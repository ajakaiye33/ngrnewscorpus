          "text": "Yoruba Nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, better known as Sunday Igboho, has asked the Federal High Court in Ibadan to compel the Attorney General of the Federation and the Department of State Services to pay him N5bn in damages over the invasion of his house in the wee hours of July 1 by DSS operatives.\n\nIgboho, who is currently in detention in Benin Republic, filed the suit on Friday through his counsel, Chief Yomi Alliyu (SAN).\n\nHe is, in the suit, contending that the invasion of his house in the Soka area of Ibadan, during which DSS operatives gunned down two of his associates and arrested 12 others, was not only malicious but also amounted to a violation of his fundamental human rights.\n\nIgboho told the court that the DSS operatives stormed his residence at about 1am on July 1 and \u201cwithout announcing who they were or asking the applicant (Igboho) to open his gate, shot their way through, killing two people, including an elderly Imam doing Tahjud (vigil), shooting at cars, thereby destroying them and not sparing animals, like cats and dogs in total violation of the intendments of the fundamental human rights provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 and the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights Act.\u201d\n\nHe said for two hours, the DSS operatives shot through the ceiling and roof of his house, thereby depriving him \u201cthe quiet enjoyment of his house for the period of the armed invasion of the said property.\u201d\n\nThe activist, through the SAN, is urging the court to declare that the AGF and the DSS, through the midnight operation, violated his right and trampled on the nation\u2019s constitution.\n\nHe wants the court to order the defendants to return his personal belongings, which they allegedly carted away during the operations.\n\nHe listed the items to include N2m cash, \u20ac1,000, travel documents belonging to him and his family members, gold jewellery and wristwatches, a I-Phone 12 mobile phone, Samsung mobile phone, and other items yet to be ascertained.\n\nFor the invasion, Igboho, through his lawyer, is urging the court to compel the AGF, the DSS and the DSS DG to also pay him N500m to cover for the damage done to his cars and house and another N5bn as \u201cexemplary and/or aggravated damages for breaching the applicant\u2019s fundamental rights in the course of the illegal and malicious invasion of his residence.\u201d\n\nHe also wants the court to compel the defendants to tender a public apology to him, to be published in two national dailies \u2013 The PUNCH and The Nation newspapers.\n\nIn addition, the embattled Yoruba Nation agitator wants the court to declare that he has \u201cunquestionable and inalienable fundamental right to peacefully campaign and seek for self-determination of Yoruba tribe in Nigeria and lobby the legislature to amend the 1999 Constitution.\u201d\n\nHe wants the court to declare that it is illegal for the DSS and the AGF to be hunting him with gun, with a view to arresting him because he is \u201cpropagating his belief in association with other like minds to create a Yoruba Nation/Oduduwa Republic for his indigenous Yoruba people.\u201d\n\nHe also wants the court to restrain the defendants and their agents from further harassing him or causing his bank accounts to be frozen.\n\nThe court has yet to fix a date for the hearing of the suit. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi\n\nThe Federal Government has asked sub-national entities in the country to hasten measures to decongest the custodial centres especially with regards to summoning the political will to do the needful on death row convicts.\n\nDisclosing that Nigeria now has 3,008 condemned criminals consisting of 2,952 males and 56 females, the federal government also urged states to build holding centres for awaiting trial suspects to decongest custodial facilities.\n\nMinister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola, gave the charge on Friday at the commissioning of the Osun State Command office complex of the Nigerian Correctional Service NCoS, Osogbo.\n\nThe minister\u2019s charge was contained in a statement by his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure issued Friday in Abuja.\n\nUrging State Governors to summon the will and do the needful on death row convicts, the minister said; \u201cThere are at present, 3, 008 condemned criminals waiting for their date with the executioners in our meagre custodial facilities. This consists of 2,952 males and 56 females. In cases where appeal has been exhausted and the convicts are not mounting any challenge to their conviction, the state should go ahead, one, to do the needful and bring closure to their cases; two, set some others free on compassionate ground, especially those who have grown old on account of the long time they have been in custody, those who are terminally ill and those who have been reformed and demonstrated exceptionally good behaviour; and three, commute others sentences to life or a specific terms in jail. This can be done by putting in place a system of amnesty and prerogative of mercy that will review all cases of convicts on death row periodically\u201d.\n\nAregbesola in his address titled \u201cUnmatched Infrastructure Development\u201d stated that \u201cthe entire national custodial facilities have a maximum capacity for 57,278 inmates, adding however that by the last count earlier in the week, there was a total population of 68,747 inmates, made up of 67,422 males and 1,325 females.\n\n\u201cWe have therefore shot above the capacity by 18 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that 50,992 inmates, representing 74 per cent of the total population of inmates in the custodial centres are awaiting trial while only 17,755 inmates which is 26 per cent are actual convicts.\n\nAccording to him, this brings to the fore the reality of the limitations in the effective management of the criminal justice administration and therefore urged state governments to work with the federal government in addressing this challenge as an overwhelming majority of inmates in custody are state offenders being tried by their respective State Governments.\n\nAregbesola also spoke on the various measures undertaken by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari aimed at decongesting custodial facilities and asked State Governments to \u201caccelerate the wheel of justice as a lot of inmates have been in custody for a period longer than the maximum sentence their alleged offences carry. This fundamentally is a miscarriage of justice\u201d.\n\n\u201cShare in the burden of decongesting custodial facilities by building modern holding centres, setting aside a sum for the maintenance of inmates, while the service will provide the personnel to man and run the facilities efficiently\u201d, he added.\n\nThe minister commended the Controller General of Corrections, Haliru Nababa as well as Officers and men of the NCoS for their service in actualizing the mandate of keeping convicts and awaiting trial suspects in safe and legal custody and reforming convicts to be better citizens.\n\nThe Minister thanked President Buhari for his generous disposition towards the Ministry of Interior and the four agencies under it while appreciating the Government and people of Osun state for freely donating the land and various assistance to the NCOS.\n\nThe Governor of the State, represented by the Secretary to the Government, Prince Oyebamiji Oluwole, commended the Federal Government and the NCoS for providing a conducive environment for the staff adding that it will encourage and boost staff morale in effective service delivery, stating the State\u2019s government\u2019s support to the NCoS.\n\nOn his part, Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye, in his goodwill message, commended Ogbeni Aregbesola for his passion for infrastructural development in the state, and urged him not to relent in his efforts.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, the Controller General of NCoS, Haliru Nababa, who expressed the service\u2019s appreciation to members of the National Assembly for their commitment to equipping the service for optimal performance, assured that the NCoS will justify the Federal Government\u2019s gesture.\n\nOther dignitaries at the event included the Ataoja of Osogbo, the representative of the Ooni of Ife, the Senator representing Osun Central, Senator Surajudeen Ajibola Bashiru, the Commissioner of Police in Osun state, leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun, market women and others.",

There are facilities in non-urban areas that are underpopulated.\n\n\u201cIt is in the urban areas that most of the crimes are committed and relevant courts are located, leading to the overstretching of the custodial facilities located in such cities.\u201d Aregbesola noted.\n\nGiving the clear status of inmates in the correctional centres across the country, Aregbsola noted that 50,992 inmates, representing 74 per cent of the total population of inmates in are awaiting trial, while only 17,755 inmates which is mere 26 per cent are actual convicts.\n\n\u201cThe challenges of safe and effective custody at the custodial centres come therefore from the awaiting trial inmates, given their numerical strength.\n\nThe Minister, However, asked for the cooperation of state governments in addressing custodial centre congestion challenge saying, the overwhelming majority of offenders are state offenders being tried by their respective State Governments.\n\n\u201cThe State Governments can therefore do three things. The first is to accelerate the wheel of justice. The second way the states can share in the burden of decongesting custodial facilities is to join in building holding centres.\n\n\u201cThe third way is for State Governors to summon the will to do the needful on death row convicts.

Here are a few things to look forward to:\n\n1. A double launch show: Season 6 is starting off with the biggest twist yet. The show will launch for the first time ever across two evenings. The first part of the premiere will air on Saturday, June 24 while the second part will air on Sunday, June 25, 2021.\n\n2. More interesting personalities: Big Brother has mastered the art of selecting the most exciting mix of people, and this year is no different. MultiChoice promises that the housemates this season will be more interesting than fans have ever seen on the show before.\n\n3. More engaging tasks: If you thought Big Brother Naija Lockdown had the most engaging and rewarding tasks, think again. Big Brother Naija season 6 will have even more incredible and financially rewarding activities for the housemates.\n\n4. A revamped BBNaija house: Biggie\u2019s House is going to look completely different from the way it did last year. Expect new decor, new spaces, and even a surprise feature that has never appeared in other seasons. And like the previous season, the house is being completely designed by local artisans.\n\n5. Two new house currencies designed to be an integral part of the season\u2019s gameplay: Biggie is retiring the old currencies used in the former seasons and will introduce two never-before-used currencies when the show premieres on Saturday.\n\n6. A brand new, exclusively packaged BBNaija show on Showmax: Showmax will broadcast an exclusive 30-minute show called The Buzz twice a week where viewers can get all the hidden action they may miss on other channels. The dedicated series will be a magazine-styled show with a host which will be released twice every week \u2013 on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\n7. No SMS voting: This year, all the voting will be done on the Big Brother Naija website and mobile site as well as on the MyDStv and MyGOtv apps.\n\n8. Fave Lock-In returns: The fan competition which was introduced last season is also making a comeback this season. The Fave Lock-In competition will give 30 BBNaija fans a chance of winning N1million each when the housemate they \u2018Lock-In\u2019 wins the sixth season of the show. Fans will be able to lock in the contestant they believe will win between July 29 and August 2, 2021.\n\nThe 10-week-long reality TV show will follow the lives of strangers as they interact and compete with each other to win the grand prize.",

          "text": "*Says country\u2019s asylum seekers grew from 27,557 to 408,078 in 10 Years\n\n*Applications for refugee status increased by 1,380%\n\n* Estimates 4,000 Nigerian children made orphans by COVID-19 World Bank: Nigeria Going through Its Worst Unemployment Crisis\n\nBy Ndubuisi Francis and Emmanuel Addeh\n\nNigeria is currently going through one of its worst unemployment crises in recent times, a new report by the World Bank has stated.\n\nThe multilateral institution also noted that the socio-economic challenges facing Nigerians in the last 10 years have led to an astronomical increase in the number of citizens seeking asylum and refugee status in other countries.\n\nThis is as the World Bank, in a separate report, has estimated that about 4,000 Nigerian children were made orphans by the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 and July 2021.\n\nThe report, which expressed concern about the country\u2019s rising unemployment situation was published by the Washington-based institution with support from the Korea World Bank Partnership Facility (KWPF) and the Rapid Social Response (RSR) trust funds.\n\nIn the report titled: \u2018Of Roads Less Travelled: Assessing the Potential for Migration to Provide Overseas Jobs for Nigeria\u2019s Youth\u2019, the World Bank further estimated that there were 2.1 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nigeria in 2020 alone.\n\nWorld Bank, however, blamed a combination of rising unemployment, booming demographics, and unfulfilled aspirations as resulting in increasing pressure on young Nigerians to migrate in search of gainful employment overseas.\n\nIn addition, the Washington-based institution disclosed that the number of international migrants from Nigeria has increased threefold since 1990, growing from 446,806 in 1990 to 1,438,331 in 2019.\n\nIt explained that despite this trend, the share of international migrants as a proportion to Nigeria\u2019s population has remained largely constant, increasingly slightly from 0.5 per cent in 1990 to 0.7 per cent in 2019.\n\nAccording to the bank, recent rise in irregular migration notwithstanding, the share of international migrants in Nigeria\u2019s population was much lower compared to the shares in Sub-Saharan Africa and globally.\n\nThe data showed that the number has risen by over 1,380 per cent in the years between 2010 and 2019, indicating that in comparison, the number of persons coming into Nigeria from outside has been relatively stagnant in the decade under consideration.\n\n\u201cAn important trend that is observed in the data is the rise in the number of refugees and asylum seekers from Nigeria. The share of refugees and asylum seekers from Nigeria has increased drastically in the last decade, growing from 27,557 in 2010 to 408,078 in 2019,\u201d it stated.\n\nIt noted that although the country was reaping dividends from the success of its citizens in the diaspora, which was put at five per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019, when it comes to the discourse on international migration, the narrative has not been palatable.\n\n\u201cNigeria is facing one of the most acute jobless crises in recent times. Between 2014 and 2020, Nigeria\u2019s working age population grew from 102 million to 122 million, growing at an average rate of approximately 3 per cent per year.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s active labour force population, that is, those willing and able to work among the working age population, grew from 73 million in 2014 to 90 million in 2018, adding 17.5 million new entrants to Nigeria\u2019s active labour force.\n\n\u201cSince 2018, however, the active labour force population has dramatically decreased to around 70 million\u2014lower than the level in 2014\u2014 while the number of Nigerians who are in the working-age population but not active in the labour force has increased from 29 million to 52 million between 2014 and 2020.\n\n\u201cThe expanding working-age population combined with scarce domestic employment opportunities is creating high rates of unemployment, particularly for Nigeria\u2019s youth,\u201d the World Bank report noted.\n\nHowever, between 2010 and 2020, the international financial institution estimated that the unemployment rate rose five-fold, from 6.4 per cent in 2010 to 33.3 per cent in 2020, with the rates being particularly acute since the 2015/2016 economic recession and further worsened as COVID-19 led to the worst recession in four decades in 2020.\n\nIncreasingly, it noted that educated Nigerians were struggling to find employment opportunities in the country while unemployment rates increased substantially for Nigerians across all education levels over the years, becoming progressively challenging for educated Nigerians to find employment opportunities.\n\n\u201cCombined with significant demographic changes and increased aspirations of the youth, Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis is creating migratory pressure in the economy.\n\n\u201cUnemployment is considered to be a key driver of migration. Consequently, multiple surveys show that the number of Nigerians, who are looking to migrate internationally is high and increasing,\u201d it pointed out.\n\nIn the last few years, the bank stated that the number of persons eager to migrate has increased from 36 per cent in 2014, to 52 per cent in 2018, noting that the desire to migrate remains higher among unemployed (38 per cent), youth (39 per cent), secondary education graduates (39 per cent), urban residents (41 per cent) and post-secondary graduates (45 per cent) in Nigeria.\n\nIt maintained that since there has not been an expansion of legal migration routes for youth increasingly eager to find opportunities in the overseas labour market, young Nigerians are opting for irregular migration routes to realise their hopes for a better life.\n\n\u201cWhat is worrying, however, is the increase in the number of forced and irregular migrants from Nigeria,\u201cit disclosed.\n\nIt stressed that to ensure mutual cooperation, the European Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF), which was established in 2015, with the aim to promote areas of mutual development interest between Europe and Africa, has since provided more than \u20ac4 billion in aid to African countries to address various development-related challenges and priorities in Africa.\n\nSince its inception, the EUTF, the bank stated, has provided more than \u20ac770 million for migration-related projects in Nigeria, with most of the funds invested in border control measures, awareness campaigns to stop trafficking, and the creation of jobs domestically, including for returned Nigerian migrants.\n\nWhile predicting that by 2100, Europe\u2019s working age population between the ages of 20 and 64 would decline by 30 per cent owing to low birth-rates and increased longevity, it further projected that at same time, the working age-population in Nigeria could increase by 140 per cent.\n\n\u201cBy expanding legal pathways for migration and implementing supporting measures to reap dividends from current migrants in the diaspora, Nigeria can further benefit from international migration.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s institutions are well-placed to promote managed migration approaches that help create opportunities for prospective Nigerian jobseekers to find employment internationally and can be supported to help design schemes that increase the returns to human capital investments for Nigerian youth,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n4,000 Nigerian Children Orphaned by COVID-19\n\nIn a related development, the multilateral institution has estimated that 4,000 Nigerian children were made orphans by the COVID-19 between March 2020 and July 2021.\n\nThe report by the bank\u2019s experts at the Imperial College of London, revealed that over 4,100 Nigerian children lost one or both primary caregivers within the aforementioned period, while 4,300 lost one or both primary and secondary caregivers.\n\nThe report posted on the bank\u2019s blog was jointly authored by World Bank\u2019s Lead Economist, Laura Rawlings and a senior technical advisor, Centre for Disease Control (CDC) COVID-19 International Task Force, Susan Hillis, and titled: \u201cFor every two COVID-19 deaths, one child loses a caregiver. We must do more to address the orphan crisis.\u201d\n\nThe report stated: \u201cThe COVID crisis will leave many unwanted legacies. The world has been closely tracking the COVID-19 death toll, with official mortality counts now reaching over four million people, largely concentrated among adults. The children left behind have been practically invisible.\n\n\u201cOur estimates of the toll on children left behind, just released, are that for every two people, who die of COVID, one child is left orphaned, facing the death of a parent or grandparent caregiver, who had been living in their home.\n\n\u201cBy the end of June 2021, because of COVID-19, our estimates show that nearly two million children under 18 years had lost a mother, father, and/or grandparent caregiver, who lived in their household.\u201d\n\nAccording to the experts, countries with primary caregiver death rates of at least one per 1,000 children include Peru (10.2 per 1,000 children), South Africa (5.1), Mexico (3.5), Brazil (2.4), Colombia (2.3), Iran (1.7), the USA (1.5), Argentina (1.1), and Russia (1.0).\n\nThey also noted that at the current rate, one child was being orphaned every 12 seconds due to a COVID-19-associated death, adding that the toll was growing.\n\nThe authors noted that the COVID-19 related deaths had a wide range of effects on the children from economic, developmental to psychological impacts, which would reverberate across generations.\n\nAccording to them, children orphaned by COVID face a constellation of risks, which often arrive with rapid and broad consequences.\n\n\u201cThe threats of poverty, malnutrition, displacement and separation from siblings or other family members, school dropout, depression, violence and child marriage can emerge suddenly from the Pandora\u2019s box of COVID-19,\u201d they said.\n\nNigeria had as of July 20, 2021, recorded about 2,128 COVID-19 deaths, suggesting that for every one death in the country, an average of two children become orphans.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo with agency report\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday disclosed that its much-anticipated digital currency will be launched on October 1.\n\nCBN Director, IT Department, Mrs. Rakiya Mohammed, revealed this during a private webinar, explaining that the banking sector regulator had been conducting research towards the launch of digital currencies since 2017.\n\nShe added that the central bank may conduct a proof of concept before the end of the year.\n\nThe move to adopt the electronic currency was first disclosed by the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, during the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in May.\n\nHe had said a digital currency will soon become a reality in the country, adding that the central bank had already set up its committee which was working on the concept.\n\nThe CBN governor had further restated the determination of the apex bank to drive the e-Naira project during the recent 306th Banker\u2019s Committee meeting, pointing out that the process was ongoing.\n\nMohammed was quoted by Nairametrics to have highlighted the benefits of the digital currency, saying it would enhance macroeconomic management, boost economic growth, facilitate cross border trade, boost financial inclusion and monetary policy effectiveness.\n\nMohammed said the digital payment instrument would further improve payment efficiency, revenue tax collection, remittance improvement, and targeted social intervention.\n\nShe added that the innovation would also benefit the fintech ecosystem by enhancing operational efficiency, opportunities for fintech start-ups in building services and products as well as financial inclusion that will contribute to economic growth, and the creation of a new system complimenting the traditional payment system.\n\nMohammed had last month said the proposed digital would be launched before December.\n\nAccording to her, every Nigerian would have access to the digital currency.\n\nShe had while briefing journalists at the end of a Bankers\u2019 Committee meeting said: \u201cLet me state categorically that cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and the rest of them are not under the control of the central bank; they are purely private decisions that individuals make and are not part of this arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over two years studying this concept of central bank\u2019s digital currency and we have identified the risks. And it is one of the reasons why I said we are setting up a central governance structure that would involve all industry stakeholders to access all the risks as we continue on this journey.\n\n\u201cVery soon we would make an announcement on the date for the launch and by the end of the year, we should have the digital currency.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, about 80 per cent of central banks across the world are presently exploring the possibility of issuing the central bank\u2019s digital currency, saying that Nigeria cannot be left behind.\n\nMohammed had added: \u201cYou are aware that we have two forms of fiat money: The notes and the coins. So, the central bank\u2019s digital currency is the third form of fiat money. So, this digital money is going to complement the cash and note that we have.\n\n\u201cThe central bank digital currency will just be as good as you having cash in your pocket. So, if you are having the currency in your pocket, you are as good as having cash on your phone.\n\n\u201cNow, why did we need to go into this? There are different cases that the central bank is looking at.\n\nFor instance, we have remittances, which is a huge market in Africa. We also know that in the last EFInA report, our target for this year was to achieve 80 per cent financial inclusion. We are about 60 per cent and at the rate we are going, it is unlikely we would meet this target. But the central bank digital currency would accelerate this target.\u201d\n\nShe said it would support the cashless policy as well as innovation, adding that the central bank has a \u201cvery clear roadmap on this and we are about to move to the next stage of a proof of consent after which we would start a pilot.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says countries with 70 per cent vaccination of their population are struggling\n\n*60 million vaccine doses to arrive Africa soon, says WHO\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nThe federal government has raised the alarm over a possible uptick in Covid-19 cases, propelled by a spread of the new Delta variant of the virus recently discovered in the country.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, who made a presentation at a virtual meeting held by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the country\u2019s preparations against the third wave of COVID19, expressed worry that Nigeria had witnessed an increase in the number of new cases of Covid-19 in the last two weeks.\n\nThe Minister\u2019s worry came just as Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said yesterday that it had confirmed 238 new cases of Covid-19 in the country.\n\nBut the Regional Director for Africa, World Health Organisation (WHO), Matshidiso Moeti, had disclosed that about 60 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccines were set to arrive Africa in the coming weeks from the United States of America, Team Europe, the United Kingdom, and other partners through the COVAX facility.\n\nHowever, speaking during a meeting with the leadership of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) at the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment in Abuja, Ehanire said: \u201cCovid-19 Delta variant is already entering Africa. It has been observed in several countries. In fact, has been identified in Nigeria and is sweeping across the globe now. It is a strong warning that we should all be careful.\n\n\u201cEven those countries where they have done vaccination are trembling how much more the ones like us that have not done much. UK has done two dose of 70 per cent of her population yet they are having one of their highest spike in Covid-19 pandemic right now, the same with the United States. Those of us that have only done two per cent are very worried about the situation\u201d.\n\nEarlier, in his presentation to the WHO, Ehanire said the world had begun to see a pandemic of two tracks, where the Delta variant was tearing through unvaccinated populations.\n\n\u201cWe witnessed the unfortunate surge in cases in India a few months ago and a similar surge is now being seen in most African countries. In Nigeria, the Delta variant was first detected two weeks ago, and we have begun to see an increase in the number of new cases,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the challenges faced by the country in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, Ehanire said Nigeria has had to contend with relatively weak health systems and the inequities in distribution of Covid-19 response tools, ranging from Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) and reagents at onset, to vaccines at present.\n\nHe said Nigeria received just over 4 million AZ doses to start with, from the COVAX facility and government of India and started deployment early, according to WHO recommendations for Health workers and vulnerable populations, vaccines received EUA from NAFDAC.\n\nAccording to the Minister, the vaccine deployment lead agency, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), had relied on its vast experience on routine immunisation, having recently concluded Polio eradication campaign.\n\nHe explained that the agency used ICT tools for a smooth roll-out, adding that infrastructure, especially, cold chain, and precise distribution plan were ready well before the vaccines arrived.\n\n\u201cWe have expended all vaccines, with 126% of target population of just over 2 million people receiving first dose and 70% receiving second doses. Less than 2% of target 112 million population has been reached, to reach herd immunity of 70%. Efficient data management and monitoring was performed for AEFI,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the expected vaccines, Moeti reiterated that only 20 million Africans, or 1.5 per cent of the continent\u2019s population, had been fully vaccinated so far and that 1.7 per cent of the 3.7 billion doses given globally had been administered in Africa\n\nHe made stated this on Thursday during an online press briefing on COVID-19 in Africa on Thursday, where she said no one should be under any illusion that Africa\u2019s third wave was over.\n\n\u201cThis small step forward offers hope and inspiration but must not mask the big picture for Africa. Many countries are still at peak risk and Africa\u2019s third wave surged up faster and higher than ever before.\n\nShe said that the new COVID-19 case numbers in Africa fell by 1.7 per cent to nearly 282,000 in the week ending July 18.\n\nAccording to her, the continent experienced an unbroken nine-week surge, excluding data from South Africa, which accounted for 37 per cent of these cases, adding that the current peak was 80 per cent higher than Africa\u2019s previous peak, excluding data from South Africa.\n\nShe explained that without the data from South Africa, cases rose in Africa by 18 per cent to over 182 000 in the week ending on July 18.\n\n\u201cThe Sallah celebrations, which we marked this week may also result in a rise in cases. We must all double down on prevention measures to build on these fragile gains,\u201d she said.\n\nMeoti stated further that 21 African countries had seen cases rise by over 20 per cent for at least two weeks running, adding that the highly transmissible Delta variant had been found in 26 African countries.\n\nAccording to her, the Alpha variant was in 38 countries and Beta was in 35, and that South Africa\u2019s gains remained uncertain as protests had disrupted the country\u2019s response, including disease surveillance and testing.\n\nShe explained that mass gatherings in the country could also trigger another rise in cases.\n\n\u201cA massive influx of doses means that Africa must go all out and speed up the vaccine rollout by five to six times if we are to get all these doses into arms and fully vaccinate the most vulnerable 10 per cent of all Africans by the end of September.\n\n\u201cNearly 70 per cent of African countries will not reach the 10 per cent vaccination target for all countries by the end of September at the current pace.\n\n\u201cAround 3.5 million to four million doses are administered weekly on the continent, but to meet the September target this must rise to 21 million doses at the very least each week,\u201d she said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN regulations holding back mobile money revolution in Nigeria",
          "text": "In Ghana, it would be an \u201canomaly\u201d for a supermarket, small store, or business merchant to not use a mobile money service for transactions. Daniel, a colleague at TechCabal, who visited Ghana two weeks ago said the same during a recent meeting.\n\nMobile money was first introduced in Ghana in 2009. However, it took some time for it to gain traction due to a restrictive Branchless Banking policy of the Bank of Ghana.\n\nNew agent and electronic money guidelines were released in 2014, allowing network operators to run mobile money services, with supervision from the banking regulator.\n\nEver since, players such as MTN have invested heavily in mobile money operations with great success. The telco giant launched its MoMo service in January 2017. By January 2019, over 100,000 merchants were using the service.\n\nUptake in mobile money services and financial inclusion have equally increased across the country. A March 2020 Summary of Economic and Financial Data published by the Bank of Ghana showed that the country had 14.7 million active mobile money accounts and 235,000 active agents.\n\nOn the other end of the cardinal point is M-Pesa\u2019s success in East African countries, particularly Kenya. The mobile money service, owned and operated by telco Safaricom, has significantly contributed to improving the financial inclusion rate in Nairobi.\n\nIn Ethiopia, the government is banking on a mobile money service run by the state-owned network operator, Ethio Telecom, to increase financial inclusion among low-income groups. The service soared to more than 1 million registered users in one week, 4 million in a month, and 6 million in two months.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers when it comes to penetration.\n\nChasing financial inclusion\n\nFinancial inclusion for 200 million Nigerians has been a much-touted priority of Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration and the central bank under governor Godwin Emefiele\u2019s leadership. Still, it\u2019s a goal that has been elusive.\n\nNigeria has a significantly large population without access to financial services. In 2017, it was home to 3.4% of the world\u2019s unbanked people despite contributing 2.6% to the global population.\n\nSome progress has been made over the past decade to bring more Nigerians under the formal financial system, according to a report by EFinA, but the figures remain disturbing.\n\nAt the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked as the central bank missed out on its 80% national financial inclusion target. In addition, just over 40 million out of an estimated 105.5 million Nigerian adults have bank verification numbers (BVN), an important metric for gauging how many people have access to financial services.\n\nThe CBN has adopted several measures \u2013 such as the creation of special Payment Services Banks (PSBs) in 2018 \u2013 to drive financial inclusion.\n\nHowever, the apex bank has shown reluctance towards adopting a framework that has proved to be very effective in improving financial inclusion in many African countries: telecoms-driven mobile money services.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPayment service banks, not mobile money operators\n\nIn 2018, CBN announced a new regime that would allow non-financial companies to apply for mobile banking licences \u2013 either as PSBs or Mobile Money Operators (MMOs).\n\nUnder the guidelines, mobile network operators are allowed to provide financial services to millions of unbanked Nigerians. However, they can do so only as payment service banks and through a subsidiary separate from their core operations.\n\nPayment service banks are like small-scale banks. While they\u2019re similar to typical banks, the scope of their license is strictly to deepen financial inclusion and the regulator forbids them from engaging in credit risk and foreign exchange operations.\n\nMore than two years after the CBN\u2019s announcement, just three companies (including mobile operators 9mobile and Globacom) have been granted PSB licences. The two other network companies in the country, MTN and Airtel, are yet to get a regulatory nod to launch their Payment Service Banks. Although the former launched an agent network for money transfers in 2019.\n\nThe lack of progress on licences \u2013 particularly for two telcos that have significant mobile money experience in other markets in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 calls into question how dedicated the central bank is to really broaden access to financial services in the country.\n\nSome industry stakeholders blame the issue on lobbying by traditional financial institutions said to be wary of telco-led mobile money services. Banks perceive that network operators would claim their territory if allowed to offer standalone financial services.\n\nAccording to one telecom industry expert who asked not to be named, the \u201cbig banks are fighting back behind the scenes to ensure telcos don\u2019t come to have their lunch.\u201d\n\nWill telcos ever lead?\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile money landscape is dominated by banks, technology, and financial services companies. Contrary to what is seen in Kenya and Ghana, telecoms operators are not allowed to apply directly for mobile money licences and are instead restricted to the provision of network infrastructure for the use of mobile money operators.\n\nThe regulatory framework is one of the core reasons why mobile money uptake has been relatively slow in Nigeria. As of 2019, there were just over 15 million mobile money accounts in the country, compared to nearly 60 million in Kenya, which is home to fewer than 55 million people.\n\nFintech companies have recorded significant strides towards advancing financial inclusion in Nigeria. Companies such as Paga and Teamapt democratise access to financial services through their agent networks and mobile payments infrastructure.\n\nBut telecoms companies are more positioned to deepen mobile money services due to their subscriber numbers, available infrastructure, and broader agent networks, which outnumber those of banks and fintechs. MTN and Airtel agents can be seen selling recharge cards in nearly every corner of the country.\n\n\u201cThe telecoms industry has ready infrastructure and resources to push financial inclusion all over the country. If you truly want to deepen the use of mobile technology for financial service, the last mile to reach the people is through network operators,\u201d the expert said.\n\nThere have been calls for a more liberalised regulatory framework where telcos lead. However, if the CBN\u2019s latest mobile money regulatory framework published July 9 is anything to go by, network operators will continue to play the second fiddle in Nigeria\u2019s mobile money space under the current administration.\n\nIn the new framework, the banking regulator reiterates its long-held stance that Nigeria will not adopt the model in which telecommunications companies are the drivers of mobile money services.\n\n\u201cThe CBN recognises the importance of Mobile Network Operators in the operations of mobile money services and appreciates the criticality of the infrastructure they provide. However, the telco-led model (where the lead initiator is an MNO) shall not be operational in Nigeria,\u201d the 40-page document reads.\n\nThe framework stated only two acceptable models for the implementation of mobile money services: bank-led (bank and/or its consortium as lead initiator) and non-bank-led (a corporate organisation duly licensed by the CBN as lead initiator).\n\nAlthough the CBN says it recognises the importance of telecoms companies in providing the infrastructure to drive the exchange of messages for mobile payments, it feels compelled to prohibit the Telco-led option. This, according to the bank, is to \u201cretain full control of monetary policy operations, minimise risks and ensure that the offering of financial services is driven by organisations that have been licensed to do so.\u201d\n\nAfter failing to meet its 2020 target, the CBN has revised its financial inclusion goal to 95% by 2024. But with its continued regulatory conservatism towards telecoms-led mobile money, the regulator is likely to find it only more difficult to bring millions of unbanked Nigerians into the financial system.\n\n\u201cCBN\u2019s models will only slow down financial inclusion penetration,\u201d the expert said. \u201cInstead, telecoms companies should be allowed to take the lead in the mobile money space as seen in other African countries. This is the only way speedy coverage and easy access can be achieved and financial inclusion improved.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

Bob Nzelu, the brain behind it, described it to me as a way to share and receive items of digital value \u2013 money, crypto, airtime, e-tickets \u2013 over social media.\n\n\u201cLike sending money through email addresses using PayPal, Vendly hopes to replicate that using social media handles,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that is just the basic use case he anticipates, cutting in to assuage my skepticism that money transfer on social media is a compelling enough value to build a (potentially venture-backed) company on. Long-term, Vendly will help social media users monetize their social media presence, the CEO said.\n\nBack to social money vending. Nzelu believes Vendly is similar to Cash App and Venmo because it seeks to simplify transfers between people who don\u2019t know each other. \u201cVendly is not built for chummy friends who have each other\u2019s account details.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor this type of relationship, creating a \u2018vend\u2019 with a social media handle and sharing the link with a beneficiary walks a fine line of not being too personal or invasive while caring.\n\nIt\u2019s the online equivalent of a co-worker dropping a birthday cake with a card at your desk but not inside your drawer.\n\nSomeone who receives a vend can decide to either make a claim for or ignore it by clicking the link in their DM. The message states the amount sent; recipient inputs the bank account where they want the cash to go. And like cakes, the link expires after some time (Nzelu sent me a vend of about $1 as a demo).\n\nVendly stores the recipient\u2019s bank details to make future transfers seamless but the sender never sees the account information. Because a sender can create one vend to go to multiple social media handles, Nzelu thinks it should appeal to brands or influencers who target giveaways at 3 million Nigerian social media users who have a bank account and phone number.\n\nVendly is part of a crop of social gifting apps seeking to delight people online.\n\nA few months ago, after my managing editor promised to get me a book, I got a Tweet from Showlove, a Lagos-based company, with a voucher to claim my books at a particular bookstore (thanks again, KK). Getcards, a product of the cryptocurrency startup Buycoins, was floated last December for people who want to gift services like a Netflix subscription, an Amazon or Delta airlines ticket to friends and family.\n\nLike these two services, Vendly hopes that its first platform for traction will be Twitter, because the platform is the most friendly for services that require people to click links to claim rewards.\n\nBut Nzelu knows that can\u2019t be the long-term plan. After all, Twitter is officially banned in Nigeria at the moment, an event that currently hampers Vendly\u2019s ability to be fully functional. An alternative is to send vends using phone numbers, although that option might raise privacy concerns. Integrating other platforms \u2013 Instagram, Facebook \u2013 is on their roadmap.\n\nRight now, Vendly is a prototype undergoing iteration. It may yet face hard questions about monetization, like Abeg\u2019s mobile app which launched last year to enable peer-to-peer money transfers using social handles. But Nzelu says Vendly will answer most user concerns at launch in a few weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s been working at it for two years now and feels the time is right to tap into the social and creator economy bump that started last year. Being Nigerian, his home country is the market of choice. But if it proves tough for a start, Vendly will seek initial users in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disclosed that it\u2019ll launch the pilot scheme of its digital currency on October 1, 2021.\n\nAccording to TheCable, CBN revealed this during a private webinar with stakeholders on Thursday, July 22, 2021.\n\nThe apex bank announced earlier on June 10, 2021, that it would launch a pilot scheme for its digital currency before the end of the year.\n\nRakiya Mohammed, CBN Director of Information Technology, said, \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to the populace,\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Director also revealed that the project tagged GIANT will run on the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain.\n\nHyperledger Fabric blockchain\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is a private and permissioned blockchain network designed by computer hardware company, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). The network is an open-source platform by the Linus foundation, which means several developers contributed to its code.\n\nThe blockchain network is built specifically for enterprise-grade applications. It is recommended for businesses or private entities hoping to keep transactions exclusive.\n\nSince it\u2019s a private network, the CBN decides who can enter the platform. The regulator can approve or override a transaction if it deems fit, unlike bitcoin, where transactions are approved upon the agreement of majority nodes.\n\nThe Hyperledger Fabric has been criticised as not even being a blockchain network with less expensive solutions offering the same level of security.\n\nIn a Cointelegraph article on July 2, 2019, Stuart Popejoy, blockchain expert and founder of hybrid blockchain platform, Kedena, said that \u201cFabric\u2019s architecture is far more complex than any blockchain platform while also being less secure against tampering and attacks. You would think that a \u201cprivate\u201d blockchain would at least offer scalability and performance, but Fabric fails here as well. Simply put, pilots built on Fabric will face a complex and insecure deployment that won\u2019t be able to scale with their businesses.\u201d\n\nIn comparison, he says, blockchain is a decentralised and immutable platform where truth is enforced with a consensus mechanism. On a network like Bitcoin or Ethereum, a consensus is achieved through mining or Proof of Work (PoW).\n\nHowever, IBM says the network is permissioned, meaning only authorised and known participants can access it. In addition, it has a hardware security module support, vital for safeguarding and managing sensitive data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, CBN says Nigeria cannot be left behind when 80% of central banks globally are considering issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nPer Coin Insider, China pioneered the CBDC movement while other countries like Sweden, Japan, and The Bahamas are testing their digital currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website Writer and tech enthusiast\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nTwitter\u2019s shiny new downvote button\n\nConvergence\u2019 Partners\u2019 $120m round\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\nTwitter is testing out a downvote button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on Unsplash\n\nWhat happened? Micro-blogging platform, Twitter is testing a way to upvote or downvote replies as part of efforts to understand what users find relevant in a conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this work? Twitter says while the downvote button will be visible, only the reply owner can know the exact number received.\n\nFor now, it is a test for a research the company is conducting to see if the up and down voting match what it suggests as relevant replies. It is currently available to a few iOS users.\n\nHave we seen something similar? Platforms like Reddit and YouTube have a downvote and dislike button, respectively.\n\nHowever, according to Twitter, this is not a dislike button and while it bears some resemblance to Reddit\u2019s downvote button, it will not affect the order of replies. This means they will not be ranked according to the highest numbe of downvotes.\n\nWait a minute, how will this improve interaction on Twitter? Will it reduce toxic tweets? Won\u2019t this encourage trolls especially since only the recipient can see it?\n\nWell, I found Ashton Kutcher, actor and tech investor\u2019s comments on a \u201cdislike button\u201d quite interesting.\n\nPer CNET, Kutcher believes a dislike button will head off more volatile expressions of disagreement on social media platforms, giving people a simple, frictionless way to give negative feedback.\n\nI\u2019m somewhat inclined to agree but I still have some reservations. I also wonder if there might be an option to turn this feature off if you don\u2019t want it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, in May 2021, Jane Wachung Wong, an app researcher, revealed that Twitter was working on adding Facebook-like reactions \u2014 \ud83d\ude02, \ud83e\udd14, \ud83d\ude13 \u2014 to the platform.\n\nWhat is Twitter going to spring on us next? Any ideas? Let me know what you think in the comments section below.\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Tanzania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTanzanian shilling notes\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the necessary requirements.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means Cellulant is now one of the PSSPs supported by the Bank of Tanzania to offer digital payments solutions across the country.\n\nDo you know? Cellulant was founded in 2002 as a music streaming platform that enabled musicians to get a percentage of the money paid by fans to download their songs.\n\nThen over the years, the music streaming platform rebranded as a fintech company, offering digital payments and managing an ecosystem of retailers, merchants, banks, mobile network operators, governments, and international development partners.\n\nWith a physical presence in 18 African countries, the company boasts of offering more than 154 payment choices in 34 countries, and connecting 220 million users to a single inclusive network, enabling interoperability that has evaded multiple companies in the payments market.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant launched Trigg, a digital payments network, in Zambia, that enables companies around the country to seamlessly take payments from their customers.\n\nTrigg is said to help businesses wishing to digitise their payments to collect and make payments across many payment methods and currencies with the greatest customer experience.\n\nEdwin Kiiru, Tanzania\u2019s Cellulant Country Manager, says the approval by the BOT will enable the company to extend its payment solutions across all spectrums of Tanzania\u2019s payments ecosystem.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will allow it connect to banks, online merchants, payment processors, merchants, state governments, and customers to meet their digital payment demands in Tanzania.\n\nConvergence Partners raises $120 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African tech investment firm, Convergence Partners, has raised $120 million to drive inclusion in Africa.\n\nWho participated in the round? CDC Group the UK\u2019s development finance institution, the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Proparco \u2014 private sector arm of the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD Group) \u2014 participated in the round.\n\nWhat about Convergence Partners? Founded by Andile Ngcaba, CEO, in 2006, the investment firm is focused on the Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) sector in Africa.\n\nAccording to the official website, the firm has invested in submarine cable systems, geostationary satellites, terrestrial long-haul, metro and access fibre, wireless networks, data centres, and service provision like enterprise connectivity, fintech and healthtech solutions, and data switching since its launch.\n\nIn February 2021, it acquired Ctrack, a telematics Software-as-a-Service (Saas) digital infrastructure platform that offers fleet management, insurance and weather telematic solutions and asset tracking solutions to its subscribers in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe new funding will be utilised to further digital infrastructure\u2019s emerging growth areas, particularly fibre, wireless, data centres, 5G, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), network virtualisation, and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlso, the funding when invested is aimed at boosting entrepreneurship, innovation, skills development, and creating jobs while increasing access to the Internet and all the critical digital tools it provides.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nTwitter may be adding voice effects to Spaces.

Open to Kenyans, Nigerians, and Ghanaians, applications began on July 19 and will close on August 2, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaming has evolved from a simple way to pass the time to one of the most profitable industries in the world.\n\nFor context: In September 2013, on launch day, Grand Theft Auto V made $800 million. According to Fast Company, this is more sales in 24 hours than any movie or musical album in history.\n\nMobile gaming: Per Business Wire, the mobile gaming market was worth $98 billion globally in 2020 and is expected to grow to $272 billion by 2030.\n\nInterestingly, people play more games on mobile than personal computers (PC) and consoles. According to Kevuru games, 59.9% of games were played on mobile in 2020, while 28.70% and 16.11% were played on PC and console, respectively.\n\nWhile nothing beats gaming on a 60\u201d, 4K display TV\u2014 at least for me \u2014 smartphones are mobile, hence their lead.\n\nTo know more about the GameUpAfrica Bootcamp, check out this article\n\nNew features on Instagram and YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram is giving users more control over the kind of content they consume on the app.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, the company announced in a blog post that it was launching Sensitive Content Control. The feature will help users control the content they want to see on the content discovery page, Explore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, Instagram is giving you the option to decide which kind of content you want to see while you scroll through the \u2018Explore\u2019 page. Not a puppy person? No more doggy pictures jumping out of your timeline.\n\nAccording to Instagram, sensitive content isn\u2019t content that breaks the rules but could upset some users.\n\nMore control: Back in May 2021, Facebook and Instagram allowed users to remove the Like count on their posts to give them more power over their experience on the apps.\n\nWhile Instagram is giving more power, YouTube wants to help creators make more money.\n\nOn July 20, 2021, YouTube announced it is rolling out a beta version of its new feature, Super Thanks.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? Well, YouTube says in its blog post that it\u2019s a way for fans to show appreciation to their favourite creators on the platform.\n\nHow does it work? While you\u2019re watching a video \u2014 live or not \u2014 you can purchase a Super Thanks that ranges between $2 to $50 to show your appreciation.\n\nYou can make payments through Google Pay, the same way you pay for apps on the Play Store.\n\nStill in beta: According to YouTube, \u201cSuper Thanks is currently in beta and with today\u2019s expansion, is now available to thousands of monetising creators. The feature is available to creators and viewers in 68 countries on desktop and mobile devices.\u201d\n\nClubhouse no longer requires an invite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dmitry Mashkin on Unsplash\n\nOn Wednesday, July 21, 2021, live-audio chat platform Clubhouse announced in a blog post that it is no longer in beta testing and the app is no longer invite-only.\n\nFor the past 16 months, Clubhouse was exclusive to invites only. Before now, you needed someone already invited to the platform with your phone number to send you an invite. Business Insider says some people even started a business out of selling invites\n\nWhile this exclusivity made it even more appealing, it was a way to control the rise in the number of app users.\n\nIn its blog, Clubhouse said the invite system was essential to its history. By adding people in waves, it has been able to \u201cgrow Clubhouse in a measured way, and (mostly \ud83d\ude2c ) keep things from breaking\u201d\n\nBreaking the barriers: The invite system wasn\u2019t the only thing that made Clubhouse exclusive. Until May 2021, it was only available to iPhone users.\n\nAs competition mounts from Twitter and Facebook, the app seems to be shedding its exclusivity to accommodate more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nDON\u2019T buy a new PC for Windows 11!

          "text": "The federal government has said the decision to ban microblogging platform Twitter was because it was being used by Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and to promote EndSARS protests on October 1.\n\nAbubakar Malami, Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) said this in response to a motion filed by Inihebe Effiong, a human rights lawyer. In the counter-affidavit filed by the AGF, the government said it at no time restrained Nigerians from using Twitter.\n\nThe motion filed at the Federal High Court had contended that the Twitter ban was a fundamental human rights bridge breach. Effiong asked the court to grant nine reliefs including an order of perpetual injunction restraining the respondents from further suspending, deactivating, or banning the operation and accessibility of Twitter or any other social media service in Nigeria because the act was in violation of his rights.\n\nRead also: How Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban will stifle digital ecosystem\n\nThe lawyer is also asking the court to declare as illegal the threat of criminal prosecution by Malami and Lai Mohammed against Nigerians who \u2018violate\u2019 the suspension or ban of Twitter, despite the absence of any written law.\n\nBut the AGF countered, saying Nigerians were still using Twitter despite the suspension.\n\nIt would be recalled that the government slammed Twitter with a ban after deleting a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari it deemed inciting. But following the public backlash, the government said its decision was not because the platform deleted the President\u2019s tweet. However, it needed to act because Twitter was being used by some people to destabilise the unity of the country.\n\nBut the explanation only came after the Federal Government through the office of Malami had threatened to prosecute every Nigerian using VPN to circumvent the ban on Twitter.\n\nThe threat to prosecute was challenged at the Economic Community of West African States court. In its judgment, the court ruled that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government can\u2019t impose sanctions or do \u201canything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute\u201d Twitter users, according to the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project. The non-governmental organization has filed a suit against the suspension of Twitter and the criminalization of its users in Nigeria, and a hearing is scheduled for July 6.\n\nThe government told the court that the Twitter suspension would be lifted once the platform registers with the NBC and the Corporate Affairs Commission.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Critical Letter to Buhari divides NIDO Americas as members battle",
          "text": "Key members of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation Americas (NIDOA) have dissociated the group from the letter some diaspora Nigerians in America sent to President Muhammadu Buhari last month.\n\nDated June 6, 2021, the letter, signed by Eromonsele Idahosa, Yinka Tella, Moses Timta and three others, called the President\u2019s attention to \u201cseparatist agitations in various parts of the country where tensions have boiled over partly because of persistent calls for reconfiguration of our nation\u201d.\n\nThe 23-paragraph letter delved into issues of national security and restructuring, citing the prevailing perception that \u201cterrorists of Fulani stock are being treated with kid-gloves while suspected Indigenous Peoples of Biafra and Eastern Security Network members are being eliminated extra-judicially\u201d in aerial and ground bombardment of some South-Eastern Nigerian communities by security forces.\n\nThe letter also touched on the \u201cneed for Nigeria to adopt a real Federal constitution before the 2023 elections with the 1963 Constitution and the report of the 2014 Constitutional Conference as basis\u201d.\n\nBut in a telephone call to PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 America office in Washington DC, Obed Monago of NIDO USA Ohio chapter and Michael Essien of NIDO USA Minnesota chapter, who are also chairperson and legal adviser of NIDO Americas BoT respectively, dismissed the letter\u2019s authors as \u201cimpersonators\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey are impersonators, they are impersonating me and that is totally unacceptable\u201d, Mr Monago said. He based his claim on the authors\u2019 use of the name \u2018NIDO Americas\u2019, maintaining that the name is only applied to the continental not country-based governing body of the organization.\n\nThe introductory paragraph of the letter identified the authors as \u2018Nigerians in Diaspora Organization, Americas (NIDOA), USA\u2019.\n\nNIDO Americas is one of five continental zones that make up NIDO Worldwide, the others are NIDO Europe, NIDO Asia, NIDO Oceania and NIDO Africa. Each continental zone comprises country-based chapters governed by a board of directors (BoD).\n\nThus, NIDO Americas is the continental home of NIDO Americas USA, NIDO Americas Canada, NIDO Americas Belize, etc. In written communications, NIDO Americas is often shortened to NIDOA followed by the country chapter\u2019s name (for example, NIDOA, USA) just as NIDO Europe is similarly contracted to NIDOE before the country chapter (for example, NIDOE Italy).\n\nMr Monago says as much in the phone call. He explained that \u201cNIDO Americas constitute Brazil, United States of America, Canada, Belize and other countries in both continents of the Americas. That is what NIDO Americas is and I am the chairman Board of Trustees of NIDO Americas\u201d.\n\nHe however insists that any communication referencing NIDO Americas is construed to be a reference to NIDO Americas BoT, \u201cmore so when they are communicating with the presidency,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you read what Premium Times wrote, they said NIDOA, NIDOA means NIDO Americas. They are impersonating me\u201d.\n\nMr Monago explained that \u201cunder NIDO bylaw, only the BoT can communicate with Nigerian officials outside of the United States\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe bylaw says the group in Canada can do everything within Canada, the ones in Brazil can do everything within Brazil. When it comes to engaging Nigerian officials, so that NIDO Inc. is coordinated, it is done through NIDO Americas,\u201d he said, emphasizing that in the NIDO context, Americas refers to the two continents of North America and South America.\n\n\u201cRemember I\u2019m putting s, which means the two continents,\u201d he said, emphasising that the BoT is the only body that can speak on behalf of the collective NIDO members in North America and South America.\n\nMessrs Monago and Essien also claim that the letter\u2019s authors infringed on trademarks registered by the BoT for NIDO Americas.\n\n\u201cWe have four legitimate federal government of the US-approved and recognized trademarks\u201d, Mr Essien said adding that \u201csomebody else should not say anything under that name that may be imputed back to us\u201d.\n\nThe trademark are four logos registered by the United States Trademark and Patent office in 2015.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere are several instances that we have told any and everybody that is tempted to use our name for their own personal interest that they cannot, and this is one of those times\u201d, Essien said adding \u201cyou can report rightly that the legal adviser and the chairman of the Board of Trustees have reached out to you to say that these guys are impersonators\u201d, he concluded.\n\nIn another phone conversation with our Washington office,Moses Timta, one of the signatories to the diaspora letter, dismissed Messrs Monago and Essien\u2019s claim of impersonation.\n\n\u201cIf they have any complaint they should take us to court,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Timta who, like Mr Monago, is a member of the Ohio NIDO district said all six signatories to the letter are executives of NIDO Americas USA Board of Directors (BoD). Mr Timta serves as the Secretary-General of the Board.\n\nHe traces the disagreement over the letter to what he describes as NIDO Americas Board of Trustees\u2019 interference in the day-to-day affairs of NIDO Americas USA.\n\n\u201cNIDO Americas, of which Monago claims to be the Board of Trustee chair, is supposed to oversee USA, Brazil, Canada and other North American countries, all together, in an advisory capacity,\u201d Mr Timta explained, adding that \u201ceach member country is supposed to have its own independent national board.\u201d\n\nMr Timta said notwithstanding the clear provision of NIDO Americas bylaw on member countries\u2019 BoD, the Board of Trustees (BoT) is hindering USA members from having and operating their own independent Board because most of the BoT members reside in the United States.\n\nHe gave an example of NIDO Americas USA\u2019s effort to register for the 501(c)3 status which is a legal requirement for nonprofit organisations in the USA.\n\n\u201cTo register for 501(c)3 status which organizations need in order to have a board, to hold elections and incorporate in our country of residence and, to function like other NIDO America countries, these BoT members insisted that we cannot do that because they, the Board of Trustees, which serves other countries as well, have already applied for a 501(c)3 in the United States,\u201d Mr Timta explained.\n\n\u201cThis is an illegality since the BoT is supposed to function in an advisory not executive role,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the subject of the letter to President Buhari, Mr Timta said NIDO Americas USA BoD does not need anybody\u2019s permission to write to the President \u201cso long as we all hold the green passport.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of calls from our members here in the US and from relatives when we go home,\u201d he explained, \u201cwe were told that some ethnic nationalities in Nigeria were trying to approach the US government to sanction the Buhari administration for human rights violation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of our members accused us of indifference, of keeping quiet because we are on the side of the government,\u201d Mr Timta said. \u201cWe learnt that they were planning a demonstration in Washington DC on the commemoration of June 12 Democracy day.\n\n\u201cWe sent that letter in response to the call from our members. And you can see that we did extensive research because issues mentioned in the letter reach back to the Abacha era and the Third Republic.\n\n\u201cIf anything we stated there is not correct or not right, then we can be held accountable for fallacy. But as to why we did that, we are all Nigerians, we did that as representatives of our community here in the US.\u201d",

Consequently, her German passport was returned to her.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers handling the case reported after the proceedings that Chief Sunday Adeyemo lgboho cannot be extradited to Nigeria for two principal reasons:\n\n\u201cThat contrary to insinuations, Nigeria and Benin have no Extradition Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat Nigeria has not been able to come up with charges that could lead the court to order lgboho\u2019s extradition to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigerian Government came up with were mere allegations against Ighoho such as trafficking in arms and inciting violence that could result in the social disturbance without evidence which the Government of Benin Republic considered spurious and untenable, and insufficient to warrant extradition.\n\n\u201cLastly, the case has been adjourned till Monday, 26th July to allow the Nigerian Government bring up whatever evidence they may have, and Mr. lgboho has been taken back to the police custody.\u201d\n\nThe Beninese court had on Thursday ruled that Igboho\u2019s wife, Ropo, should be released unconditionally as there were no charges against her.\n\nThe court, however, ruled that Igboho be remanded in police custody till the next date of adjournment.\n\nThe two were arrested at the Cadj\u00e8houn Airport in Cotonou on Monday while they tried to catch a flight to Germany.\n\nThis comes as the Department of State Services declared Igboho wanted for allegedly stockpiling arms, an allegation he has denied.\n\nOn July 1, the secret police raided his house, killed two of his associates and arrested over 10 others.",

          "text": "The division among Senators from Bayelsa State over the three per cent equity stake provided for host communities in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), thickened on Friday with the Senator representing Bayelsa East, Biobarakuma Wangagha Degi-Eremienyo, warning former Governor Henry Seriake Dickson to stop instigating violence in the Niger Delta.\n\nAccording to him, if Senator Dickson was not cautioned, his comments could lead to civil unrest in the Niger Delta region.\n\nHe was reacting to a press conference by Dickson on Thursday where he accused the Minister of State (Petroleum Resources), Chief Timipre Sylva, of allegedly changing the development funds percentage in the PIB for host communities from 5 per cent to 3 per cent, which he said it was a collective decision by the National Assembly.\n\nDegi-Eremienyo accused Dickson of contributing nothing to the realisation of the PIB and development of host communities as a governor, saying he was only interested in derivation funds for his villages.\n\nHe said the comments by Dickson smacked of envy, mischief and intimidatation by the astronomical rising profile of Sylva.\n\nDegi-Eremienyo in a statement on Friday titled: \u201cPIB and 3 per cent for host communities: Stop instigating violence in Niger Delta, Degi cautions Dickson,\u201d said such comments by Dickson were \u201chighly regrettable considering the tireless efforts put in by the Minister in actualising this long awaited law.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe true story was that the PIB as an Executive Bill was represented to the National Assembly proposing 2.5 per cent of the total operational cost as host communities development trust funds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe lead debate was hot and protracted in both chambers. Lawmakers from the Niger Delta region including myself spoke, argued for upward increase commensurate to our contributions and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cDuring the public hearing at various centres, host communities canvassed same postion. After rigorous and painstaking process from plenary to conference committee, the National Assembly put the host comm funds at three per cent.\n\n\u201cThis was the decision of the National Assembly and not that of the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva.\n\n\u201cOne wonders how and why Dickson would drag Sylva into this. Observers would be tempted to ask what efforts Dickson made to achieve the utmost desired as the Bill was presented to the National Assembly when he was still Governor.\n\n\u201cOther Governors from the Niger Delta region rallied round their people and even lobbied lawmakers from other regions to support increase in the host communities development funds.\n\n\u201cEx-Governor Dickson did nothing as he was contented with spending 13 per cent derivation on aggressive development of his own villages which are not host communities, leaving the oil and gas producing, host communities to suffer their fate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to see him fighting pretentiously for host communities. Dickson lacks moral grounds to criticize or attack Sylva\u2019s innocence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI can see that Dickson is just been envious, mischievous and intimidated by the astronomically rising profile of Sylva.\u201d",

Cavani, who joined United on a free transfer last year after leaving Paris St-Germain, netted 17.\n\nIn four seasons at Dortmund, Sancho notched 57 assists and created 65 big chances, more than Rashford, Martial, Greenwood and Cavani during the same period.\n\nSancho also stacks up well when compared to some of the biggest names in Europe.\n\nSince the start of the 2018-19 season, only seven players have more combined goals and assists than the England international.

          "text": "\u2026 We\u2019ve achieved what we set for ourselves \u2013 Lawan \u2018\u2026You lack powers to legislate on e-transmission of results\u2019 \u2026Approval for election rigging \u2013 PDP \u2026It\u2019s coup against the people \u2013 IPAC \u2026For political elite\u2019s interest \u2013 Ojo\n\nElectoral laws remain extremely important in a democracy; it is the compass that guides the electioneering process. As the National Assembly makes some amendments, ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU writes on the concerns raised by the citizens ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nOver the years Nigerian elections have been characterised by ballot-snatching, vote-buying, changing of results, violence, under-age voting, bloodshed and other forms of unlawful acts that in most cases discredit the outcomes.\n\nThe immediate past chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Attahiru Jega, while commenting on the nation\u2019s electoral laws, said, \u201cAll over Africa to some extent, throughout the developing world, the electoral process is failing to entrench good governance and stable and sustainable democratic political systems as a result of what can be termed as a deficit of electoral integrity.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Abubakar Bukola Saraki-led the 8th Senate made some amendments to the electoral system three times, but President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018 withheld his signature on the grounds that it was too close to the 2019 general elections.\n\nAnd determined to make some changes, the 9th Assembly re-introduced it and the chairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, Kabiru Gaya, and his counterpart in the House, Aishatu Dukku, and their colleagues swiftly set to work on the legislation to address the challenges and accommodate new ideas and innovations through the Electoral Amendment Act.\n\nNotably, the much-anticipated bill seeks to repeal and re-enact the 2010 Electoral Act as well as resolve issues concerning INEC\u2019s introduction of modern technologies into the electoral process, particularly accreditation of voters, electronic voting and electronic transmission of results from polling units.\n\nExpectedly, the section which accommodated the electronic voting and transmission of results generated a lot of rancour between senators and representatives.\n\nThe contentious sections, the drama\n\nThe electoral amendment report in the Senate contained 154 sections and out of this, the provision of Section 52 (3) of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill 2021 was the most contentious. The section deals with the electronic transmission of results of elections, which was one of the major recommendations from Nigerians including INEC. It reads, \u201cThe Commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing, the Senate Deputy Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, swiftly moved to amend the section, proposing that \u201cthe Commission may consider electronic transmission provided the national network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communications Commission and approved by the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe amended version adopted by the Senate after voice votes and votes counted during division states, \u201cINEC may consider the electronic transmission of results provided the National Network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC).\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the section which took the Senate about three hours to consider and approve, first created a stalemate when Senator Albert Akpan Bassey (PDP, Akwa Ibom North-east), countered the amendment made by Abdullahi. Bassey Akpan sought the retention of the provision as originally proposed by the committee which was, however, voted against when put to voice votes as ruled by Senate President Ahmad Lawan.\n\nHowever, after the ruling, the Senate was in a stalemate for about 15 minutes, which led to a hurried closed door session. As the lawmakers failed to reach a consensus on the matter at the closed door session which lasted about one hour, the minority leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, rose through Order 73 of the Standing Rules to call for a division on amendment sought by Senator Akpan.\n\nFollowing this, therefore, the clerk of the Senate, Ibrahim El-Ladan, presided over the election by calling the senators one after the other on a state by state basis.\n\nRemarkedly, at the end of the physical voting which lasted about 40 minutes, a total of 80 senators voted, out of which 52 voted for the amendment made by Senator Sabi Abdullahi and 28 voted for the original provision of the clause. As announced by the clerk, 28 senators were absent during the division and voting session.\n\nInterestingly, while all the 52 senators who voted for the amendment belonged to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), 26 out of the 28 who voted against the amendment belonged to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nOther amendments\n\nOther amendments include Section 68 of the legislation that reads, \u201cThe decision of the Returning Officer shall be final on any question arising from or relating to the unmarked ballot paper, rejected ballot paper and declaration of scores of candidates and the return of a candidate\u2026\u201cprovided that the Commission shall have the power within seven days to review the declaration and return where the Commission determines that the said declaration and return were not made voluntarily or was made contrary to the provisions of the law, regulations and guidelines, and manual for the election.\u201d\n\nSection 64(2) reads, \u201cA decision of the Returning Officer or the Commission under subsection (1) may be reviewed by a Tribunal or Court in an election petition proceeding under this bill.\u201d\n\nAlso, the limit of election spending was increased in the new bill passed by the Senate. Section 91 of the bill now allows presidential candidates to increase their cash \u2018haul\u2019 from the current N1 billion to N5 billion while governorship candidates can mobilise N1 billion from the hitherto N2 million.\n\nWhile senatorial candidates can now legally raise N100 million from the previous N40 million, then candidates to the House of Representatives can now accept N70 million from the current N30 million. And for the State Assembly, candidates are now free to secure N30 million from the previous N10 million.\n\nLawan\u2019s take\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, in his remarks, said with the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, they have \u201cachieved what we have set for themselves.\u201d He stated this in a statement signed by his special assistant on press, Ezrel Tabiowo.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cWe have achieved what we have set for ourselves. We would all recall that at the beginning of the Ninth Senate, we resolved to have a legislative agenda. (And) in our legislative agenda, the Petroleum Industry Bill and amendment of the Electoral Act 2010 are pillars of what we have set for ourselves to do.\n\n\u201cToday, we have achieved those two issues. Secondly, the Electoral Act amendment, we have gone through a serious and probably torturous process to reach where we have to bypass it. There was no victor, no vanquished in this affair. Everyone did what he or she did for the full commitment and realization that what we want is the same thing, but the paths we have taken are different.\n\n\u201cWe want an electronic transmission system for our electoral process, however, we want to ensure that no Nigerian is disenfranchised in this process, and time will come when all parts of Nigeria will have the coverage that we all need to deploy our technology to ensure electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cThis has come to settle the issue of what INEC can do and what INEC cannot. We have given INEC an electoral Act amended to enhance its performance.\u201d\n\nTambuwal\u2019s declaration\n\nMeanwhile, the Sokoto state governor, Aminu Tambuwal, has declared as unconstitutional the decision of the Senate on the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nThe former speaker of the House of Representatives in a statement said, \u201cThe decision of the Senate to subject INEC\u2019s constitutional power to conduct elections to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), and National Assembly is patently unconstitutional. For the avoidance of doubt, S.78 of the Constitution provides that, \u201cThe Registration of voters and the conduct of elections shall be subject to the direction and supervision of the Independent National Electoral Commission.\u201d In the Third Schedule, Part 1, F, and S.15: INEC has the power to organise, undertake and supervise all elections.\u201d\n\nIt read further, \u201cThe Constitution further provides that INEC operations shall not be subject to the direction of anybody or Authority. Unquestionably, the mode of election and transmission are critical parts of the conduct, supervise, undertaking and organisation of elections in Nigeria. Of course, the National Assembly has the power to flesh out the legal framework but that has to be consistent with the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThese constitutional powers have been solely and exclusively prescribed by the constitution to INEC, and cannot be shared with the NCC, or any other Authority, and certainly not a body unknown to the Constitution. The Senate decision to subject INECs constitutional power to conduct elections to NCC is consequently patently unconstitutional and unlawful.\u201d\n\nPDP\u2019s angst\n\nIn its reaction, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stated that the approval of electronic transmission of election results with conditionalities was allegedly for mass rigging of 2023 elections by the APC.\n\nThe party in a recent statement by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, declared that, \u201cThe action of the APC senators is an atrocious assault on the sensibilities of Nigerians, who looked up to the Senate for improvement in our electoral process in a manner that will engender free, fair and credible process.\n\n\u201cThe APC and its senators, in their desperate bid to annex the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), seek to route a statutorily independent commission to the approval of an individual masquerading in the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC); an agency under executive control in addition to an extra endorsement of the legislature, before conducting elections.\n\n\u201cIt is, to say the least, a preparation for mass rigging of elections across Nigeria by the APC, which must be firmly resisted.\u201d\n\nYiaga Africa\u2019s view\n\nIn his comments, the executive director of Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo, said the Senate took an ignoble path in respect to Section 52 by adopting the committee\u2019s recommendation. Itodo, who stated this when he appeared on Channels Television\u2019s Breakfast Show, Sunrise Daily, said, \u201cAs a Nigerian I feel it is embarrassing, disgusting and quite shameful what transpired at the Senate.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw is a determination of some individuals to block a fundamental critical amendment that will deepen the integrity of our elections. And it\u2019s quite sad because what the senators did was to vote against the will of Nigerian people after speaking and demanding that INEC should be given the power to use its discretion to determine the procedure for voting, as well as the transmission of results.\n\n\u201cWe also saw what I consider a constitution overreach and breach, where the desperation and of some political class, particularly some legislators, in trying to undermine the independent of INEC and undermine our electoral process by subjecting the decision and powers of INEC to approval by a government agency that is unknown to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s take\n\nA public affairs analyst, Jide Ojo, in his submission, said what transpired in the National Assembly was not in party\u2019s or national interest, but for the interest of the political elite in the country.\n\nOjo, in a phone conversation with this reporter, said, \u201cFor me it\u2019s a letdown. It\u2019s a betrayal of the people\u2019s trust. And they have failed to deliver, because what they delivered is dead on arrival and is not something you can bank on for credible 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cSo, for introducing that controversy and asking INEC to go and get an approval of NCC, then get the final nod from the National Assembly shows how selfish the National Assembly is. They have thrown cord in whatever good intentions they have.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, when that version of the Senate is sent to the president, the President will definitely veto it. And I know there may likely be a repeat of what happened in 2018. In 2018, when the National Assembly introduced 3 controversial clauses, one of them was 25 (1) where the day INEC should conduct election over three zones and that election of the National Assembly should come first, followed by that of the president and then governors and others. And the president said no, you do not have that power to alter the focus of elections for INEC; that was three years ago. So, why should they now think they can subvert INEC\u2019s independence by asking it to get approval from NCC and National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis obviously means that even if the president is persuaded to sign it, the court will reject that bill. And I can tell you that there are so many people who will go to court to challenge the National Assembly. So, we will be having litigation before pre- election and that will bring about a lot of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cWith what played out in the National Assembly, it is obvious that the difference between APC and PDP is like the difference between six and half a dozen.\n\n\u201cBut having said that, what the National Assembly is doing is to work in the interest of the political elite in Nigeria inclusive of APC, PDP and others. It\u2019s all about their collective interest as political elite who want to perpetuate themselves in power.\u201d",

          "text": "Senator representing Bayelsa West District in the National Assembly, Seriake Dickson, has described the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB , and the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 by the parliament as offensive and insensitive to concerned Nigerians.\n\nDickson, who addressed journalists yesterday in Abuja over the perceived shortcomings in the two bills, however, warned that the approved three percent Host Communities Trust Fund in the PIB may lead to unrest in the Niger Delta region.\n\nThis is as he justified the backlash being faced by the Senate from Nigerians over amendment made to clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, which according to him, unconstitutionally subordinated independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC\n\nThe former Bayelsa State governor specifically declared that the PIB passed with 3% for Host Communities Fund, will not in anyway, help Nigeria and investors in the oil and gas sectors .\n\nAccording to him, the 5% earlier recommended by both Committees of the National Assembly which is even lower to the 10% being demanded for by stakeholders across the various oil producing communities, supposed to have been retained in the interest of fairness, justice and equity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen PIB was first introduced and forwarded to the National Assembly by the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, 10% was proposed for Host Communities fund and Frontier Basins for exploration of oil as against the Bill recently passed, given 3% for Host Communities and 30% for Frontier Basins.\n\n\u201cThese, as far as the people of Niger Delta or oil producing states are concerned are unjustifiable and look like opening another chapter for unrest in the area which will not benefit anybody.\n\n\u201cImagine the problem the country has been facing with Boko Haram insurgency in the North East for the past ten years , the Armed banditry and Kidnapping also being faced in the North West within the last three to four years as well as agitations being faced in South West and South East, to now be added up with avoidable crisis in the South South.\n\n\u201cThose of us from the area did our best to prevail on our colleagues to listen to us and buy into our demands but number or majority position was used , which in actual fact do not build a nation with diversities like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMight and majority do not build a diversified nation like Nigeria, but presence of justice, fairness. Mere reliance on numbers without fairness, equity and justice is inimical to nation building,\u201d he added.\n\nHe therefore appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari not to assent to the bill, but send it back for more consultation and required Inclusiveness in its proposals.\n\nHe disclosed that he along with other lawmakers from the zone staged a walk out from the dinner night President Muhamnadu Buhari had with the 109 senators and 360 members of the House of Representatives, held before the final consideration and passage of the bill when they discovered that it was 3% being canvassed for host communities.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible evening for us on account of the 3% proposal, which as a politician of conviction and not that of convenience, led to my walk out from the dinner along with some other senators.\n\n\u201cWe put up the required moves on the floor of the Senate to push it up to 5% as recommended by the joint committees of both chambers but those who rely solely on numbers, have their way,\u201d he further argued.\n\nOn the controversial amendment made by the Senate on Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act, Dickson said the backlash being received by Senate over the amendment was not unexpected because the original proposal made in the clause had already taken care of whatever exigencies being envisaged on electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Senate Commitee on INEC, the phrase of where and when practicable used in clause 52(3) was enough to take care of any exigencies , making the amendment which included NCC in the entire process, unnecessary and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cFortunately a window of striking out that amendment is already provided by the House of Representatives which adopted the clause as originally proposed.\n\n\u201cSo it is expected that the earlier version of the clause, will be the one to be adopted by the confluence Commitee which will be set up by both chambers for the required harmonization of reports before transmitting the bill to the President for assent,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has urged businessmen, contractors and other privileged Nigerians who are beneficiaries of government patronage to always engage in Corporate Social Responsibility, instead of seeking to favour individuals with gifts.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President, Media & Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President said this on Friday in Daura, Katsina State when he visited the Emir of Daura, Dr Umar Faruk Umar, at his Palace.\n\nHe said: \u201cI don\u2019t want your cheque. Go and assist our communities\u201d instead of trying to return kickbacks to public officers, including his office.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want cheques from anyone or organisations as returns or influence of any kind. Let them remember their Corporate Social Responsibilities,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, President Buhari noted that he would love to visit Daura more frequently, but for the high cost of presidential movements and exposing security personnel to the weather, assuring that his heart remains with the people.\n\n\u201cWe are known for farming and I have my farm here. I could come every two weeks and no one can stop me. But the cost to the movement is high. I would rather that it be used to better our schools, clinics and hospitals\u201d.\n\nThe President said the grace of God had kept Nigeria together as a country in spite of differences that led to a 30-month civil war in the 1960\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank God always for keeping us together as a country. From January 15, 1966, the country was thrown into political crisis. We had a 30 months civil war that resulted in the loss of about a million lives.\n\n\u201cWe still thank God for keeping us together. We remain grateful to all those who showed interest in our unity and progress. May God continue to bless them,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President, who recalled fond memories of visiting the Palace as a military Head of State, expressed happiness that the warmth and hospitality of the traditional institution had been sustained over the years.\n\nIn his remarks, the Emir of Daura thanked the President for always creating time to visit his hometown and the palace despite the tight schedule.\n\n\u201cYour visit to Daura reflects your good character which we are very proud of. I can assure you that men, women, children, marketers and artisans are always pleased to receive you and they will be praying for you.\n\n\u201cToday is not for speeches but for appreciation. We have been blessed so much as a community because you are the leader of the country. You have brought honour to our domain.\n\n\u201cAs a community, we have benefited a lot with increased traffic of people and organisations coming to help us here. We know it\u2019s because of you.\n\n\u201cMay the good Lord always go before you and behind you, and remove all obstacles from your path,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Emir said the President must remain focused in getting results particularly in securing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is lucky to have you at this time. I am not saying it to please you, but if you had not been in power it would have been very difficult. I doubt if we will be here today,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the meeting, the Emir publicly announced the conferment of the title of Talban Daura on Yusuf Buhari, son of President Buhari.\n\nHe said a date would be announced for the turbanning ceremony of the President\u2019s son, which might likely be before his marriage.\n\nThe Emir also announced the creation of a District in the community of the President, with headquarters in Dumurkol.\n\nHe said the turbanning of the young Buhari and the creation of the District are to further extend and deepen the long relationship between the Palace and the family.\n\nAccording to him, the decision was in agreement with the kingmakers in Daura Emirate Council.",

          "text": "China\u2019s President Xi Jinping made his first visit to the Tibet Autonomous Region as national leader this week and urged people there to \u201cfollow the party\u201d, state news agency Xinhua said on Friday.\n\nXi\u2019s July 21-22 visit \u2013 the first to Tibet by a Chinese leader in 30 years \u2013 comes as the country faces increased security concerns as a result of clashes with India and the withdrawal of US-led troops from Afghanistan.\n\nThe visit also shows the ruling Chinese Communist Party\u2019s confidence in having established order and gained support in the region, analysts say.\n\nXi flew into the city of Nyingchi on Wednesday and took a train to the Tibetan capital Lhasa the following day along a section of the high-elevation railway being built to link the mountainous border region with Sichuan province.\n\nIn footage released Friday by state broadcaster CCTV, Xi was seen greeting a crowd wearing ethnic costumes and waving Chinese flags as he left his plane, in a red carpet welcome as dancers performed around him.\n\nAfter a \u201cwarm welcome by cadres and masses of all ethnic groups\u201d, Xi went to the Nyang River Bridge to learn about ecological and environmental protection of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the Nyang River, CCTV said.\n\nIn Lhasa, Xi visited a monastery and the Potala Palace Square, and \u201cinspected ethnic religion work\u201d and Tibetan cultural heritage protection, according to Xinhua.\n\nThe palace is the traditional home of Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is in exile and has been branded a dangerous separatist by Beijing.\n\nState television network CCTV showed a Tibetan woman wiping away tears as she joined a crowd of people dressed in traditional costume clapping enthusiastically to welcome Xi.\n\nXi instructed local provincial officials to work towards making people in Tibet identify more with the \u201cgreat motherland, Chinese people, Chinese culture, the Chinese Communist Party and socialism with Chinese characteristics\u201d, according to Xinhua.\n\nHe also said that only when the people \u201cfollow the party\u201d can the \u201crejuvenation of the Chinese nation\u201d be realised.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the population in Tibet are ethnic Tibetan while Han Chinese are the minority. Most Tibetans are also Buddhists. China\u2019s constitution allows for freedom of religion but the party adheres strictly to atheism.\n\nIn Lhasa, Xi watched a cultural performance that showcased Tibetan culture and loyalty to the party through song and dance, including a famous song with the lyric \u201csing a folk song for the party, the party is like my mother\u201d.\n\nIn Nyingchi, Xi also inspected rural rejuvenation and environmental protection.\n\nOn China\u2019s border with India, Tibet is seen as having critical strategic importance to Beijing. Last year China and India saw the most serious clash in decades on their disputed border in the Himalayas, with deaths on both sides.\n\nPhotos released by Xinhua show Xi was accompanied by Zhang Youxia, a vice chairman of China\u2019s Central Military Commission and a senior general in the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nThe Chinese leader has previously visited Tibet twice, once in 1998 as Fujian province\u2019s party chief and another time in 2011 as vice president.\n\nThe last Chinese president to visit was Jiang Zemin in 1990.\n\nBeijing sent troops into Tibet in 1950 in what it officially terms a peaceful liberation and maintains a heavy security presence in the region, which has been prone to unrest.\n\nA violent clash in 2008 between Chinese police and Tibetan monks commemorating an anniversary of the 14th Dalai Lama\u2019s exit from Tibet left local authorities unsure for many years if a visiting Chinese leader would be welcomed or safe, said Yang Chaohui, professor of politics at Peking University.\n\nTibet\u2019s high altitude, which can take a toll on leaders not accustomed to the climate, is another reason why China\u2019s top leaders rarely visit, he said.",

          "text": "The virus-delayed Tokyo Summer Olympics have finally opened on Friday with cascading fireworks and made-for-TV choreography that unfolded in a near-empty stadium, a colourful but strangely subdued ceremony that set a striking tone to match a unique pandemic Games.\n\nAs their opening played out, devoid of the usual crowd energy, the Olympics convened amid simmering anger and disbelief in much of the host country, but with hopes from organizers that the excitement of the sports to follow would offset the widespread opposition.\n\nThe number of Olympic-related infections since July 1 stood at 106, while the Japanese capital logged 1,359 new infections.\n\n\u201cToday is a moment of hope,\u201d International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach said in his welcome speech before the emperor formally declared the Games of the 32nd Olympiad open.\n\n\u201cYes, it is very different from what all of us had imagined. But let us cherish this moment because finally, we are all here together,\u201d he\n\nsaid, naming solidarity \u201cthe light at the end of the dark tunnel of this pandemic.\u201d\n\nBach also praised the Japanese people, saying in Japanese \u201cThank you to all the Japanese people\u201d for making the Games possible.\n\nThe organisers also sent the traditional message of peace as global pop stars sang the John Lennon and Yoko Ono hit \u201cImagine,\u201d while drones formed the shape of the Olympic emblem in the sky above the stadium and transformed into the shape of the globe.\n\n\u201cWith the world in a tough situation because of the coronavirus pandemic, I would like to pay my respect and express my gratitude to medical workers and all those who are working hard every day to overcome the difficulties,\u201d said the President of the organising committee, Seiko Hashimoto.\n\nA reduced parade of about 5,700 athletes, far lower than the usual numbers, filed into the stadium.\n\nJapanese tennis star Naomi Osaka lit the Olympic cauldron to mark the formal start of Tokyo 2020.\n\nMost countries were represented by both male and female flagbearers in an Olympic first, but not everybody took pandemic measures.\n\nTeams from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and the Pakistan flagbearers paraded maskless in an awkward contrast to protocol and the vast majority of other athletes at the ceremony.\n\nRegardless, it marked a coming together of the world, with an audience of hundreds of millions around the globe and at various stages of the pandemic tuning in to watch the start of the greatest show in sport.\n\nMembers of the Canada delegation wore patches in the colour of the rainbow, the symbol of the LGBTQ community, on their jackets. US first lady Jill Biden clapped at the Americans as did France President Emmanuel Macron for the French team.\n\nThe Olympic oath, recited by the athletes at the end of the parade, has been updated for the Tokyo Games, with athletes swearing their commitment to inclusion, equality, and non-discrimination for the first time at the Olympics.\n\nThe opening also featured fireworks in indigo and white, the colours of the Tokyo 2020 emblem, and gave a nod to Japanese tradition represented by giant wooden Olympic rings linked to the 1964 Games.\n\nA vastly smaller number of athletes marched in the teams\u2019 parade, with many flying in just before their competitions and due to leave shortly after to avoid infections.\n\nA moment of silence was held \u201cfor all those family and friends we have lost,\u201d especially to the coronavirus, and mention was made of the Israeli athletes slain at the 1972 Munich Games.\n\nInternational and domestic fans were banned from all venues in Tokyo.\n\nTop sponsors, including Toyota and Panasonic, also opted not to send their representatives to the opening event, with polls showing the Japanese public remaining largely against moving forward with the sprawling gathering in which about 11,000 athletes will contest 339 medal events across 50 disciplines in 33 sports over two weeks.\n\nReporting from outside the ceremony, Al Jazeera\u2019s Andy Richardson said, \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of almost disbelief hanging around this stadium.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been so much talk about this over the last 12 months \u2013 but here we are,\u201d he said, adding that the planners of the event have said the programme would be \u201csombre and in sync with the sentiment of today, what this country and the world is going through with the pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe opening ceremony has always been a pretty integral part of the Games in showcasing the country\u2019s national identity, but I don\u2019t think many host cities have had to pull off quite such a balancing act to win over such a sceptical public,\u201d he said.\n\nFlagbearers Musa Bwogi and Kirabo Namutebi of Uganda lead their contingent in the athletes\u2019 parade during the opening ceremony [Phil Noble/Reuters]\n\nJapanese Emperor Naruhito cheered on the athletes. Unlike his grandfather who opened the 1964 Games with a Japanese word that means \u201ccongratulations,\u201d Naruhito opted for a more neutral word in Japanese which is closer to \u201ccommemorate\u201d.\n\nThe ceremony was marked by major absences, including former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who wooed the Games to Tokyo.\n\nHundreds of people also protested around the venue yelling \u201cStop the Olympics\u201d. Only a third of the host nation have had even one dose of of a coronavirus vaccine, prompting worries the Games could become a super-spreader event.\n\nJapan has spent nearly $15bn on the Games, including $2.6bn in extra costs after they became the first to be postponed in modern Olympic history in March 2020.\n\nTokyo is also battling a surge in virus cases and is under emergency measures though they fall short of a strict lockdown.\n\nThe pandemic has not been the only hiccup, with scandals ranging from corruption during the bidding process to plagiarism allegations over the design of the Tokyo 2020 logo.\n\nThe controversies kept coming right up to the eve of the Games, with the opening ceremony\u2019s director sacked on Thursday for making a joke referencing the Holocaust in a video from 1998.\n\nInsiders estimate the IOC would have been on the hook for around $1.5bn in lost broadcasting revenues if the Games had been cancelled.",

          "text": "Mark Zuckerberg has laid out his vision to transform Facebook from a social media network into a \u201cmetaverse company\u201d in the next five years.\n\nA metaverse is an online world where people can game, work and communicate in a virtual environment, often using VR headsets.\n\nThe Facebook CEO described it as \u201can embodied internet where instead of just viewing content \u2013 you are in it\u201d.\n\nHe told The Verge people shouldn\u2019t live through \u201csmall, glowing rectangles\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not really how people are made to interact,\u201d he said, speaking of reliance on mobile phones.\n\n\u201cA lot of the meetings that we have today, you\u2019re looking at a grid of faces on a screen. That\u2019s not how we process things either.\u201d\n\nOne application of the metaverse he gave was being able to jump virtually into a 3D concert after initially watching on a mobile phone screen.\n\n\u201cYou feel present with other people as if you were in other places, having different experiences that you couldn\u2019t necessarily do on a 2D app or webpage, like dancing, for example, or different types of fitness,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook is also working on an \u201cinfinite office\u201d that lets users create their ideal workplace through VR.\n\n\u201cIn the future, instead of just doing this over a phone call, you\u2019ll be able to sit as a hologram on my couch, or I\u2019ll be able to sit as a hologram on your couch, and it\u2019ll actually feel like we\u2019re in the same place, even if we\u2019re in different states or hundreds of miles apart,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is really powerful.\u201d\n\nFacebook has invested heavily in virtual reality, spending $2bn (\u00a31.46bn) on acquiring Oculus, which develops its VR products.\n\nIn 2019, it launched Facebook Horizon \u2013 an invitation-only immersive environment where users can mingle and chat in a virtual space with a cartoon avatar through Oculus headsets.\n\nZuckerberg admitted current VR headsets were \u201ca bit clunky\u201d and needed improving for people to work in them all day.\n\nBut he argued that Facebook\u2019s metaverse would be \u201caccessible across\u2026 different computing platforms\u201d including VR, AR (augmented reality), PC, mobile devices and games consoles.\n\nThe concept of a metaverse is popular with tech companies who believe it could be a new 3D internet, connecting digital worlds where people hang out in virtual reality.\n\nIts origins come from Neal Stephenson\u2019s 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual-reality-based successor to the internet.\n\nTech firms have tried to implement metaverse elements in popular games including Animal Crossing, Fortnite and Roblox.\n\nThis includes planning live events such as concerts and tournaments where millions of players can interact from around the globe.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason Facebook is so heavily invested in VR/AR is that the granularity of data available when users interact on these platforms is an order of magnitude higher than on screen-based media,\u201d Verity McIntosh, a VR expert at the University of the West of England, told the BBC.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s not just about where I click and what I choose to share, it\u2019s about where I choose to go, how I stand, what I look at for longest, the subtle ways that I physically move my body and react to certain stimuli. It\u2019s a direct route to my subconscious and that is gold to a data capitalist.\n\n\u201cIt seems unlikely that Facebook will have an interest in changing a business model that has served them so well to prioritise user privacy or to give users any meaningful say in how their behavioural data in the \u2018metaverse\u2019 will be used.\u201d\n\nTech giants like Facebook defining and colonising the space, while traditional governance structures struggle to keep up with the technological change could cause further issues, she added.",
