          "text": "Senior lawyers hoping to be conferred with the rank of the Senior Advocate of Nigeria have called on the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee to extend the duration for application submission as they were unable to meet the March 31 deadline.\n\nSome of the applicants told The PUNCH that the new online application, which said they initially hailed its process, denied them registration for they experienced difficulties that didn\u2019t allow them complete the application.\n\nThe portal, powered by a leading legal technology firm in Nigeria, to eliminate the manual process of application, was opened at 12pm on January 01, 2022, and closed on March 31, 2022.\n\nSpeaking in Benin City, Edo State, a lawyer, Benjamin Okorie, called for the intervention of the Nigerian Bar Association to ensure that deserving legal practitioners were not denied the privilege of the SAN rank.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen in December, the LPPC jettisoned the manual mode of application and went digital, we were all excited with the conviction that the process would be seamless and hitch-free. Little did we know that the automation which we all celebrated will make it impossible for some of us who are deserving of the SAN rank.\n\n\u201cThe portal steadily experiences lags, while the filing process was not only difficult but makes it impossible for applicants to complete the registration process. I call on the LPPC to be considerate and extend the application to accommodate the interest of many qualified legal practitioners who may be affected by this hitch.\u201d\n\nAlso, Uyi Ekeosa of Ekeosa Chambers in Benin City, called on the LPPC to take responsibility for the failures in the new portal and extend the date of application.\n\n\u201cI started my application in the second week of January and was still not able to complete the process till I was shut out of the site at midnight, March 31, 2022. This is quite embarrassing and immediate actions must be taken to salvage the situation.\n\n\u201cAs applicants, we were expected to upload clear and legible copies of supporting documents required by the guidelines for the purpose of the application on the application portal. But this was impossible in the over two months that I struggled to complete it. The site is quite slow and troubleshoots, thereby affecting the filing process. The NBA should please intervene and save us from this.\u201d\n\nAnother lawyer, Igbinosa Edebiri, said with the digitalisation and automation of the application process, they anticipated a hitch-free application process, noting that it was not the case as most of them were logged out of the site without completing the process.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI urge the legal practitioners\u2019 committee in the spirit of fairness to ensure that the date of application is duly extended. We have put in lots of effort to meet up with the requirements of the LPPC. We rendered pro bono services to indigent clients and also pursued cases up to the Supreme Court as parts of the requirement that would enable us to enjoy the privilege. It is bad that we will be dropped for selection because of computer-error.\u2019\u2019\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "AHEAD of the submission of the report by the Governor Samuel Ortom-led zoning Committee on Tuesday (today), northern Peoples Democratic Party Presidential hopeful on Monday visited Delta and Edo States to seek support for the consensus option rather than zoning the Presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party to the South.\n\nTo this end, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, former Senate President Bukola Saraki; and a former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, Alhaji Mohammed Hayatudeen, visited Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa. However, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, who is from the North, was not in attendance.\n\nOkowa, while commending the four northern aspirants, said consensus would keep the party united.\n\n\u201cThis action that four of you have taken today is actually a step in the right direction. It will strengthen us and pull us together. It is my prayer that God will help you achieve this consensus that you seek to build because in that consensus, we will be united as a party, which will give a lot of hope to Nigerians, that truly, PDP is working the talk.\n\n\u201cSo I truly want to appreciate you for this visit and urge that you work hard towards the building of this consensus and that of the party too,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe aspirants also visited Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State where they sought his support.\n\nReceiving the visitors at the Government House in Benin City, Obaseki said the country was in dire need of a leader with the capacity to unite and rebuild the nation.\n\nHe said, \u201cI can\u2019t thank our visitors enough for bringing a new lease of life into our politics. This is a new model in leadership selection where leaders with higher aspirations can come together for the good of the people.\n\n\u201cThey are working towards a consensus candidate arrangement knowing the task of becoming Nigeria\u2019s president.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Saraki, who spoke on behalf of others, said the visit was to canvas for the option to adopt a consensus candidate ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe all know the various situations that exist in our country and the need for the PDP to provide a platform and in doing that, we realize that the interest of the country is more paramount to our own interests.\n\n\u201cAs such, we have come together and agreed that we should work out a consensus where we don\u2019t all just go to the field. We don\u2019t want our energy to be focused on just trying to get to power, but on how to help make Nigeria better.\n\n\u201cWe need your support in this process. What Nigerians need now is a president that has a team to work with. The problems are huge and we all have the qualities to lead this country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, it was learnt that the members of the zoning committee have begun arriving in Abuja and are expected to meet at the Benue State Governor\u2019s Lodge on Tuesday (today).\n\nThe PUNCH learnt that as of Monday evening, there had been no agreement on the zoning arrangement of the party. While some southern elements including Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, have insisted that power should shift to the South, several northern Presidential aspirants are pushing for an open race.\n\nMedia mogul, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, who is the leader of the technical committee, Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign, said he was confident of Atiku\u2019s emergence regardless of what the PDP decides.\n\nSpeaking at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja on Monday, Dokpesi said, \u201cI am not aware of any internal problems in the PDP. No crisis whatsoever. PDP is one big family we shall all be together as brothers and sisters.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, we have nothing against whatever the party will decide, but the zoning will not be against us.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "*\u2026petitions Presidency\n\nBy Chioma Obinna & Gabriel Olawale\n\nThe Joint Health Sector Unions, JOHESU, on Monday raised the alarm over what it described as \u201ccontinuous disruption\u201d of post-graduate specialty and skill acquisition endeavours by Chief Medical Directors and Medical Directors of Federal Health Institutions, FHI, in Nigeria, accusing them of sabotaging the residency training circular of Resident Pharmacists.\n\nIn a circular sighted by Vanguard, Acting National Secretary of JOHESU, Comrade Matthew Ajorutu alleged that all the Chief Executive Officers of FHIs with the backing of the Federal Ministry of Health, FMoH have sabotaged the residency training and a few FHIs that allow resident training for Pharmacists charge them exorbitant fees contrary to the enabling circulars.\n\nHe argued that the development was contrary to the 2015 circular by the FMoH under the leadership of the Permanent Secretary Mr. Linus Awute, which approved the use of all FHIs in the country as training facilities for Resident Pharmacists in-training at the WAPCP through a circular.\n\nHe regretted that 11 years after National Council on Establishment, NCE, endorsed a Consultant Pharmacist Cadre, FMoH in alliance with the Committee of CMDs and MDs of the FHIs have sabotaged the circular which prescribes that graduates of the WAPCP in the Directorate Cadre from CONHESS 13 to 15 be recognised as Consultant Pharmacists in the Public Service.\n\n\u201cIn what was perceived as very bizzare the FMoH recently wrote a memo to the NCE asking for further clarifications on the implementation of the Consultant Cadre circular for Pharmacists.\n\n\u201cThis memo was rejected and thrown out by the NCE which insisted that all necessary steps for implementation of the Consultant Cadre for Pharmacists were already spelt out in the August 2021 Circular of the FMoH.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that the Permanent Secretary, FMoH in a letter Ref. no. FMH/FDS/CSPTH/1/77 OF March 18, 2021, issued an internal circular to all Heads of Departments, FHIs, Agencies/Parastatals and regulatory bodies directing immediate implementation of the approved scheme, a circular that has continually been flouted by the CMDs and MDs of the FHIs.\n\n\u201cIn yet another internal circular Ref. No. FMH/FDS/CSPTH/1/95 of August 2, 2021 while citing precedents in the creation of Cadres in Civil Service, the FMoH CLEARED the mode of application for the implementation of the Consultant Pharmacists Cadre.\n\n\u201cIt hinged this on the Fellow of the WAPCP for officers already in the Directorate Cadre or the equivalent of GL.15 and above stating without ambiguity that such officers shall transit to the corresponding GL as Consultant without stepping down any grade.\n\n\u201cDespite the flawless process that engendered the approval of the Consultant Pharmacists Cadre, it remains a sad testimony that only the UCH, Ibadan and about two other FHIs as well as the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria have complied with the circular of the OHCSF and the FMoH to implement the new Consultant Pharmacists Cadre, it is apparent that some key chieftains of the FMoH have colluded with the CEOs of the FHIs to attempt to jeopardize the Pharmacists Cadre.\n\n\u201cGovernment apathy and refusal to impose sanctions on the reckless attitude of the CMDs amounts to promoting indiscipline in the service as well as a clear usurpation of the collective authorization, rights and privileges of Pharmacists and the Generality of all Health Workers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe sound a note of caution yet again that the CMDs and MDs are employees of the Federal Government who should not be allowed to truncate the rights of other employees.\n\n\u201cThey are not employers of labour, regulatory bodies or autonomous organs of government which dictates what the benefit packages of any group of stakeholders in the Health Sector should or should not be in arithmetical or other known measures.\n\n\u201cThe HOCSF is called upon to uphold the mode of implementation already clearly and unambiguously documented in the circular Ref. No. FMH/FDS/CSPTH/1/95 of August 2, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis circular clarified the mode of applicability and full implementation of the Consultant Pharmacists Cadre in Nigeria.\n\nThey enjoyed HOCSF to invoke PSR 030301 against all the CMDs and MDs in FHIs immediately so as not to continue to set this ungodly precedence of indiscipline and recklessness in service protocol.\n\n\u201cThe HOCSF is further encouraged to note that PSR 030301 defines misconduct as a \u201cspecific act of wrong-doing or an improper behaviour which is inimical to the image of the service and can be investigated and proved.\n\n\u201cHOCSF ma, the incentive for the various aberrations at the FHIs is catalysed by the apparent inaction/action of the Federal Government to deal decisively with obvious aberrations perpetrated by the CMDs and MDs of the concerned FHIs,\u201d the circular noted.\n\nVanguard News",

It is on strength of the obvious strengths of this partnership that we approach the future with much confidence.\n\n\u201cWe were asked to drive value across the social chain and that has been done increasingly. We have employed Kwarans and engaged Kwarans for business.\n\n\u201d We find great opportunities, not just for commercial ends but for social value for the good people of Kwara State. \u201c\n\n\u201cAt this point in global history where economies are under daily threats of survival, it behoves on responsible organisations and governments to expand their outlook to socially beneficial predispositions. \u201c\n\nHe recalled that \u201cThe process of our emergence has been hewn from careful and deliberate thought, intelligent planning, collaborative development and assiduous dedication to the objectives of Drupp in Kwara.\n\nIt\u2019s co-operator of the scheme the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association of Nigeria, PEDPAN.which he described as a worthy partner,\u201d has proven, within the short span of our mutual collaborations, that meaningful, respectful and well-defined partnerships can exist between cab-hailing platforms and the engine rooms of these platforms \u2013 driving partners.\u201d\n\n\u201d PEDPAN has adequately proven to be partners that we can grow together with so far, and so we equally commit to a thriving partnership to drive the industry forward in Kwara State. We will rise together, and pursue our collective dreams together while achieving our entities goals in tow.\n\nHe added that, \u201cDrupp is a people-driven business initiative and so we have purposed to provide favourable and fair working conditions for all partners. While we remain perpetually in client service, we moderate that ambition by ensuring that our policies actively capture the interests of our driving partners.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Femi Oyetunji, the Company Secretary of Harmony Holdings Limited, the umbrella business outfit of the Kwara state government, said that the scheme guaranteed security and competitiveness in the area of affordable pricing.\n\nHe said that the idea behind the creation of Drupp was part and parcel of Kwara State government\u2019s plan to provide jobs and add value to people in the state, adding that the government was determined to make the business work.",

Locals were said to have been infuriated because a similar incident occurred recently and they were still nursing the wounds.\n\nAngry youths reportedly stormed the streets to protest what they termed the takeover of their communities by the okada men. They also went after the suspected killer.\n\nBut their move was resisted by other motorcyclists of northern extraction armed with daggers, knives and other dangerous weapons.\n\nThe situation which soon snowballed into an ethnic violence was brought under control by police teams deployed by the Commissioner, Abiodun Alabi.\n\nIt was learnt that the operatives arrested the suspected killer and 41 others.\n\nA resident, Long Adenekan said: \u201cThe landlords and people around several estates need to start scrutinising the okada people with the help of the police around their areas.\n\n\u201cIt was a mere argument and they pounced on someone looking for his daily bread. They killed the man.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t the police do their job before these attacks or they always wait until people are being killed before peace is restored?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people didn\u2019t stand against them, they were ready to start entering different houses to kill.\n\nPolice spokesman Benjamin Hundeyin said the suspected killer was arrested, adding that calm had been restored.\n\nHundeyin posted an update on social media, saying, \u201cWe are fully aware violent fights broke out in the Baruwa area of Ipaja today (yesterday). Adequate teams of the RRS have since been deployed to that area. Calm has been restored. One person has been confirmed dead.\u201d",

Much as the board would like to keep the cost at a minimum, the prevailing high cost of diesel and other consumables has necessitated the increase from N600 to N1,000 to enable the CBT centres provide the needed infrastructure, as partners of the board, to host the examination, which is scheduled to hold on Saturday, April 9, 2022.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe board has thought, through this increase, and resolved that instead of cancelling the mock-UTME, which introduction has improved candidates\u2019 confidence in sitting the examination owing to the high cost of diesel, it is better to increase the service charge to make the exercise worthwhile to the participating centre.\u201d",

The well-orchestrated incident remains highly condemnable, reprehensible and upsetting to every rational mind.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us, either within communities and/or on the roads we ply, have automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it. The humanity in us is slowly being eroded, thereby making us to adapt to the new normal within which we have unfortunately found ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that in Islam, and by all global standards, the essence of government and governance is solely to protect the five principal cardinal rights of the human race, the most important of which is life! Any government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place; this is enunciated in Section 33(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have, however, carefully studied and followed up the unfortunate train blast, especially that another train attack was reported to have occurred on the Lagos-Kano-bound train, near Jaji, Kaduna State, on Thursday, March 31, 2022, which inevitably led to the death of the locomotive operator.\n\n\u201cTherefore, this press release is premised on the fact that Nigeria is more or less heading to an unknown destination of multiple cum well-coordinated serial chaos attributable to lack of coordination and synergy from security personnel, if the news making the rounds is to be believed\u2026\u201d\n\nIt expressed dismay that bandits have taken over some areas in the country where they collect taxes from their victims while government cannot take action.",

          "text": "The Health sector needs at least $500 million for research and development (R&D), the Nigeria COVID-19 Research Coalition (NCRC) has said.\n\nIt also said the money would enable the country to generate research evidence for the understanding of COVID-19 pandemic and support for response to the outbreak.\n\nThe coalition, which was established by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Federal Ministry of Health, in collaboration with the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETfund), Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) and National Universities Commission (NUC), noted that the Health sector is facing paucity of funds, inadequate manpower and infrastructure, among others, and called for more domestic funding for R&D.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing on the research colloquium yesterday in Abuja, NCRC National Coordinator Dr. Chinwe Ochu said: \u201cFrom outset when the first case of COVID-19 was identified in Nigeria in February 2020, as NCDC, we decided to convene a coalition involving scientists coming together with policy makers and working with the industry and consumers to define a pathway on research in order to help us to understand COVID-19 pandemic and how to respond to it.\n\n\u201cThe NCRC was set up because of the understanding we have of the challenges we had in the country on health research; the fact that we have paucity of funds for research, inadequate trained human resources, inadequate research infrastructure, limited indigenous research protocols and silos activities of different research groups, as well as suboptimal quality of routine data to aid understanding of health issues.\n\n\u201cThe uniqueness of the NCRC is based on the fact that it utilises a model that we call the Quadruple Helix Model. This is a model that has four helices: scientists, the government, industry and private sector. We also have end-users \u2013 COVID-19 survivors who are part of the coalition.\u201d\n\nNCRC Project Manager, Dr. Popoola Mustapha Ayo, added: \u201cThe requirement, in terms of funding for research in the country, is about $5 billion. If you look at the requirement and proposition by the African Union (AU) for countries in Africa, it is to make sure that they have one per cent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a contribution to R&D.\n\n\u201cOur national GDP is trending at around $450 billion to $500 billion. If you look at one per cent of that, it will give you around $5 billion. As at present, TETfund, which is holding the highest grant portfolio for the country in terms of research, is trending at around $20 million.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you can actually calculate the gap between the $5 billion that is required for our national economic development, in terms of R&D, and the $20 million that we have.\n\n\u201cWhen you disaggregate that by thematic groups that we are working with on some of the projects, you see that the Health sector is in the requirement of nothing less than $500 million per annum for you to have concrete evidence or research that can make sense and be of impact to the economy.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors, yesterday, berated the Presidency over its response to the opposition governor\u2019s recent communique on the state of the nation.\n\nThe Forum, in a statement by its Director General, CID Maduabum, described the response of the Presidency through Garba Shehu as infantile.\n\nThe PDP governors noted that their March 23 communique merely stated the facts as it relate to the existential threat confronting the country under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governors communiqu\u00e9 made a comparative sketch of Nigeria of 2015 under PDP and Nigeria of 2022 under APC. The communiqu\u00e9 reeled out the fact that in almost all sectors, things have gotten worse by over 1000%.\n\n\u201cThis is reflected in prices of basic foodstuffs, unemployment rate, electricity prices, kerosene, diesel, fuel, aviation fuel and air ticket prices which have all gone through the roof. It reeled out figures on poverty, inflation, exchange rate, debt accumulation and corruption.\n\n\u201cIndeed, all aspects of life in Nigeria are being systematically destroyed by the APC administration. Life has become short, brutish and valueless in Buhari\u2019s Nigeria as insecurity ravages the land. But this is not the problem of Garba Shehu, who is enveloped in the Presidential Villa, totally oblivious of the suffering and agony Nigerians are facing.\n\n\u201cThe most disturbing aspect of misrule of the APC as chronicled in the communiqu\u00e9 is the petroleum sector.The stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil and the connivance of NNPC in shortchanging other tiers of government, namely, States and Local Governments is simply mind bogging, if not outright criminal. Nigeria now produces 1.1million barrels of crude oil per day. It has capacity to produce 2.5 million per day. It cannot even meet its OPEC quota of 1.8 million per day. NNPC is a law unto itself.\n\n\u201cNobody can call them to order to desist from the part of lawlessness and unconstitutional acts it has chosen to dwell in. Of course, President Buhari is the Minister of Petroleum Resources. Under his watch, the Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector is deteriorating. In an accountable government, he should have resigned his position as Minister of Petroleum, as a result of the cataclysmic failures in the sector.\n\n\u201cIt is even shocking that Garba Shehu admits that funds from NNPC are now directly used to fund social and health programmes, road construction etc, in an unconstitutional overreach. NNPC can spend the Federal Government\u2019s share of the Federation Account as it pleases. It cannot spend money belonging to other tiers of government without their approval. NNPC cheats States and Local Governments. NNPC recklessly squanders money belonging to other tiers of government and has the audacity and impudence to pay Zero amount of money into the Federation Account.\n\n\u201cGarba Shehu conveniently ignored the facts in the PDP Governors Communique that exposed the deduction of N788 billion for NNPC\u2019s own chosen projects without recourse to the Federation Account; the deduction of N8.3 billion monthly for rehabilitation of refineries in Nigeria that do not work; the scandal called petroleum subsidy that gulps trillions of naira yearly without accountability and value for money.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nAn All Progressives Congress (APC) group, Emefiele Solidarity Vanguard (ESV), has said that Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Dr Godwin Emefiele will be an unstoppable aspirant to replace President Muhammadu Buhari if he eventually declares his intention to run in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe group, which distanced the CBN governor from the hundreds of Sharan branded buses, which they say were aimed at compelling him to run in the presidential race, however, warned against a campaign of calumny against him.\n\nWhile addressing reporters on Monday in Abuja, the group led by Patriot Daniel Enyi, challenged anyone who has evidence of the CBN governor consulting for President or any other political office to tender same before the general public.\n\nThe leader of the pro-Emefiele group further said that the CBN governor is yet to accept the offer by Nigerians to succeed President Buhari when his tenure ends in 2023.\n\nThe group appealed to those behind the circulation of the pictures of the branded buses to join hands with the progressives to convince Emefiele to contest the 2023 presidential elections for a consolidated Nigeria.\n\n\u2018We are confident that, if he makes up his mind to contest, he will declare in the open as political office seeking can not be done in closed doors especially the office of the President of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018The images been circulated on social media have nothing to do with the CBN directly, the blackmail is an attempt to box Emefiele to the corner. It is outright blackmail against his person to link the agitation directly to him.\n\n\u2018It is a norm that whenever he accepts to contest, it would be made public, he will answer the clarion call in the open. As Nigerians, the truth is, nobody can stop us from expressing our opinion on whom we feel should govern the country after 2023.\n\n\u2018There is no doubt that Nigerians from all quarters, the North, the South, East and West are calling on the CBN governor to run as President in 2023.\n\n\u2018We are convinced that, if he does, he will win, this is the threat where some do or die political office seekers are trying to blackmail him.\n\n\u2018Remember, this is a man who was appointed by the PDP administration of Dr Goodluck Jonathan and was reappointed by President Buhari for a second term based on his dedicated service to the Nation.\n\n\u2018We wish to make bold that, the 2023 presidential elections are far beyond an individual as Nigeria belongs to all of us. We firmly believe that the economy needs a seasoned technocrat, an economist of all standards who understands monetary policy, diversification of the economy as well, a patriotic Nigerian who shall improve the security situation and consolidate the gains of Buhari\u2019s administration. This we have found in Dr Godwin Emefiele.\n\n\u2018Nigeria needs a President who thinks beyond 2023, a man or woman who understands the economic situation of the country and is poised to improve on it,\u2019 the group noted.",

          "text": "\n\n*Agrees with federal lawmakers that nowhere is safe again\n\n*ACF, Afenifere, PDP caution against use of mercenaries to fight terrorists\n\n*Seven of 11 coaches rerailed to safety after train attack, 80 meters of affected tracks repaired\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Kasim Sumaina in Abuja, James Sowole in Abeokuta and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday, said Nigeria\u2019s security crisis was reaching a tipping point, stressing that the situation is made even more serious as President Muhammadu Buhari seems overwhelmed by the country\u2019s problems. Obasanjo, who spoke in Abeokuta, was reacting to the recent bomb attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train, which killed eight persons, with many other passengers kidnapped or missing.\n\nThe former president agreed with the position of some members of the House of Representatives, who declared last week that nowhere was safe in the country.\n\n\n\nThat was as the foremost northern socio-political body, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF); the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cautioned against the proposal to use mercenaries in the fight against terrorists in the country.\n\n\n\nThe idea of resorting to mercenaries was mooted recently by the Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, after confessing he was \u201cangry, frustrated and felt totally helpless\u201d over the activities of terrorists.\n\nBut, in a welcome development, the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), yesterday, said it had successfully re-railed seven out of the 11 coaches that were affected on the Kaduna-bound AK9 train, when it was attacked by terrorists. NRC also said 80 metres of the affected rail tracks had been repaired.\n\nObasanjo said recent happenings had shown that Nigerians were no longer safe anywhere in the country, whether in vehicles, on the train or at the airport.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, inside his residence, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, while receiving a PDP presidential aspirant, Dr. Ugochukwu Williams, and his team, Obasanjo lamented that Nigerians \u201care no longer safe on the road, on the train and at the airport.\u201d He called for a concerted effort by stakeholders to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe former president said the present government was overwhelmed by the situation, cautioning, however, that Nigerians must not allow the problem to overcome the country.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, if anybody comes to say I want to see you, I want to talk to you, I will say \u2018you\u2019re welcome\u2019. This is because I believe very strongly, and I have said it publicly and I will say it again that the situation we are in this country is not a situation, where one man will say, yes, he has a solution, unless we are deceiving ourselves. I believe we need to sit down collectively and look at the situation.\n\n\n\n\u201cA situation where you are not safe on the road, you are not safe on the train, you are not safe at the airport, shows a very serious situation. I believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObasanjo wished Williams well in the pursuit of his presidential ambition.\n\n\n\nIn his remarks, Williams, flanked by House of Representatives aspirants from Plateau and Imo states, said he had, with regard to his presidential ambition, visited Obasanjo for consultation. The presidential hopeful described the former president as a leader, who was passionate about the peace and unity of Nigeria.\n\nWilliams said he was on a mission to \u201crescue Nigeria.\u201d\n\nACF Cautions Against Use of Mercenaries in Anti-terrorist War\n\nArewa Consultative Forum (ACF) warned against the use of mercenaries in the fight against terrorists in the country.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, whose state had of recent been under deadly attacks by terrorists, was reported as saying he, alongside four other governors in the North-west, would hire foreign mercenaries to fight terrorists if the military failed to end the persistent attacks.\n\n\n\nEl-Rufai had said during an interview last Friday with journalists, after briefing Buhari on the attacks in his state, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, \u201cWhy is it that up till now the security has not gone to kill them (terrorists)? Where are our soldiers? Why have they not done it? That is why I have come to see Mr President.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd also I have said that if these actions are not taken, it becomes a must for us as governors to take measures to protect our citizens, even if it means we will import mercenaries from outside the country to do it.\n\n\u201cIf our soldiers fail, I swear to God, we will do that. This issue has gotten to an alarming state.\u201d\n\nBut ACF, in a statement yesterday in Kaduna, signed by its Secretary General, Murtala Aliyu, warned, \u201cInviting mercenaries to fight our cause must be treated with utmost caution.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe forum said it understood the frustration of the governors over the security situation, but noted that the country should avoid any haphazard approach to its problems. It maintained, \u201cThe security of the country rests on the central government and calls for cursory, calm, implementable and lasting solution.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, on the proposal to escort trains from Abuja to Kaduna, and Ibadan to Lagos or the Itakpe routes by the Nigerian Air Force, the forum urged security agencies to redesign their strategies and operations by deploying machinery and manpower to launch attacks on bandit and terrorist enclaves.\n\n\n\nACF stated, \u201cDedicating such operations to only railway lines shall make air and road users more vulnerable to such attacks. The new dimension of the terror attacks in the country, both on human and infrastructure, calls for total war.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe authorities may look at the possibility of utilising volunteers, such as the ex-servicemen and women, the civilian task forces, hunters and whatever is available to make every inch of Nigeria habitable and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe must appreciate the responsibility bestowed on us by providence as the largest black nation and as a leader on our continent, must do everything within our powers to keep Nigeria stable and strong.\u201d\n\nAfenifere: Inviting Mercenary is Ominous\n\nAfenifere flayed the suggestion by the Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, to invite foreign mercenaries to fight terrorism in the state, saying it represents an ominous sign for the country.\n\n\n\nAfenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Jare Ajayi, said the idea, coming from one of the closest allies of Buhari and a top member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), whose state faced grave security challenges, \u201ccalls for serious interrogation and action on the part of all those who should act.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said the fact that El-Rufai made the suggestion immediately after a meeting with the president could be an indication that what the governor heard from Buhari, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, was not reassuring enough.\n\n\n\nAccording to Afenifere, \u201cFor, were Rufai to be convinced with the readiness of the federal government to confront the security situation, he would not have talked about seeking an alternative action, particularly, seeking the help of foreign mercenaries. This point is very important to be borne in mind as we interrogate the security problems confronting us today.\n\n\u201cFor, hiring the services of foreign mercenary is certainly beyond the power of any state governor, according to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. And El-Rufai knows this so well. So, for him to assert that he (and a few of his colleagues) will resort to this option could be a pointer to certain things that had hitherto not been so clear to members of the public.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmong those could be the possibility that, perhaps, armed foreigners are already in our midst. It could also be a pointer to the fact that El-Rufai saw some kind of unwillingness on the part of the federal government to confront this problem headlong, hence his desire to seek help his own way \u2013 even when the manner of seeking such help is constitutionally beyond his power.\n\n\u201cBut then, his position could be understood against the background of desperation and the need to put an end to the horror going on by any means possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfenifere asserted that the solution to the problem did not lie in hiring foreign mercenaries but sincerely seeking available local the answers. The group said the first step was for the Buhari government to be genuinely determined to put an end to the carnage.\n\nIt stated, \u201cIn this determination should be adequate funding of the armed forces, proper motivation of the forces, a stoppage to the kid glove treatment being given to terrorists, and more importantly, immediate approval for willing state governments to set up their own police forces.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are dangers in bringing in foreign mercenaries by these governors, because their antecedents in the recent past do not give us reasons to trust them. They could, perhaps, use the said mercenaries against indigenous people.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said such a call by a sitting governor exposed the governor as preferring to address an issue on the surface rather than from its root.\n\n\n\nIt stated, \u201cWho would pretend not to know that many of our farmers and local people live in hamlets and villages? Would it not be those innocent people, who would be so \u2018cleared\u2019 especially since fifth columnists are likely to have informed the terrorists of the planned invasion beforehand? This is one of the reasons why the governors cannot be trusted on the issue of importing foreign mercenaries.\u201d\n\nBased on the claims by official sources that more than N4.27 trillion had been spent on defence in seven years, Afenifere lamented that in spite of this colossal sum, \u201cthe situation is getting worse by the day.\u201d\n\nAPC Leaders Fuelling Terrorism, PDP Tells El-Rufai\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the expression of frustration over the security situation and threats by Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State to invite foreign mercenaries in the fight against terrorists was a further confirmation and admission of the failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration in which he is a key player.\n\nThe PDP maintained that El-Rufai could not distance himself from those fuelling and aiding insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, PDP said the alarming insecurity in Nigeria that had led to the killing and maiming of tens of thousands of Nigerians since APC took office in 2015, was the result of the actions and comments by APC leaders and government officials, who encouraged acts of terrorism in the name of politics.\n\n\n\nPDP said Nigerians could still recall how in July 2021, El-Rufai, when asked why the federal government was lethargic in going after bandits, stated that the terrorists were collections of independent criminals for whom banditry was a business.\n\n\u201cNigerians can also recall how ahead of the 2019 general election, Governor El-Rufai threatened that, \u2018those that are calling for anyone to come and intervene in Nigeria, we are waiting for the persons that will come and intervene, they will go back in body bags.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThe party said the media was also awash with reports of how governors of APC-controlled states, especially, in the North-west, publicly romanced and empowered terrorists by paying them billions of naira of public funds in various hurried, uncoordinated, and hazy negotiations.\n\n\n\nPDP stated, \u201cNigerians have not forgotten how in November 2020 the Muhammadu Buhari presidency, through its spokesperson, Shehu Garba, rationalised the beheading of 43 rice farmers in Borno State by terrorists and blamed the farmers for not obtaining clearance before going to their farms.\n\n\u201cSuch comments and actions by Governor El-Rufai, the Buhari presidency, and other APC leaders have the propensity to embolden terrorists to unleash violence on innocent people, the results of which are now apparent and living with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur party challenges Governor El-Rufai and other APC leaders to speak out on the confession by a former APC leader that the terrorists pillaging our nation were brought in by APC leaders to rig the 2019 general election, but had remained in the country following the failure by the APC to pay them for the heinous \u2018services\u2019 they were contracted to provide against the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\n\n\nPDP said El-Rufai should know that he and other APC leaders could not under any circumstance distance themselves from blame in the worsening insecurity, pain, horror, social dislocation of families, and life-discounting experiences being encountered daily by Nigerians under the APC.\n\nPDP told El-Rufai that his suggestion or threats to import foreign mercenaries was counter-productive and capable of compounding the already dire security situation in the country.\n\n\n\nThe opposition party said it believed in the competence and capability of the country\u2019s gallant armed forces to defend Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, adding that the security agencies are only encumbered by manifest complicity, conspiracy, incompetence, and failure of the security command and control coordination structure of the APC administration.\n\n\n\nSeven of 11 Coaches Re-railed to Safety, as 80 Metres of Affected Rail Track Repaired\n\nThe Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) said it had re-railed seven out of the 11 coaches of the Abuja-Kaduna AK9 train, which was bombed last Monday by terrorists between Rijana and Rigasa, in Kaduna State. NRC also disclosed that 80 metres of the affected rail tracks had been repaired.\n\nIn a statement by its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Fidet Okhiria, NRC confirmed that four coaches (SP 00004, SP00009, SP00012 and SP00013) out of the 11 involved in the incident had been re-railed and safely moved to Rigasa Station, while work was on-going on the track repairs.\n\n\n\nOkhiria stated, \u201cWe did also state that 170 of the passengers onboard the train are safe while 21 passengers are reported missing. At the end of today\u2019s evening work, (02/04/2022), the NRC\u2019s restoration team has further re-railed four more coaches and two of the coaches (SP 00007 and SP 00013) had been safely moved to Idu and Rigasa stations, respectively. The other two coaches are still at the site due to damaged tracks.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis brings the total coaches so far re-railed to seven, but only five successfully moved to the stations. However, efforts are on to linked the track, at the moment, a total of 80 meters of the affected section has been fixed, including replacement of affected sleepers and twisted rails.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe corporation also confirmed updates that a total of 172 passengers on board the AK9 are safe and okay while 21 passengers are still reported missing. Let us assure our esteem passengers that the corporation, in collaboration with the security agencies, will leave no stone unturned in our efforts at rescuing the missing persons.\u201d\n\nThe NRC boss condoled with those who lost their loved ones and prayed for the repose of the lost souls. He also sympathised with the injured passengers and everyone onboard for the trauma the unfortunate incident had caused.\n\n\n\nOkhiria expressed gratitude to the security agencies, particularly, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air force, Nigeria Police, and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, for their support and cooperation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Again, OPEC fails to meet planned oil production volume in March\n\n*Crude records highest weekly slump in over 10 years\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho\n\nThe federal government is targeting to add 800,000 barrels to Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production from some important upstream projects being executed by Shell, TotalEnergies, and other oil companies, which had stalled due to funding and other reasons. Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Gbenga Komolafe, disclosed this in Abuja at the 2022 Oloibiri Lecture Series and Energy Forum (OLEF) organised by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Nigeria.\n\n\n\nRepresented at the occasion by his Special Technical Adviser, Mr. Abel Nsa, Komolafe listed some of the projects government was relying on to boost production to include TotalEnergies\u2019 Preowei project, Shell\u2019s Bonga South-west Aparo, and Bonga North projects, as well as other projects being executed by other companies.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cSome of these projects, including the Preowei project, the Bonga South West Aparo project, the Bonga North project, and a host of others, when completed, all have the combined capacity to add upwards of 800,000 BOPD to Nigeria\u2019s production figures.\u201d\n\n\n\nPreowei is a deep-water hydrocarbon pool located north of the Egina field in the Oil Mining Lease (OML) 130, off Nigeria. Discovered in 2003, Preowei has a subsea tank with over 150 million barrels of oil and gas equivalent and is expected to pump about 50,000 barrels of oil per day at peak.\n\nThe field development plan entails a subsea tie back to the Egina field Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) facility\n\n\n\nFinal Investment Decision (FID) on Preowei was fixed for fourth quarter of 2020, but was stalled following the suspension of the project same year by TotalEnergies due to COVID-19 constraints, concerns around new fiscal provisions in Nigeria\u2019s oil sector, as well as the collapse of oil prices at the time.\n\n\n\nShell\u2019s Bonga South West FPSO, with the capacity to pump 150,000 barrels per day, is another project government is relying on to boost daily oil production by 800,000 barrels. Bonga South-west was planned to add around one billion barrels to Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves.\n\n\n\nHowever, in February, the contract for the development of the FPSO unit for Bonga South-west was delayed, as the tendering process was put on hold till 2024.\n\n\n\nBonga, Nigeria\u2019s first deep-water oil field, currently has the capacity to produce 225,000 b/d of crude oil and 150 MMcf/d of gas, which feeds the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) plant at Bonny.\n\nShell had previously said it would develop the Bonga South-west project across three phases with a total potential yield of 3.2 billion barrels.\n\n\n\nDeveloping the Bonga South-west would cost $10 billion, according to estimates by NNPC, the concessionaire of the field.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of Bonga South-west\u2019s resources are located in OML 118, but it also extends into OMLs 132 and 140, operated by US major Chevron, where it is called Aparo. Other partners in the project are France\u2019s TotalEnergies and Italy\u2019s Eni.\n\n\n\nNigeria has been grossly underperforming in oil production, with Africa\u2019s largest oil producer failing to meet its production quota by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) for many months running.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s 37 billion oil reserve, its production hovered abysmally low at 1.5 million per day, against the country\u2019s normal 2.2 million bpd capacity.\n\n\n\nThe poor production performance had been blamed on multiplicity of factors, including massive oil theft, non-starting of oil platforms, underinvestment, and divestment by the international oil companies (IOCs).\n\n\n\nKomolafe noted that with the commission now empowered by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the government could embark on the projects. To meet the increasing global energy demand, he said the federal government was set to embark on further exploration, adding that government also plans to embark on development drilling in its bid to optimise reservoir extraction.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe federal government is also ready to drill into new targets and employ technological advances to increase production outputs for appropriate energy mix,\u201d the NURPC boss stated.\n\nAgain, OPEC Fails to Meet Planned Oil Production Volume in March\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, failed to achieve their target crude oil production, despite the modest volume it was scheduled to release in March, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe oil producers\u2019 group only succeeded in adding 90,000 barrels per day of its planned additional 400,000 barrels per day, with only Saudi Arabia, and its neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, significantly increasing production during the month.\n\n\n\nMany other member nations, such as Nigeria, pumped well below quota mainly due to declining investment and operational disruptions, which had eroded their capacity for some time.\n\nOPEC had consistently rejected requests for an increase in production, even as the Russian invasion of Ukraine shook markets and boosted prices to $139 per barrel a few weeks ago. The group insisted that it will stick to the regime of careful increases in supply agreed last year.\n\n\n\nAlthough the cartel\u2019s operations data for each month, popularly called the Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), had yet to be released for April, covering activities for March, a secondary survey by Bloomberg revealed that the 13 members of OPEC produced an average of 28.6 million barrels per day during the month.\n\n\n\nThe figures are based on ship tracking data, information from officials and estimates from consultants, such as Rystad Energy AS and JBC Energy GmbH, which represent sources, other than those directly released by OPEC.\n\nAfter its meeting last week, the cartel raised Nigeria\u2019s production quota from April\u2019s 1.735 million barrels per day to 1.753 million barrels per day in May, even though the country has been struggling to meet lower production allocations.\n\n\n\nThe country has been constrained in meeting its OPEC quota for months, and as at the last production circle had as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to theft, ageing upstream infrastructure, and sabotage, as well as technical reasons.\n\n\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels per day output allowed by the oil producers, the country had managed to increase production to about 1.4 million bpd, the highest in recent times, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nFor Nigeria, while production challenges remain, the country\u2019s rig count was up by two in February, pushing it to eight from the initial six.\n\n\n\nAfter piling pressure on the cartel to increase supply for months without success, the United States and its allies have also decided to release at least 1 million barrels per day into the market to tame rising prices.\n\n\n\nThe Sanusi Barkindo-led group has, however, objected to the request to pump more oil, insisting that markets are not yet experiencing shortages and there is a balance between demand and supply at the moment.\n\nAccording to the group, whatever is happening in the market, like the Russia-Ukraine war, are extraneous to its activities.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, oil posted its biggest weekly loss in more than 10 years after the Joe Biden administration ordered an unprecedented release of US strategic reserves to tame rampaging prices.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate dropped one per cent early Saturday and over $14 this week, the most since 2011 as the US plans to release 1 million barrels a day for six months.\n\n\n\nMembers of the International Energy Agency (IEA) also agreed to release another round of crude stockpiles, with volumes to be decided later, although the US expects them to release an additional 30 million to 50 million barrels.\n\nBiden\u2019s decision follows rocketing gasoline prices in America and concerns about supply shortages following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The war has roiled global commodity markets and driven up the price of everything from fuels to food.\n\n\n\nIt has also led to tumultuous trading in oil, with massive intraday swings throughout March. WTI for May delivery fell $1.01 to settle at $99.27 a barrel while Brent for June settlement fell 32 cents to settle at $104.39 a barrel.\n\nThe U.S. already tapped its reserves twice in the past six months, but that has done little to cool prices.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration\u2019s giant oil release contrasts sharply with OPEC+, which on Thursday ratified a planned, modest production increase of about 430,000 barrels a day.\n\n\n\nContributing to the week\u2019s slide, also, were concerns about Chinese demand as the world\u2019s biggest oil importer implements a series of lockdowns to curb a resurgence of COVID-19.\n\nAdded to that, in spite of pressure from the European Union (EU) for Nigeria to ramp up its gas production, it has been unable to do so, as it neither has the funding nor the infrastructure. Russia produces up to 40 per cent of Europe\u2019s total gas consumption.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nIndigenes of Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu state, resident in Abuja have urged Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi to use his good office to address what they called the perennial marginalization of the area in the politics of the state.\n\n\n\nAddressing a press conference Sunday in Abuja, they called on the governor to, before leaving office, prevail on their neighboring Igbo-Etiti local government council to respect the zoning agreement reached in 1999 for the House of Representatives seat to rotate between Uzo-Uwani and Igbo-Etiti.\n\n\n\nThe President, Uzo-Uwani Professionals Association, UZPA, Ambassador Jonathan Eze said the political domination of his people in fragrant negligence of existing zoning agreement was no longer acceptable, noting that it has become necessary for the people to speak up, with the 2023 general election some few months away.\n\nAccording to him, Enugu zone since 1999 has continued to marginalize Nsukka axis, both in the production of governors as well as location of critical infrastructure.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cWe ask our governor, whom we know believes and serves God fervently, and who knows that there is a God of justice, to throw his considerable political weight behind Uzo-Uwani to produce the House of Reps member for Uzo-Uwani/Igbo Etiti Federal Constituency.\n\n\n\n\u201cEnugu state as it is today was created out of Anambra state in 1991. The old Anambra state had five zones delineated according to their population and considerations of constituency delimitation. The five zones were Onitsha, Awka, Nsukka, Enugu and Abakaliki. It was upon this five-zone configuration that the general elections of 1979 and 1983 were conducted in the then Anambra state. So, when in 1991, Enugu state was created out of Anambra state, Onitsha and Awka zones became the new Anambra state, while Nsukka, Enugu and Abakaliki zones became the new Enugu ztate.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 1996, Abakaliki zone of Enugu state was carved out to fuse with Afikpo zone of Abia state to become Ebonyi state. This left, in Enugu state, Nsukka zone and Enugu zone. It is to be noted that Nsukka zone in this configuration, had about 53 per cent of the population and over 60 per cent of the land mass.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is to be remembered that a son of Isi-Uzo Local Government, Chief Isaiah Ani was the Senator who represented Nsukka zone in the Senate between 1979 -1983. The logic of dragging Isi-Uzo into Enugu zone was confounding. In effect, Enugu zone became two Senatorial zones with five federal constituencies while Nsukka maintained its sole Senatorial zone with three federal constituencies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis subterfuge resulted that since the return of democracy in 1999, Enugu zone has produced two governors in Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani (1999-2007) and Mr. Sullivan Chime (2007-2015), both of whom did an unbroken 16 years at the helm as governors of Enugu state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reality of this is the preponderance of infrastructure and developments concentrated in Enugu zone. Federal and state infrastructure that should have been shared half and half alike is now, if ever, shared, two to one. Since the return of democracy in 1999, Enugu zone has produced all the Ministers from Enugu state. Even what is due to Nsukka zone is still forcibly yanked away and sited in Enugu zone.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn what appeared an attempt at justifying the people\u2019s call for Ugwuanyi\u2019s intervention, UZPA, argued that \u201ca campus of Enugu state University of Science and Technology, in compliance with the original intendment of a multi-Campus structure of the University at design, that was sited in Adada \u2013 Nkpologu, in Uzo-Uwani Local Government was forcefully yanked away and relocated to Agbani, in Nkanu West of Enugu zone. Apart from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, UNN, which Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe mercifully sited in Nsukka, no other federal presence of note is in Nsukka. And even at that, all the prime faculties and Departments of the University, Medicine, Medical Lab, Law, Business, Accounting, Estate Management, Architecture are all in Enugu, leaving Nsukka campus with only Arts and Education.\n\n\n\n\u201cNsukka does not have a single tertiary hospital to receive referrals from primary and secondary health facilities, resulting in avoidable deaths witnessed as the patient is being transported to Enugu. Although UNN is in Nsukka, but the university teaching hospital is in Ituku Ozara, in Nkanu, in Enugu zone. Psychiatric hospital, Orthopeadic hospital, Dental School is all in Enugu zone.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, from Nsukka zone who started in 2015 will complete eight years as governor in 2023. On the basis that Enugu zone did 16 years, we ask that Nsukka zone be allowed to complete its 16 years as governor. When we agree that Nsukka should have a shot at it for another eight years to balance the equation, we would then micro zone to peripheral local governments who have been grossly shortchanged in the political tapestry of Enugu state, local governments like Uzo-Uwani and Isi-Uzo, in that order. That is our position on that.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also justified UZPA\u2019s demand for a shot at the Uzo-Uwani/Igbo-Etiti federal constituency seat saying, \u201cSince 1999, when democracy returned, to 2023 when the term of the current occupant will expire, there are 24 years. Out of these 24 years, Igbo-Etiti has taken the position of member, House of Representatives for Uzo-Uwani/Igbo-Etiti Federal Constituency for 20 years. Uzo-Uwani has gone for a miserable four years. In percentage terms, Igbo-Etiti has done 83% of the time and Uzo Uwani, a mere 17%, for a position the two local governments are supposed to share 50 per cent apiece, despite a signed agreement to rotate the position between the two sisterly local governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, there should be no question as to which Local Government Area between Uzo-Uwani and Igbo-Etiti should be nominated to represent the constituency in the House in 2023. It is so obvious that what Igbo-Etiti is doing to Uzo-Uwani is a political overkill. But we hear that many of our Igbo-Etiti brothers and sisters, including the incumbent, who is from Igbo-Etiti and who has done two terms, are aspiring to return and for Igbo-Etiti to continue. Is that fair?,\u201d he asked.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "13 years, $10bn processed. How has Paga evolved over the years?",
          "text": "During a chat at the company\u2019s head office in Yaba, a suburb on Lagos Mainland once touted as Nigeria\u2019s Silicon Valley, CEO Tayo Oviosu recalls the epiphany moment that led to the founding of Paga back in April 2009.\n\nThe Stanford-educated Oviosu had just returned to the country he was born and raised in but left at age 16 and wanted to venture into the world of entrepreneurship.\n\nOpportunities in the private sector at the time were immense. Nigeria\u2019s central bank was pushing for a cashless economy but banks were slow to innovate. After considering several ideas for a couple of months, Oviosu came up with what is now Paga.\n\n\u201cBack then, a lot of transactions in Nigeria were largely cash-dependent which was inefficient for both businesses and individuals,\u201d he said. \u201cPaga was born out of my own frustration with carrying cash around. The idea was simple\u2014there had to be a way to make payments simpler.\u201d\n\nOviosu, aiming to build the \u201cPaypal for Africa\u201d, then teamed up with Jay Alabraba to launch a mobile payments company named Paga, a Spanish word that means \u201cto pay\u201d.\n\nPaga was arguably the first fintech company in Nigeria to popularise mobile money among the unbanked. At the time it was launched, the main players bridging payments with mobile technology in Nigeria were Interswitch, eTranzact, and SystemSpec\u2019s Remita.\n\nThirteen years on, Paga\u2014now a UK-headquartered Group\u2014has amassed more than 19 million unique users through its consumer channel and agent network of over 120,000 agents across Nigeria. Since the company began commercial operations in 2012, it\u2019s processed over $10 billion ( \u20a64 trillion).\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Oviosu reflects on Paga\u2019s evolution and growth and talks about product innovation, global expansion, and the next phase for both Paga and the fintech landscape in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nDigitising consumer payments\n\nOviosu\u2019s goal for Paga was to build a platform that simplified payments, digitised cash transactions, and delivered financial services to the mass market. He started with a team of 8, a figure that\u2019s grown to more than 100.\n\nPaga\u2019s initial set of products was focused on providing more people access to traditional banking services \u2013 especially sending and receiving money \u2013 through mobile phones and physical agents equipped with POS devices. At an agent outlet, customers show up without an account number and for a fee, are able to send and receive money to anyone.\n\nIn December 2019, after the introduction of national identity numbers (NIN) and bank verification numbers (BVN), Paga launched its consumer direct product that allowed users to create mobile accounts and used wallets for transactions through the mobile app and USSD.\n\nAccording to Oviosu, more than 3.7 million wallets have been created on Paga since then while the company plans to roll out physical and virtual cards later this year.\n\nA chart showing growth in Paga\u2019s TPV since its founded. Image credit: Paga.\n\nOver the years, Paga\u2019s total processed value (TPV) has grown exponentially. While it took the company 99 months to get to its first \u20a62 trillion, Oviosu revealed it took 22 months to reach the next \u20a62 trillion.\n\nIn 2021, Paga crossed the \u20a61 trillion mark in annual TPV for the first time\u2014hitting \u20a61.2 trillion\u2014and is on track to reach \u20a62 trillion this year alone, according to the CEO.\n\nAs part of its consumer payments play, Paga in February announced its addition as a payment provider for Twitter Tips, a feature that enables Twitter users to either send or receive by simply linking their preferred third-party payment service providers to their profiles.\n\nBeyond consumer payments, however, Paga is now a fintech behemoth helping merchants digitise payments (under a separate brand called Doroki) and opening up its infrastructure for third-party companies to easily offer financial services.\n\nPaga Group is a teenager today! What started out as a simple idea to make it simple to pay & get paid is now 3 business lines:\n\n\n\n\u2013 Consumer Payments \u2013 @paga\n\n\u2013 Embedded Finance \u2013 Paga PaaS https://t.co/AvGdBzElZ5\n\n\u2013 Seller/Merchant \u2013 @doroki_ng\n\n\n\nThanks to our amazing team \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/yC5Gv64kGm \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) April 3, 2022\n\nDoroki for merchants\n\nLast year, Paga launched Doroki, a separate unit within the Group that leverages Paga\u2019s payment infrastructure to help SMEs digitise payments.\n\nDoroki allows merchants to accept cards and other forms of digital payments via point-of-sale (POS) terminals and mobile POS handheld devices, making it easy for them to get paid and track inventory while enabling them to provide other value-added financial services to customers.\n\nWhile Covid-19 has increased the use of technology in payments and money transfers in Africa, the purchase and onboarding cost of POS devices is unaffordable for most merchants.\n\nPaga announced last year a partnership with Untapped Global to provide financing that would lower the cost of entry for merchants, with payments recovered from the revenues earned on the devices.\n\nAfter a successful pilot programme, which saw 2,000 businesses provided with financed POS devices, Oviosu revealed that more than 6,000 sellers currently now use Doroki to collect payments in the wake of the commercial launch last November.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to build an ecosystem for the consumer to conveniently make payments and for SMEs to manage their businesses and do payrolls,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nProduct infrastructure play\n\nFrom merely enabling Nigerians (individuals and businesses) to make and receive payments with ease, the Paga group now offers open-source APIs to companies for building products.\n\nPaga\u2019s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) business started with the acquisition of a remittance license in 2018, after which it allowed companies like Western Union and Wise to terminate remittances to accounts in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, Paga opened up its platform to more businesses through Collect APIs, which more than 200 businesses currently use.\n\nPaga\u2019s open wallet is available to any third-party developer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to compete with you building your wealth management app; we\u2019ll help you,\u201d the CEO said, adding that its recent integration with Flutterwave is built around the same APIs.\n\nThis wknd I experienced the power of Paga's Connect API \u2013 one-click payments \u2013 on @theflutterwave as I paid for my day 2 return covid test \ud83e\udd73\n\n\n\nI had previously linked my Paga acct to Flutterwave so going fwd it's super easy to pay on any website using Flutterwave!@TechProd_Arch pic.twitter.com/6WJkFOvAWa \u2014 Tayo Oviosu (@oviosu) January 24, 2022\n\nIn effect, Paga has extended beyond the payments business to becoming a product infrastructure company, which entails entering into partnerships with tech companies in similar and adjacent sectors.\n\nPaga\u2019s Nigeria approach\n\nPaga\u2019s go-to-market strategy in Nigeria has been a hybrid approach that combines offline and online channels. \u201cA majority of the population may not be tech-savvy and smartphone penetration is still low,\u201d Oviosu said.\n\nStarting out, Paga relied on a retail network of shops and agents that consumers can visit for in-person transactions. \u201cTo scale in Africa, you need a hybrid (digital and physical) approach. If you don\u2019t want or know how to use the technology, you can go to agents and still deal in [physical] cash, but the agent can do the digital.\u201d\n\nOviosu acknowledges that in Nigeria, physical cash is very much still a thing and won\u2019t go away anytime soon. Smartphone penetration has also not improved significantly. Hence, the company \u201cstill needs on ramps & off ramps to cash\u201d.\n\nAlthough the share of Paga\u2019s total transactions being done via agents has declined in recent years.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, agents accounted for about 90% of our transactions. Last year, that figure fell to 60%, an indication that other channels/parts of the business are growing fast.\u201d\n\nA Paga paypoint in Lagos. Image credit: Tayo Oviosu/Twitter.\n\nWhat next for Paga? Expansion\n\n\u201cThe vision is still the same\u2014to solve payments for individuals and businesses,\u201d Oviosu said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken an open approach. It\u2019s not a closed circle.\u201d\n\nOn what an \u201copen approach\u201d means, the CEO explained that with Paga, users can link their several bank accounts, debit cards, and mobile money wallets from other providers.\n\nIn addition, anybody\u2014including non-Paga account holders\u2014can pay a Doroki merchant. \u201cYou can walk into a store and pay with your card, scan a QR code, or make payments using USSD from any bank.\u201d\n\nWhile the vision has been steady, the ambition and scope of Paga have grown over time.\n\nAlongside product expansion, Paga has in its sight a global expansion starting with Ethiopia. In January 2020, it acquired Apposit, an Ethiopian software development company that is planned to be its vehicle for entry into East Africa and Latin America. Last month, Paga announced an official launch in the Horn of Africa country.\n\nBecause there are local nuances to be aware of, Paga has a local team of at least 50 in Ethiopia. The payments platform was also built to be multilingual, so switching from one language to another is easy.\n\nAs per funding the expansion plans, Oviosu revealed Paga, which has secured $35 million to date\u2014with the backing of investors such as Jim O\u2019Neill and Tim Draper\u2014is looking to raise additional capital.\n\nTayo Oviosu, Paga co-founder and CEO.\n\nFintech innovation in Africa\n\nOn the next phase of innovation in Africa\u2019s fintech space, Oviosu expects new startups to build more solutions on existing infrastructure provided by older players like Paga, Flutterwave, Paystack, etc. to solve key problems.\n\n\u201cThe first couple of years of Paga was building infrastructure where it didn\u2019t exist. We built a hybrid payment infrastructure for the online and offline customer,\u201d the CEO said.\n\n\u201cNew companies don\u2019t need to repeat that. I expect to see more of them focusing on niche markets that can scale, leveraging existing platforms through open-source APIs.\u201d\n\nAs for Paga, the vision remains the same: getting up to one billion people using its platform to access and use money, according to Oviosu.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peace Itimi: From Nigeria to the UK in search of peace",
          "text": "Peace Itimi has spent 9 months away from Nigeria but doesn\u2019t miss the country. She misses her cleaner and cook, though, because, in London, she doesn\u2019t have a cleaner and cook. But she at least has peace of mind.\n\nWhen Itimi started working remotely from Nigeria, she promised herself she would stay in Nigeria, until the Lekki toll gate killing\u2014where tens of #EndSARS protesters, who were protesting against police brutality, were killed\u2014scared her out of her wits. \u201cI felt unsafe,\u201d she recalled. It was then she started to reconsider her stance on immigration and realised money won\u2019t shield her from how unsafe Nigeria was increasingly becoming.\n\nA friend gave her the nudge to leave the country, recommending that she go through the Tech Nation Visa\u2014a visa that allows tech talent across the world to live and work in the UK\u2014because, he felt, she was a good fit. In 2021, she started researching the programme, and even though she felt the requirements were scary, she realised that everything she had done up until that point made her a perfect fit.\n\nFinding different loves\n\nItimi grew up in Benin City, Edo state, and studied medical biochemistry at Delta State University. She fell in love with digital marketing while in university. She said university had been one of the most definitive phases of her life because it was where she found God, found herself, and digital marketing.\n\nWhen she became a Google Student Ambassador, she started training other students in digital marketing in school. Fresh from school, she launched a digital marketing agency with a friend in 2016.\n\nShe moved to Lagos in February 2017 to begin her national service year at digital marketing agency, Webcoupers, and that was where she officially launched her career. In 2018, she joined Wild Fusion, another digital marketing agency, where she trained people on digital marketing, branding, Google Ads, and SEO. She, in that same year, also organised training on behalf of Facebook, Orange Academy, and the British Council.\n\nDuring one of her travels for digital marketing training in Accra, she realised that even though she loved travelling, her physical reach was limited. \u201cI can\u2019t train people in Accra except when I travel to Accra. So, I started thinking that a way to break that divide was to start training people online and that means I can reach anybody anywhere, so long as they can find my content.\u201d\n\nSo, Itimi started a YouTube channel in December 2018 where she initially shared marketing tips and random lessons about life, before launching a now-popular segment called Founders Connect, where she has interviewed about 40 African founders, including Odun Eweniyi of Piggyvest, Atsu Davoh of Bitsika, and Ezra Olubi of Paystack.\n\nIn 2019, she entered the Nigerian tech ecosystem after landing a role as the Head of Marketing at fintech company, Korapay, before moving to Venture Capital (VC) firm, Seedstars in 2020.\n\nFirst comes loneliness\n\nIn the first few months after Itimi arrived in the UK last June, she felt lonely. She had never been so far away from home before; the farthest she had travelled had been within the continent, to Cape Verde, in 2019.\n\nEverything was new to her in the UK. For example, the summer was warm yet she still felt cold. She couldn\u2019t see clearly and had migraines when she went outside without sunshades. It also took her a while to adjust to the predominant use of contactless payment in London.\n\nAs an introvert, making friends was initially difficult for her, even though she didn\u2019t face this difficulty back home. In Lagos, she was mildly popular so people started conversations with her at events. Now in the UK, she decided to become more intentional about making friends and connecting with people by starting conversations. When she sees someone on social media she wants to connect with, she reaches out and asks them to have a coffee or jump on an informal call with her. \u201cI am learning that a new environment and country requires an improved me. I have to do extra work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what this means for her is that she has to move past her introverted nature and social anxiety because to live the life she wants she must connect with people, build a network, and make impact in this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed, she made more friends when she joined a cycling community of about 20 other immigrants and her friends for whom she had reviewed the Tech Nation Visa applications joined her in the UK. On top of that, on the back of her YouTube video where she shared her experience with the visa application, at least 20 people have reached out to tell her they had got the visa.\n\nLondon, the good and the bad\n\nShe currently works remotely as Head of Growth for offline fintech app, Stax and admits that her productivity has increased since she moved. \u201cI don\u2019t apologise for bad internet anymore. I don\u2019t have to worry about electricity, either. I can afford to leave my laptop unplugged.\u201d\n\nItimi is excited about the travelling opportunities London presents; she feels more confident applying for visas for different countries now than she ever was in Nigeria. London has the most connected flights anywhere in the world and they are relatively cheaper.\n\n\u201cWhen I travelled to Kenya from London, in February, my flight cost less than a flight from Lagos to Kenya.\u201d\n\nOne thing Itimi likes about London is its diversity\u2014in people, food, and even the hobbies she can choose from. She is also in love with its efficient transport infrastructure: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exceed the time I estimate to get to my destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this exposure to working infrastructure and this level of diversity is doing something to my mind that I will be grateful for in a couple of years because of how I would have grown as a person.\u201d\n\nShe also loves the feeling of freedom in the city, which allows people to be themselves. \u201cFor instance, I feel like my confidence in the way I dress has increased a lot since I moved to London, compared to when I was in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t like the weather. During the winter, she rarely left her house, and when she did, her multiple layers of clothing didn\u2019t stop the cold from getting to her and the wind from threatening to blow her over. She looks forward to the summer, which she prefers.\n\nMaybe higher up on the list of things she doesn\u2019t like are taxes, because there are a lot of them. \u201cI feel like if I thought too much about my taxes I probably would not have moved when I did; I would have waited a bit longer to save more money in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Stax is levelling the playing field between USSD and bank apps",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax is a startup that takes banking with Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) from the phone dialler to an offline mobile application that gives offline banking a better user experience.\n\nPer Stax\u2019s blog, USSD has been around for 24-years and has mostly been used by telcos to facilitate communication with their customers. For example, telcos have a USSD code that usually starts with * and ends with # to check airtime balance or buy data.\n\nAccording to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), nine in 10 mobile money transactions in sub-Saharan Africa are done through USSD.\n\nInterestingly, the technology is the product of the GSM 02.90 document created by engineers at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), a body formed by the European Union in 1988 to harmonise and standardise communication technology in Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a 2018 Quartz Africa article, the document had a protocol designed to facilitate communication between telcos and their subscribers. However, telcos needed a protocol and initiated machine-to-machine communication where the subscriber\u2019s mobile phone would simply query the network and get a response instantly.\n\nOver the years, USSD has gone from aiding network and subscriber communication to being used for several other applications, including banking. Interestingly, the USSD protocol has not had any major upgrade since its introduction.\n\nHow is Stax using USSD differently?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax is harmonising USSDs and making them simpler to use. Instead, of dialling *123# and following the instructions to send money or buy airtime, Stax is bringing all the USSD codes under one roof.\n\nIt is doing this with a USSD app that automates transactions and saves you the hassle of remembering codes and putting data in dialogue boxes as fast as possible, so you don\u2019t get an error message.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Stax Co-founder and CEO, Ben Lyon, explained that the startup is trying to make USSD better and \u201cfind a way to give smartphone users a way to leverage the best parts of USSD.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lyon, the best part of USSD is that it works offline; its bad part, however, is that it has an awful user experience.\n\nUSSD works with a smartphone or basic feature phone\u2019s dialler. For example, to complete a bank transaction, you dial the bank\u2019s USSD code and follow the instructions in the pop-up\u2019s interactive menus.\n\nThese menus are timed, so inputting data such as an account number or personal identification number (PIN) has to be done swiftly, or you\u2019ll get an error message and start again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere has never been significant innovation around USSD because the Internet took its place in developed nations. A high level of Internet penetration and the rapid development of smartphones and computers made USSD redundant.\n\nInternet penetration in Africa, on the other hand, is slow. In 2000, Internet penetration among adults in the US was 52%, significantly higher than Africa\u2019s 0.5%.\n\nWhile developed countries did not need USSD, it was important to Africa, and it moved from being a way for telcos to communicate with customers to a major tool for financial inclusion.\n\nUsing USSD seamlessly on smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Lyon, Ceo, Stax\n\n\u201cIs there a way we can screenscrape USSD?\u201d That was the question that set the pattern for what Stax is doing today \u2014 navigating USSD menus on behalf of end-users in the background of an Android application.\n\nAccording to Lyon, the startup started out by selling the solution to other developers under the company name Hover, Stax\u2019s parent company. However, the business model did not generate the anticipated revenue, and Stax was created in 2020 as a consumer-facing version of Hover.\n\nLyon described Stax as an online payment super app for Africa that brings together all USSD based services in one place.\n\nHow does Stax work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStax website\n\nTypically, when USSD is accessed through a phone dialler, you can get a session error if you do not type fast enough. What Stax does is run the USSD in the background and reduce the USSD menus to fewer taps within the app.\n\nThe Stax app works almost like any bank app, but offline. Unlike bank apps, it requires less information which makes setting it up straightforward. It, however, requires permission to manage phone calls and read messages.\n\nThe setup process is completed by selecting your bank(s). Sending money with Stax can be completed in a few taps by selecting the sending and receiving banks and the amount to transfer.\n\nIt becomes evident that the app is running a USSD protocol when it asks which SIM card you\u2019d like to complete the process with. Besides that, the process is just as seamless as using an online bank app.\n\n\u201cI compare USSD to the early Internet,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cIt is like asking people to interact with the web without a browser, going to IP addresses directly instead of websites.\u201d\n\nWith Stax improving the USSD user experience on smartphones, its market is limited to just smartphone users, but according to Lyon, this is still a huge number.\n\nWhile one might assume that smartphone users will typically prefer to perform transactions over the Internet rather than USSD, data by GSMA reveals that although smartphones outnumber feature phones in sub-SaharanSaharan Africa, USSD remains the most popular form of banking.\n\nIn 2019, there were one billion mobile money accounts in sub-Saharan Africa, and over $1.9 billion was processed daily.\n\nHow Stax makes money\n\nFree to use, Stax only takes a USSD telco session charge. It, therefore, becomes difficult to see how the company makes money from its solution.\n\nRevealing Stax\u2019s revenue generation model, Lyon said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to start monetising in Kenya in the next few weeks. We\u2019re going to charge fees and commissions to businesses that sell to our users. So, when you buy airtime in Stax, we\u2019ll get a little commission from the seller.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, he said telcos work with dealers and distributors that buy wholesale airtime rates and sell to the subscribers. Stax\u2019s plan is to partner with these distributors and steer traffic to them while they get a cut.\n\nAlthough Stax has a monetisation plan, its feasibility can only be proven when it starts. The startup recently got a $2.2 million seed funding led by World Within Ventures and Noemis Ventures in March 2022, which Lyon said has been instrumental in growing the business.\n\nStax\u2019s plan goes beyond making existing services available via USSD better; it wants to make crypto services, among others, accessible through USSD.\n\nWill a 24-year-old technology continue to dominate in Africa? Only time will tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover. Twitter\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHola,\n\nIt\u2019s the start of a new work week, and I\u2019m meant to say something funny or uplifting here, but I have nothing. I\u2019ve got something else, though. Spoiler alert: It\u2019s about Twitter.\n\nSo, you know how you can co-author a post on Instagram with another user, Twitter says it\u2019s testing this feature, but you\u2019ll only be able to invite public accounts who follow you to co-author a tweet, and they\u2019ll have to accept your invitation.\n\nThere\u2019s no \u201cdue date\u201d yet, but like so many other beta features, we may or may not get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Today\u2019s Digest, we\u2019ll be discussing three very different stories:\n\nFantasy football in Africa\n\nMTN\u2019s contribution to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue, and\n\nWhat the Web3 is\n\nBetting on fantasy football in Africa\n\nAt the beginning of every football season, every person I know interested in the English Premier League \u2014 the biggest football league in the world (argue with your keypads) \u2014 starts talking about which players they\u2019re buying and what fantasy league they are joining.\n\nEven though I\u2019ve been a football fan for the last 13 years, I\u2019ve never understood the craze behind fantasy football. So imagine my surprise when I heard African football fantasy startup, Eksab had raised $3million in funding on Monday, March 28, 2022.\n\nWhat\u2019s fantasy football, though? So, think of this as your average football league, complete with players, coaches, and everything that makes up the entire production, but this time, you\u2019re the coach, and you choose your players yourself. Each match week, you get points based on how your players perform. At the end of the season, the person with the highest points gets a prize.\n\nIt\u2019s a big deal in places like Europe and Asia, not so much in Africa. On the African continent, betting companies rule the roost, and you\u2019d often find football fans \u2014 this tag is arguable, in my opinion \u2014 placing bets on how teams play.\n\nBut what does a fantasy football startup raising money mean for the \u201cecosystem\u201d? How would this play out considering the dominance of betting companies in Africa? Chimgozirim and Bolu made some interesting findings, which they shared here: Fantasy sports in Africa: Can $3m funding make it popular?\n\nMTN\u2019s lion share taxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s go down a different path: On Saturday, April 2, 2022, news of telecom company, MTN\u2019s 13.5% contribution to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue hit the papers \u2014 or in most cases, screens.\n\nAccording to MTN, it paid \u20a6757 billion in taxes to all Nigerian government agencies in 2021 and \u20a6618.7 billion to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The company was also named the most tax-compliant company in Nigeria. An interesting u-turn from 2018 when the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, accused MTN of owing $2billion in taxes. This was eventually resolved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContributing 13.5% of the total taxes paid to the FIRS in a tax year is no mean feat and got our spidey senses tingling. So, Emmanuel and I decided to do a little calculation.\n\nThe FIRS says it collected \u20a66.4 trillion in taxes in 2021. After our calculations, it amounts to approximately 10%, instead of 13.5%; still not a bad number if you ask me. Interestingly, according to Premium Times, the tax collecting body refused to comment on the actual percentage.\n\nApart from this, however, is one crucial fact: MTN contributes double-digit percentages to Nigeria\u2019s tax revenue. The implications of this are myriad. For one, this basically seals the telecoms giant\u2019s status in Nigeria. It could also mean that MTN leaving the country might have some interesting consequences.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to unpack here, and it should make for an interesting read.\n\nMaking sense of the Web3 buzz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably heard or seen the words \u2014 or abbreviations \u2014 Web3, NFTs, LFG, WAGMI and wondered what the evangelists were on about.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the \u201csimplest\u201d, Web3. It is said to be the next version of the Internet, which will focus on decentralisation and user ownership. So, unlike the current dispensation \u2014 Web2 \u2014 where many platforms are owned and regulated by one central entity, individuals in Web3 have more say in how their data or actions are controlled.\n\nTake Twitter, for example. Instead of having rules and regulations being set by the microblogging site, users can put possible policies to a vote and decide how they want to be regulated, kind of like democracy, but not.\n\nIn the last few months, Bolu has covered quite a bit on the space and, in a natural progression of events, hosted a Techpoint Twitter Spaces on Friday, April 1, 2022. We spoke to Chika Uwazie, Founder of Afropolitan; Erikan Obotetukudo, Founder of Audacity; and Clement Ugbo, Founder of Crevatal, to make sense of the Web3 buzz.\n\nHave a listen or if you want a read, you can check out this explainer: Web3: The Internet evolution to come in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechpoint stories for you\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nSpent the weekend in the company of The Black Power Mixtape.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nStakeholders in the Niger Delta Region in Nigeria have expressed optimism that with continuous engagement with critical government agencies the region will be able to overcome the inherent challenges that have deviled the area and the country at large in the past due to corruption.\n\nIt is no more a secret that one of the issues that is on the front burner at every discourse when the dwindling fortune of Nigeria, especially the oil rich region is being articulated is corruption amongst the government agencies and politicians in the corridor of power.\n\nAt the center of this colossal waste of the nation\u2019s wealth is the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, and the six oil producing states of Edo, Abia, Delta, Imo, Rivers and Ondo state and the National Assembly where the elected members take care of their own interest more than their constituents\n\nTo address reforms and issues of transparency and accountability in NDDC and the oil producing states as well as promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms the Africa Network for Environment Justice, ANEEJ held the Enhancing Anti-corruption and social inclusive reform initiatives in Nigeria project inception meeting at Abuja recently with stakeholders in attendance\n\nIn the words of the facilitator, Rev David Ugolor, Executive Director of ANEEJ, this important project seeks to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms at both the national and sub-national levels as well as designed to enhance local civil society organizations ability to be positive and responsible change agents in Nigeria\n\nHe said, \u201cEnhancing Anti-Corruption and Social inclusive Reforms initiatives in Nigeria is designed following the anchor cluster model adopted by Palladium to promote and engage in anti-corruption policy reforms. ANEEJ is the anchor for the Anti-Corruption cluster under the SCALE project working with eight cluster organizations across six states and Abuja.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Palladium has adopted the cluster approach to identify possible areas of networking, advocacy, lobbying, civic engagement and policy dialogue and we are building that collective action that will put pressure on those institutions that need reforms and at the same time when those institutions are established, there is need for implementation and for implementation to happen there is the need for some level of public awareness.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the approaches we are going to be adopting and where the reforms is working we would like to scale it up by using the passivity impact and bringing the result to bear in our advocacy work,\u201d he added\n\nOn the issue of lack of accountability and transparency, he noted that it has been governance challenge, stressing, \u201cit is not just in the PADECS, oil and Gas commission alone because there have been reports and assessments that have shown that 13 percent oil money going to all the oil producing states are not properly managed well because of lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n\u201cThere are research that have now demonstrated that when there is absence of transparency the tendency is to have accountability impaired. Our message through this project is that we want to work with government agencies to see how the oil and gas commission established to manage this 13 percent are properly run and then they are able to achieve their goal so that people\u2019s livelihood will improve and there will be transparency and accountability in programmes they carry out.\n\n\u201cWhen that is done, there will obviously be developments happening in the region and this conflict and crises we are seeing engulfing the entire region will reduce dramatically,\u201d Rev. Ugolor added.\n\nHe further disclosed that ANEEJ has the history of working in the region in the past 20 years, and has developed governance index which is systemizing where there are possible improvement and opportunity to engage in those selected states which are just pilot states and when it is successful it would be scaled to the entire region and eventually impact across the country.\n\nWhile expressing profound gratitude to USAID through Palladium for providing ANEEJ cluster the grant to undertake this very important project as a very critical time of the nation\u2019s democratic match, Rev Ugolor added that \u201cOur cluster will also advocate for the mainstreaming of anti- corruption issues into the country\u2019s upcoming 2023 general elections discourse.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the inception meeting provided the platform for the stakeholders who lauded the initiative of ANEEJ the opportunity to buy in to the project because of its timeliness to curb the huge deficit being experienced in the region which has translated to infrastructural decay and wanton profligacy by some Nigerians who fed fat at the expense of the tax payers.\n\nIn the past, ANEEJ was known for coming from the confrontational background, throwing stones. The Civil Society Organizations and Nigerians are quite aware of some of the actions taken, such as demanding the sack of Alison Madueke as the Minister for Petroleum, and other battles against corruption\n\nBut a time came, according to the Deputy Director of ANEEJ, Leo Atakpu that they now have to adopt what works in other climes apart from the stone throwing approach even though it is also helpful. They had to use a method which will deliver a better result and they arrived at the conclusion that collaborating with other stakeholders using global initiatives together, like the open government partnership that bring all stakeholders together on the table to procreate policies and drive the implementation with them has been found to be very useful in delivering results.\n\nAn Assistant Director of Community and Rural Development in the NDDC, Mrs. Ebi Ake who was delighted to be invited for the meeting said the commission is predisposed to the agenda of the meeting and more inclined to the social inclusiveness that will bring about the much needed reforms in the region.\n\nWhile pouring encomiums on ANEEJ, the NDDC Assistant Director noted that the commission will be ready to continue the engagement because of its commitment to whatever will bring succor to the region\n\nShe was explicit in her choice of words, when she said that with such engagement a lot would be achieved at the National Assembly where critical decisions concerning the region are being taken by the representatives of the people.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate what ANEEJ is doing, we are here because we want to further the engagement in whatever that will bring succor to the region and create a sense of responsibility amongst institutions and partnering with persons that have good intentions for Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cWe know what we have been going through as a region, because of the way things are, we are looking at and ensuring that the NDDC constitutional review, the act that set it up need to be looked at again and see how we can meet up with international best practices in service delivery. Having to associate with ANEEJ we know that we would be able to achieve that at the National Assembly,\u201d she enthused.\n\nIn the same vein, a key stakeholder in the NDDC and a Civil Society Organization activist, Patterson Ogon who expressed optimism that the result of the project will be positive, advised that all hands must be on deck to improve the lives of the people in the region.\n\n\u201cWe commend ANEEJ for what they are doing and we want more stakeholders and development partners to key in to what ANEEJ is doing because it is a collective enterprise. We are certain it is going to be positive at the end of the day to translate to a better livelihood for the people.\n\nAlso, a representative of the chairman of Delta State Oil and Gas Producing Areas Communities, DESOGPADEC, Mr. Bayo Iyalaju commended ANEEJ for such a platform to discuss about corruption and he assured that the commission will be ready to Partner on this project to deal with corruption.\n\nOn behalf of the cluster members, Mrs. Onose Matha appreciated ANEEJ for working with the cluster organizations on the anti-corruption project noting that they are very anxious to see what is in the package for them in the next two years that the project will last.\n\nThe representative of Mr. Sulayman Dawodu, Executive Secretary of Criminal Justice Monitoring Committee, Joshua Dada disclosed that they have a good working relationship with ANEEJ Executive Director, Rev David Ugolor, adding that they are looking forward to working at the legislative reform of the project.\n\n\u201cWe supervise criminal justice in Nigeria with particular interest in anti-corruption that has been the path we have thread with ANEEJ\n\nThe interactive session was in-depth as Civil Society Organizations represented made indelible inputs during the meeting. For instance, Comrade Taiwo from Publish what you pay, observed that the theory of change presented by Deputy Director of ANEEJ, Leo Atakpu captured the inclusiveness of the project and Ismail Opeyemi from 24 Century advised on the intentional involvement of youths who are critical stakeholders.\n\nIn the words of Anne Bisi Ojugo, representing Joint Association of persons with Disability, JONAPWD, the persons with disability have never had it so good because they are always been carried along by ANEEJ.\n\n\u201cWe thank ANEEJ for including the people with disability in this project, we have never had it so good. A forum like this to build the capacity of people with disability is commendable,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe project has developed six indicators that will assist ANEEJ measure results achieved and this will be centered on three objective of the project, which are capacity building, advocacy engagement and public awareness activities.\n\nAccording to Sandra Eguagie, the second indicator to be measured in this project is the total number of anti-corruption commitment and oil commission mandate and policy documents reviewed. There will be a number of researches that will be done in line with the commitment of the OGP and the London anti- corruption commitment and other policy that will be used to review the PADECS.\n\n\u201cWe want to know the number of commitments that will be secured through the review of this Project and We are going to be measuring it by the time we are doing our presentation. Secondly, We are not only going to be looking at the number of documents reviewed, we are going to be looking at the number of laws that will be passed because we have some pending bills before the National Assembly,\u201d she added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Saving public tertiary education in Nigeria",
          "text": "For several years now, the public tertiary education space in Nigeria has been afflicted by a rash of industrial actions arising from the displeasure of academics and other stakeholders in the system over the inability of government to honour collective bargaining agreements and give a jolt of life to the sector.\n\nThe latest experience of this disruption in the academic calendar of public tertiary institutions began in February when the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities, ASUU resumed its warning strike action that it had earlier suspended.\n\nPut I perspective, the latest action by ASUU has been seen in most quarters as one that was seriously avoidable given that the academics and the government had reached a compromise of sorts after the last bout of strike which had resulted in an agreement that many hoped would have been the beginning of a conclusive resolution of the recurring disputes. What was then needed was to implement the outcome of that compromise which the academics now insist has not been done. And for the better part of seven weeks, the institutions have in the immediate, remained cold rooms for study purposes.\n\nBeyond the immediate, the net outcome of this rash of strike actions then has been the stultification of academic activities and massive frustration for students and parents.\n\nBeyond these also are the collateral damages that have come into the mix. They include the challenge of securing enduring quality for the system in a world where tertiary education is evidently a universal engagement where global best practices are the norm. There is also the issue of the continuing migration of many students who ordinarily should be receiving their tertiary education in-country but who have been forced by factors, including the instability in the educational calendar, to seek admission and study opportunities outside the country.\n\nThere is also the sheer range of economic losses that the country suffers on account of the large numbers of Nigerians that are forced to go abroad to study. As CBN records would readily confirm, this is a major source of pressure on the nations foreign exchange position as the volume of dollars being sought by the Nigerians studying abroad continues to soar.\n\nEven more worrisome is the fact that government tends to be lackadaisical, unconcerned and indifferent about taking prompt and serious action to address the entire situation. When the strike first broke in the current dispensation, the attitude of government officials was to feign ignorance of the action. When they finally stepped in to presumably address it, the focus has been on trying to intellectually shoot down the positions being canvassed by the striking lecturers as if this is a lecture room debate. There is no sense of urgency; no show of empathy, compassion and consideration for hurting students, distraught parents and a continually hemorrhaging nation.\n\nIn the past there have been several suggestions, including one that public office holders be forced to compulsorily educate their children and wards within the countrys public tertiary educational system. While this has been shot down at the National Assembly the fact remains that there is still a large dose of indifference of public sector personnel to the plight of Nigerians who work in and are supposed to derive benefits from the system.\n\nOn their part, lecturers and students have been criticised for not being realistic in their opposition to raising fees in the system as a way of increasing funding. But even this point is neither here nor there as specific proposals and cushioning effects in this regard first have to be put on the table by those promoting them. For example, rather than simply ask students and their parents to just go and find any fees that are presumably denominated as market-efficient rates, can proper steps be taken to ensure that even as those adjustments are being proposed, there are also corollary proposals to address the question of a revamped Students Loans Board that would undertake to ensure that those who bring evidence of an inability to pay the revamped fees get to secure low interest loans to fund their studies.\n\nThis newspaper reminds government that it is its responsibility to get the system to work and therefore calls for everything to be done within the next two weeks towards ensuring that the schools are opened once again for full and uninterrupted studies.",

          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nIf not properly handled the proposed reopening of Lekki Toll gate may prove a sticky one for the administration of Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos State.\n\nLast Friday, Abiodun Alabi, commissioner of police in the state warned citizens planning to converge at the Toll gate to protest to shelve the idea, saying much as they have rights to protest, the state Police Command will not take kindly to attempts to infringe on the rights of others in the name of protest.\n\nThis subtle sabre rattling on the part of the police command in the state comes amidst meetings with stakeholders by the Lagos officials, where majority of speakers voiced their opposition to reopening, even as the representatives of Lagos State pleaded for understanding. The spectre of trouble hovers, and crisis looms over the polar views held on the matter by the government and the people.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 2020, as #Endsaars protests which started as ripples of discontent against police brutality \u2013 especially its special branch responsible for robbery \u2013 raged across the country, rapping the knuckles of Nigeria\u2019s state actors lost sleep and became jittery. Then, wave after wave of soft pressure on the protesters, which included the deployment of street urchins to scuttle the protests failed to make their mark, before force was deployed.\n\nOn the night of October 20, 2020, while young Nigerian protesters sat at the Lekki Toll Gate, wrapped in the national flag and singing the national anthem, a hail of bullets cut loose from guns procured with their taxes, felling about 11 of them in the process while leaving others with horrific injuries. About a year later,\n\nresponsibility for the bloodbath, which effectively ended the protest was placed at the doorstep of the Nigerian police and the Nigerian army.\n\nIn scorching findings penned by the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led judicial panel of inquiry set up by the Lagos State Government to investigate the disturbances, the killings were poignantly described as a massacre. But that was not before the Lekki Concession Company, operators of the Lekki Toll Gate, where the killings happened, was indicted.\n\nThe panel was unequivocal and unsparing in its findings that the company lent a leprous hand to those who carried out the massacre.\n\nRecently, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso, announced plans by the Lagos State Government to open the Lekki Toll Gate closed for over 18 months since the massacre. Pegging the planned opening for April 1, 2022, Omotoso said operators of the facility had huge debts to pay.\n\nOmotoso puts the debts at N11.6 billion to local lenders and about $31.1 million to foreign lenders. He also announced that about 500 workers with families to feed had been affected by the closure. But Omotoso said nothing about the blood debts owed by the Lekki Concession Company for its complicity in the killing of October 20, 2020. This, Omotoso, conveniently glossed over.\n\n\u201cFor money, reopening Lekki Toll gate without the state paying adequate compensations to victims and publicly apologizing is not the path to go\u201d, said Professor Adeagbo Moritiwon, a political scientist.\n\nHe told this newspaper that reopening \u201cought to be the last on the menu.\n\n\u201cThe first is to come clean by accepting responsibility for what happened, and paying adequate compensation, then the state can call a meeting of stakeholders to negotiate and haggle on how to reopen.\u201d\n\nBen Adamson, a lawyer told Business Hallmark that \u201cI think this administration should have shown more sensitivity and compassion, placing profits above every other thing is not the best. We are talking about the feeling of Nigerians, their psyche was assaulted at the same Lekki, and we are yet to resolve this, only for the government to be talking of reopening the toll gate.\u201d\n\nIn the past one week, the Lagos State Government has been intensifying its plea to the people of the state, especially residents of Lekki and Ikoyi, to show understanding ahead of the proposed reopening of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge toll plaza by the Lekki Concession Company Limited.\n\nAccording to a statement on Wednesday, the Lagos State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso; Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederick Oladehinde and Commissioner for Home Affairs, Anofiu Elegushi, disclosed this during a stakeholders meeting held in Lagos.\n\nOmotoso and his counterparts assured the residents that the government will look into all the requests and recommendations made by the stakeholders which included the President of Lekki Estates Residents and Stakeholders Association, Olorogun James Emadoye; human rights activists, the media and several other residents of Lekki and respond appropriately.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are here to seek your understanding as a government about the matter at hand. We are also citizens of Nigeria. We are all Lagosians. I have listened to all of you talking about our rights, privileges and how government should be responsible for everything. I also feel that as citizens, we should have some responsibilities.\n\n\u201cLagos is a city of about 25 million people and out of the 25 million people there are about six million taxpayers and among six million taxpayers, only 4.2 million are active taxpayers.\n\n\u201cSo, let us reflect on all these things. I know how people feel and I understand what has been said but I believe that the matter at hand is about seeking your understanding. It is a matter of showing some compassion for people who have one thing or another to do with this company.\u201d\n\nOladehinde explained the decision of the government to re-open the toll plaza was not to punish people but to create an enabling environment for more jobs through private sector participation.\n\n\u201cWhat Lagos State is trying to do is to create an enabling environment to create more jobs and when you create more jobs. We should not be shortsighted. The only way to create jobs is to create an environment where we can attract the private sector to build more infrastructure in the state. Let us look at the issue from the view that we are trying to resuscitate the economy of Lagos State,\u201d he said.\n\nElegushi, said the purpose of the stakeholders meeting was to engage key stakeholders on the matter of reopening the toll plaza and appealed for cooperation from the people to work together with the government.\n\nThe Managing Director of LCC, Mr Yomi Omomuwasan, on his own hinted on the necessity for the resumption of operations so as not to continue to default on its payment of local and international loans as well as to cater for the welfare of its workers.\n\nLCC has also introduced new technology and innovations to make movement at the toll plaza seamless and faster for commuters.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians of all hue had asked the Lagos State government to halt the April 1 planned reopening of tolling of the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge by the Lekki Concession Company Limited, LCC. This comes as appeal from Lagos State government calling for understanding on the side of the people mounts.\n\nHowever, the residents said they want the reopening halted based on the harsh economic situation in the country. They said the tolling would aggravate their hardship. Some Nigerians also took to social media to demand justice for people killed and injured at Lekki Toll Gate during the #EndSars protest.",

          "title": "Soaring diesel cost forces companies to adopt gas power",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nNigerian manufacturers have started investing in alternative energy to tackle the challenge of poor electricity supply in the country, Business Hallmark findings have revealed.\n\nIt would be recalled that the power situation in the country had worsened towards the end of 2021 when the prices of crude oil soared above the $100 mark.\n\nThe resultant surge in crude prices pushed the cost of diesel, used by most manufacturers to power their generators, to over N400 per litre.\n\nThe situation further worsened in February 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine. The imposition of sanctions on Russia, a major crude oil producer, by the United States and Western European countries, especially members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), disrupted fuel supply, sending oil prices to 13 years high of $130.\n\nThe effect spilled over to Nigeria, with cost of energy, particularly diesel hitting the roof. While manufacturers were still managing the situation, the already poor electricity supply deteriorated, with Nigerians going on for work weeks without power, as the national power grid collapsed twice in a week..\n\nNot surprisingly, the triple effects of rising crude oil, poor power supply and naira losing value, further pushed up the price of diesel.\n\nAs at Saturday, April 2, 2022, a litre of diesel sold for an average N800 across the country. In Lagos, filling stations that had the commodity were selling from N690 to N730, depending on the marketers location, while in some states the commodity sold for as high as N900.\n\nSome of the manufacturers who spoke with our correspondent in Lagos, said the high cost of diesel has driven up the cost of production. The situation, they complained, is impacting on prices of commodities and profitability.\n\nA manufacturer who operates a PVC plant Ikeja, Lagos, Segun Cardoso, described the development as antithetical to economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe situation calls for urgent attention. We wouldn\u2019t be in this mess if the government is living up to expectations. But no, the government is in a slumber.\n\n\u201cNo electricity, no diesel. And when it is available, the price is out of reach of many. At the beginning of this year, we were buying fuel of about N32million to power our plants.\n\n\u201cAs at March 31st, the amount rose to N57million. The most annoying part is that we can\u2019t increase the price of our products. As it it, people are no longer buying.\n\n\u201cSince we can\u2019t just be producing without finding buyers, I have to shut down two of the three production lines, hoping that the storm will soon pass over\u201d, Cardoso lamented.\n\nMeanwhile, most manufacturers, BH learnt, have started investing in alternative energy, epecially power plants, in their bid to overcome the power challenges in the country.\n\nThe Managing Director of Derox Industries Nigeria, a packaging company based in Oregun, Lagos, Stephen Elega, told our correspondent that his firm is in partnership with a power firm to help build a 2MW gas-powered plant.\n\n\u201cWe hope that when the plant became operational, it will solve our power challenges and boost production and help us to expand\u201d, declared Elega.\n\nA 1MW gas-powered plant, some energy experts who spoke with our correspondent said, will cost between $1.5million to $2million, thereby pushing it out of the reach of small business owners.\n\nBut in an effort to get around the problem, small and medium scale manufacturers are coming together to pull resources together to be able to get their own plant.\n\nThe Group Managing Director (GMD) of Lubcon Lubricant Manufacturing and Blending Company based in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, Adesoji Fagbemi, lamented that poor electricity supply has impacted negatively on his company.\n\nThere is electricity power challenge affecting the manufacturing industry in the country. The capacity of electric power being generated is not adequate. We share power among other sectors of the economy. It is even so difficult to achieve eight hours of supply daily.\n\nWe spent more than N93 million in a quarter on diesel because we run several manufacturing points. We had to purchase a 1,000KVA generator. We also expended about N157 million on 33KVA dedicated line to get 23 hours power supply by co-opting other neighbouring companies just to cope with the huge expenses. Thus, profitability is affected.\n\n\u201cWe are going the cooperative route again. We recently signed a Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with a consortia of firms on gas production in the Ajaokuta gas park.\n\nThe deal is expected to boost trade and investment, especially among Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in and around the state,\u201d Fagbemi noted.\n\nMeanwhile, stakeholders in the country have warned that the rise in inflation would be driven by a higher cost of production for manufacturers who depend largely on diesel.\n\nA development economist, Aliyu Ilias, said the increase in the price of diesel would contribute to inflation.\n\n\u201cDiesel is used by industries and big vehicles, such as those that convey goods. With the price increase, there would be a multiplier effect on the cost of products in Nigeria.\n\nThis is a similar case in the aviation sector. When the cost of aviation fuel increased, there was an increase in the cost of air tickets.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to refine locally. There is no alternative to diesel. Many industries rely on diesel to power their generators,\u201d Ilias advised.\n\nAlso, the Chairman, Infrastructure Committee of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Ibrahim Usman, said the rise in inflation would be driven by a higher cost of production for manufacturers who depend largely on diesel for production.\n\n\u201cThe rise in the price of diesel means higher production cost for manufacturers because most of us rely on diesel to produce. So when the cost of production is high, then manufactured products will be sold at a higher price; this is to enable the manufacturers to make a profit after sale and stay afloat.\n\n\u201cSo, basically it will increase the inflation in the country which is already high, further compounding the problems and plight of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTo avoid these things from happening, the government should make sure that it creates a situation whereby the cost of electricity is reduced for manufacturers and that power supply is accessible to producers,\u201d the MAN boss stated.\n\nIn the same vein, the President, Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), John Udeagbala, said the rising prices of petroleum products, particularly diesel and aviation fuel, is worrisome.\n\n\u201cThe implications of this situation for the Nigerian economy are far-reaching; the use of these petroleum products are entrenched in the production and transportation processes of both the public and private sectors.\n\n\u201cAs the private sector adjusts to the current realities, we expect that unless drastic policy actions are taken, the rising prices of petroleum products combined with the issues of the national electricity grid will bring about increasing inflation, further erosion of the purchasing power of the populace, and the redistribution of wealth that plunges more of the population below the poverty line.\n\n\u201cAs such, we use this opportunity to stress once again our call for incisive policy implementation within the energy sector to limit our economy\u2019s exposure to global shocks and serve as a springboard for sustained economic growth,\u201d the NACCIMA boss advised.\n\nAlso speaking, the Director-General of MAN, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, said the impact of the energy crises has led to a plunge in the capacity utilisation of manufacturers.\n\n\u201cThe rising price of Automotive Gas Fuel (AGO) otherwise known as diesel is very worrisome as it is negatively impacting on businesses especially the manufacturing sector of the economy.\n\n\u201cThere is a rise in price due to the increase in price of crude oil in the international market which has gone above $110 per barrel.\n\n\u201cKnowing also that diesel has been deregulated removes the question for a buffer to the cost. The law of demand and supply is at play here, and since we have historically lacked local refining capability, we are left at the mercy of the vagaries of international price and the geopolitics of it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, manufacturers who largely rely on diesel to run their factory, due to unreliable grid power supply, are contending with huge cost to sustain their production line.\n\nThe information from MAN members equally indicates that the production capacity utilization has been going down because of the unsustainable cost for running daily production on diesel.\n\n\u201cThe direct implication of this trend, as many Nigerians are already feeling the heat, is the reflective high cost of goods in the market owing to the high cost of production\u201d, the MAN DG noted.",

          "title": "PDP betrays Southeast, throws ticket open",
          "text": "The waiting game seems to be over. Southeast may have lost the opportunity to produce the next president of Nigeria under the People\u2019s Democratic Party, (PDP), as the 37- man zoning committee headed by Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue state, has adopted the contentious Gov. Bala Mohammed\u2019s Report, which recommended open contest for the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nMost people, including social cultural organizations, such as Afenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEF, and Middle Belt Forum, have canvassed for Igbo presidency in the interest of equity, justice and fairness, as the zone is the only majority group without s shot at the office. The Igbo have campaigned on the morality of their position, especially in the PDP, which they had backed since 1999, and in its period of crisis after 2015, an action that has cost them dearly under the APC government led by President Buhari.\n\nThe issue of zoning had sharply divided the party between north and south, especially after the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, demanded it. However, the north, whose candidates in the party, sensing an opportunity to lead the country given APC\u2019s woeful performance and low popularity, have insisted on open contest for the ticket. Notable among them is foemer vice president, Atiku Abubakar, who flew the party\u2019s flag in the 2019 polls losing to Buhari.\n\nTheir arguments, self serving and provocative, were that the party is not in power and therefore, cannot zone what it does not have.\n\nSecondly, they argued that there is nothing like zoning in the party\u2019s constitution, which is untrue. Thirdly, they insist that as an opposition party, it needs its best materials to contest to be able to defeat the ruling party, as APC did to it. Finally, the stated that only the person with guaranteed northern vote will win the election.\n\nSoutheast has thrown up some candidates such as former senate president, Pius Anyim, former governor of Anambra state, Mr. Peter Obi, and Mazi Sam Ohuabubwa. But the north parades more formidable candidates, such as Atiku Abubakar, former governor and senate president, Bukola Saraki, and to less degree Gov. Aminu Tambuwal.\n\nThe Southeast may have little hope in the event of open contest, which may be the stimulus for the intervention of Gov. Nyeson Wike of Rivers state to contest, which is a bitter-sweet for the Igbo, because he is the only Southern\n\ncandidate with the muscle to effectively challenge the north; but his participation also seals Igbo ambition.\n\nThis may have brightened Mr. Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s chances for the office, hence he doused the growing uncertainty over his candidacy by declaring at the weekend. Although his belated claim of Igbo-ness may be opportunistic, it is likely to resonate with the region if he plays the right card. APC leadership may not easily concede power to Southwest, which boosts his chances. But that may mean voting APC which the zone has loathed in the past eight years.\n\nThough a number of other governors in the South-South, notably, Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom state and Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta, were said to be interested in the contest, with the former having already obtained nomination form, they were not considered much of a threat to the aspirations of the Southeast, even as many had pointed out that Okowa\u2019s ambition was still in line.\n\nHowever, the declaration, on Sunday, by Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State, of his intention to run for president in 2023, and the consequent momentum his ambition is gathering, have rattled some stakeholders of the party in the zone.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, everyone is confused,\u201d said a top party source in Enugu who craved anonymity. \u201cYou can\u2019t deny the fact that he (Wike) is a big player in the PDP. He certainly stands a good chance, especially when you consider that he\u2019s be the party\u2019s major financier for a while.\n\n\u201cOur agitation has been that the ticket should be zoned to the South in the understanding that the south will micro-zone to the Southeast since it\u2019s the only zone yet to taste power. But Wike\u2019s move may change all that.\u201d\n\nThe Rivers governor, in the last seven years, has remained the most influential figure in the opposition party, having been its financial bulwark since it lost power in 2015, particularly with the likes of former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar; former senate president, Abubakar Bukola Saraki, among others, initially abandoning it for the emergent ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014.\n\nHe evidently sees 2023 as an opportunity for the party to reward him for his effort, and had insisted while declaring his intention to run for president on Sunday in Benue State, that he deserved the ticket for standing up for the party when others ran away.\n\n\u201cThose who want to be president now were the problems of the party in 2015. They ran away when the party needed them most,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cBut I have stood and worked for this party. I have nowhere to run to because I take it personally that the party should not die. And I challenge anyone to a debate what they did for PDP.\u201d\n\nWike\u2019s ambition sources said, has divided party stakeholders in the Southeast, even as he is said to have secured the backing of the two governors of the party in the zone, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State and Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu.\n\nThe governors were said to have endorsed Wike at an Enugu state special PDP stakeholders meeting organised by Ugwuanyi on Sunday, March 27.\n\nSources said during the meeting, which Wike allegedly funded with N50 million, Ugwuanyi prompted attendees to adopt a resolution endorsing the Rivers governor as their choice presidential candidate for 2023, a development that has since led to many accusing them of betrayal.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a case of betrayal and it\u2019s very unfortunate,\u201d the party source said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more painful when you consider that Wike has often used every opportunity to deny sharing any cultural identity with the Igbo. But as you know, these governors don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nThough many in the Southeast, especially within Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the apex Igbo sociocultural group, seem open to the option of an Igbo candidate from the South-South geopolitical zone, with the group, for instance, on a number of occasions, encouraging Rotimi Amaechi, who like Wike, is of the Ikwere stock in Rivers State, to run for president, the incumbent governor\u2019s open rejection of Igbo identity is particularly responsible for the inability of many in the Southeast to identify with him.\n\nThe case, however, appears different with Amaechi, who has also joined the presidential race, while maintaining that he is Igbo and can run on the Igbo platform.\n\nAmaechi in his yet-to-be formally unveiled 86-page manifesto brochure titled, Qualified to Serve, which is his pitch for the APC ticket, made a case for a president of Igbo extraction in 2023, while noting that he decided to contest on account of his competitive advantages, broad and deep experiences in governance, nationalist outlook, geopolitical considerations, political prowess, personality and leadership, track record of performance, highlights of achievements as Rivers State Governor and Minister of Transportation and what he called hallmarks of Amaechis leadership.\n\nAmaechi said in the document: \u201cWe must give meaning to democracy so that every Nigerian can find a place and a voice in a land of free men and women. We must deploy our diversity to increase our strength.\n\n\u201cWe must make our streets and highways, and now forests and farmlands, safe again for all Nigerians to fulfill their individual dreams of a good life so that, together, we can actualize the manifest destiny of this blessed land.\u201d\n\nItemising the focus of his campaign, Amaechi said, \u201cWe need to quickly replace the politics of impressions and personalities with the politics of issues and ideas. We must seek common ground on broad national issues on a bipartisan basis, not on the basis of personalities or geopolitical zones, tribes or factions.\n\n\u201cThe common ground must be based on a dispassionate grasp of national problems: how do we educate our children, heal the sick, give hope to those in despair, provide succour to the needy and find work for the unemployed? How do we build infrastructure that will quickly transform and modernize our economy for the good of all Nigerians?\u201d\n\nParticularly addressing the question of his Igbo identity, he said, \u201cMy birth names are Igbo names Chibuike Amaechi. I am an Igbo man. Let no one deny me my Igbo heritage, birthright, ancestry, please!\n\n\u201cUnless you want to be sectional and deny the Igbo people. I have made myself clear repeatedly, that I, Chibuike Amaechi from Ikwerre, am an Igbo man. Our people are Igbo people.\u201d\n\nThe minister further urged his party, the APC, to look towards Ndigbo for the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nAs APC prepares to conduct the primaries to choose the party\u2019s flag bearer, they must pay attention to all the geopolitical factors at play.\n\nUnderstandably, there is a strong push for power to shift to the South in 2023 and specifically to the Igbos. Igbos have not been at the centre since the Second Republic more than 40 years ago, when late Alex Ekwueme was Vice President in the Shehu Shagari administration. Not surprisingly there is loud agitation from the Igbos that they should have their turn to lead the government.\n\nOther groups are also pleading the case of the Igbos in the name of equity and the stability of the country. Leader of Pan Yoruba sociopolitical group, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has warned that Igbos should produce the president in 2023 election, if Nigeria hopes to enjoy peace. The Association of Arewa Community in Igboland has also urged Nigerians to consent to an Igbo becoming the President of the country in 2023.\n\nChibuike Amaechi is an Igbo man of Ikwerre stock. His hometown Ubima is on the border of Imo State and the fact that Nigerias modern geopolitical map places it in the South-South region does not change the fact that Ikwerre are a dialectical group of the Igbo nation. By ethnicity, language and heritage, Amaechi is no less Igbo than a man from Abriba, Owerri, Ebonyi, Awka or Enugu-Ukwu.\n\nAddressing those who insist that only Igbo from the Southeast are qualified since zoning is done on regional basis, the brochure said Amaechi coming from South-South gives him a unique advantage.\n\nIn addition, he also has the unique advantage of being not only Igbo but a Niger Deltan. This means that Amaechi could also find favour with those currently insisting that the next President should come from the South-South on the basis that their region only completed one elected term under President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nThere are some in other parts of the country who may find it more politically expedient to throw their lot behind a South-South candidate than behind a traditional Igbo man.\n\nAs much as Amaechis tribe and geo-political zone give him an advantage, he also has the advantage of being a candidate who is a true national figure \u2014 recognized all over Nigeria, with friends and allies across the length and breadth of the country.\n\nSome people vying for office also have recognizable names but are identified so resolutely with their tribe or zone that they cannot be effective national consensus candidates.\n\nFew of Amaechi\u2019s contenders have had the same opportunity or share the same disposition that allows him to travel to every state of the Federation, forge alliances and build relationships.\n\nBeloved by his people in the Niger Delta, he is also embraced by the South East as a true Igbo son and lauded in the South West for providing the Lagos \u2014 Ibadan railway system which has been a source of pride and renewed economic activity in the region. The North see him as a friend, a truly detribalized Nigerian who does not discriminate against tribe or religion and who has worked tirelessly to support President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAmaechi said the cap fits him because he has a thorough understanding of the complexities of the nation \u2014 the challenges of balancing the interests and influences in a country of different persuasions, traditions, cultures, religions.\n\nWhile others fan the flames of ethnic tension for their own selfish political advantage, Amaechi has consistently championed national unity, identifying ethnic divisiveness as an obstacle to progress.\n\nIndeed, many in the Southeast will easily agree with the minister and accept his bid as an Igbo bid for power, even if he had denied his Igbo identity in the past.\n\nOn many occasions, Ohanaeze had expressed readiness to back the minister as one of the Igbo sons seeking power in 2023, and had particularly praised him effusively when he was given chieftaincy title by the Emir of Daura in February.\n\nFor Wike, however, the case appears different. While a section of the political elite, notably the two governors of PDP in Southeast are said to be backing him, the zone\u2019s street doesn\u2019t seem to identify with him.\n\nRegardless, the governor seem determined to push for the ticket and appear to be getting somewhat more broad-based southern support.\n\nBeyond the Southeast, he is said to have also secured the support of party stakeholders in the Southwest, with two key figures of the party in the zone, Seyi Makinde, governor of Oyo State and Ayo Fayose, former governor of Ekiti State said to be strongly behind him, as he looks set to achieve wider support in the South.\n\nIndeed, last week, Fayose called on other members of the party to support the governor\u2019s presidential ambition, describing him as a man with exemplary character.\u201d\n\nMr. Fayose who spoke in Port Harcourt when a group of party chieftains presented the presidential nomination form to Wike, said, \u201cAs an elder statesman, I know what is right and just. I am here as his brother, his friend, to a man with exemplary character. For Governor Wike, what you see is what you get.\n\nThe bible says, God to so many is righteousness. The fierce-looking man, Wike, has a good heart. His problem is that he has to say it the way it is.\n\n\u201cBut it is not enough to judge a man by what he says because there are so many people who are quiet but they are wicked,\u201d continued Mr. Fayose whose remark drew applause from the people at the ceremony.\n\nGovernor Wike accepted the nomination form, thanked those who bought it for him, and said he is prepared for the assignment.\n\nHe said, \u201cAll of us are aware of the problems we face today. It is not going to be an easy task, but its a task that is surmountable, with commitment and passion. And by the special grace of God and with your support, we shall surmount the problems facing Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Wike emphasized that he had done well for the party and deserved to be given a chance, even as he noted that he would still back the party and ensure it emerges victorious in 2023 even if he doesn\u2019t get the ticket.\n\nHe said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should prepared for transparent election, once he gets the PDP presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cI will not be rigged out. Nobody can rig me out in this election. So it is left for the PDP, it is left for the delegates. If you want us to just be on the ballot, its okay. But if you want PDP to come back to power, give me the ticket,\u201d he said.\n\nBut his ambition is one that seem to be coldly received in the Southeast, with a number of stakeholders insisting that he should step down from the race and back someone from the zone in the interest of justice and unity.\n\n\u201cI expect Wike, and indeed, the people of the South South to collectively back the Southeast in 2023,\u201d said Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, former PDP chairman and one time governor of old Anambra State.\n\n\u201cWe have been with the South South all the way. We fought with them to ensure that they get a fair deal from the Nigerian state. We were with them and made sure they got 13 percent derivation from oil. We backed Goodluck Jonathan all the way. We have always been with them. So, I think it\u2019s only proper for them to reciprocate the gesture this time and I hope Wike reconsiders his position.\u201d\n\nZoning Controversy Persists\n\nMeanwhile, attempts by the opposition party to agree on which zone should get its presidential candidate in 2023 have so far failed to materialise as stakeholders from both the north and south have continued to insist on the position.\n\nThough the party\u2019s 37-member zoning committee inaugurated on March 24 was supposed to submit its recommendations last week, it failed to do so, even as its governors continue to engage in a game of wits over the mode of primary elections that should be used to nominate the presidential candidate for the election.\n\nWith the committee apparently unable to come up with a resolution on zoning and mode of primary, there are already suggestions that both may eventually be referred to the National Executive Council (NEC).\n\nSources say the committee met twice in Abuja earlier last week but was unable to agree on the thorny issue of zoning, with members sharply divided on whether to cede the presidential ticket of the party to the southern part or throw the contest open for aspirants from all parts of the country.\n\nThe last meeting was hurriedly adjourned when it became obvious that committee members were not going to agree on a position on the matter, with further deliberation fixed for Tuesday.\n\nHowever, chairman of the committee and Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom, assured party supporters that they would come up with an arrangement that will be acceptable to all.\n\nThe meeting is yet to be concluded. We have adjourned till Tuesday next week at the same time, at the same venue. And until we conclude the proceedings, there is not much to say, he said.",

          "title": "Train attack: The humanity in us slowly being eroded \u2013 JNI \u2013 Blueprint Newspapers Limited",
          "text": "Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI) \u2013 the apex Muslim organisation in Nigeria \u2013 has said the rising security challenges in the guise of killing, maiming and kidnapping are indications that \u201cthe humanity in us is slowly being eroded.\u201d\n\nThe group, led by Sultan of Sokoto Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, also noted that any government that cannot protect the lives and properties of the people lacked the justification of remaining in office.\n\nIt also expressed worry that the tragic train attack may have indicated the nation was heading towards an unknown destination of chaos.\n\nJNI Secretary-General Dr. Khalid Abubakar Aliyu made the group\u2019s position known Monday in a statement issued to journalists in Kaduna.\n\nTitled \u2018Passengers\u2019 bound train attack along Abuja-Kaduna rail track\u2019, the statement said: \u201cTo say the least Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI) is agonised and short of words to express her-self over the gory incident of the infamous train attack which happened on Monday, 28th March, 2022. The well-orchestrated incident remains highly condemnable, reprehensible and upsetting to every rational mind.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the continuous callous acts of mayhem, killings and arson happening almost on daily or weekly bases around us; either within communities and/or on the roads we ply, has automatically reset our human psyche that we now have accepted such dastardly acts as part of our lives, to the extent that we no longer feel it. The humanity in us is slowly being eroded thereby making us adapt to the new normal within which we, unfortunately, found ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that in Islam and by all global standards, the essence of Government and Governance is solely to protect the five principal cardinal rights of the human race, the most important of which is LIFE! Any government that is incapable of protecting the lives of its citizens has lost the moral justification of being there in the first place; this is enunciated in section 33(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have however carefully studied and followed-up the unfortunate train blast especially that another train attack was reported to have occurred on the Lagos-Kano bound train, near Jaji, Kaduna state, on Thursday, 31st March, 2022, which inevitably led to the death of the locomotive operator. Therefore, this press release is premised on the fact that Nigeria is more or less heading to an unknown destination of multiple cum well-coordinated serial chaos attributable to lack of coordination and synergy from security personnel, if the news making the round is to be believed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNevertheless, history is replete of several astonishing and bravery art of governance exhibited overtime by leaders. For instance, during the time of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him), he battled and expelled Banu Qaynuqa from the city Madinah, because a woman was molested in the market by one of them and the community-supported his actions. The Prophet (SAW) did not waste time but promptly attacked Banu Qaynuqa and expelled them. This served as deterrence to others with evil intentions.\n\n\u201cIn the Nigeria of today, how many wives are raped daily in the presence of their husbands, mothers in the presence of their sons? How many daughters are raped in the presence of their fathers and sisters in the presence of their brothers? This happens a lot. and it is well known. What action did the authorities take in averting and/or to remedying such absurd and ungodly happenstance? Why must the country be brought to kneel?\n\n\u201cHuman life is held sacrosanct in Islam that is why Allah (SWT) declared in the Glorious Quran that if a single soul is killed without just cause, then it is as if the entire humanity is wiped off the face of the earth. We claim to be people of faith and all these occurrences are allowed without any form of prompt intervention. Why? Well, it should be known that an attack on one soul; is an attack on all, and this is how the human race should be preserved and protected, but if allowed to continue we fear the consequence(s) of the innocent souls that were killed, without any fault of theirs.\n\n\u201cTerrorists are now becoming bolder and more belligerent by the day. They operate in any area of their choice(s) at any time they so wish. They even operate for up to 8 hours non-stop (as it was reported to have happened in Niger state last Monday), without any fear of being confronted or apprehended. Most communities are now under the bandits\u2019 absolute control with taxes being paid to bandits\u2013some parts of Borno, Katsina, Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto states and some others yet to be disclosed to the public. In fact, terrorists do what they wish knowing that there is no gun power or authority that will defy them,\u201d the statement further added.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith all the reported resources allocated to relevant security agencies; intelligent gathering mechanism, military arsenal and tact, can\u2019t the Government provide any convincing justification on why the security situation in the country continue to deteriorate? Why are attacks experienced all over the place and continuing unabated without any deterrence? Moreover, why must security budget and expenditure remain so secretive, despite the reported release of fund? The mind boggling train attack of Monday, 28th March, 2022, the kidnap and sporadic shootings that ensued thereafter the train en-route Kaduna needs to be seriously investigated and punitive measures taken. Although, without doubt, the security men have exhibited capacity, resilience, determination and dexterity during the rescue operation of the same ill-fated train attack.\n\n\u201cIt is also the firm belief of most Nigerians that the Government is expected to know the enclaves and hideouts of these criminals, particularly that only Government has absolute control and use of force, and by extension it also has machineries to generate genuine information. Again, why can\u2019t the Government proactively take the battle to the criminals\u2019 hideouts and wipe them off? Why should the Government wait until people are attacked, lives and properties lost for them to strike and be issuing empty orders and usual condemnation? The whys are endless?\u201d\n\nThe JNI scribe said it\u2019s high time the security outfits were directed \u201cto ransack the enclaves of all criminal elements and deal with them decisively. Informants should not be spared, as they are more dangerous than the killers. They should be made to face the right punishment befitting their crime. The intelligence community should beef-up their efforts in trying to dig to the root of this phenomena.\n\n\u201cIt is also worth noting, that in recent time, scholars of social behavior have discovered that most acts of terrorism and banditry are carried out under the influence of hard drugs. As part of effort to tackle insecurity in Nigeria, the war on drug should be placed on the front burner as it is the elixir that spurs criminals to action. Suppliers, vendors and traffickers of hard drug and intoxicants must be dealt with decisively. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and other security agencies should as a matter of national security note and penetrate into villages, higher institution campuses, motor parks and recreational or viewing centres, because they are now dwellings where hard drugs/substances are being peddled brazenly.\n\n\u201cLikewise, parents, religious and community leaders have a role to play in the fight against illicit drugs/substance pervading most households within our neighbourhoods. This should be considered a fight for all and not only for the Government.\u201d\n\nThis is not conventional war \u2013 Lai\n\nIn a related development, Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed, told former President Olusegun Obasanjo that the nation\u2019s security agencies were battling unconventional warfare.\n\nMohammed, who spoke on a TVC programme, \u201cThis Morning,\u201d said contrary to Obasanjo\u2019s position, the Muhammadu Buhari administration was not overwhelmed by the nation\u2019s security challenge.\n\nObasanjo, had , while reacting to Kaduna train attack, said: \u201cI believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCountering the former president\u2019s position however, the minister said the military and other security personnel were doing their best and had recorded successes in their fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cWe must give kudos to our military; you know that we are not fighting a conventional war but terrorism, hence the need for everyone to support the security agencies so as to win over the menace.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has also given the military the enabling environment to continue in the fight against terrorism and banditry,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMohammed also said: \u201cThe Federal Government is working toward ensuring that such incident does not reoccur.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that the government wants to do is to fast-track the installation of a surveillance and monitoring system, not just on the Abuja-Kaduna rail track.\n\n\u201cBut also on the Lagos-Ibadan and Warri-Itakpe rail tracks to ensure that at any given time we will be able to monitor from the control room.\u201d\n\nGunmi on suspended cleric\n\nMeanwhile, controversial Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Gumi, has backed the suspension of the Chief Imam of Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque, Abuja, Shiekh Nuru Khalid, over an \u2018inciting sermon.\u2019\n\nIn the sermon last Friday, Khalid lashed at the Buhari-led government over the recent train attack in Kaduna and related killings by bandits in the Northern Nigeria and across the country.\n\nCommenting on the cleric\u2019s suspension, however, thinks otherwise as he has condemned the sermon, saying it was riddled with \u201csentiments overriding intellect.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with journalists on Monday in Kaduna, Gumi said what Imam Khalid did was worse than \u201cthe few kidnappings\u201d being perpetrated by bandits.\n\nGunmi, an ex-military officer said: \u201cIt\u2019s a case of sentiments overriding intellect. Calling masses not to vote out incompetent government by massive voting is worse than the few kidnappings and a misplaced judgement.\u201d\n\n",
          "summary": "It also expressed worry that the tragic train attack may have indicated the nation was heading towards an unknown destination of chaos.\nJNI Secretary-General Dr. Khalid Abubakar Aliyu made the group\u2019s position known Monday in a statement issued to journalists in Kaduna.\nTitled \u2018Passengers\u2019 bound train attack along Abuja-Kaduna rail track\u2019, the statement said: \u201cTo say the least Jama\u2019atu Nasril Islam (JNI) is agonised and short of words to express her-self over the gory incident of the infamous train attack which happened on Monday, 28th March, 2022.\nThe mind boggling train attack of Monday, 28th March, 2022, the kidnap and sporadic shootings that ensued thereafter the train en-route Kaduna needs to be seriously investigated and punitive measures taken.\nAlthough, without doubt, the security men have exhibited capacity, resilience, determination and dexterity during the rescue operation of the same ill-fated train attack.",

          "text": "The race to the Presidential Villa in 2023 is getting more intense in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the party\u2019s 37-man zoning committee meets to take a decisive position.\n\nThe committee is expected to recommend to the party whether zoning would help its return to power at the centre in 2023 or not, and which part of the country picks the presidential ticket.\n\nThe committee was inaugurated on the 24th of March, 2022 with Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom, and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Hon Ndudi Elumelu as chairman and deputy chairman respectively, while Emmanuel Ekpe was named as secretary.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the first meeting, held few days ago after their inauguration and the other one held on the 29th of March, 2022, ended inconclusively.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur on 29th March, 2022, the governor said: \u201cThe meeting is yet to be concluded. We have adjourned till Tuesday next week at the same time, same venue. And until we conclude the proceedings, there is not much to say. So far, all the members are quite understanding. There wasn\u2019t any form of tension.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dicey \u2013 Source\n\nAlso, a reliable source who is from North-central told Blueprint that almost all members of the committee came to the meetings with a position and argument for the ticket to be zoned to their geo-political zone.\n\nThe source, a high ranking member of the party and also a member of the committee who did not want his name in print said, \u201cthe zoning committee has met twice since inauguration. The next meeting which will be the 3rd meeting will take place on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe previous meetings ended inconclusively as members of the committee were advancing arguments to favour their zone. So, it becomes difficult to agree on a zoning arrangement.\u201d\n\nAsked about the possible way the zoning would go, he said: \u201dIt is difficult to say, the committee has not concluded and no one can say it will go south or north. But, from the number of those who have bought forms and from our last meetings it will be difficult for this committee to zone it to either south or north.\n\n\u201cThe aim of the party is to win 2023 general elections, if we zone it now that many people have bought forms it may cause crisis within the party. From our previous meeting and from what the majority of the members have said, the 2023 Presidential ticket may be thrown open.\u201d\n\nThe report and recommendation of this committee would determine the fate of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim, and former Anambra state Governor Peter Obi, at the PDP presidential primary slated for May 28 and 29.\n\nOthers who have obtained the PDP presidential nomination form include, Sokoto state Governor Aminu Tambuwal, Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed; Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel; former Senate President Abubakar Bukola Saraki; Oliver Diana Teriela, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, Ovation Publisher, Dele Mohammed, Sam Ohuabunwa and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen.\n\nThe two-week deadline given the committee to submit its report elapses Thursday, 10th April, 2022.\n\nDokpesi hopeful on Atiku\n\nIn a related development, the chairman, Technical Committee, Atiku Presidential Project, High Chief Raymond Dokpesi, has expressed confidence that the PDP zoning would not affect the former VP.\n\nDokpesi stated this, Monday, shortly after submitting the expression of interest and nomination forms on behalf of Atiku.\n\nReacting to questions on whether the zoning would affect the plans of Atiku to vie for the PDP Presidential ticket, the media mogul said: \u201cDefinitely, we have nothing against whatever the party will decide, but the zoning will not be against us.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of any internal problems in the PDP; no crisis whatsoever. PDP is one big family and we shall all be together as brothers and sisters. The forms have been fully signed and in complete order.\u201d\n\n",

At 7.15 am in New York (1115 GMT) Twitter\u2019s stock was trading at about $49, up by around 26 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,\u201d analysts Daniel Ives and John Katsingris of Wedbush wrote in a note.\n\nMusk launched a poll on Twitter on March 25, saying \u201cfree speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?\u201d\n\nMore than two million people voted in the poll, with over 70 per cent saying \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?\u201d he continued the next day.\n\n\u201cIs a new platform needed?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust buy Twitter,\u201d was one of the first responses from tens of thousands of users.\n\nMusk, Twitter and controversy\n\nMusk has wielded Twitter polls to conduct business before: in November last year, he offloaded $5 billion in Tesla shares days after asking fellow social media users if he should sell 10 per cent of his stake.\n\nIn the summer of 2018 Musk published a tweet where he claimed that he had the appropriate funding to take Tesla private, without providing proof.\n\nThe tweet caused a brief spike in Tesla\u2019s share price but the SEC said the statements on Twitter were \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d\n\nThe mogul then agreed that any tweets capable of moving Tesla\u2019s share price would be screened by lawyers, as part of a deal that saw him pay $20 million to settle a fraud case brought by the SEC.\n\nThen in early March, Musk asked a New York judge to overturn the agreement with the stock market watchdog on his tweets.\n\nHis lawyer said the dispute with the SEC was \u201cyet another attempt to harass Tesla and silence Mr Musk.\u201d\n\nMusk has also used Twitter to court controversy away from the business world: in March he challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a fight, with the fate of Ukraine at stake; and in February he drew condemnation for a tweet comparing Canadian leader Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler\n\n-AFP",

That is the meaning of democracy. My father did not contest to represent zoning interest. His interest was Nigeria and Nigeria alone,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that another similarity was that the late MKO believed in a United Nigeria, just like Bello, noting that he also treated everyone around him with respect regardless of their social standing.\n\n\u201cThese are the same qualities I have seen in Governor Bello. He dared to contest, not minding that he was from a minority tribe in Kogi and won, and he has come out again. My father did the same, when it was believed that a Yoruba man could not be President.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is the best man for the job. And you know me, I\u2019m not driven by pecuniary considerations. I do what I believe in. In the next seven weeks, we would be working hard, and when we emerge, we will deliver a Nigeria of our dreams,\u201d Hafsat Abiola said.\n\nShe said her father would have been happy to see that a young, courageous man like the Governor had done everything to bring back his Hope \u201993 in Hope \u201923, with the same person that did the manifesto on board \u2013 Senator Jonathan Zwingina.\n\nThousands of Nigerians from all walks of life had stormed the Eagle Square at the nation\u2019s capital on Saturday to witness the official acceptance of Governor Yahaya Bello to vie for the 2023 Presidency.\n\nWhile declaring his intention to run, Governor Bello reiterated that he had demonstrated capacity to lead Nigeria in his present assignment as the Governor of Kogi State, noting that, for him, all that mattered was Nigeria and the wellbeing of citizens.\n\nThe DG pointed out that the presidential aspirant had the right marks where the votes were \u2013 women and youths \u2013 adding that being the first female Director-General of a presidential campaign organisation was an attestation to Governor Bello\u2019s unrivalled record in women inclusion.",

Could it be that the senator is out for mischief against the PDP in Kano state, considering that he is not only a stakeholder but also a brand in his own right?

          "text": "The usual crowds filled the streets as bars and nightclubs were closing in California\u2019s capital city of Sacramento when the sound of rapid-fire gunshots sent people running in terror. In a matter of seconds, the latest U.S. mass shooting had left six people dead and 12 wounded.\n\nSacramento police said they were searching for at least two people who opened fire around 2 a.m. Sunday on the outskirts of the city\u2019s downtown entertainment district, anchored by the Golden One Arena that hosts concerts and the NBA\u2019s Sacramento Kings. The team\u2019s home game against the Golden State Warriors went on as scheduled Sunday night and began with a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nPolice Chief Kathy Lester revealed few details from the investigation and pleaded with the public to share videos and other evidence that could lead to the killers.\n\n\u201cThe scale of violence that just happened in our city is unprecedented during my 27 years here,\u201d Lester told reporters during a news conference at police headquarters. \u201cWe are shocked and heartbroken by this tragedy. But we are also resolved as an agency to find those responsible and to secure justice for the victims and the families.\u201d\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg and other city officials decried escalating violence in the city while also urging people to keep coming downtown for events like NBA games and performances of the Broadway musical \u201cWicked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can never accept it as normal and we never will,\u201d Steinberg said of the shooting. \u201cBut we also have to live our lives.\u201d\n\nThe gunfire erupted just after a fight broke out on a street lined with an upscale hotel, nightclubs and bars, but police said they did not know if the altercation was connected to the shooting. Video from witnesses posted on social media showed rapid gunfire for at least 45 seconds as people screamed and ran for cover.\n\nThe gunfire startled sleeping guests at the Citizen Hotel, which included a wedding party and fans of the rapper Tyler the Creator, who performed at a concert hours earlier.\n\nFrom her window on the fourth floor of the hotel, 18-year-old Kelsey Schar said she saw a man running while firing a gun. She could see flashes from the weapon in the darkness as people ran for cover.\n\nSchar\u2019s friend, Madalyn Woodward, said she saw a girl who appeared to have been shot in the arm lying on the ground. Security guards from a nearby nightclub rushed to help the girl with what looked like napkins to try to stanch the bleeding.\n\nPolice found a stolen handgun, but they did not know if it had been used in the shooting. The dead included three men and three women. Authorities were still working to notify family members, and had publicly identified only one victim as of late Sunday, 38-year-old Sergio Harris, without providing a cause of death. Of the 12 wounded, at least four had critical injuries, according to the Sacramento Fire Department.\n\nSunday\u2019s violence was the third time in the U.S. this year that at least six people have been killed in a mass shooting, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University. And it was the second mass shooting in Sacramento in the last five weeks.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called for action on gun crimes in a statement Sunday.\n\n\u201cToday, America once again mourns for another community devastated by gun violence,\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut we must do more than mourn; we must act.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 28, a father killed his three daughters, a chaperone and himself in a Sacramento church during a weekly supervised visitation. David Mora, 39, was armed with a homemade semiautomatic rifle-style weapon, even though he was under a restraining order that prohibited him from possessing a firearm.\n\nThe crime scene Sunday sprawled across two city blocks, closing off a large swath of the city\u2019s downtown. Bodies remained on the pavement throughout the day as Lester said investigators were working to process a \u201creally complex and complicated scene\u201d to make sure investigators gathered all the evidence they could to \u201csee the perpetrators of this crime brought to justice.\u201d\n\nCouncilmember Katie Valenzuela, who represents the area, said she\u2019s fielded too many phone calls reporting violence in her district during her 15 months in office. She cried at a news conference as she told reporters that the latest phone call woke her up at 2:30 a.m. Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartbroken and I\u2019m outraged,\u201d she said. \u201cOur community deserves better than this.\u201d\n\nAP",

Similarly, the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has issued over 78 million unique NINs till date,\u201d Pantami said.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved the implementation of the Policy with effect from the 4th of April, 2022. Consequently, the Federal Government has directed all Telcos to strictly enforce the Policy on all SIMs issued (existing and new) in Nigeria. Outgoing calls will subsequently be barred for telephone lines that have not complied with the NIN-SIM linkage Policy from the 4th of April, 2022. Subscribers of such lines are hereby advised to link their SIMs to their NINs before the Telcos can lift the restriction on their lines. Affected individuals are hereby advised to register for their NINs at designated centers and thereafter link the NINs to their SIMs through the channels provided by NIMC and the Telcos, including the NIMC mobile App.\n\n\u201dPantami thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for his tremendous support. He also commended the Executive Vice-Chairman of the NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Dambatta, the Director-General/Chief Executive Officer of NIMC, Aliyu Abubakar Aziz along with their management and staff, as well as other notable bodies whose efforts have seen to the monumental success of the exercise.\n\nThe Minister also extended his thanks to the telecommunication operators for their support towards the success recorded.Pantami said enrolment for NIN would be a continuous exercise and that NIN would henceforth be a precondition for service in Telcos, Banks, Nigerian Immigration Service, and for several other government services.He also encouraged Nigerians and legal residents to visit NIN registration centres for the enrollment and issuance of valid NINs.\n\nEmma Okonji",
