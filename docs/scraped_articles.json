          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nHealthcare experts say Nigeria needs to develop new modalities to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the country, noting that the testing procedure must be improved to protect the nation.\n\nThey stressed that the country must improve its COVID-19 testing to guaranty control efforts.\n\nAccording to them, lack of adequate testing, cost of testing, and sticking to the methods of testing can undermine efforts to curtail the infection.\n\nRecall that despite the efforts by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, the Presidential Steering Committee, and other partners to increase the COVID-19 testing capacity, the number of people tested for the viral infection in the country so far remains low.\n\nData from the NCDC as of January 6, 2022, showed that out of the 206 million population, only 3,863,081 have been tested since the first case of the virus was detected on February 27, 2020.\n\nExperts, however, warned that Nigeria may not be able to control community transmission even with the spread of the Omicron variant of the virus and future variants.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, a Professor of Community Medicine and Public Health, Adesegun Fatusi said the lack of adequate testing in the country undermines efforts to control the pandemic in the country.\n\n\u201cIn terms of testing modalities, we started testing everybody using the polymerase chain reaction machine and it takes a lot of time for the result to be out but now we are using the antigen. What we need to do is continuously focus on the rapid test and it should be available widely. People should be able to test themselves at home.\n\n\u201cWe need to deploy means that will ensure that people can test themselves so that we can capture more people very early before they can spread it to other people.\n\n\u201cWe need to encourage people to test more and see how the test kit can become widely available in the country,\u201d Fatusi, who is also the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo State, said.\n\nAlso speaking with PUNCH HealthWise, the Head Of Infectious Disease Unit at College of Medicine, University of Lagos, and Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Lagos, Dr. Iorhen Akase noted that inadequate testing undermines the control measures of COVID-19 in the country.\n\nHe said that there is a need to redefine the role of testing for COVID-19 on many levels.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, where we have challenges with people following the COVID-19 protocols, especially the communities, in our markets, the real question now is what is the role of testing.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to do testing to guide community behaviour, that\u2019s fine but in a situation where community adherence and behaviour is still not optimal and we do not have enough facilities to test everyone, then there is a need to redefine our testing modalities,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Prof. Fatusi advocates a need for everybody to self-test for COVID-19, Dr. Akase said there is a need to discuss if everyone should test for COVID-19.\n\nAccording to Akase, the role of testing needs to be redefined with the rate of community transmission.\n\n\u201cAt this stage where we have extensive community transmission, but we don\u2019t have the testing capacity for everyone, the role of testing needs to be redefined. If we don\u2019t have enough for everyone and it\u2019s not going to change the community behaviour, we need to discuss if we should priorities testing among travellers, those at risk, or those who have symptoms.\n\n\u201cCountries are redefining the criteria for testing but at the stage of the pandemic, it\u2019s beneficial if we do widespread testing but at the stage where we are, we need to discuss if we have to test everyone.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for a discussion that should put this in perspective because if you look at the amount of money that goes into testing, we really need to have to optimise it.\n\n\u201cWe need testing to guarantee control efforts but now at the stage where we are, we need to ask ourselves where we are in terms of that and what are our aims and if we aim to identify all COVID-19 cases.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a model, we have been doing copy and paste from other countries and we need to sit and decide the model of testing we need in the country.\u201d\n\nThe infectious diseases expert also said the high cost of private PCR tests inhibits Nigeria\u2019s fight against COVID-19.\n\n\u201cPCR testing is still N50,400; it\u2019s not sustaining and it defeats the purpose at the end of the day and that\u2019s for the group of people who have to test because they need it and if they come back, they have to test. If the price is reduced, it encourages compliance.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just be doing copy and paste but we need to determine what model works for us,\u201d Akase said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Among unvaccinated women, the rate was seven percent For those who received at least one vaccine dose during the course of their pregnancy, it was 4.9 per\n\ncent.\n\nRegarding the babies who were born small for their gestational age, the researchers found no difference between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. The rate for both groups was 8.2 per cent.\n\nNearly every woman in the study was vaccinated in either the second or third trimester; only about one per cent received a vaccine in the first trimester.\n\nThe researchers noted that receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with increased risk for preterm birth or Small-for-Gestational-Age.\n\n\u201cThe absolute risk for severe morbidity associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy is low; however, women with symptomatic COVID-19 during pregnancy have a more than twofold increased risk for intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and a 70 percent increased risk for death, compared with nonpregnant women with symptomatic infections.\n\n\u201cEvidence of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy continues to accrue, including the detection of antibodies in cord blood. Together, these findings reinforce the importance of communicating the risks for COVID-19 during pregnancy, the benefits of vaccination, and information on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,\u201d they said.\n\nAccording to them, the findings in the report are subject to at least four limitations but the findings from this retrospective, multisite cohort of a large and diverse population with comprehensive data on vaccination, comorbidities, and birth outcomes add to the evidence supporting the safety of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.\n\n\u201cCDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for women who are pregnant, recently pregnant (including those who are lactating), who are trying to become pregnant now, or who might become pregnant in the future to reduce the risk for severe COVID-19\u2013associated outcomes,\u201d they said.\n\nCommenting on the study, a public health physician, Dr. Ifeanyi Nsofor confirmed that there is no link between COVID-19 vaccines and giving birth to premature babies.\n\nHe, however, said pregnant women who have not received their COVID-19 vaccines have a higher risk of giving birth to premature babies.\n\nNsofor, who is also the Senior Vice President for Africa, Human Health Education and Research Foundation said \u201cPregnant women who have not received their COVID-19 vaccines have a higher risk of giving birth to premature babies.\n\n\u201cPregnant women who have COVID-19 and show symptoms have higher chances of dying due to the COVID-19 infection compared to women who are not pregnant.\n\n\u201cThe advice to pregnant women, women of childbearing age, and women who want to get pregnant in the future is to make sure they receive their COVID-19 vaccines as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

May we have sense in our lifetimes.\u201d\n\n@BrewsterHerr: \u201cNigeria is at an en-passe. History is about to repeat itself. Remember MKO, the same thing will most likely happen to Tinubu, either he loses the ticket in APC or in the general elections. Even if he wins both, there is no escaping the turmoil 2023 has in store for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n@__Ahmadak: \u201cTinubu circle is massive in the southwest and by extension to the north. That man has a lot of REAL MADE MEN with him and he understands this politics. If he decides to run, I don\u2019t think any force can stop him. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n@DubemMartin: \u201c7 years of the Buhari/Tinubu alliance in power is hard suffering and pain. It will be foolish for Nigerians to allow the same mess to continue. They will manipulate it. Best way for people to stop them is to rise now and demand for a RESTRUCTURED Nigeria or REFERENDUM to decide our future.\u201d\n\n@sophysoo: \u201cTinubu becoming president? Nigerians should get set for more problems. We can\u2019t continue with these problems, from Buhari to Tinubu? Nigerians should reject it.\u201d\n\n@Awafiq_\u201dThere\u2019s no incongruity between Tinubu and Osinbajo campaigning for the presidency. They are probably testing the waters to see which candidate has more approval ratings.\u201d\n\n@Realifeanyieze: \u201cTinubu declared to run for president in 2023 by informing Buhari of his intention. I wish him the best, Tinubu isn\u2019t what we need to move this Nigeria forward.\u201d\n\n@MaryNekky1 wrote: \u201cTinubu na Buhari pro-max, baba go and retire, please don\u2019t ruin my life as a Nigerian.\u201d\n\n@dekezman wrote: \u201cIf you\u2019re planning to vote Tinubu next year after voting Buhari twice, then you need to really reevaluate your life.\u201d",

John Ayah, has said that Nigerian presidency should be made to go round the geopolitical zones in the country as every zone has something to contribute to the growth and economic well-being of the nation.\n\nThe Bishop, who made the assertion in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom state capital during the end of the annual diocesan praying and fasting assembly, held at Cardinal Ekanem Seminary grounds along Brook Street, said no group should have monopoly of leadership.\n\n\u201cLet leadership go round, everybody has something to contribute and when we bring all these contributions together, we make Nigeria great again. Leadership is not meant for a particular group, what makes a particular group better than others?\u201d He queried.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201dIf we have good leaders in the north, we have them in the west, and in the south as well. Let leadership go round so that everybody shares in it. It is like cake, when everybody shares in it, nobody will be angry, nobody will be disgruntled at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cGod has blessed us in this country and each of us from our various vantage points has something to contribute to the growth and well-being of this country. The Igbo man has something to contribute, the man from the north has something to contribute, the man from the west also has something to contribute.\n\n\u201cAnd we from this part of the country (south) also have something to contribute and we\u2019ll bring all these contributions to make Nigeria great. God has given us what it takes to be a great nation.we should look towards that direction and see what God has in store for us and make Nigeria great\u201d\n\nOn the issue of agitation for separation, the Catholic Bishop said he was not an apostle to that, stressing that what is needed in the country at the moment is for the people to pray and work towards the unity and growth of the nation.\n\nHe noted that there is every indication that if the Biafra nation is created, there is every possibility that another secessionist group would emerge seeking its independence even as he admired the unity seen in the United States of America.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is not good to break up, if Biafra breaks away today, another disgruntled group will want to break away as well, rather, Nigerians should pray and work to keep the country together and the leaders should look for a lasting solution to all the issues threatening our unity and growth.\n\n\u201cLet us pray for God to give us good leaders in this country, who have the interest of the people at heart, who think about those poor people out there who cannot feed. Let\u2019s look at the greatness of this country and pray that God will hear our cries\n\n\u201cWhen I hear America I envy them so much. No part of that country is clamouring to be a separate country. They all want to work together as a people, they are wonderful in so many ways. We too are blessed.\u201d\n\nBishop Ayah however prayed for unity and security of Nigeria and asked God to see the country through all these trying moments.",

This is very strange.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of farm produce in the country is because of insecurity, many farmers are in IDP camps. There are no farmers in their places to produce all these foodstuffs, that is why their prices are high.\u201d\n\nPresident of Igangan Agro Park Investors Association (IAPIA), Femi Abioye, lamented that farmers in some parts of the Northwest pay bandits before harvesting their crops.\n\nAbioye said the lingering security challenges are contributory factors to the high cost of food items.\n\nAccording to him, \u201crice farmers cannot harvest until they pay bandits, and sometimes when they don\u2019t pay, their farms are set ablaze.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have fewer people on the farms compared to five years ago. Northeast for example, if there is peace in that zone, the cost of beans will go down by at least 50 percent because they are the largest producers of beans and a large percentage of the farming community has been destroyed.\n\n\u201cIn the South, criminal herdsmen keep destroying farmers\u2019 crops. Now, they have gone into full-blown banditry and kidnapping for ransom. They also kill farmers. In the last two years, we have few farmers in the region, I have not slept on my farm and I am into commercial agriculture.\u201d.",

I\u2019ve never seen the cap of a kingmaker before. That is the truth, and I\u2019ve never seen where it is written in the rule book, anywhere in any country, that a kingmaker cannot be a king, unless you commit murder.\n\n\u201cSo, whatever is your attribute is your own opinion.

You\u2019ve seen that experience and the capacity to turn things around and that is what we are doing.\n\n\u2018You know, the confusion, the drift of the past in PDP is being corrected. And you can\u2019t take away from that. As we are today, go back to the data on how many barrels of oil we were producing when we first came in and what it is today. We cannot even at the time we came in we did not pay the counterpart funds to start our rail line. Today, you enjoy the comfort of having rail from Lagos to Ibadan, you have the Kaduna and you have the one for Kano State on the aggressive pipeline, you see excellent infrastructure. I just came from Azare and I have seen good roads, the carnage of dying on motor vehicles is reducing except you know, lack of compliance with a lot of Nigerian drivers and VIOs. Let us think back, let us be intellectually inquisitive as to the past and the present and what the future holds for Nigeria.\u2019\n\nAsked why he would not remain a kingmaker rather than being the king, Tinubu said there is nothing that stops a kingmaker from becoming the king unless he has committed murder.\n\nThe APC chieftain said: \u2018About the cap of kingmaker. I\u2019ve never seen the cap of a kingmaker before. That is the truth. And I\u2019ve never seen where it is written in the rule book anywhere in any country. That a kingmaker cannot be a king unless you commit murder. So, whatever is your attribute is your own opinion. Me, I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker. You can write your literature and your story based upon your own perception.\u2019\n\nTinubu, also commenting on the direct primaries and the convention, said: \u2018First of all, the National Assembly and the president must be encouraged to review and review again. Whatever they come up with electoral amendment is what we must comply with. There is no unlimited elasticity in what we face, because we have to plan and plan well, and be able to manage the time effectively. The great roadmap to success is the ability of a leader to do what he must do at the right time that it should be done. So that to me, the electoral amendment point we will still look at that collectively. And it is our country. It\u2019s our democracy. We had adopted it and we will push it rigorously.\u2019\n\nOn the ruling party\u2019s convention, he said: \u2018it is certain that we are going to get it.\u2019\n\nAsked when he responded, he said. \u2018Oh, well. I\u2019m not a spokesperson for the party. And the President is the leader of the party. So, expect convention, maybe if that\u2019s added to your own anxiety, or the other party\u2019s anxiety is good for us. We get it and we\u2019ll get it done properly.\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the purpose of his visit, Tinubu said he came to see the President on general issues concerning Nigeria, including the ruling political party, security issues, the achievement and the New Year Agenda.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe rumoured plot to draft former President Goodluck Jonathan into the 2023 presidential race by the All Progressives Congress (APC) is causing disquiet and panic in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nIn recent times, there have been reports of alleged moves by some leaders of the APC to convince the former president to throw his hat into the ring for the 2023 presidential election on the party\u2019s its platform.\n\nLast week, Jonathan campaign posters surfaced on some social media platforms, but his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, dismissed the posters.\n\nEze described Jonathan\u2019s alleged presidential bid on APC platform as rumour, saying it had no basis.\n\nHowever, Daily Sun learnt at the weekend that, despite the PDP\u2019s dismissal of the alleged romance between Jonathan and APC as a \u2018non-issue,\u2019 some leaders of the opposition party are actually worried about the development. Some members loyal to Jonathan have also vowed not to move with the former president to the APC if the rumour tuned out to be true, even as they threaten to revolt against him. Some others fear it would amount to losing one of its big fish to the APC.\n\nA senior party source said though the bid to draft Jonathan into the APC was still seen by many as being in the realm of speculations, members were worried losing him to the APC.\n\n\u201cSome of us are worried of its implications for the PDP, if it turns out to be true. We are worried. But the man has said it is not true. But when you hear these sort of talks, you cannot but be worried. We are watching.\u201d\n\nAlso, a former member of the PDP National Working Committee ( NWC), who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the matter, dismissed talks of Jonathan contesting on APC platform in 2023.\n\nHe, however, said the party would not \u201cmiss the former president, in the event that talks about his romance with the APC are true.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause president Jonathan, since he left office, has not been participating actively in the affairs of the PDP. But for us in PDP, if he goes there, we will revolt against him. We will not go with him. That is truth. The thing is that Jonathan has never been an active participant in the PDP since he lost election in 2015. For us, Jonathan has never been an active member of the PDP. Whatever decision he takes, it is at his peril. He has not provided any purposeful leadership for the PDP since 2015.\u201d\n\nA former member of the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) and former Minister of Transport, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, advised Jonathan not to contemplate going to the APC.\n\nBabatope told Daily Sun, at the weekend, that Jonathan would be diminished if he contests in 2023 on APC platform.\n\n\u201cI hope he does not tarnish his good image by going to contest. He is not a member of APC. He is a former president of the country on the platform of the PDP. And to now go and contest as an APC man will send wrong signals entirely. But I want to advice him because he is an adult, he should think it deeply and come to very reasonable conclusion. I want to advice him, because it is something that will bring him down within seconds,\u201dhe said.\n\nWhen contacted, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said talks about Jonathan\u2019s alleged romance with the APC is a publicity stunt by the ruling party to divert attention from its internal crises.\n\nOlogbunagba said the APC was not bothered about the news, as it was concerned about rallying Nigerians to rescue the country in 2023.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing for us to comment on. It is rumour in the public domain. However, we want to believe that it is part of the stunt of the APC to shift attention from their own confusion within their system.\n\n\u201cWe are not bothered about that. This party cannot be bothered by any stunt being pulled by the APC. PDP is focused. PDP is moving around the country to energize Nigerians to rescue the country,\u201dhe said.\n\nEfforts to get the former president\u2019s reaction were unsuccessful, as his spokesman, Eze, did not respond to repeated calls to his mobile phone.",

          "text": "*Zulum always offers logistics support without prompting, Says GOC\n\nChuks Okocha, Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja and Michael Olugbode in Maiduguri\n\nA former vice president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has decried the continued killings in the northwest zone, particularly the recent attack in Zamfara State, which left over 200 dead, and therefore appealed to the federal government to ramp up security in the zone to stem further waste of lives.\n\nIn the same vein, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, has also described the recent killings in Zamfara by bandits as nothing short of horrific.\n\nAlso in a related development, the acting General Officer Commanding 7 Division of the Nigerian Army, Major General Abdulwahab Eyitayo, has hinted that the Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, always offered logistics and other supports to the Nigerian Army in the ongoing war against Boko Haram insurgents without being asked by the military authorities.\n\nOver 500 fleeing bandits on motorcycles had reportedly attacked five villages and razed their homes, after killing over 200 of the people, recently.\n\nReacting to the development, Atiku in a statement, said, \u201cI expect that security be ramped up to stem this waste of precious human lives.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president explained that, \u201cWhen I expressed my deepest condolences to the people and government of Zamfara State on the 6th of January over the senseless killing of innocent citizens in Bukkuyum and Anka Local Government Areas of the state, little did I know that the tragedy that befell the people was far worse than envisaged.\u201d\n\nHe said it was heartbreaking to have dozens of innocent citizens killed in just one day, lamenting: \u201cIt is a traumatic experience to imagine. Even as I sympathise with people in the affected families and the affected communities, yet again, as they bury their dead, I expect that security be ramped up to stem this waste of precious human lives.\u201d\n\nFarouq, in a statement, condemned the atrocity that followed the invasion of five communities and killing of over 200 people in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas of the state as horrific and tragic.\n\nOver 200 persons were buried today (Saturday) due to the invasion by bandits. We are very saddened by this incessant invasion and killings by bandits and we also worry about the displaced persons, who are fleeing in their hundreds from their communities, especially, the women and children.\n\n\u201cWe sympathise with the government and people of Zamfara State in this trying period and condole with the families of the dead. We pray for the repose of their souls and that peace returns to the state and soon as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nShe, however, directed that relief materials be sent to the Internally Displaced Persons in the state to cushion the effects of the sudden displacement.\n\nReports say more than 10,000 victims had been rendered homeless after their homes were razed by the bandits while scores were still missing.\n\nMeanwhile, Eyitayo, spoke glowingly yesterday about Zulum, where he noted that his support had gone a long way in enhancing the military operation in the Northeast.\n\nEyitayo, speaking during Zulum\u2019s visit to the headquarters of the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army in Maiduguri during a social gathering organised by the army to celebrate the acting GOC\u2019s recent promotion to the rank of a Major General, said the governor had always come to their aid.\n\n\u201cSeverally, without being prompted, you (Governor Zulum) come to our aide to support us (the army) even logistics wise. Through your persistence and unrelenting cooperation and assistance, you have one way or the other, turned the spirit of the soldiers into fighting machines,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GOC, therefore, requested Zulum to convey the gratitude of his officers to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of Army Staff for identifying and promoting deserving soldiers involved with the fight against Boko Haram in Borno State, which he indicated, was highly encouraging.\n\nIn his response, Zulum congratulated the acting GOC and other recently promoted military officers, saying the people of Borno shared the good moment and were happy with it\n\nThe governor said officers and personnel of the military and other security establishment deserve to be supported and encouraged, even as he described their duties as tough, hence, the need for not only support by states, for increase in their entitlements, when the economy permits such considerations by the federal government.\n\nZulum credited his administration\u2019s numerous efforts to the peace-building role of the military, which he said, had led to the safe resettlement of about 18 communities across Borno.\n\nHe said with continued peace-building, more communities would be safely resettled, while some major roads, such as Maiduguri-Damboa road would be opened for the safe use of motorists.\n\nZulum was accompanied to the function by commissioners of Agriculture, Bukar Talba; his sports and youths empowerment counterpart, Sainna Buba and that of transport, Abubakar Tijjani.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Edwin Clark, an Ijaw national leader, says majority of Nigerians believe in state police.\n\nSpeaking during a recent Channels Television interview, President Muhammadu Buhari had said state police is not an option for the nation.\n\nReacting to the president\u2019s statement on Monday, Clark said state police is one of the cardinal points of a federal system.\n\nHe argued that it cannot be discarded over fears that it \u201ccould be used by state governors in persecuting perceived political opponents\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr. President dismissed the call for state police in the country. He said that state police was not an option, that governors will misuse it. He gave an unrelated instance of the relationship between state governors, and local governments, that there is no functional local government in the country,\u201d Clark said.\n\n\u201cWhile the president is right that no local government in this country truly functions as provided by the constitution, not even the joint account under which state governments receive monies on behalf of the local governments, because the accounts are fully controlled by the state governors, it is not enough to dismiss the demand for state police.\n\n\u201cLike I stated in my recent interview, state police is a popular agitation by Nigerians and was robustly discussed and agreed upon during the 2014 national conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is very unfortunate that the state governors who are elected under the party are the ones running the party today. But it is unconstitutional for Mr. President to say that state police, which was even recommended by the El-Rufai committee \u2014 as one of its items under devolution of power to be transferred from the executive list in schedule 1 of the 1999 constitution, as amended, to schedule II of the concurrent list \u2014 should be discarded.\n\n\u201cI totally agree with Mr. President that most state governors have undermined the provisions of the 1999 constitution, where local government is provided for under Section 8. They do not only abuse the joint account system but also engage in establishing caretaker committees, rather than conducting free, fair and democratic elections.\n\n\u201cI also agree with Mr. President that state police could be used by state governors in persecuting perceived political opponents, but it is also true that the federal government is also using the Nigeria Police Force to persecute perceived political opponents, undermining the NASS and obstructing free speeches. But that does not mean that the whole idea of state police should be discarded? That will mean throwing away the baby with the bathwater.\u201d\n\nClark said there is an urgent need to restructure the country and to have a new constitution for the country to survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ijaw leader accused the president of being \u201cinsincere and dishonest\u201d with regard to his campaign promise of restructuring the country.",

He said that state police was not an option, that governors will misuse it. He gave an unrelated instance of the relationship between state governors, and local governments, that there is no functional local government in the country,\u201d Clark said.\n\n\u201cWhile the president is right that no local government in this country truly functions as provided by the constitution, not even the joint account under which state governments receive monies on behalf of the local governments, because the accounts are fully controlled by the state governors, it is not enough to dismiss the demand for state police.\n\n\u201cLike I stated in my recent interview, state police is a popular agitation by Nigerians and was robustly discussed and agreed upon during the 2014 national conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is very unfortunate that the state governors who are elected under the party are the ones running the party today. But it is unconstitutional for Mr. President to say that state police, which was even recommended by the El-Rufai committee \u2014 as one of its items under devolution of power to be transferred from the executive list in schedule 1 of the 1999 constitution, as amended, to schedule II of the concurrent list \u2014 should be discarded.\n\n\u201cI totally agree with Mr. President that most state governors have undermined the provisions of the 1999 constitution, where local government is provided for under Section 8. They do not only abuse the joint account system but also engage in establishing caretaker committees, rather than conducting free, fair and democratic elections.\n\n\u201cI also agree with Mr. President that state police could be used by state governors in persecuting perceived political opponents, but it is also true that the federal government is also using the Nigeria Police Force to persecute perceived political opponents, undermining the NASS and obstructing free speeches. But that does not mean that the whole idea of state police should be discarded? That will mean throwing away the baby with the bathwater.\u201d\n\nClark said there is an urgent need to restructure the country and to have a new constitution for the country to survive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Ijaw leader accused the president of being \u201cinsincere and dishonest\u201d with regard to his campaign promise of restructuring the country.",

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, one of Nollywood\u2019s highest-grossing movies in 2021, and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a busy Thursday afternoon in one of Nigeria\u2019s busiest cities \u2014 Lagos. Three young men who needed to go from Ikotun to Agege hopped into the popular yellow buses known as Danfo.\n\nShortly after the journey began, the conductor asked for payment.\n\nThe man who was to pay their fare had no idea his wallet wasn\u2019t with him and confidently reached for it in its usual place \u2014 his back pocket \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t there. He calmly stuck his hand into the left-back pocket but withdrew it with a panicked look on his face.\n\nThat pocket, too, was empty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreets of Lagos\n\nHis situation instantly became a drama; his fellow commuters, the audience, and he, the protagonist in a stage play with a bad script.\n\nThe conductor, who stood right in front of him, glared at him as he tried to come to terms with the situation.\n\nBeads of sweat had begun to appear on the young man\u2019s head. He wasn\u2019t okay. Although he knew he wouldn\u2019t find it, he searched his other pockets frantically.\n\nHe\u2019d forgotten his wallet at home.\n\nResigned to his fate, he concluded that he and his friends were in trouble. When the conductor finally asked what the problem was, he asked, \u201cCan I do a transfer?\u201d\n\nThe conductor threw his head back in laughter but what followed was a very dark look.\n\nMichael Oluwole, Olamide Afolabi, and Yinka Adewale (Kudi CEO) had a similar experience, which led them \u2014 Oluwole and Afolabi \u2014 to create a digital payment system that is as seamless as cash payments.\n\nThey are the founders of Touch and Pay (TAP), creators of the contactless Cowry card used in paying bus fares. It is especially popular in Lagos, with over 1.5 million users. TAP is currently trying to replicate its success in Kaduna, Kano, Oyo, and Ogun States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoding from OAU to LAUTECH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAP Co-Founder, Olamide Afolabi and Micheal Oluwole.\n\nThe three friends wanted to own a tech company since they were in university, so they did the techiest thing they could think of \u2014 coding.\n\nFrom what Afolabi told me, coding was perhaps the coolest thing to do in university then.\n\n\u201cWe were basically tech enthusiasts. In the university, we devoted most of our time to technology. We participated in Microsoft Imagine Cups and Microsoft student ambassadors. Those were the things that reigned seven or eight years ago. To be cool in school, you just had to be a member of a tech organisation.\u201d\n\nAfolabi went to Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Osun State, Nigeria, while Oluwole and Adewale studied at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria. Though Afolabi wasn\u2019t in the same school as his friends, he said they could still do things together.\n\n\u201cWe came together to participate in Microsoft Imagine Cups, and the first time we did it, we didn\u2019t even qualify. We did it the second time, and we came second, and the third time we won to represent Nigeria in Russia.\u201d\n\nThey were great at coding, and to them, that was all they needed to build a successful tech business, but after a couple of unsuccessful businesses, they quickly realised they couldn\u2019t be more wrong.\n\nThey came up with businesses such as Clinic Bell, a platform that helped doctors and patients secure appointments at a mutually convenient time. Still, the three went broke within a couple of months as their pocket money could not keep the business running.\n\nWhen they returned from Russia, they got into the Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) and learnt that being able to code doesn\u2019t make you a good businessman.\n\nGetting the Lagos deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTAP\u2019s Cowry card\n\nTAP started the process of digitising microtransactions in 2017, but it didn\u2019t start with transportation. It piloted with different sectors before realising transportation was the way to go.\n\n\u201cBetween 2017 and 2019, we ran a lot of pilots. We created wristbands for Gidi Culture Festivals; we collected the Jangali tax in Kwara. We also deployed the technology at Babcock University and LAUTECH. We even tested it with microfinance banks and thrift collectors.\n\n\u201cAnd it was at that point we realised we couldn\u2019t keep stretching ourselves. We were probably a team of eight then.\u201d\n\nThe team asked, \u201cWhich sector can we look at that will give us traction in the shortest amount of time?\u201d\n\nThe answer was transportation, and they decided to focus on digitising transactions in that sector.\n\nOluwole said the decision to focus on transportation put them in the right place at the right time. They started by working with LAGBUS, creating a revenue assurance system that helps track revenue.\n\nImpressed by their work, LAGBUS recommended them to LAGFERRY to do the same thing. But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, everything was about to change for TAP.\n\nSide note: LAGBUS was created by the Lagos State Government in conjunction with a private company in 2007 and has over ten franchises. LAGFERRY, on the other hand, was established in 1983 in conjunction with Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA). LAGBUS and LAGFERRY are under a single regulator, Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA).\n\nPopularly known as BRT buses, LAGBUSes are anchored at several terminals across Lagos, where passengers get tickets to board buses. However, TAP has been contracted by LAGBUS to digitise the payment system. Passengers now load their Cowry cards at terminals instead of paying with cash and getting tickets. They pay by placing the cards on the NFC-enabled devices on the buses.\n\nThe entire country was in lockdown, and governments were saddled with the daunting task of figuring out a way to open up economic activities in the safest way possible. Transportation was obviously a strong spread point for the virus.\n\nExchanging cash, handing out bus tickets, and frequent communication were ways the virus could spread, and the Lagos State Government needed a solution.\n\nAfolabi defined the solution the State wanted specifically as \u201cthe contactless system just like Oyster in the UK.\u201d\n\nA lot of companies that could provide this solution came forward. Oluwole said they came from Cyprus and several other European countries. But their solutions did not conform with the realities of Lagos. He said many of them proffered online transactions, but Internet quality in Lagos and Europe differ significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwole and Afolabi live in Lagos, and they understood that a radical change that was too different from what people were used to would not work. And with enough experience with LAGBUS and LAGFERRY, TAP was the right company for the job. The startup formed a strategic partnership with the Lagos State Government to digitise the transport system.\n\nDigitising microtransactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrotransactions are daily transactions, like paying bus fares and buying things in traffic. They\u2019re transactions done with cash because they\u2019re inexpensive and are not worth the hassle of bank transfers or card payments.\n\nAs insignificant as they might seem, microtransactions are very important to the economy. They are what keep small businesses going. These small businesses are the backbone of the Nigerian economy. According to PwC, they have contributed 48% of the national GDP in the past five years.\n\nHowever, microtransactions are still largely cash-based in Nigeria. Towards the end of 2021, naira notes in circulation rose by 4.6%, signifying a high dependence on cash.\n\nHowever, digitising daily transactions is hard. Afolabi said it is understandable to use bank transfers for rent, school fees, and other large payments, but doing the same for micropayments isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nThe founders thought the best way to digitise small payments would be through contactless cards.\n\nOluwole said, \u201cWe needed to mimic cash transactions, and one of the characteristics of cash is that it is physical. It doesn\u2019t get network issues, and you receive the value immediately. Hence the reason why we went through the contactless route.\n\n\u201cToday, contactless works both online and mostly offline. So, if I perform a transaction, it will be completed whether there is a network connection or not.\u201d\n\nAfolabi chipped in that in the informal sector, it has always been speed over accuracy, which is why cash works.\n\n\u201cAny tech that will digitise cash transitions in the informal sector has to match the speed.\u201d\n\nOther startups have tried to digitise payment for public transport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLagos\u2019 yellow buses. Source: Steemit\n\nThere are many problems with the public transport system in Nigeria, especially Lagos, and the easiest way to sum up these problems is through a single phrase, \u201center with your change.\u201d\n\nThat phrase takes into account the ways of unruly bus conductors, uncomfortable sitting arrangements, and even the battle to secure a place for yourself in old rickety yellow buses.\n\nBut the most apparent meaning of the phrase is, only board a bus with the exact denomination of the bus fare or be prepared to give away your change.\n\nTAP isn\u2019t the first startup attempting to digitise payment on public transportation. In 2019, we featured Gona, a startup digitising bus payments with Quick Response (QR) codes.\n\nPassengers download the Gona app and scan one of the many QR codes that have been pasted in strategic points on the bus to pay their fares. However, we\u2019ve not heard much of the startup; lately, the website, getgona.com is also not functioning.\n\nInterestingly, Afolabi pointed out that TAP is also experimenting with QR codes, but they\u2019ve realised not everyone has a smartphone to scan them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayment with QR code\n\nAccording to Statista, 48.12% of Nigerians use mobile Internet. It is projected that this number will hit 59.7% by 2026. Afolabi admits that the smartphone penetration in Nigeria is definitely growing, and scanning QR codes as a means of payment could be an iteration for TAP.\n\nATM cards have contactless capabilities too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nThe touch to pay technology on contactless cards is made possible by Near Field Communication technology or NFC. While NFC is just catching on as a payment method, it is not exactly a shiny new technology.\n\nIn 2006, Nokia created the first NFC-enabled mobile phone and most flagship smartphones since 2010 have NFC. Once a card or device has an NFC chip, it can exchange information with other NFC-enabled devices.\n\nMost bank cards also have this NFC chip in them. A radio wave image at the corner of an ATM card indicates it has an NFC chip. So why can\u2019t we just pay for bus rides with our bank cards?\n\nAfolabi\u2019s first answer is that bank cards still need the Internet to carry out transactions with NFC because the money has to be debited from the bank account. Where there\u2019s a network timeout or the recipient\u2019s bank isn\u2019t available, transactions will fail.\n\nOluwole explained this further with a bit of humour, asking, \u201cWould you go to the bank to complain that a \u20a6200 transaction did not go through? The current infrastructure we have today doesn\u2019t really support microtransactions,s and that\u2019s why we are creating a new framework.\u201d\n\nIt is also quite expensive for the merchant and the customer. According to Afolabi, there are charges that the card issuer (MasterCard or Visa), the bank, and the terminal provider deduct from every transaction, which is to the detriment of the merchant.\n\nAnother major reason why bank cards will not work is that \u201cwe still have so many people that don\u2019t have bank accounts.\u201d\n\nThe Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) puts the number of Nigerians with a bank verification number (BVN) at 51.8 million as of January 2022. This leaves about 54 million Nigerian adults without a BVN.\n\nHe, however, admitted that TAP is working with some banks so users can top up their Cowry cards directly from their banks.\n\nA path to true financial inclusion?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it\u2019s starting with transportation, TAP has plans to digitise the entire informal market with contactless cards and perhaps it could be a way to achieve true financial inclusion.\n\nThe founders explained that Cowry cards generate financial data about people that might not even have bank accounts.\n\nAn instance is how they\u2019ve deployed the technology in other states like Kaduna, Ogun, and Oyo. In Kaduna, for example, the Cowry card helps the government receive revenue from transport operators.\n\nOluwole pointed out that receiving the revenues via cash through a collector left out a lot of information that could be valuable to the government. The actual bus drivers or bus owners were unknown to the government even though they pay taxes regularly.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re changing that model by giving them a card which could also serve as their association ID card. They can fund this card and make their daily payments with it. The more they make these payments with the card, the more the government has access to them.\u201d\n\nPaying with the cards gives the government information about individual drivers and how much they pay tax. Giving tax returns or tax reliefs then becomes easy.\n\nBus drivers could also access insurance through the plethora of data the card payment system provides.\n\nBoth founders did not immediately admit they were positioned to solve the problem of true financial inclusion in the country when I asked them. However, they inadvertently did when they enthusiastically painted scenarios where the Cowry card could facilitate financial inclusion.\n\nOne of those scenarios is passengers getting rides on credit due to information available about their ride patterns.\n\nIt is important to note that all these could be possible without even having a bank account.\n\n\u201cThese are informal transactions, and nobody has been able to penetrate this sector. We are creating a simple platform that provides visibility into these transactions, and all of a sudden, the entire ecosystem changes and now we have data.\u201d Oluwole said.\n\nThe company makes money by charging a 2% or 5% fee on transactions. Oluwole hinted that merchants are happy to part with the fees because it doesn\u2019t only cover the transactions but the entire process of digitising a business.\n\nThe company has grown so far without raising any funds, but Communications Manager, Damilola Adebesin, said they have plans to raise in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

I\u2019ve got quite an interesting lineup for you today, including some information (probably unwarranted) about super apps.\n\nSo, today I\u2019m discussing:\n\nBFREE $1.7 million pre-Series A\n\nInstant transfers in Tanzania\n\nAfrica\u2019s startup laws\n\nBFREE raises $1.7 million pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBFREE team; Source: TechCrunch\n\nNigerian credit fintech startup, BFREE has announced a $1.7 million pre-Series A as the company looks to expand to Asia, South America, Europe, and across Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis expansion drive will see the company move into 16 countries, including Ghana, India, Uganda, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Russia, Poland, Pakistan, and Indonesia.\n\nThe round saw participation from 4Di Capital, Octerra Capital, VestedWorld, Voltron Capital, Logos Ventures, and several other angel investors. This comes after the fintech\u2019s $800,000 seed raise in May 2021 and brings total disclosed funding to $2.5 million.\n\nIf you live in Nigeria or Kenya, chances are you might have received a text from a loan company debt shaming a friend, colleague, or family member. To solve issues like this and with experience working for digital lending startups, Julian Flosbach (CEO), Chukwudi Enyi (COO), and Moses Nmor (CPO) founded BFREE in 2020.\n\nCurious about BFREE? You should check out this in-depth article: How Nigerian credit fintech startup, BFREE, is helping Africans repay their loans\n\nPer TechCrunch, the company has hired two additions to the team: Konrad Pawlus (CTO) and Yohan Theatre, Head of Data Decision-Making and Financial Engineering.\n\nThe startup says it currently serves around 800,000 customers and has followed up 1.1 million defaulters to date, with Flosbach telling TechCrunch that the company looks to handle 1.4 million profiles by the end of next month.\n\nThe African funding scene is off to a good start this year, with startups in different industries already bagging significant amounts. Last year was a good one, and you can check out Chimgozirim\u2019s analysis here: African startups raised $1 million every 2 hours in 2021 \u2014 Africa: The Big Deal\n\nTanzanians to enjoy instant transfers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has said that it expects to roll out its new payment system, Tanzania Instant Payment System (TIPS), in February 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, what does TIPS do? This payment system would enable Tanzanians to instantly transfer money to people in their mobile contact list without searching for their phone numbers. It would also allow the interoperability of digital financial services among payment service providers to make transactions cost-effective and secure.\n\nEssentially, users of all digital payment systems, including mobile money operators like Airtel Money, Tigo, M-Pesa, and HaloPesa, will be registered under a single platform and anyone can send money by searching the name of the registered recipient in the system.\n\nUnder Tanzania\u2019s present payment system, transfers are made within two hours of the initiation of the transaction. In an increasingly digital world, this could be a roadblock for everyday use cases in markets and shops.\n\nThree years in the making: preparations for TIPS first began in June 2018 following the passing into law of the Payment Systems Act 2015, which authorised the BoT to upgrade and create new financial systems. It was to be launched in 2020 but got shelved due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAfter several delays, a potential date of December 2021 was given but was postponed due to upgrades being made to the system.\n\nComparing Africa\u2019s startup laws\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s recent history with startup acts appears promising. From the first foray by Tunisia in 2018 to the second by Senegal in 2020, countries on the continent are creating enabling environments for these disruptors.\n\nRecently, Nigeria-based technological advisory firm, Tech Hive Advisory and Africa-focused tech policy research NGO, Ikigai Innovation Initiative released a guide on African startup acts: Start-up Laws in Africa Vol. 2.\n\nThe guide highlighted and compared regulations \u2014 proposed and already existing \u2014 from six countries: Tunisia, Senegal, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Algeria.\n\nComparing the first five countries, the guide focused on the material and territorial scope of the different laws and regulations, labels and governance, incentives, and enforcement.\n\nAlthough there were several similarities, these regulations differed on several counts. For example, only Tunisia provides a paid vacation to resurrect fledgling startups, fully sponsored by the government. All five are quiet on monetary penalties.\n\nInterestingly, going by the four parameters, The Nigeria Startup Bill (NSB) appears to rank highest, with Tunisia coming in a close second.\n\nHowever, I noticed that on the table, regarding sanctions like withdrawal of labels and marks, The NSB got positive marks, contradicting an earlier position in the guide which stated that there were no provisions for a withdrawal of labels and marks.\n\nThe NSB has received approval from Nigeria\u2019s Federal Executive Council and is expected to be presented to the National Assembly by Muhammadu Buhari, the country\u2019s president.\n\nCurrently, it appears there are no publicly available copies of the bill.\n\nWe can, however, (re)read Emmanuel\u2019s Paul\u2019s analysis here: Startup Acts: Can the decade\u2019s sexiest law save Nigeria\u2019s thriving but uncertain startup ecosystem?\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nI\u2019m back with my music recommendations, and this weekend, I listened to a playlist I curated myself.

Data from various sources show that startups on the continent received over $4 billion from investors in 2021.

While this percentage is less than that of 2020 (2%), it is partly explained by the fact that funding raised in 2021 was 2.5x more than 2020\u2019s figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that while the total amount raised by women is increasing, the percentage of funding going to startups founded or led by women is on the decline from 4% in 2019 to 0.95% in 2021.\n\nTo be fair, women worldwide have a harder time raising money than men, and with Africa\u2019s startup scene in its early stages, that is to be expected. However, more can and should be done to fund African startups founded by women. Fortunately, it seems more investors are willing to do this with firms like FirstCheck Africa providing funds for female founders.\n\nFintech reigned supreme\n\nAs has been the case in the last few years, fintech startups received the bulk of funding in 2021. According to Briter Bridges, 62% (~$2.9 billion) of total funding in African startups went to fintech startups, double the 31% recorded in 2020.\n\nHealthtech and Biotech follow closely at 8%, with logistics (7%), education (5%), and cleantech (5%) rounding up the top five sectors by investment value. With payments still posing a problem for businesses and individuals, fintech looks set to retain its place as a preferred destination for investment in Africa for a while.\n\nFour countries still dominated\n\nJust like fintech and men dominate funding received, the Big Four \u2013 Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Kenya \u2013 still dominate Africa\u2019s funding scene. For example, Nigeria alone accounts for a whopping $1.5 billion of the total funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax AB, an Egyptian eCommerce startup raised a $55 million Series A across two rounds in 2021.\n\nOne country that is worth talking about is Egypt. With 562 active tech startups, it sits behind only Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya as the countries with the most startups in Africa. Startups in the country also showed significant growth in terms of the amount of funding they received. However, Briter Bridges\u2019 report shows a growing interest in Francophone Africa, inspired, perhaps by Wave\u2019s unicorn status.\n\nMore $100+ million deals\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you hear of deals exceeding $100 million in Africa. Even when they happen, they are often mergers and acquisitions, but 2021 saw the highest number of $100+ million deals ever. There were 12 deals worth at least $100 million, accounting for $1.9 billion of the total funding value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTradeDepot. Source: Supplied\n\nSome startups that raised at least $100 million include Andela, $200 million Series E; Flutterwave, $170 million Series C; Chipper Cash, $250 million Series C across two separate rounds; OPay, $400 million Series C; Trade Depot, $110 million Series B; and Jumo, $400 million led by Fidelity Management & Research Company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForeign investments dominate, but local investors stepped up.\n\nSo far, foreign investors still dominate funding for African startups. Briter Bridges reports that the United States and the United Kingdom lead the way. In Africa, South Africa and Mauritius are the top two countries where local investors have their headquarters. Asian investors are not left out with growing interest from Singaporean, Chinese, and Japanese investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoftyInc Capital Management Management Partners. Source: Supplied\n\nHowever, local African investors are increasingly stepping up activities. In 2021, several African investors threw their hats in the ring or raised new funds. Some of these investors include Ventures Platform, Savannah Fund, FirstCheck Africa, LoftyInc Capital, and Flat6Labs.\n\nOn a lighter note, some of the things that stand out include the fact that about 43% of startup founders have their alma mater on the continent. I may be reaching, but I believe this helps them tap into a wider network when raising money for their startups, considering most of Africa\u2019s startup funding comes from outside the continent. However, it is also a reminder that Africa\u2019s education system still has a long way to go before it catches up with its Western counterparts.\n\nWith the heights reached by African startups in 2021, it is logical to expect them to be matched and hopefully eclipsed in 2022. Only time will tell, but 2022 looks set to see more growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Nevin, partner/chief economist, PwC Nigeria, says.\n\nAccording to Nevin, Nigeria can achieve this through a visible improvement in the business environment as well as an increased and assured level of security.\n\nAs a percentage of the total investment inflow into Nigeria, FDI amounted to 6.23 percent in the review period. The largest amount of capital importation by type was received through portfolio investment, which accounted for 70.30 percent ($1,217.21m) of total capital importation. This was followed by Other Investment, which accounted for 23.47 percent ($406.35m).\n\nAnalysis of the latest NBS report reveals that the total value of capital importation into Nigeria in the third quarter of 2021 stood at $1.73 billion from $875.62 million in the preceding quarter of 2021, showing an increase of 97.73 percent.\n\nWhen compared with the corresponding quarter of 2020, capital importation as well increased by 18.47 percent from $1.46 billion.\n\nThe Nigerian Investment Promotion Council (NIPC) says Nigeria is attracting an average of $2 billion of FDI annually, which is significantly lower than the $10 billion estimates needed to achieve the desired economic growth.\n\nThe trend of declining foreign investment, particularly FDI, is a worry for Nigeria in dire need of private capital to boost economic growth and create jobs.\n\nSince 2017, when oil-dependent Nigeria emerged from its first economic recession in five years (exited its second in 2020), not only has the country\u2019s economic growth been sluggish but only a few sectors triggered the expansion, further undermining the country\u2019s capacity to create enough jobs to meet the growing number of labour market entrants.\n\nA breakdown of the NSB report for the review period shows that by sectors, capital importation into financing had the highest inflow of $469.17 million, amounting to 27.10 percent of total capital imported in the third quarter of 2021. This was closely followed by capital imported into the banking sector valued at $460.39 million (26.59%) and the production sector $323.83 million (18.70%).\n\nNigeria\u2019s labour-intensive sectors with the potential to reduce the country\u2019s 33.3 percent unemployment rate, like the agriculture and construction sectors, respectively, attracted 1.90 percent and 0.001 percent worth of capital importation in Q3.\n\nUnemployment in Africa\u2019s most populous nation rose to its highest in over a decade at 33.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, a mirror of the fragile state of Nigeria\u2019s economic progress.\n\nThe weak per capita income of Africa\u2019s largest economy means that the economy is not creating enough opportunities to accommodate a fast-rising population, a factor that has continued to drive the number of jobless people.\n\nCapital importation by country of origin reveals that the United Kingdom ranked top as the source of capital imported into Nigeria in the third quarter of 2021 with a value of $709.8 million, accounting for 40.99 percent of total capital imported in the period under review. This was followed by capital imports from South Africa and the United States valued at $389.54 million (22.50%) and $257.12 million (14.85%), respectively.",

          "text": "A new study suggests that immunity developed against Omicron can also protect against Delta, justifying how omicron outpaced Delta as the most dominant coronavirus variant.\n\nResearchers, who observed how immunity from the highly infectious Omicron variant performs in 33 participants in South Africa, discovered that the ability to neutralise Omicron rose 14 times after 14 days, while immunity against Delta was enhanced four times.\n\nThis was detected in previously vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals who were infected with COVID-19 in the Omicron infection wave soon after symptoms started.\n\nResearchers think this sets a positive tone in phasing out variants fostering the burden of coronavirus disease, ensuring re-infections with Delta become less likely.\n\nThis also implies that while Omicron displaces Delta, it takes over re-infections in individuals with weak Delta infections and then counteracts itself.\n\n\u201cThe increase in Delta variant neutralization in individuals infected with Omicron may result in a decreased ability of Delta to re-infect those individuals. Along with emerging data indicating that Omicron, at this time in the pandemic, is less pathogenic than Delta, such an outcome may have positive implications in terms of decreasing the Covid-19 burden of severe disease,\u201d the study states.\n\nEnd of acute phase?\n\nThe study has not been peer-reviewed but if it hatches out, it could see the beginning of COVID-19 transition into a less harmful disease as Omicron dominates further, analysts suggest.\n\nRead also: COVID-19 infections near 10m in Africa\n\nAccording to a study led by researchers at South Africa\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases, individuals infected with Omicron between October and early December 2021 had lower odds of being admitted to the hospital compared to those infected with other variants \u2013 equivalent to a roughly 80 percent reduction in risk.\n\nThe study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, also looked at disease severity once someone was admitted to hospital with Omicron, compared to known Delta infections, and identified a roughly 30 percent reduction in the risk of severe complications.\n\nOther studies suggest that Omicron spares the lungs, considering that upper respiratory infections are much less dangerous than infections that embed themselves in the lower respiratory tract, as previous COVID strains have.\n\nHowever, there might be downsides when it comes to future protection, George Abraham, president, American College of Physicians said in a monitored report.\n\nHe said weaker infections tend to lead to weaker and shorter-lived immunity. \u201cPeople with more severe illness tend to get more robust immunity, which may last longer. People who have milder infections tend to have less robust immunity,\u201d he adds.\n\nThat means there\u2019s a chance that people who catch Omicron and experience it as a mild upper respiratory illness might not gain much protection if a more severe variant emerges.\n\nAnd getting a mild or even a severe case of COVID won\u2019t protect forever. Any immunity from an Omicron infection, or from any other variant, is fleeting, Abraham says, noting that the bodies destroy antibodies over time, and viruses continually mutate.\n\nEventually, the combined effects of a declining immune response and future mutations will allow the virus to elbow its way back into previously-infected cells.\n\nThis occurs with the common cold, infects over and over. People who\u2019ve already caught the virus can catch it again after some time passes, as can people who\u2019ve been vaccinated.\n\nNo spike in Omicron cases will change the potential for breakthrough cases, apparently. But we can hope that when most people have some level of immunity, either from vaccination or previous infection, relatively mild cases will become the norm and the spread will slow, some analysts say.",

          "text": "From PETER OKORE, Umuahia\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) says the party is moving towards reconciling all existing warring factions in the party in all the states of the federation, before its proposed National Convention scheduled to hold next month (February).\n\nChairman of the 2022 APC Special State Congress Committee for Abia state, Hon. Kolawale Babatunde, who dropped this hint in Umuahia, while announcing the results of the state Congress, said that the party cannot afford to go for the National convention in factions.\n\nHe said reconciliation committees have been dispatched to states where factions existed to harmonize contending issues and report back to the National Headquarters in Abuja, pointing out that the crux of the whole crisis is all about \u201cinterests\u201d.\n\n\u2018It is good we have a good leader of the party, in the person of Gov. M.M. Buni of Yobe state, who is out for reconciliation of factions,\u201d he said.\n\nIn pursuance of the new move of the APC, a Special State congress of the Party was held in Abia state , last Saturday, to fill the vacancy created by the sudden death of the former Chairman, Mr. Enyinnaya Harbor, who was elected in October 2021 but died November 2021 after a brief sickness. He is yet to be buried.\n\nSpeaking after the election before declaring Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu, winner and new chairman of the party in Abia state, Hon Babatunde explained that the Special Congress was conducted in- line with the Party Constitution. He described Ononogbu as the only candidate for the race and that he scored a total vote of 1,069 out of a total of 1,075 votes cast and 1,080 of delegates from the 17 Local Government Areas of Abia state accredited to vote.\n\nHe said the election was supervised by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party from Abuja, the National secretariat of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, some Party functionaries from different states of the federation as well as State and National Houses of Assembly members. There were also security operatives drawn from the private sector, the police and Civil Defense organizations.\n\nHe commended all who contributed in one way or the other to make the congress a success.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, the new chairman, Dr. Ononogbu thanked the organizers of the congress and the national body of APC for the honour done him and promised to work as a team-member in the bid to carry APC to a higher level.\n\nHe said he was on a rescue mission to take over Abia state from the PDP in the 2023 general elections. He paid glowing tribute to the late immediate-past chairman of the Party in Abia, Enyinnaya Harbor, saying that the late Harbor was dedicated, honest and a credible man, who was poised to take APC higher in Abia.\n\nIn his own speech, the Publicity secretary of the party in Abia state, Mr Okeh Ezeala claimed that the existing two factions of the APC in Abia are gradually fusing into one, saying that all the party officials in the Donatus Nwankpa-led parallel faction were all at the Special congress to express their loyalty and support to the Ikechi Emenike-led faction (now recognized by the leadership of the party).

          "title": "2023: Buhari\u2019s endgame plan in danger",
          "text": "By Uche Chris\n\nFate is uncanny in its dealing with mankind. Oftentimes, man may have devised the best positively profitable end for himself only to see it unravel before his eyes. Religionists put it this way: Man proposes, God (fate) disposes. Whether in politics, business or social life, it happens so frequently as not to bear further proof.\n\nAnd this seems to be the prospective fortune of Nigeria\u2019s sitting president, Muhammadu Buhari whose tenure of office expires either in May or June, 2023. Virtually everything he had planned as exit strategy has come unstuck and the well-choreographed script spinning out of control, with his eight years in power looking like a pack of cards seemingly about to tumble.\n\nBoth in governance and party politics, the president\u2019s back is against the wall and his supposed legacy in jeopardy. Insecurity reigns across the country with massacres taking place by the day in his own geopolitical zone, northwest, with little response from security agencies and only what now seems as his usually empty threat to the bandits.\n\nLast week, the president in a television interview did not hide his immediate desire to retire, perhaps overwhelmed by the problems. For a man who fought hard to win the election after three previous attempts, it was an admission of failure. Generally, most people are reluctant to leave power, but the president appears already eager to quit.\n\nThere are some reasons for the president to be despondent. His performance has been abjectly poor on all fronts, including security, economy and social. All development indicators declined under the president leaving Nigerians in far worse position than they were in 2015, when he assumed power.\n\nInflation, which was single digit in 2015, has remained at high double digit throughout his terms; naira value had declined threefold since 2015; public debt has risen threefold; unemployment rate has doubled from 18 percent to 33 percent; GDP has plunged fivefold with two recessions; and insecurity has worsened across the country with the northwest becoming a killing field.\n\nSadly for Buhari and the party, the main condition that led to his victory, namely, the crisis in PDP, seems to have been resolved, with the party positioning for power after it successfully conducted its national convention in October 2021 against all odds. The onus is now on the ruling party and President Buhari to redeem the party from imminent collapse.\n\nThe worsening crisis in the All Progressives Congress, APC the party that brought President Buhari to power is a direct assault and indeed, revolt, against his succession plan. The president may be the most powerful political figure in the country, however, in the party he is a mere figure head, because the governors who control the states\u2019 structures of the party, are the real power brokers and king makers.\n\nIn over 23 states, including Lagos and Kano, its major political strongholds, the party is in disarray with several factions and dozens of court cases. It is a bewildering fact to the president that he and the party have lost control; and he was frank enough to admit this in a recent television interview.\n\n\u201cAPC must put its house in order quickly before 2023 election; otherwise it will lose power to the opposition party\u201d, he said.\n\nFrantic moves had followed the open admission by the president as Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau state was at the Villa shortly afterwards to consult with him and promised a further consultation with an enlarged team of governors last Sunday, which expectedly failed to hold, provoking speculations that the centre can no longer hold.\n\nA serious hurdle for the party to scale is the national convention to elect new party executives and the mode of election. Although this may not have direct reference to the successor to Buhari, however, the zoning of party offices gives clear indication and direction to the likely zone that will produce the next presidential candidate of the party.\n\nInitially, the Caretaker committee led by the governor of Yobe state, Mai Mala Bunu, was put in place specifically to conduct the national convention after six months, which was the constitutional tenure of the committee. But the committee kept elongating its tenure by adding new briefs to its duty, such as producing new membership register, and reconciling aggrieved members, which has remained a tall order\n\nConvention date had been fixed and postponed severally. The last postponement was in November, which shifted the date from December to February, as if it will never come. Now, with the new date in sight, all hell seems to be let loose, as another postponement may sound the death kneel of the party. President Buhari\u2019s dilemma now is the adoption and choice of consensus candidate.\n\nThe governors do not want to leave anything to chance. Bola Tinubu, who declared his intention to run for president, after meeting Buhari in Aso Rock on Monday, has enough war chest to sway some governors and their delegates at individual and personal level in any contest. So, the governors have decided to do away with election altogether to ensure that their preferred outcome is achieved, even against the president\u2019s best wish.\n\nThis explains the controversy over the electoral amendment bill vetoed by President Buhari on December 19, 2021. Section 78 of the Bill and the clause on direct primary, which was not originally part of the bill, was promoted and inserted by the Speaker of the lower chamber to checkmate the dominance of governors in deciding the party candidates.\n\nHowever, pressure from the governors, who saw through the gambit, forced the president, who had initially expressed support for it after visits by heads of the two chambers of the NASS, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, and Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, respectively, suddenly development cold feet and vetoed it.\n\nHe may have realized too late that he does not have the power to determine the party\u2019s succession plan; which must be a sobering truth for him. To his chagrin, all the schemes and plots of the two major blocs in the party to achieve a certain predetermined outcome have been thwarted by the governors, leaving both the president and the cabal nonplussed.\n\nThere are three tendencies in the APC, namely, the Presidency and the cabal; the Tinubu bloc and the governors. The New PDP, which was instrumental in defeating former president Jonathan, has been sucked in by the presidency, and no longer has a separate identity. President Buhari\u2019s first mistake was to allow the governors to impose one of them as the Care taker chairman after the ouster of elected chairman, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nOshiomhole\u2019s election as party chairman was perceived as a major power shift in the party in favour of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the national leader of the party, and a key merger partner of Buhari. He is an acolyte of Tinubu and his headship of the party raised alarm bell for most stakeholders in the party toward 2023.\n\nOshiohmole himself did not help matter as his bungling of the 2019 polls in several states particularly, Zamfara and Rivers, sealed his fate and handed the governors with the ammunition to oust him. But the coup would have failed without the president support. However, the surprise was that the president and his minders did not see this coming. Perhaps, the fear of Tinubu united his perceived common enemies.\n\nAs it stands, if any elections were to be conducted today, it is most likely that the ruling party will be defeated and this looks as the most obvious fate for the party going forward. This is the prospect the president warned against in the interview. APC may be a one president ruling party, which would defeat the very objective and purpose of the merger that brought it to power.\n\nPresident Buhari may have become APC\u2019s only unifying factor and trump card. But his own maladministration has compounded the crisis in the party by its woeful performance.\n\nIn his reaction, a senior journalist, columnist and author, Lanre Adewole, described the president as a sitting duck who has lost control of the narratives.\n\n\u201cIt is almost a given that the current administration has lost control. Even senior members of Mr. Buhari\u2019s party regularly allude to the obvious mismanagement of national wellbeing, though mostly in private conversations. Yoruba will say, \u2018eyin ajanaku la nyo ida\u2019 (swords are only swung in bravado in elephant\u2019s absence).\n\n\u201cEveryone lines up in loyalty in public, except those ready to face the EFCC. But how long can force keep the falling and failing entity together.\n\n\u201cToday, APC is officially fragmented in 23 states with parallel excos from ward to state level and in a couple of cases like Lagos, ending with five excos.\n\n\u201cWhen Buhari used Villa as tiger\u2019s visage to throw Oshiomhole and his NWC gang out, there was a promise to deal with party members seeking judicial redress. Incidentally, Aregbesola\u2019s men in Osun and Lai\u2019s men in Kwara are in court and nothing has happened to anyone.\n\n\u201cParty chieftains who have been schemed out of political relevance and influence in their states are ignoring the president\u2019s admonition to explore and exhaust internal mechanism for conflict-resolution, of which the appeal process is part of.\n\n\u201cEven Ibikunle Amosun, the president\u2019s well-known enforcer, is not heeding the falconer (Buhari) on this. He shunned the appeal panel and didn\u2019t go to court. Ibrahim Shekarau shunned appeal too.\n\n\u201cWhat should agitate the mind of a real leader of a functioning party, which the president should be, by convention, is, what are my people up to\u201d, declared Adewole.\n\nAlso speaking, Abia Onyike, social critic and spokesperson for Alaigbo Development Foundation, told this medium that the crisis in APC and their inability to organise a convention shows that the party is just a coalition of all kinds of tendencies that came together to hijack political power for the purposes of revenge, and not necessarily for national development. And now having thrown the country into a major calamity, pressure is being mounted on them to leave the scene.\n\n\u201cSo, they are thrown into confusion. They can no longer reorganize themselves. Buhari who should be in charge. He has been quite aloof and doesn\u2019t care what happens in the country and so it appears that his regime has been hijacked by his kitchen cabinet and he himself does not even care what happens even in the party\u2026 \u201c\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The Governor Gboyega Oyetola faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, has urged the National Reconciliation Committee to disregard whatever is contained in the petitions forwarded to it by the dissenting members of the party called The Osun Progressives (TOP).\n\nThe Ilerioluwa faction of the APC loyal to Governor Oyetola, who described TOP\u2019s requests as self-serving, misleading, sarcastic, spurious and baseless, called on the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led Reconciliation Committee to dismiss the allegation in its entirety as it was meant to clandestinely destroy the corporate image of the party in the State.\n\nThe Ilerioluwa faction\u2019s position was made known when the Committee met with them and the patron of the group at the Government House, Osogbo on Monday.\n\nResponding to some of the issues raised and prayers made by TOP members to the Reconciliation Committee, the Secretary, Ilerioluwa Faction\u2019s Congress Committee, Sunday Akere, claimed that the allegation of alienation of party leaders was false and way off from the truth.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said the present leadership structure was put in place by Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola and inherited by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola until few additions were made just about few months ago.\n\nOn the allegation that the present governor hinged most of his policy implementations and executions on the platform that ushered his emergence, Ilerioluwa, Akere noted that the emergence of Ilerioluwa was more or less like the emergence of Oranmiyan created by the immediate past Governor Rauf Aregbesola that ushered him to power, adding that since Oyetola was elected governor, the party has taken the front burner in all decisions making and implementation.\n\nAkerem who noted that TOP was formed purposeful by those that believed in an \u201cAudio\u201d promise given them without the knowledge and consent of the governor to be made one thing or the other in government, said the allegation of \u2018sit-tight syndrome\u2019 was not correct because the Ilerioluwa APC in adopting consensus as suggested, ensured that those that were not active or doing well in positions they were holding were replaced.\n\nAccording to him, in the preparation for the recently-concluded congresses, the governor and some party leaders carried everybody along and acted in conformity with the party guidelines and resolutions reached at all levels as the elections went smoothly in all the wards, local governments and state levels.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe called on the Committee to ask the petitioners (TOP members) to produce those that screened their purported aspirants, those that conducted their purported congresses, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission that supervised their congresses, the security agencies present at the venue they claimed they used among others, as demanded by electoral guidelines.\n\n\u201cTheir prayer asking the Reconciliation Committee to recognise their Congresses is misplaced and distractive because the Committee is to appeal to frayed nerves to give peace a chance and not deciding on the long-concluded Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Committee should take note that, these so-called TOP members have constituted themselves into a team more vicious than the opposition. They do not have respect for the governor or the leadership of the party headed by Prince Gboyega Famodun. The manner in which they deride the programmes and achievements of the governor shows clearly that some of them have made up their minds on leaving the party if they cannot get what they want.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in turns, the chairman, Osun APC Elders\u2019 Caucus, called \u201cIgbimo Agba\u201d, Engr. Sola Akinwumi; Senate spokesman and Senator representing Osun Central Senatorial District, Bashiru Ajibola; former Osun Deputy Governors, Senator Christopher Iyiola Omisore; Mrs Titilayo Ponle; Prince Adeleke Adewoyin; Deputy Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Simeon Popoola; the party chairman-elect, Prince Gboyega Famodun; reaffirmed the commitment of the party\u2019s leadership to ensure unity and oneness.\n\nThey passed vote of confidence in the governor and the leadership and members of the party just as they described the congresses held in the state as most credible and acceptable by all, noting that the leadership of the party would not be distracted by any form of internal or external force.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, noted that their presence at the Government House was part of efforts to ensure fair hearing, equity and justice as it would serve as a forum for the party leadership to respond to and defend some of the allegations raised and petitions filed before it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou are aware that APC like any human endeavours has issues that are affecting the free flow of the affairs of the party, hence the inauguration of the Committee to restore peace. It is natural for human beings to have conflicts, but what is important is to resolve it.\n\n\u201cWe are here to work for the unity, harmony and love within and among the party loyalists.\n\n\u201cWhen we came yesterday, our port of call was to visit Mr Governor to declare that we are at his domain. We have started to take requests, and we felt it was necessary to hear from you too. That is why we are here. We have served the copies of the petitions to the Governor. We expect to have some responses. Nothing is expected to be covered,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Governor of Osun, Adegboyega Oyetola, commended the Committee for taking the bull by the horns, just as he expressed confidence in its ability to carry out the task with fairness and equity.\n\nHe expressed delight at the presence of who-is-who in the party, saying the large turn out of the party leaders was an indication that his Administration was open to all and that power resides in the party.",

May we have sense in our lifetimes.\u201d\n\n@BrewsterHerr: \u201cNigeria is at an en-passe. History is about to repeat itself. Remember MKO, the same thing will most likely happen to Tinubu, either he loses the ticket in APC or in the general elections. Even if he wins both, there is no escaping the turmoil 2023 has in store for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n@__Ahmadak: \u201cTinubu circle is massive in the southwest and by extension to the north. That man has a lot of REAL MADE MEN with him and he understands this politics. If he decides to run, I don\u2019t think any force can stop him. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n@DubemMartin: \u201c7 years of the Buhari/Tinubu alliance in power is hard suffering and pain. It will be foolish for Nigerians to allow the same mess to continue. They will manipulate it. Best way for people to stop them is to rise now and demand for a RESTRUCTURED Nigeria or REFERENDUM to decide our future.\u201d\n\n@sophysoo: \u201cTinubu becoming president? Nigerians should get set for more problems. We can\u2019t continue with these problems, from Buhari to Tinubu? Nigerians should reject it.\u201d\n\n@Awafiq_\u201dThere\u2019s no incongruity between Tinubu and Osinbajo campaigning for the presidency. They are probably testing the waters to see which candidate has more approval ratings.\u201d\n\n@Realifeanyieze: \u201cTinubu declared to run for president in 2023 by informing Buhari of his intention. I wish him the best, Tinubu isn\u2019t what we need to move this Nigeria forward.\u201d\n\n@MaryNekky1 wrote: \u201cTinubu na Buhari pro-max, baba go and retire, please don\u2019t ruin my life as a Nigerian.\u201d\n\n@dekezman wrote: \u201cIf you\u2019re planning to vote Tinubu next year after voting Buhari twice, then you need to really reevaluate your life.\u201d",

Microscopic sections also confirmed these findings.\n\n\u201cDeath was from septicemia, following infections of the lungs and kidneys arising from ankle wound.\n\n\u201cNo evidence of blunt force trauma in this body. The findings in the oesophagus and stomach are not compatible with chemical intoxication. Death in this case is natural,\u201d the result stated.\n\nThe DPP had stated in Paragraphs Three and Four of its advice dated January 4 that the late student, on November 20, 2021, and November 21, 2021, suffered injuries while playing football with his friends in school and was taken to a sickbay by his friend and was released to his family on November 23, 2021.\n\nThe late Oromoni was taken to Warri by his father on November 26, 2021, and was being treated at home by a medical doctor, according to the DPP advice.\n\nThe DPP also stated in the advice that while being treated at home, the deceased told a family friend names of some senior students of the college who allegedly beat him for refusing to join a secret group.\n\nIt added that the deceased alleged that he was given an obnoxious substance by the senior students to drink.\n\nOn November 29, 2021, the deceased was taken to a diagnostic centre at Warri for a scan which revealed hepatomegaly due to acute viral hepatitis, according to the advice.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, his condition deteriorated and he allegedly died while being rushed to the hospital, it added.
