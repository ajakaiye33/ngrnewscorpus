          "text": "Mr George Omo-Iduhon, Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation Europe (NIDOE), Italy Chapter, said more than 1.5 million registered Nigerians urgently needed the Nigerian passport.\n\nOmo-Iduhon stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Saturday while reflecting on the activities of NIDOE in Europe.\n\nNAN reports that NIDOE is the European arm of a global Nigerian diaspora network, established in year 2000 by former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nNIDOE has its headquarters in London, where it serves 21 regional chapters.\n\nOmo-Iduhon said that out of about three million Nigerians registered in Italy, 1.5 million of them needed passports, which had prevented them from returning home or getting jobs.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems we are facing as Nigerians living in Italy is acute shortage of Nigerian passport. Most times, we go to the embassy to address the problem.\n\n\u201cWhat we normally get as response is the shortage of booklets and backlogs. The government should help to address this problem because Italy serves as the gateway to other countries in Europe, especially for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians prefer to have their political asylum in Italy. In Italy, we have more Nigerians than we have in other European countries; the registered Nigerians according to database are three million aside the undocumented ones.\n\n\u201cAbout 1.5 million Nigerians in Italy don\u2019t have passports, even some of those that have been accepted by Italian government have not been issued passport which makes it difficult for them to work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chairman said that the supply of 500 booklets of passport to the Nigerian embassy in Italy was grossly inadequate to serve the number of the citizens that needed it.\n\n\u201cThe number of booklets allocated to the embassy in Italy, which is 500 is insignificant to the number of applicants; even giving Italy 20,000 booklets in a month may not go round.\n\n\u201cUsing the same sharing formula for all the countries in Europe cannot work in Italy where we have more Nigerian residents. We cannot be compared with Sweden with fewer number of Nigerians residents.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the relevant government agencies and our amiable Minister for Internal Affairs, Alhaji Rauf Aregbesola, to help us address this issue.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of NIDCOM, Mrs Abike Dabiri, has tried for us as well,\u201d he said.\n\nOmo-Iduhon said that the body had a change of leadership in July 2021, after an election, adding that the new administration was poised to improve the welfare of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe just had our elections in July this year, the first thing we have set out as a team is to improve the welfare of Nigerians in Italy. This is of paramount interest to us.\n\n\u201cWe are also liaising with the Nigerian embassy in Italy to do the right thing at the right time and importantly, our mandate in bringing investors from Italy to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to grow the economy of Nigeria, a mission at which we are established by former President Obasanjo to assist in the development drive,\u201d he added.\n\nNIDOE is recognised as official platform through which individual Nigerian in diaspora, their community, organisation and corporate bodies can channel their development efforts to Nigeria.\n\nThe organisation partners with Nigerian community, professional organisation as well as public and private businesses in focused areas such as Foreign Direct Investment, professional networking, stakeholders advocacy, medical missions, educational support and skill transfer to Nigeria.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has explained that establishing industries is not wholly the state government\u2019s responsibility.\n\nHe said the state government would rather create an enabling environment for industries to thrive.\n\nThis was coming in the wake of speculations in some quarters that the industries established in the state under the present administration are not owned by the state government as claimed but by private individuals.\n\nThe governor, in his Christmas broadcast on Saturday, December 25, 2021, said those attacking the efforts of the state government in attracting investors on ownership status are \u2018ill-informed.\u2019\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI have heard some people make rather ill-informed comments to the effect that these industries we have attracted are not owned by the State Government.\n\n\u201cFellow Akwaibomites, it is not the duty of any state government to establish or wholly own industries. The main job of a State Government is to create the enabling environment for investors to come to such a state and invest, and to engender Public-Private Partnerships (PPP).\n\n\u201cIt, however, takes a leader who understands and has established enduring contacts within the corporate world to convince and bring these investors to the state, which thankfully we have done in the last six-plus years and still remain committed to doing. I urge us to do a little research before we begin to attack and condemn.\u201d\n\nHe also reminded the people about the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, urging them to observe the precautionary measures so as to help in curtailing the spread.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cSome people have also taken to the social media to talk about serious issues such as pension and gratuities armed with little knowledge of the subject matter or outrightly misinforming the public. My dear Akwaibomites, as I speak to you, we have paid our pensioners up to date. I repeat we have paid up to date all our pensioners. The Office of Accountant-General regularly publishes this information, yet people, out of mischief and sheer blackmail, are still pushing the lie that we are owing to our pensioners.\n\n\u201cThe issue of gratuity is a national problem. We are a mere subnational and even other higher layers of government are struggling with the issue of the payment of gratuities. In spite of this, we have painstakingly continued to pay gratuities and remain committed to doing so. Part of what I did, within my first few months in office was to settle a backlog of such, between 2002 to 2011, and ever since, in spite of the paucity of funds, we have endeavoured to pay gratuities.\n\n\u201cPeople must not lose the sense of the fact that we operate a three-tier Government structure: Federal, State and Local Government. Primary Education and Primary Health Care are under the Third Tier of Government and in spite of this we have regularly intervened in the payment of salaries and other benefits. I understand the political season is upon us, and thus the need by some people to score cheap political points, but we should not mislead our people with patent falsehood.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, called on the Akwa Ibom people to embrace peace and eschew any tendency to disrupt the existing peaceful coexistence in the state.",

          "text": "The Presidency is not in agreement with the National Assembly over the legislature\u2019s decision to increase the estimate for the 2022 national budget by N1 trillion, The Nation learnt yesterday.\n\nThe increase has sparked misgivings at the seat of power, sources said, with the Federal Government already weighing its options on the development.\n\nThe President, on October 7, presented a bill of N16,391,023,917,692 to the National Assembly.\n\nThe lawmakers, however, passed the budget on Wednesday after increasing it from N16,391,023,917,692 to N17,126,873,917,692.\n\nThe N17. 1 trillion bill was sent to the President yesterday for assent.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEntitled \u201cAppropriation Bill 2022,\u201d the budget was forwarded to the President by the Clerk of the National Assembly, Mr. Ojo Olatunde Amos, with a covering letter.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cIn consonance with the Provisions of the Acts Authentication Act Cap. A2, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, I wish, with due respect, to forward to Your Excellency, the authenticated copies of Appropriation Bill, 2022 for your consideration and assent.\n\n\u201cAfter Your Excellency\u2019s assent, one copy of the signed Bill should be retained in your office while the other two are to be returned for our further action, please. With my highest regards.\u201d\n\nA top source, however, said the Federal Government would look at the budget, especially allocations either adjusted or added to it.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe government submitted a proposal to the National Assembly and the lawmakers within their constitutional powers increased it by N1 trillion. This is on the high side.\n\n\u201cNow that the budget has been passed, the government will take another look at the estimates before President Buhari assents it. We will pay attention to areas where the budget was jacked up.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government may not agree with the lawmakers on the increase but it will engage them before the President signs the bill into law.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly did not put into consideration the fact that we have limited resources to fund the budget. The alternative is taking loans to finance it. Yet, the mood of the nation does not support fresh loans.\n\n\u201cIt is also our duty to make the National Assembly know if the budget new oil price benchmark of $62 per barrel set by the lawmakers is realistic or not. You know the Executive based its projections on $57 per barrel.\n\n\u201cSo, we have to open up to the National Assembly on what we think are the ways out. Since the President is now in receipt of the bill, the Executive will quickly study it.\u201d\n\nAfter passing the bill, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, said in part: \u201d [And] we are very optimistic that Mr. President will assent to the bill, like he did for 2020 and 2021, so that by January 2022, the implementation of the budget 2022 will commence by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the benefits of passing and assenting to the budget in good time, especially when we had to fight COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of the implementation of the budget in 2021 and 2020 was very clear.\n\n\u201cFor us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria and Nigerian businesses especially will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nLawan, during a visit to the President on Thursday night, had said Buhari would sign the appropriation bill this week.\n\nThe Senate President, who met with the President alongside House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, said Buhari personally invited them for the purpose of thanking the National Assembly through its leaders for the members\u2019 services to the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cMr. President invited the honourable speaker and me to come so he could thank the National Assembly through us for working so hard to pass the 2022 appropriation bill, which will be brought to Mr. President for his assent by next week by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic. In fact, we\u2019re very sure that Mr President will sign the bill into an act of the National Assembly next week by the grace of God. And this is the way we should always work together. This is our third appropriation bill to be passed before we go on Christmas break.\n\n\u201cIt has shown how important the passage and the assent to the budget before the end of the year have been. You will recall that we were in two or three different recessions, but because public expenditure, which normally drives our economy as a developing economy, has always brought that advantage, made the availability of funds into the economy. And we can come out of the recess periods.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to thank Mr President for thanking the National Assembly, because this is essentially the reason why he invited the Speaker and I to say that National Assembly, thank you very much for working with us for making this budget 2022 pass in good time as you did for 2020 and 2021.\u201d",

Hence, he has been appealing for her to be pardoned. This is what he has been doing behind the scene, in the last few days.\u2019\n\nWhen contacted, the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, assured that the soldier would be released on Christmas Day.\n\nNwachukwu said: I can confirm to you that an order has been made for the soldier to be freed and enjoy the Christmas with her family and friends with a serious warning for her not to repeat such act again.\u2019",

We have observed that the security situation now, our forests are the major problems because they accommodate bandits, terrorists and armed robbers.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State we have taken some measures. We have two large forests the Falgore forest, which is bordering Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi and also not far away from Plateau. In that forest, we established a military training ground in conjunction with the Army. And there\u2019s a lot of military training going on in that forest using the facilities that we have provided. I have requested Mr President to also establish another institution within that forest and that forest will be liberated completely.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "title": "Christmas: Hard times for South-East, South-South travellers \u2013 The Sun Nigeria",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze And Aloysius Attah, Onitsha\n\nSouth East travellers coming home to celebrate the festive season with families and friends have had to lament about their traffic ordeal at the River Niger Bridge Head, and its \u201cmother of all sufferings\u201d counterpart at the Ihiala military checkpoint. Both traffic chokepoints have now become something of a nightmare to travellers heading to the South East from the western part of the country. The agonies and pains that they go through are compounded by the multiple checkpoints and roadblocks placed on the various roads leading into the region.\n\nSince December 16, the Niger Bridge has proved practically impassable owing to the blockade mounted on the bridge by many security agencies and purported revenue collectors extorting commuters. On daily basis, gridlock from both ends of the bridge spirals into the cities of Asaba and Onitsha, making vehicles spend between three and nine hours on the axis. Residents of the two towns are also not spared of the pangs of the gridlock.\n\nSituation report, by Saturday Sun reporter\n\nWhen our reporter visited the bridge yesterday, it was like a house of commotion for the three hours that he spent in the area. From the Onitsha end, he ran into a long stretch of vehicles wanting to access the bridge. It stretched from the bridge down to the Upper Iweka, Lagos Park.\n\nGetting to the bridge proper, he discovered a thin line of vehicles moving freely. At the Asaba end, he ran into another long line of vehicles wanting to cross over to the Onitsha end. It stretched from the neck of the bridge at the Asaba Toll Gate till Abraka Junction in Delta State.\n\nSoldiers stationed their army vehicle in the middle of the bridge and allowed vehicles to enter the bridge in a single file, one at a time. Parked beside the GUO Motors Asaba terminal was a police vehicle with the inscription: \u201cOperation Safer Delta\u201d. He found few metres away several policemen on both sides of the road busy extorting money from vehicle owners, private and public, and, in the process, helping to increa se the agonies being experienced by commuters. There were also men in blue apron issuing tickets and collecting money from commercial vehicle drivers.\n\nAt the centre of the bridge, soldiers were seen clutching assault rifles or hanging them on their bodies while leaning on the bridge pillars. Three plainclothes men were seen collecting money on their behalf. The reporter watched as they got clearance from the soldiers to either leave a driver or delay him until he pays. Located at the Onitsha end were various groups like Ocha Brigade, Anambra Youth Traffic Volunteers, Anambra Traffic Management Agency (ATMA) Police and Federal Road Safety Corps personnel. As our reporter discovered, it was more of a competition on who would collect more money from the commuters, than traffic control.\n\nNonso Igwedibia, a traveller who spoke to Saturday Sun, hissed, out of frustration while narrating his experience on the road.\n\n\u201cI took a 50 minutes flight from Abuja to Asaba airport hoping to meet up with an engagement I have in Awka, but too bad that I\u2019ve spent four hours trying to cross over to the Onitsha end since our flight landed,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot understand what is going on here. I don\u2019t know why we must continue to suffer unnecessarily in this country.\u201d\n\nEya Johnson, a traveller heading to Ikom, Cross Rivers State from Lagos, said that it was hellish making the trip at this period, lamenting that he and his family had been trapped at the Asaba end of the Niger Bridge for upward of five hours. A bus driver, Anthony Obumse, who plies the Asaba-Onitsha route also lamented the long hours wasted on the route because of the blockade. He said: \u201cNormally, if the road is free, it takes just 10 minutes to get to Onitsha from Asaba, but this time around; we sometimes spend three hours to get to Onitsha. If the law enforcement agents working in this route can declare \u201coperation keep moving\u201d while the touts are flushed out, I think we can make progress, especially at this Christmas season.\u201d Johnbosco Ezika, a resident of Asaba trading at the Onitsha Bridge Head said to get home after the day\u2019s business was akin to passing through hell.\n\nA Lagos-based businessman, Mr. Ope Obafemi, who recently experienced the rigour of travelling to the eastern part of Nigeria, said travellers should be ready to spend three days on the road as there are security check-ups after every ten- minute drive.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nAccording to him, he opted to book a flight to Asaba after failure to get a ticket to Owerri, which was his real destination, but, the experience left him regretting his decision.\n\n\u201cWe flew from Lagos to Asaba, then hoped to drive from there to Owerri to attend a burial ceremony. We left Asaba airport around 7:20 pm. We were told that that the journey is a maximum of two hours. We moved. Within one hour, we did a very good speed, then we met traffic. We were told that the military barricaded the road for security checks. We got to the traffic jam with the hope of leaving in the next 10 to 15 minutes, but that was a lie. After one hour, there was no end in sight, by this time it was around 9:30pm. There was fear in us. I wanted to jump down but I was assured that there was no problem with security and then we spent another hour again making it two hours. By the time we got to the barricade, to my surprise chagrin, they were negotiating with haulage trucks and commercial vehicles. You would see them negotiate with drivers and if the driver could not pay, they\u2019d remain on one spot while others waited in the queue. It dawned on me that we spent two horrible hours on a 200meter road. After that, we met another barricade where we spent another one hour. We left that place and in another 10mins again we met another barricade and spent another hour again. If anybody is travelling, he should just plan to spend like three days on the road,\u201d he stated.\n\nEfforts made by authorities to ease the gridlock\n\nMeanwhile the Onitsha Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture (ONICCIMA) has urged the federal authorities, security agencies, as well as the governors of Anambra and Delta States to do something about the menace posed by the Niger Bridge gridlock which they claimed is caused by the activities of some unscrupulous law enforcement agents on both ends of the bridge.\n\nKelvin Obieri, its newly elected President, in a statement in Onitsha on December 18, criticized the activities of some law enforcement agents whom he accused of setting up unnecessary roadblocks under the guise of \u201csecurity concerns\u201d at the Asaba end of the bridge that are causing gridlocks with the consequent economic hardship and losses to the people. He urged that the activities of the security personnel be limited to surveillance and monitoring to ensure free flow of traffic.\n\nSpeaking on the same issue, the Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, promised to set up a taskforce comprising the police, the military, FRSC officials and the Delta State Traffic Management Authority to handle traffic situation congestion in the state. At a recent joint press conference he held with the Corps Marshal of the FRSC, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, in Government House, Asaba, he called on the military and the police to dismantle their checkpoints around the bridge so as to ease movement of vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that working together, they (our taskforce and FRSC officials) will be able to ensure truly that we have a free flow of traffic at that point (the River Niger Bridge),\u201d he noted. Oyeyemi said that he was in Asaba to brief the governor on the annual review meeting on how to ease off traffic at the Asaba bridgehead. He noted that his men had been deployed to the area to ensure that no passenger or road user was stranded on the Asaba/Onitsha route during the festive period. Saturday Sun gathered that the FRSC had deployed additional 600 personnel to Anambra State and 652 others to Delta State.\n\nSimilarly, the House of Representatives recently directed security agencies to remove multiple checkpoints on highways leading to the South-East. This followed the adoption of a motion by the lawmaker representing Idemili North and Idemili South Federal Constituency of Anambra State, Obinna Chidoka, at the plenary in Abuja.\n\nBefore then, the House had, on December 1, directed the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, to dismantle all illegal and needless police and military checkpoints across highways in the country. The mover of the motion, Ifeanyi Momah, harped \u201con the need to investigate loss of many lives along the Onitsha-Owerri express road within Ihiala Federal constituency.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that commuters sometimes stay up to six hours at the Ihiala military checkpoint, while those who got there after 6pm are made to sleep overnight as the road is usually blocked completely at that time of the day.",
          "summary": "From the Onitsha end, he ran into a long stretch of vehicles wanting to access the bridge.\nAt the Asaba end, he ran into another long line of vehicles wanting to cross over to the Onitsha end.\nIt stretched from the neck of the bridge at the Asaba Toll Gate till Abraka Junction in Delta State.\nLocated at the Onitsha end were various groups like Ocha Brigade, Anambra Youth Traffic Volunteers, Anambra Traffic Management Agency (ATMA) Police and Federal Road Safety Corps personnel.\nSimilarly, the House of Representatives recently directed security agencies to remove multiple checkpoints on highways leading to the South-East.",

          "text": "\u2018Our courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land. Let us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, in a special Christmas message personally signed and issued yesterday, promised to ensure that the security challenges facing Nigerians become history soon.\n\nFor years, terrorists have been roaming across the country unhindered, killing, kidnapping and maiming.\n\nWhile rejoicing with Nigerian Christians as they celebrate Christmas, the President declared: \u201cI am confident that with the renewed commitment and empowerment of our committed security personnel, all these issues which inflict pain and trauma on us will soon be history.\u201d\n\nThe President admitted that despite the \u201cremarkable successes generally recorded,\u201d the nation still has challenges to contend with.\n\nHe noted that the military was doing everything possible to tackle the insecurity menace.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cOur courageous security forces, bolstered by the necessary support from this administration, daily confront the wicked ones amongst us, who continue to threaten the peace of the land.\n\n\u201cRecently, during the meeting with fellow Heads of State of the ECOWAS, I discussed the need to intensify efforts to jointly confront this menace causing instability in our sub-region.\n\n\u201cLet us utilise the opportunity that this festive period brings to encourage ourselves so that the machinations of the wicked ones in our midst will find no place to thrive.\n\n\u201cChristmas is a season when hope is rekindled. Hope, Peace, Joy, Love are the recurring themes of this time. It is in the midst of hardship that the true test of a nation emerges.\u201d\n\nThe President urged Nigerians to invoke the indomitable spirit in them and see the present order of things as a phase that would also pass, \u201cjust like other unsavory situations in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nHe said his government would not abandon the promises made to Nigerians for a better lease of life, adding that the diversification of the economy embarked upon by his government was yielding fruits.\n\nThe President said: \u201cWe shall continue to create opportunities for our teeming youths to ventilate their tremendous energy. As we felicitate with family, friends, colleagues, associates, let us spare moments to reach out to the less privileged.\n\n\u201cLet us also pray and give words of encouragement to our gallant security personnel fulfilling their oaths to keep us safe.\n\n\u201cI assure my compatriots that this administration remains resolute at ensuring that the standard of living of the average Nigerian is elevated.\u201d\n\nHe assured that his six and half-year administration would fulfill all the promises made to Nigerians before the government terminates in 17 months\u2019 time.\n\nUrges Citizens to Get Vaccinated\n\nAlso in the Christmas message, the President pleaded with all citizens to get vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nHe expressed disappointment that for the second Christmas running, the world would not be able to celebrate as it used to in years past because of the pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic, with its attendant debilitating impact, has remained with mankind, mutating and leaving in its wake, devastating consequences on the economy, social interaction, and curtailing certain freedoms.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining, however, is that humanity has been able to rise up with one voice and purpose, to confront the foisted conditions.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to appeal to our dear citizens to embrace vaccination, which is the best scientifically known bulwark against the pandemic. Recent events have shown that vaccination greatly reduces the effects of the virus on the human body.\n\n\u201cI will also urge those that have taken the two doses to go ahead and take the booster as advised by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC). I commend the efforts of members of the PSC under the headship of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation as they continue to chart a roadmap out of the pandemic and associated issues.\n\n\u201cOn this note, I wish Nigerians Merry Christmas!\u201d\n\nKaigama: Heart of Every Nigerian Heavy with Suffering\n\nThe Catholic Archbishop of Abuja, His Grace, Most Revd. Ignatius Kaigama yesterday lamented that the hearts of Nigerians are heavy with the suffering they had experienced and seen in 2021 alone.\n\nKaigama, who stated this in his Christmas message, also called on Nigerians not to give up on the country, saying although the present situations may be tough, \u201cGod is in control.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with security challenges, COVID-19 and agitations for self-determination, Nigerians would not forget 2021 in a hurry.\n\nThe cleric told the faithful not to give up on their country, but \u201cdare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKaigama said: \u201cChristmas this year has found us in the throes of woes and distressing circumstances far beyond our human control. As Nigerians, in almost every part of this country, our hearts are heavy with the suffering we have experienced and seen this year alone \u2013 the many deaths as a result of terrorism, kidnapping and banditry, the depressing economic situation with inflation spiraling out of control, crashing further the ordinary man who has already been drained of joy, peace, and hope.\n\n\u201cThe violent agitations for self-determination, which have come with the loss of lives and limbs, have left horrific scars on our collective psyche. All these make this year one that many Nigerians may not forget in a hurry. Nevertheless, Christmas proclaims, \u2018Joy to the world the Lord has come.\u2019\n\n\u201cFor every disenchanted Nigerian who is on the verge of giving up on this country; for anyone who is prepared to cut off his moorings and drifts away to distant lands, Christmas challenges us to dare to look ahead and again embrace the hope for a better Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile stating that unbridled corruption and criminality were a grim reminder that selfishness had taken root in the hearts of many statesmen, the Archbishop said: \u201cChristmas is an invitation to give up selfishness, to think only of others and how to bring the greatest happiness to them.\n\n\u201cOn account of Christmas, all our leaders are challenged to once again dream big for our country and to faithfully work hard to realise those dreams so as to find solutions to our teething problems and better the lives of some of the poorest people on earth.\u201d\n\nCatholic Bishops Urge Nigerians to Be Hopeful\n\nCatholic Bishops have urged Nigerians overwhelmed by suffering and hardship not to give up hope of a better Nigeria.\n\nThe bishops said Nigerians should always remember the popular Christmas refrain, Emmanuel which is that \u201cGod is with us\u201d and try to be hopeful of a better future.\n\nIn its Christmas message issued by the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) jointly signed by the President, Most Rev. Augustine Akubeze; Vice President, Most Rev. Lucius Ugorji and Secretary, Most Rev. Camillus Umoh, the clergymen enjoined Nigerians not to allow any situation to lead them to despair because God is always there to intervene for them.\n\n\u201cThis feast reminds us that God is with us. Therefore, the word \u2018Emmanuel\u2019 should be a constant refrain in our mouths. We should, therefore, not allow any situation to lead us to despair because God is always with us. We are grateful to God for all his divine interventions in our lives. We know that if not for God, things would have been worse.\n\n\u201cI want us to use part of our time during this holy season and maybe even beyond the Christmas Season to develop our capacity to listen to God who speaks to us in silence,\u201d said the bishops.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Ganduje demands deployment of more soldiers in Kano\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has described the multiple rocket attacks in Maiduguri by the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) ahead of the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Borno State last Thursday as worrisome.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba stated this while briefing State House Correspondents on the outcome of an emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by President Buhari at the presidential villa.\n\nThis is just as the federal government allayed the fears of Nigerians over the reported planned attack by terrorists on Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nISWAP had launched multiple rockets on Maiduguri, the state capital, hours before the visit of the President to Borno State.\n\nFive people were killed and many houses destroyed by the ISWAP rockets that landed in different areas, including Ngomari, Bulumkutu, Ajilari, and Ayafe communities.\n\nThe IG, however, said the insurgents were unable to achieve their objectives.\n\n\u201cThey are launching it in major towns, they are launching it in Maiduguri. It is a concern. And it has been seriously checkmated. There are efforts to continuously checkmate it,\u201d Baba said.\n\nHe stressed that although the government and the security forces were particularly concerned about the rocket attacks, the target of the terrorists was defeated by security forces.\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari, during the meeting, tasked all security and intelligence chiefs in attendance to increase the heat against the terrorists and all other criminals, saying none should be spared.\n\nThe IG said they were asked to spare no terrorist or criminal, adding that the target now should be crime prevention.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe marching orders are always the same; you have even told Nigerians the marching orders of the President. It has always been the same; there is no space, there is no tolerance to any threat to security.\n\n\u201cThere is no sparing of any terrorist and there must be an intelligence gathering, there must be proactive prevention of crime and there must be checkmating of all those that are involved in criminal activities, whether it is terrorism, banditry or armed robbery or whatever and that is what we are trying to do to the best of our knowledge and ability.\u201d\n\nOn why there are so many policemen deployed to the South-east region of the country, seemingly more than to areas considered more prone to violent crimes, Usman said population, economic activities and other factors determine deployment.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou said it is an allegation which has not been proven, it has always been an allegation. The spaces are different, the whole of the South-east, in terms of landmass, might not be as large as Niger State, so certainly you may see a number of policemen within a very small space, trying to do policing work and you may see another number, not equal, doing much more than that.\n\n\u201cBut when we talk about policing a population or policing a place where there is economic activity or policing in a place where there are more threats, then certainly you have to put more men to govern that small space and that is what you are seeing.\n\nAlso speaking to newsmen, Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, allayed fears among Nigerians, especially the residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, over reported planned attack on Abuja, saying there is no cause for worry.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t any threat to the safety and security of Abuja. Abuja is secure and very safe. If there was a leak, as you mentioned, it could just be an operational alert that does not require any worry or concern. The Council has mandated us to assure Nigerians of their safety, of their security and enduring peace for the period of the festivities.\n\n\u201cThe message of the Security Council, through you to Nigerians, is that all measures for the safety and security of the Nigerian people and Nigeria, are in place for a successful and happy celebration of the yuletide and the New Year. Compliment of the season to all of us from the President and members of the Security Council.\u201d\n\nBefore the commencement of the security meeting, the President swore-in the newly-appointed Minister of State for Works and Housing, Muazu Sambo.\n\nIn attendance at the security meeting yesterday were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha and the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (retd.).\n\nOthers include Minister of Defense, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.); Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; Chief of Defense Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo; and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao.\n\nAlso present were the Inspector-General; the Director-General of the Department of State Service, Yusuf Bichi; and the Director-General of the National Intelligence Agency, Ahmed Abubakar.\n\nGanduje Demands Deployment of more Soldiers\n\nGovernor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to deploy more military personnel to forests in the state.\n\nSpeaking to journalists yesterday after meeting with the president in Abuja, Ganduje said he came to brief Buhari on the security situation in his state.\n\nHe called for the establishment of another military training base in the forest bordering Kano, Kaduna, Bauchi and Plateau, as part of efforts to check the activities of criminals.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThere are challenges all over the country that are unfortunate, but we believe Mr. President is doing his best with other stakeholders in order to curtail the situation.\n\n\u201cWe need the helping hand of almost everybody, especially governors and chairmen of local governments. We have observed that the security situation is worsening now. Our forests are the major problems because they accommodate bandits, terrorists, armed robbers and criminals.\n\n\u201cIn Kano State, we have taken some measures. We have two large forests, including the Falgore forest, which borders Kano, Kaduna and Bauchi states and also not far away from Plateau. In that forest, we established a military training ground in conjunction with the army and there\u2019s a lot of military training going on in that forest, using the facilities that we have provided.\n\n\u201cSo, that is helping to checkmate the activities of bandits in that forest and I have requested Mr. President to also establish another institution within that forest and that forest will be liberated completely.\u201d\n\nHe added that the state introduced the use of technology within its forests to improve effective communication between security operatives in the state.\n\nAccording to Ganduje, the state has also constituted an enlarged security committee to promote efforts to maintain peace.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have introduced technology within the forest. From the office of the DSS in Kano and the office of the commissioner of police and even from my office, we are able to monitor what is happening in that forest.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s effective communication between the DSS and the police and those who are managing the forest \u2014 the checkpoints and various places that security agencies are manning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re laying over 100 kilometres of optic fibre within the Kano metropolis, so that CCTV cameras will be more effective and we can manage the whole mega city in terms of security and also in terms of network improvement.\n\n\u201cWe have also constituted what we call an enlarged security committee because limiting it to the air force, army, police, DSS, civil defence, I think the security network, in terms of flow of information, requires much more than that.\n\n\u201cAlso, we introduced technology. As earlier mentioned, we have the most powerful tracker in the country. Through that one, even some people who escaped to Niger Republic, Cameroon, we were able to trace them and connect with international security agencies for their arrest.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Says with new hardware, military more prepared to flush out terrorists\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said his administration would support families of dead and wounded soldiers, and help them realise their potential. Buhari stated this in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, when he addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base.\n\nIn a related development, the president stated that with the acquisition of more capability in military technology and hardware, the country was better prepared to deal with terrorists, especially in the North-east. Buhari gave the assurance on yesterday in Maiduguri after inaugurating some projects donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi.\n\nBuhari, who addressed troops at the Nigerian Air Force Base, said the military had almost eliminated completely insurgency and other security issues threatening the country. He urged men of Operation Hadin Kai, the military operation against insurgency in the North-east, to remain steadfast as they went into the final phase of the campaign against terrorism and other criminalities.\n\nHe urged them to stay focused \u201cto achieve our strategic end-state, which is the defeat of all adversaries and restoration of an economically viable North-east geo-political zone and other parts of the country, where Nigerians are free to go about their activities without fear or harassment.\u201d\n\nThe president told the soldiers that the whole country remained grateful to them for their gallantry in ensuring the gradual return of peace to the North-east. He condoled with families that had lost loved ones, as well as the wounded.\n\nBuhari assured the families of soldiers, who paid the supreme price for the country, and the injured that the federal government would cater for their needs, in recognition of their sacrifices for all Nigerians.\n\nHe asserted before the troops, \u201cI am delighted to be with you today and to convey my gratitude and that of the entire nation to you all, as you continuously strive to secure our dear country. Your career is like no other, because it is a conscious commitment and preparedness to give your best for the sake of others. I am, therefore, here on behalf of a grateful nation to thank and commend you for your service and sacrifices.\n\n\u201cLet me start by commiserating with you all on the unfortunate loss of Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkushu, and other personnel of 25 and 28 Task Force Brigades, who died on 13 November 2021. I do this mindful of the fact that we have lost others in this Theatre of Operation as well as other operational areas across the country.\n\n\u201cWe pray for the repose of their souls and for the Almighty God to comfort the families that they left behind. The people of Borno State and, indeed, the entire country owe a debt of gratitude to our serving men in uniform for the huge sacrifices in the pursuit of peace.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the troops for their extraordinary resilience and steadfastness in the face of adversity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat is the spirit, tenacity and resolve that the Nigerian Armed Forces are known for. Well done. Our country, just like all the others in the Sahel region, is faced with several security challenges that are largely characterised by the violent activities of non-state actors. This has necessitated several interventions aimed at ensuring the security of persons and property across the numerous hot spots.\n\n\u201cFurther improvements in the security situation in Operation Hadin Kai have led to a corresponding rise in the confidence of our people, who are now returning in significant numbers to their homes. Further to the reorganisations in the military leadership, concerted efforts are being made to improve your equipment holding. I am aware that you have started receiving some of the platforms procured by our administration while others would be received in the weeks ahead.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on the threat posed by criminals through the employment of Improvised Explosive Devices, the president said substantial resources had been directed to procuring equipment for explosive ordnance disposal. He said similar attention was being given to intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance assets.\n\n\u201cThese measures and the platforms being received would accord you the necessary reach, fire power and protection to project force across the theatre and bring the fight to a logical and successful end,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari told the troops that at the onset of his administration, he emphasised the need to rejuvenate the Multinational Joint Task Force. This was in realisation of the fluid and transnational nature of current threats and their propensity to hibernate in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge you to continue to further strengthen your cooperation with the militaries of the other countries under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force in order to further optimise the mutual gains for our respective national security,\u201d Buhari told the troops.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs we step up the military efforts, our administration has remained conscious of the efficacy of the employments of other lines of effort in our drive to ensuring the return of lasting peace to the North-east region.\n\n\u201cThe North East Development Commission continues to make giant strides at improving the economic and social welfare of Nigerians in the region. I am also happy with the increased level of cooperation between the good people of Borno State, other stakeholders and the security agencies. I urge you to continue to cooperate with other security agencies with a view to ensuring a full return to normalcy.\u201d\n\nHe assured the people that the administration would continue to work with all well-meaning stakeholders, including friendly nations and civil society organisations, to bring peace to all troubled areas across the nation.\n\nWhile appreciating the government of Borno State for its continuous cooperation with the federal government in multiple spheres, the president added, \u201cThis has been critical to the furtherance of our mutual efforts at restoring peace to the state.\n\n\u201cI particularly commend Your Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for your untiring commitment and cherished collaboration with my administration for the overall good of the people of Borno. Yours is a good example of the inherent benefits that are accruable from conscious positive interaction between the federal government and states.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended the Minister of Defence as well as the Chief of Defence staff, service chiefs and the heads of all other security agencies for forging a common front of collaboration and cooperation, which continues to enhance operations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt was gratifying to observe some of these examples of collaboration during the research and development exhibition at the recently concluded Chief of Army Staff\u2019s annual conference and the launch of locally constructed seaward defence ship at the Naval Dockyard.\n\n\u201cI urge you all to stay the course towards ensuring that we become self-sufficient in the production of our defence equipment in no distant future.\n\n\u201cTo my dear troops, as your Commander-in-Chief, I am mindful of your selfless sacrifices, which in some cases have entailed paying the supreme price. The nation owes you a debt of gratitude for your commitment, dedication and unalloyed loyalty to the Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur government will continue to work with your respective heads to ensure that your welfare receives priority attention and that our wounded comrades are given the best medical care possible.\u201d\n\nBuhari also said the manpower challenges, which had limited the rotation of some units from the theatre, would be addressed by concerted efforts to increase recruitment and ensure that the remaining units due for rotation were relieved as soon as practicable.\n\nIn a related development, Buhari assured that hard times awaited terrorists troubling the North-west, with the procurement of high-tech equipment and hardware by the military.\n\nHe also said he would continue to do his best for the development of the country until May 2023, when he would statutorily leave the presidency.\n\nThe president spoke on Thursday in Maiduguri after the inauguration of Oriental Energies Resource Ltd Hanger, Muhammadu Indimi Distance Learning Centre, and an International Conference Centre donated to the University of Maiduguri by business mogul, Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi, he expressed concern at the level of insecurity in the North West zone.\n\nHe said it was sad that the people of the North-west, who prior to now lived together, sharing same culture and outlook for a long time, would start stealing, kidnapping and killing one another.\n\nBuhari said, \u201c I know I swore by the constitution, and I will leave in 17 months. I pray that the person that will take over from us will also follow the targets of securing the country and building the economy.\n\n\u201cWithout securing the country, you cannot grow the economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari said Nigerians should appraise the performance of the administration based on what the situation was on security, economy and corruption before he came in, and where it is now.\n\n\u201cWe have a great country, and we thank God for giving us so much resources. But we need to develop our resources.\u201d\n\nThe president noted that development would be more sustainable by empowering the people.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am highly impressed with what I have seen at this state of the art Centre for Distance Learning and Auditorium sited here, the University of Maiduguri. I am told that this international conference hall has 1,300 seats. The high quality standard of this edifice is major contribution by Alhaji Muhammadu Indimi. This intervention will benefit not only students from Borno and the North-east but also students from all parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the Oriental Energy Resources Hangar, which I commissioned, it will welcome and offer support services to aircraft and pilots involved with Humanitarian Air Services.\u201d\n\nBuhari also commended Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno state for the work he had done in two years, and said he was in the state in June to commission development projects.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum appreciated the president for honouring the state, adding that Indimi\u2019s contributions to the development of the state showed he loved his people.\n\n\u201cWords cannot convey our gratitude for the statesmanship, \u201c the governor said.\n\nZulum said the state had recognised the contributions of Indimi by renaming the Damboa Road after him, now Alhajji Muhammadu Indimi Road.\n\nSpeaking also, Indimi said he was motivated to build the Distance Learning Centre and the International Conference Centre to encourage education in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe the centre will help in delivering training and skills as well as encourage those who will be taking lessons from remote places.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Olori Naomi, Ooni of Ife\u2019s Wife, Announces Divorce from Monarch",
          "text": "Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nWife of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, Olori Naomi Silekunola, yesterday, announced her separation from the monarch, citing many personal reasons.\n\nIn a statement posted on her verified Instagram handle and Facebook account, in the morning, Naomi announced an end to the three-year marriage.\n\nAlthough the palace, which earlier maintained silence, came back to say divorce being a two-way thing, could not be announced by a party, even though there was an unconfirmed account, which disputed the claims of the Olori as untrue.\n\nAt the same time, a Yoruba interest group, Igbimo Apapo Yoruba Lagbaye, has described the development as a sacrilege to the royal stool of of Ife and the entire Yoruba race urging the people of Yoruba to remain calm and resolute to the cause of preserving the sacredness of the tradition and unique value of the throne of the Ooni of Ife.\n\nBut, according to the queen, she had tried to make the union work, unfortunately, the monarch\u2019s public identity was at variance with \u201chis true self\u201d.\n\nThe fair-skinned ex-queen wrote: \u201cI did my best to endure and make it work. Many times, I smiled through the struggle, but I have finally realised I had just one assignment: my son, and when God is done, He is done. He chose Saul to be king, and when He was done, He told the prophet Samuel I have moved on.\n\n\u201cReligion was never an issue between us; please refer to my interview on News Central TV. Instead, His Majesty has a picture he would love the world to see and perceive him as and another one which is his true self.\u201d\n\nShe, therefore, declared: \u201cToday, I announce the beginning of a new dawn and the close of a chapter. Today, I am a mother to God\u2019s unique gift. I am no longer a slave to my thoughts of perfection. I, at this moment, announce that I shall no longer be referred to as wife to the Ooni of Ife or as Queen of Ile-Ife, but as the Queen of the people and mother of my adorable Prince.\u201d\n\nAlso addressing some allegations, Silekunola said her \u201cdecision to move on did not come because his majesty is married to another queen\u201d, but added that, \u201cAs many would love to assume, throughout our life as a couple, I was the only married wife to him. There were side attractions, but it was never an issue.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered from a palace source that up to the time of filing this report, the palace neither denied nor confirmed the true position of the situation, thus putting a doubt on the other account which dismissed the divorce announcement as untrue.\n\nInterestingly, Naomi\u2019s divorce makes it the second since Ooni assumed the prestigious stool. Ooni, on assuming the throne of his fathers, married Olori Wuraola Zaynab Otiti, who left in 2017.\n\nBut the palace image maker, Moses Olafare, who initially declined calls, later said separation was a two way affair and not something announced by one party.\n\nHe said the announcements of separation is subject to agreement by both parties, so, to that extent, the palace was not aware of such separation, because \u201cwe all went to bed last night having the king and queen being together.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo, if by this morning, the queen went to her social media to write that she is no longer in marriage with Ooni, we will look into it to see whether or not the Instagram page truly belongs to her, and to know the reason behind it.\n\n\u201cBut, as at today \u2013 this moment \u2013 the palace is not aware of the separation. Marriage is a private affair, no matter how prominent the personalities involved, it is a private affair. We will dig deeper and know what happened. But, like I said, all of us just woke up to read about the separation on social media.\n\n\u201cEven by this time yesterday, (Wednesday) kabiyesi was still packaging special gift for her. If you want to separate with someone, you cannot be packaging gift for her. I was aware that Kabiyesi was putting special gift for her for Christmas.\n\n\u201cIf he is not in love with her, he cannot be doing that, only to wake up the following morning to hear from public that she was no longer in the relationship. In fact the Christmas gift has been delivered to her already,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Igbimo Apapo Yoruba Lagbaye, an umbrella body for the Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide and Yoruba Council of Women Worldwide, alongside all her affiliated groups, said it was \u201caghast to read just like millions of people from all works of life on the verified pages of social media platforms belonging to Olori Naomi Silekunola Ogunwusi\u2019s Facebook and Instagram handle declaring herself divorced and separated with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe group, in a statement by its President, Aare Oladotun Hassan, said, while her action had caused monumental embarrassment to the throne, \u201cthe Yoruba race and all lovers of the Ooni globally, we deplore this most condemnable act of disrespect aimed at devaluing the age-long tradition of the Arole Oduduwa Olofin Adimula throne.\n\n\u201cWe wish to clarify that the throne had its modus operandi and thorough orderly guiding principles, wherein it is totally unheard of for an Olori Ooni to frivolously and peremptory announce her divorce on the pages of the social media.\n\n\u201cWe have a tradition in Yorubaland that respects and values the woman, however, it seems the Olori failed to realise that being married to the Ooni estopped a woman from public display of tantrums and ridiculous misrepresentation of facts.\n\n\u201cWe are firmly pleading with His Imperial Majesty, Kabiyesi Ooni to look beyond the current travails and obstacles as a passing wind, see the bigger picture of how all of us from diverse backgrounds support and express our unending love for His Majesty.\n\n\u201cKabiyesi Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Babatunde Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, The Ooni of Ife, is an embodiment of God\u2019s love for humanity. No matter what evil predetermined picture anyone may want to paint of the Ooni, we enjoin Kabiyesi to keep focused and determined to steer the ship of unity and development of the Yoruba race to an expected promised land.\n\n\u201cWe are using this medium to serve a note of warning to anyone or group abusing or using the name of His Imperial Majesty, Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, in a most condemnable manner to henceforth desist from such sacrilegious misconduct. We have emphatically spoken.\u201d\n\nAlso, another Yoruba self-determination activist, Rasaq Oladosu, said, \u201cWe watch with utmost dismay the narrative in the media surrounding the Oonirisa and his alleged estranged wife.\n\n\u201cWhile we respect the privacy and the rights of the ex-queen to steer her affairs in the manner she so deems fit, it is imperative to note and state that the Ooni, beyond being the traditional leader of the entire Yoruba race, is an age long institution in himself.\n\n\u201cThus, the sacredness of his position and office precludes him from issues such as this. While the Ooni may not be able to make comments in the media, we will not stand by and allow the office of the Ooni and by extension, the entire Yoruba race to be denigrated.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Much ado about Electoral Act amendment",
          "text": "No surprises. It was speculated that President Muhammadu Buhari would withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 and he finally did. His concern, he said, is the mandatory direct primary through which parties are to pick their candidates. This, he maintained, will lead to high costs of conducting primaries, cause security challenges, violate citizens\u2019 rights, lead to litigation and is subject to manipulation. Parties should be allowed to adopt the type of primary election that they choose, the president argued. He has been commended by some governors and condemned by civil society groups and some members of the national assembly. I expect more fireworks ahead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany have asked me: what is direct primary? It is \u201cdirect\u201d in the sense that every eligible party member can vote \u201cdirectly\u201d in picking candidates for all elections: house of assembly, governorship, national assembly and presidential. For instance, all eligible PDP members will vote at their wards to decide who will be the presidential candidate of the party in 2023. Currently, the preferred system is \u201cindirect\u201d under which elected or nominated delegates do the voting. Under the \u201cindirect primary\u201d system, the PDP would hold a single convention where delegates from all over the federation will vote to pick the presidential candidate. This has been the most common mode of primary in Nigeria.\n\nWhere do I stand? I am not really bothered about what mode of primary a party adopts to pick its candidates. Direct and indirect are both democratic. Neither is guaranteed to be free of manipulation. And neither is primed to guarantee good governance. As I always say, our problem is not the system but its operators. We did direct presidential primary in 1992 and watched as some candidates shared N50 notes and hot loaves of bread to win votes. Also, we did indirect presidential primary the following year and watched as some candidates camped delegates in hotels and spread GMG bags around to secure their votes. As far as I am concerned, the problem is us, not the system.\n\nStill, I agree with Buhari on two points. One, the cost of conducting direct primary will be enormous for the parties and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Imagine INEC, as mandated by law, having to send observers to monitor every party\u2019s presidential primary in 8,809 wards across Nigeria \u2014 compared to just a convention in one location. Two, I agree that parties should choose the system they prefer. Some are financially stronger than the others and can afford the logistics of holding a primary election in every ward. Nevertheless, I think Buhari belaboured his argument with many flimsy reasons, such as security and ligation. Indirect will not eliminate those.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as hyperboles go in public debates in Nigeria, Buhari\u2019s refusal to sign the amendment is now cast as the worst thing that has happened to democracy in the history of the human race! The previous worst thing was his refusal to allow \u201celectronic voting\u201d in 2019. And the worst one before then was President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s refusal to allow the National Judicial Council (NJC) nominate INEC chairman as recommended by the Mohammed Uwais panel. Before that one, the worst thing ever was President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s refusal to support the return of the ancient open ballot system. Those who frame public debate in Nigeria deserve a million Nobel prizes.\n\nPray, how does direct or indirect primary produce credible elections? I have looked for examples across the world, from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas, and found nothing definitive. Who then came up with this fantastic theory that direct primary is fool-proof and the most democratic? Some people have set the tone for the discourse and \u2014 as typical of us in Nigeria \u2014 all we do is parrot them without interrogating the logic and the facts. It happens all the time. For all you care, the hullabaloo over direct primary is a face-off between governors and federal legislators \u2014 but it has now been packaged and presented to us as a struggle for the survival of democracy.\n\nThe much I know is that legislators want to curtail the influence of the governors who are in control of the party machinery in the states and can, thus, deny them re-election tickets. To clip governors\u2019 wings, the legislators want a direct system that will, theoretically, be beyond governors\u2019 control. The lawmakers can bypass party leadership at the ward level and take hot loaves of bread directly to the party members in order to secure the tickets. In a nutshell, this is the core of the direct primary controversy that has been sold to Nigerians as a patriotic war to rescue Nigeria from rigging and misrule. Fellow Nigerians, it is all politics. Head or tail, the politicians win. You and I are mere pawns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am also aware that some APC presidential aspirants prefer direct primary because, by their own permutations, it will work in their favour. Results of a direct primary are easier to manipulate, compared to an indirect primary. For instance, before the 2021 Anambra governorship election, Chief Andy Uba secured 230,000 votes in the APC direct primary and was nominated candidate. In the election proper, when more people actually vote, Uba got only 43,000 votes. Compare this with the 2017 APC indirect primary in the same state where 5,430 delegates voted and Chief Tony Nwoye got 2,146 votes to defeat Uba, who got only 931 votes. It is harder to manipulate indirect figures.\n\nMy indifferent attitude to direct primary does not mean I am saying we should not improve the electoral system to accommodate innovations. The introduction of electronic voter registration and electronic verification has obviously helped the system. You cannot change bad behaviour overnight, but at least you can make certain things more difficult for riggers. Some innovations can be implemented to continue to make some bad practices difficult in our environment. On the basis of this, I support continuous innovation. What I cannot stand is the way we shout \u201cdemocracy is in danger\u201d at the slightest provocation \u2014 simply because we cannot have our way over certain issues.\n\nThe initial \u201cbiggest\u201d thing that endangered our democracy, going by the trending argument, is that Buhari refused to sign the electoral law amendment because electronic voting \u201cwill eliminate rigging and make it impossible for the APC (his party) to retain power\u201d. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no provision for electronic voting in the amendment. What we have is electronic transmission of results. That is, the results of voting in every polling unit will be electronically fed into INEC servers. I love technology and would be happy for us to vote electronically and transmit results electronically, but do we have to shamelessly fiddle with the facts just because we want to win an argument?\n\nAnd, come to think of it, will electronic transmission of results \u2014 which I support 100 percent \u2014 eliminate rigging? If your answer is yes, then you don\u2019t understand the science of rigging in Nigeria. It is what you feed into the servers that INEC will collate. If you bribe INEC officials, security agents and polling agents to feed forged figures into the servers, that is it. We always think the problem is the system, not its operators. We are always wrong. Lest I forget, didn\u2019t Alhaji Atiku Abubakar allege (without evidence, though) in 2019 that INEC servers were tampered with and his votes manipulated? So where is this logic of fool-proof electronic transmission of results coming from?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, many activists refer to the 2015 general election as \u201ccredible\u201d because a sitting president was defeated. Yet, when Prof Attahiru Jega was appointed as INEC chairman by Jonathan in 2010, all hell was let loose. People said the INEC boss must be nominated by the NJC as recommended by the Electoral Reform Committee (the Uwais Panel) set up by late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua in 2007. Otherwise, we would never have credible elections! The PDP did not implement Uwais Panel report, critics said, because they wanted to rig. It became the sing-song in the media. Yet, PDP later lost power under the same Jega, appointed by Jonathan. The critics started celebrating Jega. Nigeria!\n\nIn my article, \u2018Jega, Uwais Report, June 12, etc\u2019 (THISDAY, June 13, 2010), this was my summary of their position: \u201cThe aspect of the Uwais Report which many see as the \u2018super solution\u2019 to electoral fraud is the appointment of the INEC chairman through a process overseen by the National Judicial Council (NJC). The body should be saddled with the responsibility of advertising vacant INEC board positions. It will screen applicants and recommend three nominees per position to the National Council of State (made up mainly of governors!) NCS will then pick one nominee per position and send the name to the National Assembly for confirmation\u2026 That is the Uwais Report magic!\u201d\n\nI then countered: \u201cBut who said an Iwu cannot emerge through this process? Has anyone ever bothered to look at (former INEC chairman Professor Maurice) Iwu\u2019s CV? You can tick all the right boxes, emerge through a rigorous process and still be a crook! By the way, I still prefer a rigorous selection process, but that does not in any way guarantee a credible INEC chairman. Our problems are deeper than that.\u201d That was my view 11 years ago. My view has not changed till today. Our problems are far deeper than systems. We have some of the most rigorous systems, theoretically designed for transparency and accountability, but we always conspire to subvert them. Always.\n\nBefore then, there was a heavy storm over what the voting system should be: secret or open ballot? In 2005-2006, the public sphere was awash with a campaign for a return to the open ballot system \u2014 in which voters would openly queue up behind the posters of their preferred candidates. According to the proponents, this would mark the end of rigging in our history. The damned hyperbole! Some even revised history and said open ballot was used for the June 12, 1993 presidential election and that was why it was the \u201cmost credible\u201d poll ever. But June 12 was conducted by secret ballot. Truth is the first casualty when some agitators want to play their game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think we should stop chasing shadows. Direct primary or indirect primary does not make a rigging culture better or worse. Electronic or manual transmission of results does not make elections better or worse. In the UK, for instance, there is no PVC or BVAS. You go to the polling unit, identity your name on the register, collect the ballot paper with a pencil, go to a cubicle, mark \u2018X\u2019 against your choice, fold the paper, drop it in the box and you are done. Without a long queue, you could conclude the entire process in one minute. You follow the rest of the proceedings on TV and hear the results in the evening or the following day. Nigerians who vote in the UK can attest to this.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, we regularly spend billions on voter registration (when national ID is clearly enough), do PVC and BVAS, buy all kinds of equipment, deploy troops and police all over the federation, disrupt the economy by restricting movements and shutting the businesses of self-employed Nigerians, engage all manner of professors as returning officers and so on. But what do we get in return? Vote-buying, intimidation, manipulation and such like. Some judges are also waiting in the wings to upturn the results depending on who can pay well. And we turn around to conclude that our problem is direct primary or electronic transmission. We will wake up one day.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nMAGODO MADNESS\n\nLast week, an army of thugs, policemen and Shangisha landlords invaded Magodo Phase II residential area. They had sued the Lagos state government for acquiring the area for \u201cpublic use\u201d in 1984 only to turn it into a residential scheme. In 2012, the Supreme Court ordered Lagos to allocate plots to the affected landlords. Fair enough. Most have accepted plots in other residential schemes, but some came with a bulldozer to Magodo on Tuesday to \u201cpossess\u201d already allocated plots whose titles they do not have \u2014 and without a valid writ of possession. Did the court say they should be \u201callocated\u201d plots or they should take the plots by \u201cforce\u201d? Whatever the merit of their case, their action was silly. In what country would private individuals bulldoze over 500 houses one evening \u2014 with women and children inside? Has our insanity in Nigeria reached these levels? Unbelievable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHUSTLE AND BILLIONS\n\nIn my previous article, \u2018How Not to Kill the \u2018Hustle\u2019 of Nigerians\u2019, I asked: \u201cWhen will someone up there realise that it is in the best interest of government to seek first the prosperity of businesses \u2014 and bigger tax revenue will inevitably be added to it?\u201d A few days later, Elon Musk, world\u2019s richest man, tweeted that he would be paying $11bn in taxes this year. Mr Taiwo Oyedele, a tax expert, commented thus: \u201cJust to put this in context, Elon Musk\u2019s $11 billion tax bill exceeds the aggregate personal income tax collected by all 36 states in Nigeria over the past 5 years. Lesson: A government is only as rich as its people.\u201d How else may we explain this to the Nigerian authorities? Sense.\n\nCOLD COVID\n\nThe Omicron variant of the coronavirus has thrown a spanner in the wheel of progress of the global fight against the pandemic as the first two vaccine doses are not offering enough protection. There is the little good news that Omicron is not as severe as its ancestors \u2014 Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta \u2014 even though it is more infectious and is now responsible for most new cases. The theory is that if Omicron becomes dominant, COVID may end up as nothing more than a cold. I hope so. Meanwhile, I got my Pfizer booster jab on Wednesday. I will continue to wear my face mask, wash my hands and observe necessary measures to protect myself and others. So help me God. Amen.\n\nLOVE IN YIKPATA\n\nWhen I saw the picture of a female soldier kissing a youth corps member while accepting his marriage proposal at the NYSC Yikpata Camp in Kwara state, I knew there would be trouble. The military runs a regimented system. There is a limit to what you can do while wearing the uniform. Even the Bible says \u201cno soldier that warreth entangleth himself with civilian pursuits\u201d. Of course, the story has now been twisted to mean the Nigerian army is saying she was wrong to fall in love. How can? Don\u2019t soldiers marry? All said and done, though, I am pleased that the army has tempered justice with mercy. This thing called love can make one forget the rules at times. Clemency.",

          "title": "Much ado about Electoral Act amendment",
          "text": "No surprises. It was speculated that President Muhammadu Buhari would withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 and he finally did. His concern, he said, is the mandatory direct primary through which parties are to pick their candidates. This, he maintained, will lead to high costs of conducting primaries, cause security challenges, violate citizens\u2019 rights, lead to litigation and is subject to manipulation. Parties should be allowed to adopt the type of primary election that they choose, the president argued. He has been commended by some governors and condemned by civil society groups and some members of the national assembly. I expect more fireworks ahead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany have asked me: what is direct primary? It is \u201cdirect\u201d in the sense that every eligible party member can vote \u201cdirectly\u201d in picking candidates for all elections: house of assembly, governorship, national assembly and presidential. For instance, all eligible PDP members will vote at their wards to decide who will be the presidential candidate of the party in 2023. Currently, the preferred system is \u201cindirect\u201d under which elected or nominated delegates do the voting. Under the \u201cindirect primary\u201d system, the PDP would hold a single convention where delegates from all over the federation will vote to pick the presidential candidate. This has been the most common mode of primary in Nigeria.\n\nWhere do I stand? I am not really bothered about what mode of primary a party adopts to pick its candidates. Direct and indirect are both democratic. Neither is guaranteed to be free of manipulation. And neither is primed to guarantee good governance. As I always say, our problem is not the system but its operators. We did direct presidential primary in 1992 and watched as some candidates shared N50 notes and hot loaves of bread to win votes. Also, we did indirect presidential primary the following year and watched as some candidates camped delegates in hotels and spread GMG bags around to secure their votes. As far as I am concerned, the problem is us, not the system.\n\nStill, I agree with Buhari on two points. One, the cost of conducting direct primary will be enormous for the parties and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Imagine INEC, as mandated by law, having to send observers to monitor every party\u2019s presidential primary in 8,809 wards across Nigeria \u2014 compared to just a convention in one location. Two, I agree that parties should choose the system they prefer. Some are financially stronger than the others and can afford the logistics of holding a primary election in every ward. Nevertheless, I think Buhari belaboured his argument with many flimsy reasons, such as security and ligation. Indirect will not eliminate those.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, as hyperboles go in public debates in Nigeria, Buhari\u2019s refusal to sign the amendment is now cast as the worst thing that has happened to democracy in the history of the human race! The previous worst thing was his refusal to allow \u201celectronic voting\u201d in 2019. And the worst one before then was President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s refusal to allow the National Judicial Council (NJC) nominate INEC chairman as recommended by the Mohammed Uwais panel. Before that one, the worst thing ever was President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s refusal to support the return of the ancient open ballot system. Those who frame public debate in Nigeria deserve a million Nobel prizes.\n\nPray, how does direct or indirect primary produce credible elections? I have looked for examples across the world, from Africa and Asia to Europe and the Americas, and found nothing definitive. Who then came up with this fantastic theory that direct primary is fool-proof and the most democratic? Some people have set the tone for the discourse and \u2014 as typical of us in Nigeria \u2014 all we do is parrot them without interrogating the logic and the facts. It happens all the time. For all you care, the hullabaloo over direct primary is a face-off between governors and federal legislators \u2014 but it has now been packaged and presented to us as a struggle for the survival of democracy.\n\nThe much I know is that legislators want to curtail the influence of the governors who are in control of the party machinery in the states and can, thus, deny them re-election tickets. To clip governors\u2019 wings, the legislators want a direct system that will, theoretically, be beyond governors\u2019 control. The lawmakers can bypass party leadership at the ward level and take hot loaves of bread directly to the party members in order to secure the tickets. In a nutshell, this is the core of the direct primary controversy that has been sold to Nigerians as a patriotic war to rescue Nigeria from rigging and misrule. Fellow Nigerians, it is all politics. Head or tail, the politicians win. You and I are mere pawns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am also aware that some APC presidential aspirants prefer direct primary because, by their own permutations, it will work in their favour.

          "title": "Ghana\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley is inside refurbished government buildings",
          "text": "Imagine 100 startups housed in 12 refurbished buildings and located in a large compound with sufficient parking space. These 12 buildings provide 8,820 square metres of space customised to fit the needs of each startup\u2014from a small team of five employees to a massive call centre of 100 employees.\n\nThis project in the heart of Ghana\u2019s capital city, the Accra Digital Centre, is a symbol of Ghana\u2019s ambition to be the startup capital of Africa. It aims to house the largest group of entrepreneurs, incubators, and accelerators from Ghana. The digital centre in Accra is one out of 16 others that the government plans to build around the country.\n\nAn aerial view of the Accra Digital Centre\n\n\u201cBeyond Ghana\u2019s capital city, the government has identified unused government buildings around the country,\u201d said David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on buildings at Kumasi, Tamale, and Takoradi. All the costs and appraisals have been done.\u201d\n\nGetting the project off the ground\n\nStarted in 2011, the Accra Digital Centre project was financed by the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation. It started with the renovation of a collection of 12 old warehouses belonging to the Public Works Department. But due to changing government regimes and interests, the project wasn\u2019t fully operational until 2017.\n\nFour years later, the Accra Digital Centre is living up to expectation and looks to be a worthy template for other centres across the country. Coincidentally, this aligns with increasing startup activity in the country.\n\nThe success of the Accra Digital Centre is indicative of what Ofori, the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, and even President Nana Akufo-Addo hope is a new future for Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has made it a priority to support innovation and entrepreneurship since coming into office in 2017.\n\nWhile Ghana still needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the startup scene is already one of Africa\u2019s top destinations for startup investment. Based on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, Ghana displaced Rwanda to take up fifth place.\n\nTo keep this momentum going, Ofori believes the government\u2019s decision to bankroll this project is important because it helps bridge the gap between the privileged and less privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen things are beyond the reach of average citizens, the government comes in to bridge the gap. Otherwise, the world would become a place of haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nThe perks\n\nOne of the major attractions of the digital centre facility is the low-rent cost. Currently, it costs $8 per square metre, a fraction of what it costs in other places.\n\nCK Bruce, CEO Innovare, a tech consulting company is one of the early tenants of the Accra Digital Centre who doesn\u2019t regret the decision to move in.\n\n\u201cWhen the centre was launched they came around to convince people to join. At the start, a lot of infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there was nobody here. It took some time for things to kick off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c As soon as we moved in, we started to grow. Every year we\u2019ve had to request for additional space; our team has grown over 100% in the past 3-4 years it\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nBy being in a space filled with many other startups, Bruce said Innovare has gotten to do business with other companies in the space and formed partnerships. In addition, the environment is vibrant and motivating for his team members.\n\nAnother early tenant of the Accra Digital Centre is aYo, an affordable insurance product by MTN. Francis Gota, CEO aYo Ghana, told TechCabal that its attraction was its affordability, and so far the centre has been maintained well. When I pointed out that instead of aYo the space could better serve smaller startups, Gota was quick to clarify that, as a subsidiary of MTN, aYo is responsible for managing its profitability and sustainability without external help. Similar to Innovare, the workforce of aYo Ghana has increased\u2014doubling from about 125 to 250 employees\u2014since it started working from the centre.\n\nWhen I asked Bruce and Gota separately what they hoped the centre could do better, they both echoed the same thing: they needed more office space.\n\nExporting tech talents\n\nBeyond the affordable real estate cost, the Accra Digital Centre organises activities and programs to educate people and spur innovation.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a hand in instigating and nudging people towards a digital future. A lot of people are still wired to go to school, and afterwards get a job. Yet they have access to a smartphone and the internet to learn,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThese activities and programmes at the digital centre are facilitated by the tech club and Innovation Hub. The activities involve getting people to try their hands on real tools like drone technology, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality. The best part of these programmes is that they are free to the public.\n\nIn the long run, these activities are meant to position Ghana as a major exporter of tech talents in Africa, starting with neighbouring countries like Liberia, Gambia, and Togo.\n\n\u201cTalents are a critical resource, and we can\u2019t keep relying on foreigners to take the lead in these areas.\u201d\n\nA private company owned by the government\n\nThe Accra Digital Centre is managed by a private company called Ghana Digital Centres Limited, under the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation. To ensure that the Accra Digital Centre functions properly, it is a private company that is 100% owned by the government of Ghana. This was done to demonstrate confidence in the private sector because people often aren\u2019t comfortable doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s job is to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. The government\u2019s core business is to bring in regulations and look out for the interest of the society and make sure there\u2019s no unfair competition,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThe government is responsible for the initial setup of the digital centres and afterwards, the revenue generated from the operations of the centre is used to run them. This way the project is self-sustaining and not a burden on taxpayers. On the flip side, the goal isn\u2019t for the digital centres to become massively profit-oriented, else it\u2019d deviate from its purpose of providing critical infrastructure and services at an affordable rate.\n\nStartups are more than websites\n\nDespite all the progress made, it\u2019s been an uphill task trying to convince local investors that startups need more than affordable facilities to scale; they need capital. The Accra Digital Centre is looking to partner with local or foreign investors and investment companies to expand its reach and impact.\n\nOfori explains that there\u2019s a cultural bias that needs to be overcome. Local investors prefer to invest in sectors like real estate and agriculture where the product is tangible, unlike in the tech sector where the products are often intangible.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to a local investor that you bought a domain name? How do you explain hosting? All you have to show is a website,\u201d Ofori said. \u201cThese businesses that seem like just websites today will become tech giants tomorrow. BMW started out as an aircraft engine manufacturer; today, it\u2019s more famous for its cars.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Flutterwave x Wizkid to drive global payments adoption",
          "text": "Before Flutterwave\u2019s launch in 2016, many African businesses and individuals had a hard time paying for services from companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, subscribing to YouTube Music, or Spotify would mean several calls between customers and their banks, or frustrated attempts using debit cards. Flutterwave\u2019s digital payment infrastructure was part of the revolution, which at the time, included Paystack\u2019s web payments service and Interswitch\u2019s upgrade of WebPay. While Paystack was more involved with helping startups collect payments, Flutterwave focused on helping anyone send and receive money via its API.\n\nSince then, the digital payments service has transformed payments in Africa with a number of solutions. It\u2019s taken a leading role in solving payments problems by enabling merchants and banks to receive multiple payment integrations with one simple API. It allows African merchants collect payments from their customers anywhere in the world, on web and mobile. Other than payments solutions, it\u2019s also created several products including Flutterwave Store, an online marketplace for merchants; Flutterwave Grow, which helps users register and incorporate their businesses in the US and UK; and Flutterwave Mobile, an app that allows MSMEs use their phones as POS machines. This year also saw the release of an integration with PayPal, which allows African merchants in 50 countries to receive payments through PayPal.\n\nFlutterwave Send\n\nFlutterwave Send dashboard\n\nIts latest product, Flutterwave Send, is taking payments to the global level.\n\nWith Send, Flutterwave is empowering customers with a product that allows them to instantly send money \u201cin a way that\u2019s convenient to the recipient\u201d. According to Flutterwave, users will be able to process payments\u2014in over 150 currencies\u2014in 40+ countries. Merchants, for example, can use Send to process payments to contractors and employees all over the world. Individuals can use it to top up their bank accounts, allowing constant access to financial services regardless of location. \u201cSend is finding yourself in Nairobi and being able to add your US-issued bank card to a product that will allow you to patronise local businesses straight to their mPesa wallet,\u201d Flutterwave announced.\n\nThe Essence of Flutterwave Send\n\nAt the helm of Flutterwave Send is Afrobeats artiste, Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun\u2014popularly known as Wizkid\u2014who was signed on as Flutterwave\u2019s global brand ambassador.\n\nLike Flutterwave, superstar WizKid has also risen to global fame in the past decade. Around the same time Flutterwave was building blocks for its now widely used service in 2016, starboy Wizkid had just started receiving worldwide recognition following his collaboration with Drake for \u201cOne Dance\u201d, a song that reached No 1 on US Billboard Hot 100 and got two Guinness World Records for being the most streamed song on Spotify [at the time], and for being the first song to reach a billion streams on Spotify. Since then, the artiste has been celebrated worldwide, getting four Grammy nominations and winning one for his collaboration with Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nFor Flutterwave, Wizkid will be leading adoption across African countries by drawing his fans in. \u201cI\u2019m excited to work with Flutterwave in bringing more Africans into the digital economy through Send,\u201d he said. \u201cFlutterwave is an African product, a quality product that actually caters to the everyday problems we face back home. For me, Flutterwave is easy and simple because you\u2019re able to send money any time, any day.\u201d\n\nWizkid will help drive Flutterwave\u2019s goal to increase global awareness of the affordable remittance service. Studies have shown that celebrity endorsements help about 85% of consumers gain confidence in brands; 50% of people are more likely to use products and services celebrities use.\n\nSpeaking on Wizkid\u2019s appointment, CEO Olugbenga Agboola said, \u201cWizkid\u2019s story is that of hard work, resilience, and excellence. The way he constantly represents Africa in the global entertainment stage is something we love. As a leading technology company out of Africa, our values align, and we\u2019re excited to have him join us to drive adoption for Send. He\u2019s genuinely interested in our brand, he knows payments, and he understands what we\u2019re trying to solve. \u201c\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days. Not to be a Grinch, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it this year.\n\nMeet the 15 semi-finalists for Pitchstorm 3.0. Find out a little about them.\n\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Techpoint Africa is a digital media company that amplifies the best innovations out of Africa through its media, data, and events.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

In particular, Honeywell Flour Mills plc with an asset base of N68 billion, an annual revenue of about N55 billion and over 5,000 employees and several distributors was subject to unfair and harsh restrictions as a result of Ogunba\u2019s mischievous suits and wrongly obtained orders until the said orders were rightfully set aside by the Court of Appeal.\u201d\n\nConcluding, Honeywell said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act (CAP L11, LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nHadiza Mustapha, chief registrar of the Supreme Court and secretary of the Privileges Committee issued a statement informing the public that the committee had at an emergency on September 15, 2017, noted that the matter of the alleged misconduct levelled against Ogunba was tabled and decided.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cthis is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the legal practitioners\u2019 privileges committee at which the respondent (Ogunba) was given fair hearing, it was decided that the petition is meritorious. \u201cConsequently, the legal practitioners\u2019 privileges committee at its 129th plenary meeting have withdrawn the rank of senior advocate of Nigeria from Kunle Ogunba Esq and all other privileges attached to the rank forthwith.\u201d\n\nThe story has been updated. https://businessday.ng/companies/article/lawyer-in-ecobanks-tango-with-honeywell-ogunba-got-back-rank-of-san-in-2018/",

They know the problem of the nation.\n\n\u201cIt is good that they educate the less informed about the realities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president noted that there was a need to be more careful in assessing the performance of the administration and it should be relative to the time and resources available.\n\n\u201cOn our three targets, we should look at where we were when we came in and where we are now in relation to time and resources,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president noted that in spite of a drop in production output and price of crude oil, the administration utilised what was available to make a difference on security and the economy.\n\nThe president assured Nigerians that his administration will use the remaining period to consolidate on efforts in restoring peace and improving the economy.\n\n\u201cFor the period remaining, we will keep doing our best especially in infrastructure so that those who will come after us will not have cause to complain,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Gov. Babagana Zulum expressed appreciation that the president was visiting the state for a second time in less than six months to commission developmental projects.\n\nHe said the people of Borno were enjoying gradual return of peace, which enabled many to return to their homes and farms, with a commendable turnout in harvest in 2021.\n\nThe governor thanked the military as well as paramilitary and the Civilian JTF for their efforts in restoring order to the state.\n\nZulum also appreciated the interventions of the president, particularly in housing and energy, which included the 50 megawatts NNPC project to improve power supply in the state.\n\n\u201cMay Allah give the president wisdom and fortitude to carry on with the good works. We remain eternally grateful,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Shehu of Borno, Dr Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El Kanemi, said the state had started experiencing a new lease of peace, with many people returning to their farms and businesses.\n\nAccording to the traditional ruler, the state had also enjoyed many infrastructural developments since 2015.\n\n...",

The corps member was seen wearing the lady\u2019s military cap as she stood directly behind him.\n\nThey, thereafter, shared a kiss to the delight of other corps members filming the incident.\n\nThere were reports after the incident that the soldier was detained by the Army, an action that generated condemnation on the social media.\n\nMilitary sources, however, said the soldier has not served the mandatory three-year service as stipulated by the Armed Forces Act before going into marriage.\n\nThe COAS has also appealed for mercy for the female soldier, which may not be unconnected with the fact that the Christmas season presents an opportunity for persons who erred to be given clemency.\n\n\u201cThe COAS, in his wisdom, believes that the young female soldier will retrace her steps and show remorse for engaging in acts that negate military ethical codes, by the time she is pardoned and forgiven. Hence, he has been appealing for her to be pardoned. This is what he has been doing behind the scene, in the last few days,\u201d said a senior military officer, who does not want to be mentioned.",

          "text": "Concerned groups, including environmental rights groups and ethnic youth leaders, have welcomed the findings of the joint investigation visit which attributed the recent oil spill in Nembe to human sabotage.\n\nThe groups, which include Friends of the Environment, Nigerian Ethnic Youth Leaders Council (NEYLC), Niger Delta Youth Movement (NDYM), and the African Centre for Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR) made their positions known in their separate reactions to the findings.\n\nThey described the report that human sabotage caused the spill as truth based on science and facts that must be applauded by all stakeholders.\n\nThey agreed that the findings should be used to get the culprits and avert future occurrences.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe groups, in applauding AITEO which has been vindicated by the findings, said they entertained no fear from the beginning that being a socially responsible oil company, the spill could not have been caused by AITEO\u2019s negligence.\n\nThey said the report which absolved the company of any fault or wrongdoing has further confirmed the saying that if lies travel for 20 years, the truth will catch up with it in one day.\n\n\u201cThis is a vindication for AITEO. Findings have shown that the spill, as we have been suspecting from the beginning, was an act of sabotage by enemies of the Federal Government and a plot to undermine President Buhari\u2019s Niger Delta agenda,\u201d the NEYLC, which is made up of the Arewa Consultative Youth Movement, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Movement, Oduduwa Youths and Middle Belt Youths said in a statement signed by the Acting Head of the coalition\u2019s secretariat, Nduka Edede Chinomso.\n\nThe Niger Delta Youth Movement (NDYM) regretted that while experts in the industry, with their science-based evidence, believe the spill was sabotage, the Bayelsa State Government\u2019s agents were using emotion to look for scapegoats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat the findings have shown us that the Bayelsa State Government had since been playing on the emotion of the people of the area and indeed all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWith this evidence and science-based findings, we hope that the state government will be humble enough to make a public apology based on the wrong position it earlier took on the matter,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nThe popular environmental rights group, Friends of the Environment, in its separate statement, said the issue of the six persons who were arrested at the scene at about 2.30 am when the spill happened should not be overlooked by the state government.\n\nIt said in a statement, \u201cSix persons were said to have been arrested at the scene at an ungodly hour of about 2.30 am.\n\n\u201cThis revelation is very key and should not be overlooked by the state government and all others concerned.\u201d\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Youth Movement (ACYM), in a separate statement, said the findings have left no one in doubt concerning the cause of the spill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEven the man from Ministry of Environment who said he had reservations was convinced when an expert addressed his fears,\u201d ACYM said in a statement.\n\nThe African Centre for Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR), in a statement by its coordinator, Nduka-Edede Chinomso, also said the findings have been proven to be the handiwork of saboteurs and enemies of President Buhari\u2019 efforts to drive revenue while preserving the environment\n\nIt said, \u201cevidence from the joint investigation panel confirms earlier information that the spill was an act of national sabotage by enemies of the Buhari regime to sabotage the Federal Government\u2019s revenue drive, destabilize the Niger Delta region and undermine the President\u2019s ongoing peacebuilding efforts in that region.",

          "text": "Following the decline in compliance with the safety measures against the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has called on security agencies to work alongside religious bodies to enforce the safety protocols during the festive season.\n\nThe call by the NCDC was contained in a directive obtained by Saturday PUNCH in Abuja on Friday.\n\nThis was as the centre disclosed during a virtual interactive session with journalists in Abuja on Friday that 45 cases of the omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus had so far been detected in the country. It added that the first Omicron case was detected in a sample on November 9, 2021.\n\nThe variant, which was first detected in South Africa and Botswana, has spread to other countries.\n\nThe NCDC, in a fresh directive signed by its Director-General, Dr Ifedayo Adetifa, said, \u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, the Federal Ministry of Health as well as the NCDC and its partners are intensifying communication efforts to remind Nigerians of the risk we face and the need to take collective responsibility to reduce the transmission of the virus.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies are also encouraged to ensure consistency of the messages to the community, as generated by relevant authorities as well as identify the right channels of communication. These include the Federal Ministry of Health, state Ministries of Health and the NCDC.\n\n\u201cInformation and feedback should also be shared with relevant authorities to influence decision-making and strategies.

It is a time to render service to others as Jesus did.\u201d\n\nThe Governor noted that his administration \u201cwill continue to promote healthy community relations with economic opportunities and empowerment prospects for all.\u201d\n\nIn the spirit of the season, Governor Fintiri urged the citizenry to also pray and give thanks for those brave men and women in uniform, many of whom will spend the holidays far from home.\n\n\u201cTheir courage and dedication is helping keep us safe and extending freedom and peace. We are grateful for their service to our country and for the support and sacrifice of their families,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile urging the people to celebrate responsibly, Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri advised that COVID-19 protocols be adhered to in view of the difficult times the nation has found itself.\n\n\u201cAs with Jesus\u2019 birth, amid the challenges we face this Christmas we celebrate aspiration, strive to do good, be charitable, forgiving and have hope and love. Let\u2019s take refuge in His timeless promise,\u201d he said.\n\nGod\u2019s faithfulness\n\nEnugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, noted that the commemoration of Christ\u2019s birth symbolizes God\u2019s love for humanity and His faithfulness in sending a Saviour to redeem the world.\n\nThe governor, who appreciated God for His goodness and mercies, urged Nigerians to remain steadfast and committed to prayers and other engagements that promote peace, love, unity, security and progress of the country.\n\nWhile thanking \u2018Ndi Enugu\u2019 for their unceasing love, prayers, solidarity, support and goodwill, Gov.

This, he said should call for celebration in moderation. He said much of the time ought to be devoted to appreciating God for His mercy and to reflect on the country with a view to seeking God\u2019s intervention.\n\nHe urged Christians and adherents of other religions to pray for an end to the deadly Coronavirus. He also reminded them on the need to stay safe, and observe all safety protocols outlined to curtail the spread of the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum also urged Nigerians to reflect on their individual contributions to the peace and progress of their immediate community, their State and the country in general, during and after the festive season.\n\nHe urged Christians to use the opportunity to pray for the peace of Ekiti State which is about to enter an election year and Nigeria which is going through various challenges at the moment.\n\nFayemi commended Christians in the state for living in harmony with adherents of other religions, a gesture which he said makes Ekiti one of the most peaceful states in the country.\n\nAssurance for safety\n\nAbia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu urged residents to celebrate the season with a full understanding of its significance in the life of the average Christian.\n\nThe birth of Christ, according to the Governor, is about the most important event in Christianity, since it was the beginning of the redemption of mankind.\n\nGovernor Ikpeazu assured the people of Abia State that his administration has taken critical steps to ensure that people are able to take part in the celebrations through the release of about 3.5 Billion Naira to deal with the issue of salaries of some ailing parastatals and pensioners, maintaining that the mainstream civil servants have continued to be up to date in receiving their salaries.\n\nThe Governor also assured the State workforce of the determination of his administration to continue to mainstream the issue of welfare of workers in the State.\n\nThe Governor further noted that contractors have been mobilized to resume work on major road projects, especially in Aba, promising Abians that the current dry season window will be fully utilized for massive rehabilitation of key roads.\n\nAccording to the Governor, the first quarter of 2022 will witness a massive turnaround in roads and other critical infrastructure and thanked the people for their patience so far.\n\nHe also assured traders at Ariaria and Ngwa Road Markets that government is working very hard to ensure that the rebuilding process of the markets is sped up as much as possible.\n\nHe announced that his administration has set aside funds that will go to the affected traders directly to the tune of 150 Million Naira as a form of assistance to those traders whose businesses have been affected by the reconstruction of the markets.\n\nGovernor Okezie Ikpeazu noted that this Christmas period will be defined by peace and security as the government has put in place measures to deal with any form of criminality across the State.\n\nThe Governor stated that all relevant security agencies are on red alert to nip in the bud, any person whose plan to disrupt the peace, security, and stability in the State at this yuletide period and even beyond.\n\nThe Governor however tasked everyone to take the security of lives and property around them seriously.\n\nRemember COVID-19\n\nOyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, in his Christmas message, charged the residents of the state to adhere strictly to COVID-19 protocol and stay safe amid rising cases of the virus in the country.\n\nAccording to the governor, residents of Oyo State must celebrate the Yuletide with caution, observe necessary precautions such as proper sanitisation, use of nose covers, and maintenance of social distancing, in order to keep the COVID-19 at bay.\n\nHe called on Christians and adherents of all other religions in the state to always be at peace and to demonstrate love and brotherliness, stating that development and progress can only take place in an atmosphere of love.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate Christmas, I celebrate with all residents of the state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Christmas festivity presents us all with an opportunity to relive the lessons of love, peace and sacrificial living that Christ taught with his life.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity to celebrate and make merry but we must also imbibe the lessons of love and harmonious co-existence.\n\n\u201cAs a state government, we will continue to do everything possible to continue to uplift the state. But we can only do so much with the support of our people.\u201d\n\nThe governor also advocated for moderation by residents of the state during the Christmas celebrations, urging them to be security-conscious and to stay safe.\n\n\u201cWhile rejoicing with Oyo State residents, I advise them to do everything in moderation, as the times we are in demand that we remain security-conscious and observe all necessary protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cSecurity is the responsibility of all and sundry, so all residents must be observant and report any untoward movements in their environments.

          "text": "The European Union can only blame its own policies for record gas prices as some of its members resell cheap Russian gas at much higher prices within the bloc, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.\n\nPutin also called on the EU to approve a new Russian gas route, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, to ease the price crunch.\n\nEurope\u2019s benchmark gas price climbed to a new record on Tuesday, up almost 800% since the start of the year. The price eased on Friday, but it was still up more than 400%.\n\nNord Stream 2 is opposed by the United States and particularly several east European states, which say the pipeline will make the EU even more reliant on Russian gas, which already supplies 35% of the bloc\u2019s gas needs.\n\nThe pipeline from Russia to Germany, which was built in September, is still awaiting regulatory approval from Berlin and Brussels.\n\n\u201cThe additional gas supplies on the European gas market would surely reduce the price on an exchange, on the spot (market),\u201d Putin was quoted as saying by news agency RIA at a joint meeting of the State Council and a council on science and education.\n\nAdding to the squeeze, the Yamal-Europe pipeline that usually sends Russian gas to Western Europe was flowing in reverse for a fourth day on Friday, pumping fuel from Germany to Poland, data from German network operator Gascade showed.\n\nRussian gas giant Gazprom has not booked gas transit capacity for exports via the Yamal-Europe pipeline for Dec. 25, auction results showed.\n\nGazprom usually books capacity via the route on a short-term basis, after Poland and Russia chose not to extend their long-term transit deal last year.\n\nPutin said Poland had \u201csidelined\u201d Russia from managing the Yamal-Europe pipeline, which has been working in reverse mode by sending gas eastward. The pipeline runs from Russia to Belarus and further to Poland and Germany.\n\n\u201cThis does not increase the Russian gas volumes on the European market, so the price is rising,\u201d Putin said according to Interfax news agency, about the reverse flows.\n\nPutin said on Thursday that Germany was reselling Russian gas to Poland and Ukraine rather than relieving an overheated market.\n\nIn Ukraine, another transit route for Russian gas to Europe, the head of state gas transmission operator said Gazprom had reduced daily gas transit across Ukrainian territory to 87.7 million cubic metres (mcm) from 109 mcm.\n\n\u201cThe reduction in gas supplies to the European Union at a time when prices reached $2,000 suggests that these are not economic decisions but purely political ones, aimed at increasing pressure on the EU to launch Nord Stream 2 on terms of the Russian Federation,\u201d Sergiy Makogon wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe benchmark European gas price soared above 2,200 euros ($2,495) per 1,000 cubic metres on Tuesday.\n\nMakogon said Europe had set a record for extracting gas from storage because of supply shortages.\n\nRussia has repeatedly dismissed charges it has played politics over gas and says it is meeting all the amounts it is contracted to supply. Companies with supply deals have also said their contracts have been met.\n\nMISSING OUT\n\nRussian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak also said Europe was missing out on additional Russian supplies because of delays to Nord Stream 2.\n\n\u201cTo my mind, European consumers are very interested in the project to start working, while the companies, which participate in it, they could have submitted additional requests as part of long-term relations on gas supplies via this new gas pipeline,\u201d Novak told Russian state TV channel Rossiya-24.\n\nHe also said European leaders had made mistakes in reducing the use of long-term supply deals in favour of the spot market, where prices are more volatile.\n\n\u201cThe countries, which receive gas via the long-term deals, they receive it much cheaper,\u201d Novak said.\n\nEurope\u2019s red-hot gas market could find some relief from redirected cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Asia as European prices make this diversion attractive.\n\nGazprom, which has a monopoly on Russia gas exports by pipeline, has not booked gas transit capacity for exports via the Yamal-Europe pipeline for Dec. 24, auction results showed on Friday.\n\nGascade\u2019s data on the Yamal-Europe pipelines showed flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border going east from Germany into Poland at an hourly volume of around 1,218,000 kilowatt hours (kWh/h) on Friday and were expected to stay at these levels during the day.\n\nData from Slovak pipeline operator Eustream showed capacity nominations for Friday\u2019s Russian gas flows from Ukraine to Slovakia via the Velke Kapusany border point were at 739,843 MWh, down from Thursday\u2019s 785,160 MWh.\n\nThat drop was being balanced by higher nominations for flows from the Czech Republic to Slovakia, meaning nominations for flows from Slovakia to the Austrian hub Baumgarten were roughly stable compared with the previous day.",

The Kremlin reiterated on Friday that it reserves the right to move its own forces on Russian territory as it sees fit and that Western countries were carrying out provocative military manoeuvres near its borders.\n\nU.S., European and Ukrainian leaders have accused Russia of building up troops again near Ukraine\u2019s border since October after an earlier brief buildup in April, when Maxar also released images. U.S. President Joe Biden and other leaders say Moscow appears to be weighing an attack on Ukraine as soon as next month, something Moscow has repeatedly denied.\n\nThe images released late on Thursday showed a base in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, packed with hundreds of armoured vehicles and tanks as of Dec. 13. A Maxar satellite image of the same base in October showed the base was half empty.\n\nMaxar said a new brigade-level unit, comprised of several hundred armoured vehicles that include BMP-series infantry fighting vehicles, tanks, self-propelled artillery and air defence equipment, had arrived at the Russian garrison.\n\n\u201cOver the past month, our high-resolution satellite imagery has observed a number of new Russian deployments in Crimea as well as in several training areas in western Russia along the periphery of the Ukraine border,\u201d Maxar said in a statement.\n\nIt cited increased activity at three sites in Crimea and at five sites in western Russia.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Russia wanted to avoid conflict, but needed an \u201cimmediate\u201d response from the United States and its allies to its demands for security guarantees. read more Moscow has said it expects talks with U.S. officials on the subject to start in January in Geneva.\n\nOn Friday, Putin said Russia had conducted a test launch of a hypersonic missile. The test follows earlier ones this month, in October, and in July as part of what he said was a new generation of unrivalled arms systems. read more\n\nWhen asked on Friday about the build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was acting to defend its own security.\n\n\u201cRussia is moving its own troops around on its own territory against the backdrop of highly unfriendly actions by our opponents in NATO, the United States and various European countries who are carrying out highly unambiguous manoeuvres near our borders,\u201d said Peskov.\n\n\u201cThis forces us to take certain measures to guarantee our own security.\u201d\n\nRussia also accused the United States and the European Union of using the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline to take Russian gas to Europe as a bargaining chip. The West has threatened to block the pipeline, which is awaiting regulatory approval in Germany, if Russia invades Ukraine. read more\n\nBiden has threatened strong economic and other measures in retaliation for any invasion, building on sanctions imposed over Moscow\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea and backing for an ongoing separatist rebellion by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine. read more A U.S. official has said new retaliatory measures could include tough export controls.\n\nRussia says its wants NATO to halt its eastwards expansion and is seeking guarantees that the Western military alliance will not deploy certain offensive weapons to Ukraine and other neighbouring countries.\n\nOther Maxar images showed a build-up at the Soloti staging ground in Russia close to the Ukrainian border, with photos shot at the start of December showing a larger concentration of military hardware than in September.\n\nPictures also showed continuing build-ups at Yelnya, a Russian town around 160 miles (260 km) north of the Ukrainian border, and at the Pogonovo training ground near the southern Russian city of Voronezh.",

Nearly 10,000 more flights were delayed.\n\nThe website showed that 1,779 Christmas Day flights were called off worldwide, along with 402 more that had been scheduled for Sunday.\n\nCommercial air traffic within the United States and into or out of the country accounted for more than a quarter of all the canceled flights over the weekend, FlightAware data showed.\n\nAmong the first U.S. carriers to report a wave of holiday weekend cancellations were United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), which scrubbed nearly 280 flights combined on Friday alone, citing personnel shortages amid the surge of COVID-19 infections.\n\nCOVID-19 infections have surged in the United States in recent days due to the highly transmissible variant Omicron, which was first detected in November and now accounts for nearly three-quarters of U.S. cases and as many as 90% in some areas, such as the Eastern Seaboard. read more\n\nThe average number of new U.S. coronavirus cases has risen 45% to 179,000 per day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally.\n\nNew York reported more than 44,000 newly confirmed infections on Friday alone, shattering that state\u2019s daily record. At least 10 other states set new one-day case records on Thursday or Friday.\n\nRising hospitalizations were hitting healthcare systems especially hard in the U.S. Midwest, with intensive care units in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan bracing for the worst even as they remain under pressure from an earlier wave of Delta variant cases.\n\nIn Britain, many industries and transport networks were struggling with staff shortages as sick workers self-isolated, while hospitals have warned of the risk of an impact on patient safety.\n\nOne in 20 Londoners had COVID-19 last week, a figure that could rise to one in 10 by early next week, according to data released on Thursday by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nGovernment data showed a record tally of 122,186 new infections nationwide on Friday, marking a third day in which the number of known cases has surpassed 100,000.\n\nWhile recent research suggests Omicron produces milder illness, and a lower rate of hospitalizations, than previous variants of COVID-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook.\n\n\u201cThere is a glimmer of Christmas hope \u2026 but it definitely isn\u2019t yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat,\u201d Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, told the BBC.\n\nFrance hit another COVID-19 infection record on Friday, with its daily tally exceeding 94,000 while hospitalizations from the virus reached a seven-month high, prompting the government to convene a special meeting for Monday that could trigger new public health restrictions.\n\nDespite the uncertainties and grim news around the world, millions of Americans carried on with travel plans through a second pandemic-clouded holiday season.\n\nMoses Jimenez, an accountant from Long Beach, Mississippi, flew to New York with his wife and three children, even though the latest torrent of coronavirus cases dashed their hopes of catching a Broadway performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d or visit some museums.\n\n\u201cHamilton\u201d was one of a dozen productions to cancel shows this week as cast and crew members tested positive for COVID-19. Museums were scratched from the family\u2019s itinerary because many now require proof of vaccination and the two younger children are ineligible for the shot.\n\nInstead, Jimenez, 33, said his brood will make the best of roaming the city\u2019s streets and parks, while also seeing relatives and friends.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to get out of the house, really, get the kids out to the city for Christmas,\u201d Jimenez told Reuters on Thursday at New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport.\n\nNew York planned to sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its annual outdoor New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, in response to the surge of new coronavirus cases, capping the number of attendees 15,000.\n\nThe Biden administration will next week lift travel restrictions on eight southern African countries imposed last month over concerns about the Omicron variant, the White House said.",
