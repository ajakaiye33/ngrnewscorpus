          "title": "Foundation encourages youths participation in electoral process",
          "text": "A non-profit organisation, Anap Foundation, has stated that in line with its objective of driving Nigerian youths to actively participate in the nation\u2019s electoral processes, it would inaugurate the GoNigeria Hausa rap challenge.\n\nThe foundation disclosed this in a statement in Lagos on Thursday, adding that the contest which was organised for young Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 34, would serve as an incentive-driven platform that would boost political participation by Nigerian youths.\n\nThe statement read partly, \u201cThese GoNigeria competitions act as an incentivising platform that should also boost political participation by Nigerian youths, as the messaging requires participants to showcase their communication skills beyond entertainment alone, but by also delivering an important message through rap that is consistent with the ongoing GoNigeria advocacy campaign.\n\n\u201cThe Hausa Rap Challenge will be anchored by Buba Barnabas Luka (Classiq) and the contest will run from Friday, June 10, 2022 to Thursday, June 30, 2022. Only Nigerian youths between the ages of 18 and 34 years and who have Permanent Voter Cards are eligible to participate. Participants are required to send in a 60 seconds rap video, in which they must show their PVCs or registration slip and play with the word PVC in their rap production.\n\n\u201cWhile the thrust of the rap challenge is aimed at engaging Nigerian youths with a strong inclination towards rap to showcase their talents, the real objective is aimed at encouraging Nigerian youths, within the eligibility demographics of the challenge.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

This indeed demonstrates the camaraderie that brought us together over eight years ago.\n\n\u201cThe party primaries were peacefully conducted and the delegates have selected the candidate to carry the APC flag in the 2023 presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cToday, as a patriotic APC member and stakeholder, I trust that you will come together to work with our candidate to win the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said although the administration had achieved a lot, there is much work to be done.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the past seven years in government, we have achieved a lot. However, we have a lot more to do.\n\n\u201cThe APC project is far from over and we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\u201d\n\nBuhari added: \u201cOur candidate, His Excellency, Senator Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is no stranger to you.\n\n\u201cHe is our friend and brother. We know his commitment, his track record, and his capacity to lead our party to success.\n\n\u201cSo, now is the time for all of us to come together and march forward, as we did in 2015, to a convincing APC victory.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working closely with APC Governors to support Senator Tinubu and all our APC candidates to success in 2023.\u201d\n\nBuhari writes Tinubu\n\nThe President said he would work with the APC presidential candidate, the campaign team and the party to achieve victory in next year\u2019s poll.\n\nIn the letter, the President said he was reassured by his impressive margin of victory at the primary, which demonstrated that the party, through its delegates, was united behind the flag bearer.\n\nPresident Buhari also commended Tinubu for what he described as his impressive acceptance speech, which stressed the importance of unity in the party.\n\nThe President, who highlighted his achievements in the areas of economic diversification, social investment, battle against corruption and anti-terror war, said Tinubu\u2019s victory represented for the country \u201ca source of hope for a future characterised by peace, prosperity and freedom for all\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cI look forward to working with Your Excellency, your campaign team and the wider APC family to ensure victory for the APC.\u201d\n\nAdamu, who led members of the National Working Committee (NWC), on a congratulatory visit to Tinubu at his Abuja residence, said: \u201cTinubu is our project.\u201d\n\nAdamu, who reflected on the outcome of the primary, told reporters that the delegates spoke in clear terms with the overwhelming support for the standard-bearer.\n\n\u201cFor us, action speaks louder than voice. We are here to join our brother and congratulate him and assure him that we are together. This is our project and by God\u2019s grace, we will succeed.\u201d\n\nAPC governors from the northern states also paid a visit to Tinubu.\n\nThe governors held a meeting with the candidate on critical matters.\n\nThe governors included Bagudu, Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina), Umar Ganduje (Kano), Inuwa Yahaya (Gombe), Simon Lalong (Plateau) and his Niger State counterpart, Abubakar Sani Bello.",

For instance, the French Development Agency (AFD) and the World Bank are offering miscellaneous support for the implementation of the ten strategic goals of the blueprint.\n\n\u201cThe American Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and the CHEA International Quality Group are impressed with the reports of progress being made in implementing the blueprint.\n\n\u201cWe have started seeing evidence that the reforms are working. Last week, Tristan Horlick, the Regional Manager \u2013 Africa for THE (Times Higher Education) wrote to me saying \u201cFirstly, I would like to extend my congratulations to yourself and the Nigerian universities who have participated in the Impact Rankings this year! We have had some really impressive results from these universities with Covenant University and Afe Babalola University placing within the top 400 universities worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe competition was fierce this year with almost 300 new institutions ranked, so this is a huge achievement for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am delighted about the commitment of Malam Adamu Adamu, the Minister of Education to having a more stable academic calendar, better resourcing of the system and better motivation for staff.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has disclosed that last Sunday attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State, by gunmen leading to the death of worshippers have been linked to Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP).\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola who briefed State House Correspondents at the end of National Security Council Meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe minister who briefed alongside Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Baba Usman; said the police has been ordered to go after the perpetrators of the act and bring them to justice.\n\nAccording to him, the imprint of ISWAP has been found at the scene of the attack, vowing that they will be brought to Justice.\n\nAccording to Aregbesola, ISWAP\u2019s aim is to pit Nigerians against each other by this attack to make it appear as ethno-religious war.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Council is quite concerned about the violent attack in Owo, Ondo State. We have been able to locate the imprints of the perpetrators of that attack and form all indications, we are zeroing in on the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP).\n\nIt is not an ethno-religious thing. The ISWAP members wanting attention and recognition are suspected to have carried out that attack and we have directed all the agencies concerned to go after them and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nThe Interior Minister further said the Council is worried over recent cases of blasphemy in Sokoto State and the Federal Capital Territory, where two people were killed.\n\n\u201cWe are equally concerned about the spate of attacks in the name of blasphemy. The Police have been directed to mobilize, identify and apprehend all those involved in the blasphemy attacks in Sokoto and Abuja of recent,\u201d he added.\n\nAregbesola stressed that the current administration will not relent in its effort to provide adequate security to citizens across the country.\n\n\u201cThe assurance is that we are committed to maintaining law and order and providing adequate security for Nigerian citizens. Appropriate preparation is put in place for the elections coming up in Ekiti State this month and Osun State next month by principally Nigeria Police and other security agencies, with the military at the background,\u201d Aregbesola assured.\n\nThe IGP, said that 10,000 additional police officers will be graduating next month, would be added to the security architecture and enhance efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, Baba said the police will be leading other security agencies to monitor the June 18, 2022 elections in Ekiti State and over 17, 000 police officers and men have been mobilized to maintain law and order during the election.\n\nHe said: \u201cAppropriate preparation is put in place for the elections coming up in Ekiti, this month, and Osun, next month, principally by Nigeria Police and supported by other security agencies, and to some extent, the military. That\u2019s the long and short of it.\n\n\u201cThe President wants us to assure Nigerians that his administration is committed to providing adequate security and ensuring the maintenance of law and order, so that Nigerians will be able to go about their businesses, particularly farmers, who will want to go to their farms without any fear of attack or molestation.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that over 500 arrests have been made in the last two months, for crimes bordering on kidnapping\n\n\u201cIn particular, my briefing to the Security Council covers a period from 21st April, when we had our last meeting to yesterday 8th June. The security profile of the country was analyzed and brought out.\n\n\u201cIn that we had achievements and there are cases that are still undetected. I informed the council that we have made arrest of over 584 suspects involved in high profile crimes; ranging from banditry, IPOB, book haram and terrorism in general,\u201d the IGP stated.\n\nBaba also said efforts are on to rescue victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack who are still in captivity.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, as well as the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nOthers were Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, Service Chiefs and heads of other security agencies.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

All of a sudden, they started shooting people who were mostly suya and tea vendors. A J5 bus driver who was on transit and stopped to eat was the first victim. They killed a guardman and another shopkeeper who was trying to lock up his shop and run away from the assailants.\n\n\u201cThey again gunned down two young men who were eating noodles at a mai shayi stall. That makes five victims in Sabo alone. Again, they struck another area called Iba where they also shot dead another man,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nWhile reacting, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Funmilayo Odunlami confirmed the development but said it was an armed robbery case, not a reprisal, stressing that the victims involved in the failed robbery were of Yoruba, Igbo and Northern extraction.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe Command wishes to state clearly that there was no reprisal attack on the Hausa Community at Sabo area in Ondo town or any part of the state as purported by war mongers.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, 7th of June, 2022, there was an attempted robbery on a J5 vehicle with plate no MKA \u2013 469 YJ carrying Onions and Potatoes coming from Zaria enroute Ore, had a stop over at Ondo town and was attacked by men of the underworld around 0110hrs .

          "title": "Corruption Allegations Against Tinubu Linger As 70-year-old Ex-Lagos Governor Becomes Ruling APC Presidential Candidate",
          "text": "Despite court cases of alleged massive frauds hanging on his neck, former Governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu was on Wednesday officially declared the presidential candidate of the party.\n\nTinubu polled 1,271 votes at the election which was held at Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nFormer Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi trailed with 316 votes, while Vice President Yemi Osinbajo garnered 235 votes.\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan and Governor Yahaya Bello polled 152 and 47 votes respectively.\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters revealed that the fraud cases against Tinubu dated as far back as 1998, raising questions about how the former governor struggled to delay the axe of the law.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, SaharaReporters obtained original copies of a judgment in the case of United States versus Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in which Tinubu was charged (along with other defendants) in a case of massive drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\nThis judgment directly relates to (and further documents) the SaharaReporters report of September 16, 2008 \u2013 How US Federal Agents successfully Linked Tinubu to Drug Trafficking Ring in Chicago.\n\nThe United States of America, by its attorney, Michael J. Shepard, United States Attorney for Northern District of Illinois, for its verified complaint of forfeiture, stated that \u201cBeginning as early as 1998, Adegboyega Mueez Akande, with others operated an organisation which distributed white heroin, a controlled substance under Title 21 of the United States Code.\n\n\u201cThis distribution operation was conducted on a large scale and the proceeds of the operation substantial.\u201d\n\nThe judgment was that the court ordered: \u201cthat the funds in the amount of $460,000 in account in the name of Bola Tinubu represents proceeds of narcotics or were involved in financial transactions in violation of 18 U.S.C ss 1956 and 1957 and therefore these funds are forfeited to the United States.\u201d\n\nAfter protracted litigation in which Bola Tinubu claimed that the monies legitimately belonged to him, his wife, Oluremi Tinubu, and his surrogate mother, one Alhaja Mogaji, Bola Tinubu finally opted for a stipulated settlement with the US government.\n\nAccording to the settlement order dated September 15, 1993; Hon. Judge John A.

The speculation, which has yet to dissipate since then, is that Tinubu completely owns or is a major shareholder in the company.\n\nIn the same vein, the state has also never denied claims that the company takes about 10 percent of the internally generated revenue of Lagos, estimated in 2016 to be about N40 billion every month.\n\nThe court process was still ongoing when on October 27, 2020, hoodlums burnt the documents during the riotous #EndSARS violence in the state.\n\nThe court papers stating charges brought against Tinubu, his tax consultancy firm, Alpha Beta Consulting, by Apara were burnt, according to claims by Tade Ipadeola, Apara\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cEverything in Igbosere High Court got burnt including the registrar\u2019s copy of our application.

          "text": "Despite court cases of alleged massive frauds hanging on his neck, former Governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu was on Wednesday officially declared the presidential candidate of the party.\n\nTinubu polled 1,271 votes at the election which was held at Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nFormer Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi trailed with 316 votes, while Vice President Yemi Osinbajo garnered 235 votes.\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan and Governor Yahaya Bello polled 152 and 47 votes respectively.\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters revealed that the fraud cases against Tinubu dated as far back as 1998, raising questions about how the former governor struggled to delay the axe of the law.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, SaharaReporters obtained original copies of a judgment in the case of United States versus Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in which Tinubu was charged (along with other defendants) in a case of massive drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\nThis judgment directly relates to (and further documents) the SaharaReporters report of September 16, 2008 \u2013 How US Federal Agents successfully Linked Tinubu to Drug Trafficking Ring in Chicago.\n\nThe United States of America, by its attorney, Michael J. Shepard, United States Attorney for Northern District of Illinois, for its verified complaint of forfeiture, stated that \u201cBeginning as early as 1998, Adegboyega Mueez Akande, with others operated an organisation which distributed white heroin, a controlled substance under Title 21 of the United States Code.\n\n\u201cThis distribution operation was conducted on a large scale and the proceeds of the operation substantial.\u201d\n\nThe judgment was that the court ordered: \u201cthat the funds in the amount of $460,000 in account in the name of Bola Tinubu represents proceeds of narcotics or were involved in financial transactions in violation of 18 U.S.C ss 1956 and 1957 and therefore these funds are forfeited to the United States.\u201d\n\nAfter protracted litigation in which Bola Tinubu claimed that the monies legitimately belonged to him, his wife, Oluremi Tinubu, and his surrogate mother, one Alhaja Mogaji, Bola Tinubu finally opted for a stipulated settlement with the US government.\n\nAccording to the settlement order dated September 15, 1993; Hon. Judge John A. Nordberg ordered that the sum of $460,000 held by Bola Tinubu in the First Heritage Bank account be forfeited to the United States Government.\n\nA bigger scandal was uncovered in 2018 when Alpa Beta, a consultancy owned by Bola Tinubu, was caught at the centre of a N100 billion fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering petition written by Mr. Dapo Apara, its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAccording to Apara\u2019s petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Alpha Beta \u201chas become an avenue for official corruption of government officials, a conduit pipe for massive money-laundering scheme, tax evasion, among other vices.\u201d\n\nIn the petition, sent on his behalf by Adetunji Adegboyega ESG, his solicitors, Apara said: \u201cOver the years the company is being protected and shielded by some powerful politicians and people in the society which made them to always boast of being untouchable, but our client, feeling the need not to keep quiet again and strengthened by his belief in the fact that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is keen on fighting corruption, which has been the bane of our country, is of the firm belief that it\u2019s time to expose and open the can of worms called Alpha Beta Consulting.\u201d\n\nAlpha Beta first became known when it was appointed as a consultant to the Lagos State Government, arguably its first client, under the tenure of Babatunde Fowler as the Chief Executive Officer/Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue from 2005 to 2014.\n\nThe company got the appointment when Tinubu was Governor of Lagos State.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Hostel.ng wants to connect Nigerian students to quality and affordable hostels",
          "text": "In 2016, when Davidson Okafor gained admission into the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, southeast Nigeria, he learned that the university\u2019s on-campus hostels couldn\u2019t accommodate all admitted students; rooms were already overcrowded, and the overall living conditions in and around them were bad\u2014dirty rooms, broken windows, and nasty bathrooms. Like many students, he decided to find accommodation off-campus, a search that would turn out arduous. For starters, he had to shuttle between his home Lagos and Awka, an unfamiliar environment, in his hunt for a hostel room. One time, when he found a hostel room he wanted and was about to pay the rent, he discovered the agent he was liaising with was an imposter. Another time, after he had reached an agreement with the hostel manager about payment and returned to Lagos to pick up his things, the hostel manager gave the room to another tenant who had sooner than Okafor could.\n\nAlthough, as a first-year student, Okafor had a month before lectures started, the one-month search for accommodation made him miss important orientation sessions for new students.\n\nWhen Okafor realised his unpleasant experience was shared by many other students, he started thinking of creating a solution that would make it easier for students to secure accommodation off-campus.\n\nDuring a nationwide university lecturers\u2019 strike in 2016, he enrolled at a computer training institute to improve his coding skills, and it was there he met Folaranmi Olujobi, who was lead tutor at the institute, and who would later join him, as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), to co-found Hostel.ng, an off-campus accommodation solution for students.\n\nOkafor started building Hostel.ng in 2019, with help from his co-founders, Olujobi and Tobi Otomewo, a frontend developer. Hostel.ng\u2019s website allows students to explore the available hostels in their area of choice and inspect them while the Hostel.ng team confirms the availability of the rooms and schedules an appointment with an agent on behalf of the student.\n\nFrom the Nnamdi Azikiwe University campus, where the startup has its only operations, Hostel.ng currently has 150 hostels housing about 2,000 rooms on its platform and has connected about 500 students to their dream hostels.\n\nAccommodating revenue\n\nIn search of revenue, Hostel.ng has made several iterations over the years. In 2019, after building a minimum viable product (MVP), Okafor discovered that while a lot of students were coming to their website to check out their listings, they were not paying for the listed hostels via Hostel.ng\u2019s payment portal, even though there was a button for them to do so. Instead, after these students found their choice hostel on the website, they proceed to pay directly to the hostel\u2019s manager, as they didn\u2019t feel comfortable paying to a random website they\u2019d found on the internet.\n\nHostel.ng\u2019s search for a revenue model got successful in 2021 after it made money earning a 20% service fee during the beta testing phase on its short-stay leasing feature. The short-stay leasing feature allows students to rent out their hostels to other students who are on a short visit. This will put money in the pockets of students, especially in the light of the ongoing universities strike, which began on February 14, 2022, and has left in its wake empty hostels already paid for.\n\nLater this year, Okafor said, Hostel.ng will launch a rent financing feature that would allow students to pay for hostel accommodation in instalments, spread over 6 months. By partnering with Kwaba, a rent financing startup, to ensure verification of lenders, and disbursement and collection of the credit, Hostel.ng will be making this technology available to hostel managers across the country who wish to allow their tenants pay in instalments. Okafor recalls that while he was still in the university, it was not an easy task for his parents, at the beginning of each school year, to pay his rent and that of his 2 brothers, all at once. He said that it would have been more convenient if they had to foot that bill in instalments.\n\nIn 2020, Hostel.ng joined the Lagos Innovate Idea Hub Programme, a 20-week incubator for early-stage tech businesses, organised by the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF), which gave them much-needed exposure to the tech ecosystem. Hostel.ng also went through the TVC Labs accelerator in 2021 and, after a successful outing, landed long-time startup investor, Tomi Davies, on its advisory board. Davies mentors the team and assists with refining their ideas.\n\nLast year, Hostel.ng introduced its short-stay lease on WhatsApp by manually pairing students who wanted to lease their hostels with those in need of accommodation. It was able to successfully facilitate some bookings and get about 30 students who were ready to sublease their rooms for up to \u20a63,000 per day. During a concert that took place at the Nnamdi Azikwe University, students from different other universities came to visit, and this led to a spike in requests for Hostel.ng\u2019s short-stay lease feature. The founders couldn\u2019t meet up with over-40 requests it got, so they built out a feature that would automate the process.\n\nOkafor attributed the website\u2019s growth to organic bookings from its SEO-friendly name, as they don\u2019t have a marketing budget. He believes the launch of the short-stay lease and rent financing features will make Hostel.ng profitable. He also intends to close a pre-seed funding round for Hostel.ng before the successful launch of these features. For now, Hostel.ng is currently building a wait list for its sub-leasing and rent-financing features.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Kenyan government has announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nEarlier this week, a proposal submitted to the Parliament included an amendment to the Excise Duty 2015 of the Finance Bill, which provides for a 20% tax on all digital loans.\n\nLike many other countries on and off the continent, Kenya\u2019s digital lending space is rapidly growing. At least 13% of Kenya\u2019s population of 53.7 million people have taken digital loans from more than 120 digital lenders operating in the country. As at April 2021, the lenders were disbursing over Ksh 2 billion ($17 million) per month in loans.\n\nThe introduction of the tax could also mean increased interest rates for users of digital loan apps like Tala, Branch, Timiza, and O-Kash, most of which already charge high-interest rates from borrowers. Branch, for example, charges a 17% monthly interest rate, while Tala charges as high as 19%.\n\nKenya leans on digital loans\n\nThe proposed tax is the latest in Kenya\u2019s moves to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nSince 2021, the Kenyan Parliament and the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) have taken active steps in curtailing the activities of digital lenders who charge predatory interest rates and engage in unethical loan recovery practices like debt-shaming.\n\nLast year, Parliament approved the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Bill which bestowed the Central Bank with the power to regulate digital lenders. The approval also subjected digital lenders to the Data Protection Act, which prevents them from violating users\u2019 privacy through debt-shaming.\n\nThis March, the CBK also published the Digital Credit Providers Regulations, 2022 which requires digital lenders to obtain licenses from the CBK in order to operate in the country. The regulations also provided that lenders seeking licensing would be required to disclose and verify their sources of income. These regulations have not yet been implemented; the law will go into effect in September.\n\nThe proposed 20% tax could have unintended effects on the millions of Kenyans who use digital loan apps. Parliament will deliberate the proposal until Thursday, June 9th before taking a final decision.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Ikpea Esq, dated May 12, 2022 and titled \u201c SUPPRESSION OF REPORTED CASE BY POLICE OF GRUESOME ATTACK, ASSAULT AND THREAT TO LIFE OF MRS QUEEN OKOJIE BY INSPR MONDAY AIDOMOH OF MOPOL 60, IYAMOH\u201d, Mrs Queen Okojie stated that Inspector Monday Aidomoh had openly boasted to eliminate her under the guise of accidental discharge and nothing will happen thereafter, due to an irreconcilable differences between her and one Netty Abu said to be a lady friend of the embattled police Inspector.\n\n\u201cWe are informed by our client that one Inspr Monday Aidomoh of Mopol 60, Iyamoh, has a lady friend by name Netty Abu who runs a store beside our client\u2019s residence.\n\n\u201cInspr Monday Aidomoh is attached to Setraco/Hartland Estate. He passes by our client\u2019s residence and store when going and coming from the Estate, situate at the far end of the road.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between Netty Abu and our client has been so strained because of constant quarrels between them always caused by Netty Abu. In short, Netty Abu has had cause to apologize to our client in a public Newspaper on one occasion and at another had rang bell around Auchi town in her bid to appease our client. Despite the above, she does not want to see our client.\n\n\u201cIn his bid to please his lover, Inspr Monday Aidomoh has taken sides with Netty Abu by trying to revenge or fight for her with our client. This has made Inspector Monday Aidomoh to openly boasted to our client that he will eliminate her under the guise of accidental discharge and nothing will happen thereafter. He has on occasions openly called our client \u201cAshawo\u201d (Harlot) to the hearing of the public\u201d. The petition stated in parts.\n\nThe petition which was submitted to the office of the Commissioner of Police in Benin City on May 16, 2022 further alleged that \u201cHe (Inspr Monday Aidomoh) subjected our client\u2019s son, Sulieman Amin, a 10 years old child, to frog jump for a distance of over 100ft under the pretence that the child poured water on him.\n\n\u201cOn 11/12/2021, Inspr Monday Aidomoh met our client in front of her house when our client was about entering her gate in company of one Florence and started reigning insults on her by abusing her with indecent words. When she returned the insult, Monday Aidomoh assaulted her by beating, tore her clothes and took her phone (Techno Canon 15) costing over N150,000. Up till now he has not returned the phone and clothes he tore\u201d.\n\nS.A. Ikpea Esq decried the lukewarm attention the police is giving to his client\u2019s case.\n\nHe expressed his disappointment when he referred the Commissioner of Police to his client\u2019s initial petition on the same case.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid repetition, we hereto attach as Annexure \u201cA\u201d, a petition captioned \u201cPetition On A Case Of Gruesome Attack, Assault And Threat To Life Against Inspr Monday Aidomoh Of Mopol 60\u201d, dated 13/12/21, written by J.A Abolagba & Co, a firm of Legal Practitioners. The petition was received by your office on 20/12/21. It contains most of the criminal acts against our client and her child committed by Inspr Monday Aidomoh.\n\n\u201cOn receipt of the petition by your office, the matter was referred to your X-squad for investigation and one Inspr Idemudia was made the IPO. Our client was invited by your X-squad. She went there 3 times with her son. They only took her son\u2019s statement but she adopted the contents of her petition. The X-squad men came to Jattu and interviewed the DPO at Jattu who confirmed certain facts to them. One Florence made statement to your X-squad as our client\u2019s witness when they came to Auchi. Since that day, Monday Aidomoh has been threatening to deal with Florence. She works inside Hartland Estate where Inspr Monday is attached to. He has gone to the relations of Florence and reported to them that he will deal with her and ensure she is sacked from her employment.\n\n\u201cSince then the IPO has been dilly-dallying with the case\u2026.As a manifestation of the boasting, nothing has really happened to Monday even when our client has reported the incidents as they happened to your Divisional Police Officer at Jattu, Area Commander\u2019s office at Auchi and now your office\u201d.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, Thursday, inaugurated a 13-man Edo State Productivity Committee to sustain the government\u2019s efforts at stimulating productivity and driving the state\u2019s industrial growth.\n\nObaseki, during the inauguration of the committee headed by Barr. Joel Edionwe, at the Government House in Benin City, said his government remains committed to engendering progress.\n\nThe governor said his government will continue to deliver value as well as quality services to the people, ensuring a better livelihood for residents of the state.\n\nHe noted, \u201cOur focus is how we can make our institutions, country and society to deliver values to our people and stop us from looking outside to satisfy ourselves.\n\n\u201cThe role of the government is to enable production to happen in the larger society. Government is to create an enabling environment for its citizens to produce and live a fulfilled life. Our role is to create the environment and provide the amenities for people to produce effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government in offering services must be at its apex in terms of productivity, knowing that the money we spend is taxpayers\u2019 money and have to show value to the people in managing the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we are a productive society, we will create more jobs but our experience today is that we are losing jobs to other countries. We think it\u2019s cheaper to bring people from other countries but we have to change our system and ensure we begin to produce,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cIn Edo State, we knew this right from the beginning of this administration which is why we have to make government services efficient and for the people to see the value the government is creating. We must utilise our resources and ensure people deliver value to the society and state.\n\n\u201cWe have started in Edo State to reposition our public service to deliver quality services to the people. We attracted people into the services, rewarding hard work and tracking productivity, thereby ensuring we get values. We train people, create the enabling environment and ensure they deliver services.\n\n\u201cWe operate an e-governance platform to track what people are doing, raising the level of transparency. We have an academy where we continuously train our civil servants and would like to partner the National Productivity Center (NPC) to achieve this great feat.\n\nHe further stated, \u201cWe are rethinking our educational system to reset the minds of our children from a very early age to begin to think on how to deliver value and move away from the culture of certificates. Success should not be seen from a point of certificate but a point of value delivery to members of the society, either as manufacturers, a small business or as a government.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Director General of NPC, Dr. Kashim Akor noted that the \u201cEdo State Productivity Committee was set up to assist and complement government\u2019s efforts as it relates to enhancing productivity and economic development in the state.\u201d\n\nAkor, represented by Abdullahi Hassan, further said, \u201cMembers of the committee are drawn from private and public sectors in other to achieve the set goals like stimulating productivity consciousness through productivity awareness campaigns in Ministries, Department and Agencies; productivity coaching and mentoring in schools, and measuring productivity trend in public and private sectors.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the committee chairman thanked the governor for giving them the opportunity to serve, pledging to deliver on their mandate and contribute to the development of the state.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Anastacia Eluwa, Asaba\n\nAsaba Airport company has announced that it was targeting improved services and international flight operations with the successful verification of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) at the airport.\n\nManaging Director of the Asaba Airport Company, Christophe Penninck disclosed this in Asaba while addressing journalists during the verification of the ILS at the airport.\n\nHe said that with the successful verification of the calibration of the ILS, airlines would be able to land at the airport in deteriorated weather conditions up to 800 meters.\n\nThe Asaba airport boss noted that the verification done with the aid of a drone was the first of its kind in the country, adding that it gives more accurate data and does not disrupt traffic.\n\nHe said NAMA would formally carry out the calibration and certification following the successful verification of the ILS.\n\n\u201cThe ILS was installed a long time ago but was never used because we couldn\u2019t calibrate it but what we have done in the past weeks is that we invited specialists that know how to tune the equipment.\n\n\u201cIt is specially used in low visibility conditions and this means that in the past when we had flight cancellations during harmattan or raining season\n\n\u201cDuring harmattan and the rainy season we will not have flight cancellations anymore except that it goes below the very minimum.\n\n\u201cThe equipment was installed prior to our arrival and in order to make sure that the equipment is really well tuned we invited the company from Spain to do verification with the drone because it gives a more accurate reading than an aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe specialist arrived a few days ago and with the four flights we have done we are actually spot on and on perfect angle.\n\n\u201cWhen the NAMA aircraft will be available to do the calibration we will pass it with 100 percent which means that in the near future we will have a finally calibrated ILS in Asaba.\n\n\u201cThis will also make us the first airport in this region that will enable us to fly in an aircraft during deteriorated weather conditions.\n\n\u201cWe intend to build the traffic here from early morning to late at night and also aim at getting international flights here but without proper calibrated and certified equipment it\u2019s not possible.\n\n\u201cSo we actually do step-by-step upgrading of the facilities at the airport to have more traffic and to give Asaba the opportunity to develop to be the gateway to the South South.\n\n\u201cIt requires a lot of money and work but we are confident that by the end of this year a lot of things will have changed,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn his remarks, Commissioner for Information in the state, Mr. Charles Aniagwu commended the airport management for the giant strides recorded in almost one year of its operations.\n\n\u201cI am happy that a whole lot of changes have happened in this airport which justifies the government\u2019s decision to concession the airport.\n\n\u201cStarting from the number of traffic you have increased and bringing the airport to profitability and to the calibration of the instrument landing system ILS.\n\n\u201cWhen we installed the ILS then we couldn\u2019t calibrate it but you have done that within a short period of time.\n\n\u201cWe are quite pleased that we took the decision to concession the airport and it is our hope that in a short while many of those goals we have set for ourselves while concessioning this airport would have been realised\u201d , he said.\n\nHe also lauded the airport for their corporate social responsibility stressing that the state government was proud to have taken the decision to concession the airport.\n\n\u201cYou have helped us to reduce unemployment and we have also seen the traffic lights you installed along the expressway.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing today goes to show that the decision to hand over the airport to professional managers is a very patriotic decision and we are proud to have taken that decision.\n\n\u201cOur airport is now ranking far above its contemporaries with a larger number of traffic and more navigational facilities and we look forward to the real intent to make it an international hub for the South-South and a number of states in this country,\u201d Aniagwu added.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, NMCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom has said that Nigeria spent $13 million on bitumen importaton in 2020.\n\nNkom made this known at a round table at the just concluded three -day Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit, NAFNIS, in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria was blessed with 42.74 billion metric tonnes of bitumen reserve yet untapped, located in Ogun, Ondo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa States.\n\nHe said currently the global market for bitumen was $42 billion, but that the market could increase to $66 billion by 2027 due to its high demand.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there will be rise in the value of bitumen market by 2027 which is why Nigeria should look into bitumen exploration that will bring development to the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria can conserve its foreign exchange when it starts exploration on the mineral and this will bring a boost to our economy.\n\nNkom stressed that Nigeria was ranked 6th in global bitumen deposit as demand for the mineral in Nigeria is high due to high road construction.\n\n\u201cNigeria has more than 160, 000 kilometres of roads to be tarred while only 60,000 are already tarred,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Cyril Azobu, the Partner/Mining Leader, PriceWaterhouseCooper said \u201cNigeria is endowed with a good quality of untapped bitumen.\n\n\u201cBitumen is a big demand all over the world, Nigeria can serve as a hub for local supply of bitumen or asphalt for export in sub-Saharan to other countries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, issued a letter of award on November 11, 2021, to PwC to act as its Transaction Advisor and Programme Manager for the concession of the bitumen block to potential investors.\n\n\u201cProgrammes had been lined up for the successful take for bitumen concession to the right investors, noting that hopefully it will be concluded before the end of this year.\u201d\n\nHe added that the ministry in collaboration with PwC will embark on a sensitisation workshop and an investor conference will be held soon to ensure judicious exploitation of the nation\u2019s bitumen deposits.\n\nAfter repeatedly failing in the past to harness its bitumen reserves, the government in April announced it would grant concessions of bitumen blocks to prospective local and international companies in a bid to end the importation of the mineral deposit in the country.\n\nIt consequently appointed PriceWaterhouseCoopers as its transaction advisor in November 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the total value of capital importation into Nigeria in Q1 2022 stood at US$1,573.14 million from US$2,187.63 million in the preceding quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics has said.\n\nIn the its newly released data on Thursday, NBS said the figure shows a decrease of 28.09 per cent compared to last year.\n\nWhen compared to the corresponding quarter of 2021, capital importation decreased by 17.46 per cent from US$1,905.89 million.\n\nThe bureau statistics showed that the largest amount of capital importation by type was received through Portfolio Investment, which accounted for 60.87 per cent ($957.58 million). This was followed by Other Investment with 29.28 per cent (US$460.59 million) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) accounted for 9.85 per cent ($154.97 million) of total capital imported in Q1 2022.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, Dr Abdulrazaq Garba, has said that there has been an influx of investors because of the quality of geoscience data the agency had generated.\n\nGarba made this known yesterday during an interactive session with newsmen in the agency\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe stated that it was only the right type of data that could attract appropriate investors noting that the the agency has improved from generating surface maps.\n\n\u201cBefore what we do is surface maps but we have improved, we also achieved this using the appropriate tools to produce geodata. We have published the first set of data on geochronology recently, which has to do with ages of minerals,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining capacity development of the NGSA, the Director General pointed out that the agency was the bridge between the academia and the industry.\n\nHe also said that sustainability was the key to driving the mining sector into greater heights as he solicited for more funding to ensure continued growth and development of the economy.\n\nHe further stated that the success stories of the Nigeria Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, could be seen in the increased revenue generation of sister agency such as The Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, and Mines Inspectorate.\n\nSpeaking on the NIMEP Project, he said that it was a means to an end adding that there was no end to data generation as Nigeria was still at the upstream where data generation is very important.\n\nHe explained that the project was a success story as it has been able to produce Three Hundred and Thirty Three (333) maps albums presenting the 36 States and resources found in them.\n\n\u201cWhat we had when I came on board was the Interactive maps, currently we have produced Lithostructural maps that has Tetonic information about Nigeria,\u201d he added\n\nHe said Nigeria has high grade hard rock lithium mineral where pockets of occurrences has been discovered stating that its lithium occurrences were of grade and that investors were currently eager to pay large amount for some of the dataset generated\n\nNigerian Pilot reports that lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, batteries that recharge mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cNigeria lithium is hot cake now, the mineral was discovered in several parts of the country in the course of the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Project, NIMEP, during exploration and we did investigation and came up with analysis and discovered that Nigeria lithium is of high grade.\n\n\u201cHigh grade in the sense that the standard worldwide for even exploration and mining starts from 0.4 per cent lithium oxide but when we started exploration and mining, we saw one per cent up to 13 per cent lithium oxide content.\n\n\u201cAnother advantage of Nigeria lithium is hard rock lithium found and that is what investors are looking out for worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe even heard discussion with some private companies with mining licences in Nigeria and they conducted test on the lithium and we also collaborated with Canada on that too,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that all data received from NIMEP were quite exciting and would boost the economy.\n\nNIMEP is a hallmark project that provides reliable geo-sciences information needed by investors to make the right mining investment decisions in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that a track of mineralisation almost two to 10 km was discovered close to Abuja, adding that resource evaluation was conducted on the area and anomolous gold, lead and silver were discovered with Tungsten.\n\n\u201cGold mineralisation found there has high content of tungsten which is used as an additive in the production of steel, therefore, any company mining there will be mining gold associated with lead, silver and tungsten.\n\nGarba said that many companies both local and international investors are interested in the data set generated.\n\nHe said that pronouncement would be made soon on companies that had shown interest on those data saying that \u201cwhat we want to do is we are projecting to we concession the areas that are free through the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office, NMCO, so interested investors can get licence and data and take it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThese are the things we are looking at and working on to ensure that the data we generate are useful to investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile in his presentation at the just concluded Nigeria- Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit, NAFNIS, the NGSA boss disclosed that government had identified seven strategic minerals based on the information available on them.\n\n\u201cThe seven minerals are Coal, Iron Ore, Bitumen, Gold, Limestone, Lead/Zinc and Barite,\u201d he listed.\n\nGarba said that the government had invested funds in generating Geoscience data for those minerals to enable investors have adequate knowledge about them.\n\n\u201cBasically, you will agree with me that the business of mining is not meant for government to do investigation on minerals, but in this our particular climate, we need to take this information up to a particular level whereby the minerals will be attractive to investors.\n\nThe NGSA has over a hundred years been the sole generator and validator of geo data and geological information.",

          "text": "Nigeria overcame a stunning early goal to turn the screw on Sierra Leone and eventually win 2-1 to pick all three points in a Day 1 encounter of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification series at the MKO Abiola Stadium on Thursday.\n\nThe fleet-footed Leone Stars, who famously came back from four goals down to tie the match 4-4 in an AFCON qualifier against Nigeria in Benin City in November 2021, had knocked hard at the Super Eagles\u2019 door as early as the 4th minute, when a rasping shot from Mohamed Turay was tipped over the bar by Francis Uzoho.\n\nTwo minutes later, a good pass by Aribo was followed by a teasing cross from Calvin Bassey but Victor Osimhen\u2019s header failed to find target. In the 10th minute, a brilliant pass from Sadiq Umar found Osimhen, whose shot drifted away.\n\nAt the other end, just a minute after, Jonathan Morsay scored a stunning goal with a diving header from a pin-point pull-out from Alhassan Koroma.\n\nFour minutes later, the advantage could have been stretched for the visitors when they hit the upright on another counter-attack.\n\nHowever, in the 16th minute, Nigeria were level when an exchange of passes between Alex Iwobi and Moses Simon ended with the former emphatically finding the far corner of goalkeeper Mohamed Kamara\u2019s post.\n\nThree minutes later, Kamara saved a strong Moses Simon header, and in the 35th minute, Musa Kamara came close with a stinging grounder as the visitors swarmed forward once more.\n\nFour minutes before half time, Osimhen scored Nigeria\u2019s second when he drove the ball into the roof of the net from a Simon header off Ola Aina\u2019s cross from the right.\n\nIn the second half, the game flowed from one end to the other, but Nigeria should have made it 3-1 in the 58th minute when Iwobi and Osimhen carved open the visitors\u2019 defence, only for Samuel Chukwueze to get too much purchase on his shot and drag it wide.\n\nAribo, Osimhen and substitute Ademola Lookman all missed chances as Nigeria pushed for another goal, but in added time, it took Aribo\u2019s last-second intervention to deny the Leone Stars.\n\nThe Eagles pocket three points and are top of Group A, as they head to Agadir, Morocco for their Day 2 encounter against the \u2018The Falcons and True Parrots\u2019of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe on Monday evening.",

          "text": "The Kaduna state government in Nigeria\u2019s northwest has debunked reports that terrorists used a helicopter to kill 32 people in an attack on four communities in Kajuru Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Adara Development Association (ADA) had alleged in a statement on Wednesday that terrorists invaded four communities in Kajuru LGA, with a helicopter, killing 32 people.\n\nThe statement signed by President of ADA, Awemi Maisamari, said during the attack, \u201cThe valiant natives who came out in large numbers from neighbouring villages were already driving back the invaders and taking control of the situation when a helicopter appeared.\n\n\u201cTo the horror of the natives, the white painted helicopter, faced the brave natives instead and started gunning the youths from the air, clearly leaving out the killers who can be distinctly identified by the mode of dressings and from their positions\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever, the Kaduna state government, while confirming the killing of the 32 people in the attacked communities, said the story that a helicopter provided air support to the bandits against the locals was not true.\n\nThe Kaduna state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, explained in a statement on Thursday that, \u201ca helicopter (under Operation Whirl Punch) dispatched to the area, had earlier scanned the first two communities and sighted burnt houses and properties on fire.\n\nHe said the helicopter intercepted the bandits at the Ungwan Maikori community and engaged them as they retreated, before the arrival of ground troops to the general area.\n\nAruwan said the Kaduna State Government had initially received reports from security agencies, that bandits attacked the villages of Dogon Noma, Ungwan Sarki and Ungwan Maikori in Kajuru LGA on Sunday.\n\nHe said the security report indicated that, the bandits stormed the area in large numbers on motorcycles and proceeded to raze several houses, as they attacked and killed locals.\n\nThe commissioner said, \u201cSince the attack on Sunday, security agencies and traditional leaders in the locations have been updating the government on the development.\n\n\u201cAs of the time of this report, 32 persons have been confirmed dead following the attack\u2026\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cwhile the government mourned the gruesome killing and burning of houses in the attacked locations, a report was published suggesting that the victims of the attack were killed by terrorists using a helicopter is not true.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government wishes to make a clarification based on reports received since Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe bandits attacked the first two locations and killed 31 citizens. They then headed into Ungwan Maikori, where they killed one person and burnt some houses.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAn Air Force helicopter (under Operation Whirl Punch) dispatched to the area, had earlier scanned the first two locations and sighted burnt houses and properties on fire.\n\n\u201cThe helicopter intercepted the bandits at the last location (Ungwan Maikori) and engaged them as they retreated, before the arrival of ground troops to the general area.\n\n\u201cIt was the arrival of the air asset which deterred the bandits from further attacks on the citizens in the village, after the bandits had already killed one local and burnt several houses.\n\n\u201cThe story that a helicopter provided air support to the bandits against the locals, is therefore an untrue account.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Kaduna State having gone through all the facts, finds it regrettable that a section of the media would circulate an unverified report, insensitive to its implications on national security, law and order.\u201d\n\nAruwan said further that, \u201cEyewitnesses to the peddled report of a helicopter aiding bandits in the killing of innocent citizens are invited to present their accounts to the Government backed by incontrovertible facts.\n\n\u201cThe military, police and other agencies working in the general area deserve commendation and motivation, rather than demoralizing allegations\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the last 72 hours, security forces have conducted vigorous operations in the same general area, and are on the trail of a wounded notable terrorist.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, several kidnapped victims, including an expatriate kidnapped at a mining site, were rescued after a fierce engagement with bandits.\u201d\n\nHe said Governor Nasir El-Rufa\u2019i, has expressed deep sadness over the attacks and conveyed his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims while praying for the repose of their souls.\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "text": "A student who survived the Uvalde school shooting by covering herself in a classmate\u2019s blood has told the US Congress of the moment her teacher was killed during the massacre.\n\nHer graphic testimony left some representatives in tears.\n\n\u201cHe told her goodnight, and shot her in the head,\u201d Miah Cerillo, 11, said.\n\nThe Texas primary school shooting claimed the lives of 21 people, including 19 young children, and has renewed the US debate over gun laws.\n\nPast efforts to advance national gun-control regulations have often stalled.\n\nMiah\u2019s pre-recorded testimony before the congressional panel was part of a number of emotional appeals for Congress to act on gun violence.\n\nThe 11-year-old recalled her experience, which for her began when a teacher told students to hide after seeing the gunman.\n\nThe 18-year-old attacker shot her teacher as children took cover behind her desk and their book bags.\n\nMiah was wounded by fragments in her shoulders and head. She pretended to be dead before using her teacher\u2019s phone to call 911 and ask for police.\n\n\u201cI thought he was going to come back to the room, so I grabbed the [her classmate\u2019s] blood and put it all over me,\u201d she said. \u201cI just stayed quiet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it to happen again,\u201d she said.\n\nMiah\u2019s father, Miguel Cerrillo, said his daughter is traumatised.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not the same little girl I used to play with,\u201d he said tearfully. \u201cSchools are not safe anymore. Something really needs to change.\u201d\n\nLawmakers also heard from the parents of Lexi Rubio, one of the students killed in the Uvalde shooting.\n\n\u201cSomewhere out there, a mom is hearing our testimony and thinking to herself, \u2018I can\u2019t imagine the pain\u2019,\u201d Kimberly Mata-Rubio said. \u201cOur reality will one day be hers, unless we act now.\u201d\n\nUvalde paediatrician Dr Roy Guerrero also spoke to the committee to describe the fatal injuries he witnessed.\n\n\u201cTwo children, whose bodies had been pulverised by bullets fired at them, decapitated, whose flesh had been ripped apart. That the only clue as to their identities were the blood-spattered cartoon clothes still clinging to them,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe added that lawmakers are like \u201cdoctors and our country is the patient\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are lying on the operating table, riddled with bullets like the children of Robb Elementary and so many other schools,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe are bleeding out, and you are not there.\u201d\n\nThe testimonies came on the same day that the Department of Justice announced it would review the much-criticised police response to the shooting.\n\nIn Uvalde, the parents of two of Lexi\u2019s schoolmates \u2013 Annabell Rodriguez and Xavier Lopez \u2013 said on Wednesday the two would be buried next to each other at a local cemetery. The 10-year-olds had become sweethearts and were photographed together outside Robb Elementary just hours before the shooting.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the House of Representatives voted largely along party lines to raise the minimum age to buy semi-automatic rifles from 18 to 21 and ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n\nBut the proposal is unlikely to pass the divided Senate.\n\nOnly a handful of the 50 Republican senators appear open to new gun legislation, with Democrats seeking narrower measures as a compromise. Senators are expected to reach a final agreement by the end of the week.\n\nProposals with the greatest public support include a \u201cred flag\u201d law that would prevent individuals with mental illness or a criminal history from purchasing firearms, and expanded background checks on gun purchasers that would include private gun sales.\n\nRepublicans in the hearing argued that better school security \u2013 not gun control \u2013 was the answer.\n\nGeorgia Congressman and gun store owner Andrew Clyde said his military service taught him that \u201cthe harder the target you are, the less likely you will be engaged by the enemy\u201d. He also called for the creation of \u201ca volunteer force of well-trained and armed staff\u201d to assist the armed officers already stationed in schools.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in Washington DC, Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy organisation, told the BBC that the testimony of survivors and widespread public calls for change can be a \u201cpowerful\u201d call to action.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s focus on the issue,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a national shooting tragedy, we finally see more people in America decide they are going to get off the sidelines.\u201d\n\nBBC",
