          "text": "About 91 per cent of cases of sexual harassment in workplaces faced by women were being perpetrated by their bosses and superiors, research by a civil rights organization, HEIR Women Development Initiative, revealed.\n\nHEIR Women Development is a social enterprise borne out of the need to see young women take on more decision-making positions, and venture into leadership opportunities.\n\nThe organisation also said that while three in four; 74 per cent of the women have experienced online stalking, 68 per cent attest to receiving persistent emails, sexual invitations, with 81 per cent confirming that this sexual harassment had been rife.\n\nThese were the findings of \u201cCareer barriers and workplace sexual harassment against young women in Nigeria: Research validation meeting and extract on the Federal Character Territory\u201d, carried out by HEIR WDI with support from Ford Foundation.\n\nThe report of the research which was signed by the Programme Officer of HEIR Women Development, Blessing Ejeh, was obtained by Journalists in Abuja on Friday.\n\nAccording to the research, while 14 per cent of the respondents revealed that \u201cthey have been raped at workplaces\u201d, only 33 per cent of organizations were concerned about protecting women\u2019s rights even as 68 per cent lacked gender responsiveness in their organizations.\n\nThe report said, \u201cThree in five women; 57 per cent, have experienced physical sexual harassment which respondents reported in form of unwelcomed touching, deliberate pinching among others. 14 per cent of the respondents revealed that they have been raped at work. The major perpetrators of sexual harassment at work are seen to be bosses or superior, 91 per cent reported.\n\n\u201cAlso, three in four; 74 per cent of these women have experienced online stalking while 68 per cent attest to receiving persistent emails, invitations sexual nature with 81 per cent confirming that this sexual harassment is being experienced often.\u201d\n\nThe CSO said 68 per cent of the respondents reported a lack of gender responsiveness in their organization because the Human Resources Department is often charged with the responsibility of drafting protective policies on sexual harassment.\n\n\u201cHowever, their goal is to protect the interest of bosses to the detriment of other staff\u201d, the report revealed.\n\nThe research said, \u201cDespite these scary statistics, just 49 per cent of the respondents consider their workspace to be unsafe, which is a clear indication of the low awareness among these women of what sexual harassment entails and its dangers.\u201d\n\nEjeh also shed light on how sexual harassment affects career development.\n\nShe said, \u201cSexual harassment has constituted a major limiting factor to women\u2019s career journey at workplaces and participation in leadership for decades now. Therefore, this germane project seeks to identify with evidential data, the career barriers confronting young women with a lens into sexual harassment menace. Hence our theory of change is as follows- if young women are empowered with adequate tools to recognize and report sexual harassment at work, then organizations are encouraged to develop and ensure compliance with sexual harassment policies.\n\n\u201cThen, young women will have to be equipped to excel in their career and leadership aspirations. 51 per cent of the respondents reported that they have been sexually harassed at their workplace. 39 per cent of the respondents revealed that there were no systems, laws, policies to protect them at their workplaces while 35 per cent revealed that although \u201cTherefore, it is believed that laws on sexual harassment are non-existence as this is clearly shown in the fact that the labour law made no provision on sexual harassment at workplaces.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Friday led prominent Nigerians to pay their last respect to former governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, who was buried at his residence in Ogbomoso.\n\nGovernors and other politicians from the two leasing political parties on the country, the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party stormed Beulah Baptist Church, Ogbomoso where the funeral service was held in honour of the former governor before his remains were buried at his residence.\n\nAlao-Akala, who won election on the platform of the PDP in 2007 to become Oyo State governor eventually dumped the party and was the leader of the APC in Oyo State when he died on January 12.\n\nApart from the Vice President, the Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, who is also the Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum; Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde; his deputy, Rauf Olaniyan; Ogun State Deputy Governor, Noimot Oyedele Salako, attended the service.\n\nFormer governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola; former governor Ibikule Amosun and the Deputy National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party, Ambassador Taofek Arapaja among others were also present at the ceremony.\n\nThe Vice President Yemi Osinbajo described Alao-Akala as an open-minded politician, who would be missed for his magnanimity and compassion.\n\nHe said the late governor served the interest of his people when he was in power and gave quality counsel to those who were around him.\n\nOsinbajo said the late politician in his lifetime as the governor was an accountable personality who improved the Internationally Generated Revenue of the state from N300 million to N1billion.\n\nOsinbajo also described Alao-Akala as a very responsible and respectful to the views of individuals.\n\nHe said the late politician would be missed for his counsel and compassion.\n\nOsinbajo said, \u201cEverywhere Alao-Akala went in his days as governor, you would hear the chant of \u2018Oyato\u2019. Of course, he really did many things differently in office.\n\n\u201cHe significantly improved the IGR of the state from a paltry N300m to N1bn in eight months and put in place very good security architecture.\n\n\u201cAlao-Akala practically demonstrated what is possible when you have creativity and compassion. Since his transition in January, I have read several glowing tributes to his memory and the common refrain running through all of those tributes has been the attestation to his uncommon generosity.\n\n\u201cHe was indeed a simple and humane man, who practised politics with an open mind. Many testified that his resources were available to all and his home was there for anyone to come for help.\u201d\n\nMakinde, who declared that the state government would immortalise the late former governor, said a committee headed by his Chief of Staff, Hon. Segun Ogunwuyi, has been put in place to work on how best to honour the late Chief Alao-Akala.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs for the children who came with a request, I know how you feel and I will champion the cause to redeem whatever it is the late governor Alao-Akala has promised them.\n\n\u201cFinally, I have been going around determining how we can honour our great man from Oyo State. We have set up a committee headed by the Chief of Staff. If you also have any advice in this regard, let us know and, within the shortest period of time, the government of Oyo State will ensure that he is adequately honoured.\n\n\u201cOn that note, I want to say farewell to a great man, my brother, my mentor and a great son of Ogbomosoland.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State First Lady, Dr Martha Udom Emmanuel, has advised the state police command not to encourage granting of bail and out-of-court settlement for rape cases.\n\nDr Emmanuel who gave the advice yesterday when she paid a courtesy visit on the State Commissioner of police, Mr Andrew Amiengheme, stressed that all rape cases should be channeled to the family unit and not to be settled out of Court.\n\nREAD ALSO:Police arrest woman with fake N1,000 notes in Abeokuta\n\nShe also urged the police command to refrain from harassing and demanding money from victims of Gender- Based Violence, (GBV) before their cases are attended to, as such scares the victims from going to the police to lodge their complaints.\n\nThe first Lady who was accompanied by the GBV management committee, also noted that demanding money from already wounded and traumatized victims was an act of insensitivity.\n\nHer words: \u201cWe are here to officially tell you that we want to work with you and we want you to work with us. I\u2019m saying this because there are some police stations in some local governments that are not friendly.\n\n\u201cI want you sir to have meeting with them and address this issue. We\u2019ve been fighting this menace over the years now, especially cases of rape that has been on the high side. So far the police most time have cooperated with us.\n\n\u201cThey should not be demanding from somebody that is already wounded, adding salt into injury. Also, settlement of rape cases and granting of bails should not be encouraged. When they do that, these people will go out there and be bragging.\n\n\u201cAnd it takes the intervention of another policeman to re-arrest them. It shouldn\u2019t be like that. We should follow one guideline. The officers should empathize with the victims and give them succour\u201d\n\nThe first lady also frowned at the situation where some police officers blame GBV victims by attributing the women\u2019s woes to either their way of dressing and bad attitude at home.\n\nResponding, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Andrew Amiengheme thanked the First Lady and her team for the visit, and reassured them that offenders would be made to face the law.\n\nThe CP, however, noted that most rape victims were reluctant to come forward to pursue their cases when they are offered money, and blamed the development on the high level of poverty.\n\n\u201cI want o assure you that since I came I\u2019ve ensured that any GBV case is settled in no other place than the court. Some people go as far as petitioning the AIG. The AIG does not interfere in such matters of GBV, but he will tell you, make sure it goes to court.\u201d The CP noted.",

          "text": "Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF)\n\nBy Ezra Ukanwa, Abuja.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, has issued a strong warning to the All Progressives Congress, APC, People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, and other political parties across Nigeria on electing youths into political offices or lose the votes from the northern part of the country.\n\nThe Secretary-General of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, Hon. Nuhu Sani Lere, who spoke on behalf of the Arewa youths said the northern region has resolved to support only political parties that will present worthy youths as candidate for political positions.\n\nREAD ALSO:IPOB shut down markets, schools, banks in Imo ahead of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s trial\n\nDuring a one-day roundtable and media parley for endorsement of credible youth political aspirants in Abuja, Lere enjoined political parties to ensure that passionate youths are presented as candidates vying for political positions.\n\nLere who is also the Magajin Gari Piriga who said that the youths are shocked to see parties still fielding old aspirants as party chairmen thereby neglecting vibrant and resourceful youths in the party, alleged that the Northern youths are tired of the old politicians who he claimed have brought them an ugly past.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are in consultations and have resolved unanimously to vote only parties that elect youths into offices.\n\n\u201cHow do you vote people of 70 years and above? Or is it those with EFCC cases, Boko Haram sponsors or anti-social media campaigner?\u201d Nigeria he said, cannot move forward with this same old crooks with same songs.\n\n\u201cWe need change, and the change begins now. Any party that failed to elect youths into leadership positions in the party faces the risk of loosing our votes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, the aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Northwest Zonal Leader, Jibril Adamu, called out on Nigerian Youths to make themselves readily available in championing the cause of leadership in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cmy message to young people like me is that as young people we have never been close to leadership of this country, when it comes to political party.\n\n\u201cThis time around, for the first time, we\u2019ve had somebody who\u2019s less than 50, coming out for the position of national chairman of a party, there\u2019s a strong signal politically, and a wake up call to my generation that as young people, we must not just relax, and expect everything to work smoothly simply because we are young people. We must show commitment, determination that yes, we can do.\n\n\u201cAs young people, the best we can do is to identify, support and promote somebody within our generation, and that we must start now, because we barely don\u2019t have time.\n\n\u201cThe convention that is forthcoming, APC, is more of a foundation for us to excel, if truly we want to watch, the best we can do is to participate. We must see every little opportunity as an opportunity to launch an attack. What I mean by attack, an attack, contest for political offices. It starts from that, and unless we do that the older generation cannot see the qualities we have.\n\n\u201cAs young people, the people we want to take over from are busy organizing intellectual event while unfortunately, people of my generation are there doing series of unserious activities, watching things that have no bearing to our development politically. We have reached a level of enough is enough.\n\n\u201cWe must rise to our responsibilities. Well, I think the missing link is engagement. There have never been an opportunity for young people to engage directly. You cannot bring somebody that is not youth to discuss youth issues. So, it is Youth for Youth. Likewise, you cannot use the fault of somebody and generalize on behalf of the young people.\n\n\u201cThere are other good young people. In the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari platform, like the state where I am coming from in Kaduna, young people are the people championing the development in Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m proud to be identified as a young person and I am certain young people will still do more, and to those who have been given opportunity and have failed out we\u2019re saying sorry, they are not part of us.\n\n\u201cThe foundation of this country have been laid by young people so why can\u2019t we revibe that energy and the synergy for us to work smoothly and so as young people, we are not happy that some of our people are falling, but that is natural for you. But there are more people who have done great things at the national level and district level\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile on the side of the women and their place in politics, an official of Women Alliance For Better Tomorrow, WAFB, Musa Lubabatu, challenged the Nigerian women to include themselves in politics.\n\nWhile she pointed the importance of youths engagement in politics, she advised the women to see themselves as fit in the political community of Nigeria.\n\nShe said: \u201cMy message is especially to the youths. They should please try to be involved in politics. We should not leave the politics for the older ones because they have been there and nothing good has come out from them.\n\n\u201cwomen, too, should be included in the government system because we also have a very vital role to play in the government.\n\n\u201cI am very sure that we have youths that are ready for it because from the posters we are seeing, from the programs held by the youth, you will know that they are ready for it. The youths have been used to do what they are not supposed to do.\n\n\u201cThey have the ability to lead. They have the ability to be governors, they have the ability to be president, but they are not being given the privilege to do that. Now, I know for sure that we are very ready for this.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nuhu Sani Lere, who spoke on behalf of the Arewa youths said the northern region has resolved to support only political parties that will present worthy youths as candidate for political positions.\nHe said: \u201cWe are in consultations and have resolved unanimously to vote only parties that elect youths into offices.\n\u201cmy message to young people like me is that as young people we have never been close to leadership of this country, when it comes to political party.\nSo, it is Youth for Youth.\nWhile she pointed the importance of youths engagement in politics, she advised the women to see themselves as fit in the political community of Nigeria.",

          "text": "People wait to cast their votes in the presidential election in Lome, Togo, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2020. The West African nation of Togo is voting Saturday in a presidential election that is likely to see the incumbent re-elected for a fourth term despite years of calls by the opposition for new leadership. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba)\n\n\u2026Says Atiku has no burden\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nABUJA- A political pressure group, the Northern Progressive League has said former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar is fit to run for the Office of President of Nigeria in 2023, saying competence must not be substituted for zoning in the interest of the nation.\n\nConvener of the group, Salisu Abdullahi Maidabino, in a reaction to calls spearheaded by a group \u2013 Coalition of Civil Society for Good Governance \u2013 that Atiku should quit the race for aspirants from the South, said Nigeria with its attendant security, economic and political challenges needs the best in 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps urge FG to sustain CBN 100 for 100 Policy on Production and Productivity initiative\n\nThis is even as the group believes no one should be barred from pursuing his or her political aspiration in the name of zoning as doing so would be unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cNo civil society coalition that is well-schooled in democratic ethos will support the constriction of democratic space and advocate a conscious denial by political institutions the rights of a Nigerian citizen to aspire to any elective office in the country, pleading zoning of political offices as justification. In this case in reference, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the Waziri of Adamawa, is appropriately backed by the Nigerian constitution, the electoral laws and other conventions to run for any office of his choice in this country.\n\n\u201cNeed we remind this coalition that the processes of political recruitment have been well set out by the Nigerian constitution, the Electoral Act and the constitution of the political parties. In all of these, be it party primaries or the main elections, the voters hold the aces. They decide who they want at every stage of the elections and not the obviously hired voices of a nebulous coalition. No matter the decibels of noise from any coalition, the law remains the law and the right to choose who leads them is the weapon of the voters. The road to 2023 certainly cannot be constructed outside these guidelines.\n\n\u201cIf leadership is anchored on knowledge, skills and experience, and if narrowed to political leadership which is assessed by the democratic credentials of an aspirant, then the Wazirin Adamawa fits perfectly into this bill.\n\n\u201cBefore becoming the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for eight years, he had patiently undergone political tutelage over the years, culminating in his election as the Governor of Adamawa state before he was handpicked among the lots as the vice president of Nigeria. Therefore this absurd call by the coalition to bar through a backdoor with a misnomer called zoning is incongruous with Nigerians\u2019 collective resolve to salvage the nation battered by mediocrity.\n\n\u201cOur demand is simple: whosoever the coalition is surrogating and promoting or intends to crown a king or kings should hop into the political arena with others including the Wazirin Adamawa and go through the whole hog of the envisaged free and fair contest.\n\n\u201cWe will accept a winner that emerges through this process but calling for erection of undemocratic barriers for some people to be filtered out based on their geographic zone is an indecent agitation from a coalition. Rightly, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in this Project 2023 is not subscribing to this platform and has therefore opted for a level-playing field for all. That\u2019s what it should be,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nIt further noted that PDP, that Atiku Abubabar hopes to use as platform for his ambition \u201chas not zoned the Presidential ticket to any section of the country, neither has the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC, said any word on it too.\u201d",

          "text": "The Chairman of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) Chairman, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan, has paid a working visit to the headquarters of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, to discuss matters of mutual interest between the two federal government agencies.\n\nAmong his entourage were Alhaji Magaji Hardawa, NAHCON\u2019s Commissioner of Operation as well as NAHCON\u2019s Secretary to the Commissione, Dr Rabi\u2019u Abdullahi Kontagora among others.\n\nThey were received by the NDLEA Chairman, Brig Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Rtd).\n\nDisclosing the reason for the visit, the Hajj Commission Chairman recalled that illicit drug trafficking is one of the endemic vices challenging security personnel globally.\n\nHe said NAHCON is particularly concerned over the Nigerian-Saudi Arabian route since the kingdom is one of the precincts where the Commission\u2019s major obligations are discharged.\n\nAlhaji Hassan said it has been a tradition of the Commission to partner with the drug war agency in Nigeria in sensitizing pilgrims of the danger in trafficking drugs into Saudi Arabia whose penalty is death when caught.\n\nAccording to him, as this season\u2019s Hajj approaches, NAHCON finds it expedient to seek NDLEA to intensify monitoring and fortifying luggage of passengers to Saudi Arabia and to double-check them physically while departing to the holy city.\n\nAlhaji Kunle Hassan made the call with the confidence that Saudi Arabia would soon lift its ban on entry into the Kingdom for Nigerian Muslims to perform Umrah and hopefully 2022 Hajj.\n\nHe said by this request, NAHCON intends to leave no stone unturned in its desire to ensure that few miscreants do not cost the Nigerian Muslim citizenry their right for legitimate travel into the Kingdom for Hajj or Umrah.\n\nHe described the situation as disturbing that even innocent people are implicated in the drug trafficking saga, expressing confidence in the NDLEA\u2019s exploits.\n\nIn his response, the NDLEA boss, Brig. Gen Marwa agreed with his NAHCON counterpart that indeed the illicit drug menace in Nigeria is ugly. He decried the situation as worse since those who are supposed to apprehend the criminal trade are also found complicit in it.\n\nBuba Marwa was delighted that NAHCON is taking this war seriously, he assured Hajj Commission of the agency\u2019s readiness to strengthen the partnership and work with NAHCON both in Nigeria and offshore in Saudi Arabia.\n\nGen Marwa reiterated that Nigeria is well respected by Saudi Arabia whose high-powered delegation from its drug war agency had visited the Nigerian NDLEA office to carve out a teamwork strategy.\n\nBut for the Covid-19 pandemic, the two countries would have signed a Memorandum of Understanding by now on the illegal drug trade war.\n\nFinally, the NDLEA boss promised to collaborate with FAAN in luggage handling and monitoring at the airports to curtail cases like those of Zainab for whom the story would have been tragic if the Nigerian leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, who Saudi Arabia has high regard for, had not intervened.\n\nIn an unrelated development, Alhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan on Wednesday, 16th February led another delegation to Lagos state to solicit support for the Commission\u2019s activities.\n\nHe identified areas where NAHCON craves support to include the Hajj Savings\u2019 Scheme, the Hajj Institute of Nigeria where he prayed Lagos state government would sponsor its staff for training.\n\nAbove all, the NAHCON Chairman explained that the delegation was in Lagos particularly to seek the state government\u2019s support in getting Certificate of Occupancy for its land situated in the heart of Lagos.\n\nThe Chairman further lamented that out of 30 hectares of NAHCON land secured since 1975, encroachment had gulped over 95% leaving NAHCON with only three hectares out of 30.\n\nThe Commission cannot make significant progress on developing the land through Public Private Partnership (PPP) without the Certificate of Occupancy.\n\nFurthermore, the NAHCON Chief Executive Officer explained that the second reason for the visit was to seek support of the Lagos state government in the Commission\u2019s PPP plan to increase means of its internally generated revenue.\n\nHe informed that the Kano state project had reached 90% completion with the strong support of the Kano state government. The Chairman acknowledged the Lagos state government for always offering support to NAHCON.\n\nEqually, Alhaji Hassan expressed hope that Saudi Arabia would soon uplift its landing ban into the kingdom to enable Umrah and hopefully Hajj 2022.\n\nWhen that happens, the NAHCON Chairman assured that the Commission would transparently distribute Nigeria\u2019s allocated slots to states through an endorsed formular.\n\nWhile welcoming the guests to his office, Dr Femi Hamzat reassured the delegation of the state government\u2019s readiness to assist any citizen of Nigeria, Lagos being the Center of Excellence.\n\nHe directed the Lagos state Commissioner for Home Affairs, Prince Anofiu Elegushi to immediately commence the process of ratifying the Certificate of Occupancy for the land.\n\nIn addition, the Deputy Governor informed NAHCON Chairman that beyond the ordinary approval, the Ministry of Home Affairs shall oblige NAHCON with architectural support when needed.\n\nDr Hamzat concluded with the instruction that henceforth the ministry shall remain the Commission\u2019s direct contact point to fastrack granting of NAHCON\u2019s request.\n\nAlhaji Zikrullah Kunle Hassan was accompanied on the trip by Commissioner Planning, Research, Statistics, Information and Library Services, Sheikh Suleman Momoh, members of Technical Committee on Processing of Certificate of Occupancy for NAHCON Lands, media and Hajj Development Levy Project representatives. The trip ended with re-inspection of NAHCON land in Lagos State.",

When they were calculating our money, they used grade level. When we were retiring and they were calculating our money by Pencom, they used the salary grade level of every parastatals.\n\n\u201cThen, we applied and they computed it. Then, they applied from the federal government and it was paid.\n\n\u201cThen, Alhaji Ibrahim Bakare and his cohort took the money from the treasury and put it in a private account, generating interest of almost N200 million every year.\n\n\u201cThen we demanded for our money, before they were telling us the matter was in court. The matter is not in court.\n\n\u201cThereafter, Damisah is the key officer that is holding the money in his account. They have been keeping the money all along and taking interest.\n\n\u201cThis is our argument: IPPIS is owing us money. When our people are retiring, the money that was in the IPPIS was not calculated with their pension money; and we have been parading the office of the Accountant General for the past two years, the money is still there. They have generated the money out of all our members. What is delaying it?\n\n\u201cWe have some local issues like that of Damisah, the chairman for Ife. We asked him to surrender all the documents of the association, but he failed to do that. He was taken to the police station but the police were unable to arrest him. We have taken him to the Ooni of Ife palace.\n\n\u201cIf we arrest Damisah today, they know that the secret of this money, he and Alhaji Bakare, they colluded. Do we have a government who cannot control those people that are serving?\n\n\u201cAll letters we have been writing to the minister of finance, there was no reply.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered for this government and those people that are clamouring to leave Pencom, why are they clamouring? Why did they remove the police and Army? Is it because the condition of service there is not palatable?\n\n\u201cInstead of giving us 80 per cent of our last pay, they are giving us 20 per cent. For what? Is it in the constitution?\n\n\u201cWe asked them to make a provision for our checkup bills, but they refused. And Pencom is taking one per cent of our money as administrative charges.\n\n\u201cThese people had served for 35 years and you are saying they are not entitled to gratuity. We have not been paid our gratuity. The condition by which we were employed is still there,\u201d Olugbemiga stated.\n\nIn his reaction, Ibrahim Bakare of Salary and Wages Commission, Abuja, faulted the pensioners\u2019 claims.\n\nBakare denied fixing the pensioners\u2019 funds in an account.\n\nHe said \u201cIt is not possible for the Federal Government to pay money into somebody\u2019s account without due process. If you go through what they are saying very well, we are all pensioners; and as a pensioner, they will pay you your money. If they have any other money to pay you, they will.\n\n\u201cThey (the pensioners) are not entitled to it. They have complained to Pencom, saying they are not entitled to a shortfall.\u201d",

The powers that be should immediately take action against the terrorists responsible for the murderous crimes.\n\n\u201cAttacks on companies like Okomu call for concern, as terrorists are now focusing on such establishments, intent on bringing them to their knees, and in so doing create an impression that the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led government is weak. The attacks also pose great threat to the current and future investments in Edo State and Nigeria, especially the agricultural sector, which is the focal point of diversification of both the Obaseki and the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administrations.\u201d\n\nOkomu\u2019s communication officer also stated that the time had come for the Obaseki and Buhari\u2019s administrations to take decisive actions against the terrorists, declaring that otherwise, investments in the agricultural sector would be greatly affected, as it was the case with pipeline vandalism in the past, with the resultant negative effects on livelihoods and revenue accruing to both the state and federal government\u2019s coffers.\n\nHe urged the police to thoroughly investigate the incessant attacks on the company\u2019s facilities and bring the perpetrators to book, in order to serve as a deterrent to others.\n\nOlise admonished the authorities of the military, especially the Nigerian Army and Navy, to deploy their personnel in the area, in order to ensure adequate security for residents of Ovia Southwest LGA, their property and investments, with the terrorists and cultists to be dislodged from the area.\n\nIt will be recalled that police in Edo state on Thursday at Gelegele near Benin in Ovia Northeast LGA of Edo, paraded two arrested men: Destiny Tibhor, 22, and Lucky Clark, 52, for invading Okomu oil palm company, and stealing rubber lumps belonging to the firm, while they were apprehended on February 15.\n\nThe suspected criminals were paraded by the state\u2019s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Bello Kontongs, a Superintendent of Police (SP), who noted that Edo Police Commissioner, Phillip Ogbadu, facilitated the arrests, in an attempt to unravel the persons behind the attacks.\n\nKontongs revealed that the marine police component, led by Courage Ogonmwan, SP, while on patrol in the area, intercepted the suspects on Okomu waterway, while adding that further investigation would determine whether the two suspects were among the criminals who were involved in the attacks on Okomu oil palm plantation or not.",

          "text": "Concerned about how to bridge the gap between the National Peak Demand Forecast of 19,788Mega Watts (MW) and the Peak Generation of 16th February, 2022, the Federal Government has sought to attain a financially healthy and technically robust Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI).\n\nNigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) Plc, Managing Director, Dr. Nneaemeka Ewelukwa disclosed at the weekend during the capacity building workshop for members of Power Correspondents Association (PCAN) and Civil Society Organization in Lagos.\n\nThe theme of the workshop was \u2018Building knowledge and plugging skills gap in power sector reporting.\u2019\n\nHe said, \u201cthis mismatch is worrying the government that wants it to match.\u201d\n\nEwelukwa added that the government\u2019s plan is to keep expanding generation, transmission and distribution capacity to meet the country\u2019s demand.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNoting that the electricity market is a question of ability and willingness to pay for supplied power, he said that it will be critical to ensure that the electricity that will flow in the system is procured.\n\nHe insisted that the loan which the Federal Government is investing in the sector must be repaid through payment for consumed energy.\n\nAccording to him, the distribution companies are improving their performance and facilities to bring the 15,262MW.\n\nOn how to bridge the gap, he said: \u201cFor you to bridge the gap between Peak Demand and Peak Generation, it speaks to these market reforms because two things need to happen.\n\n\u201cThe system must have the ability to physically move that power. Two, if the system can move that additional power and GenCos are to bring that additional power.\n\n\u201cIt must be paid for. So, it brings us back to the point I made about a sector that is financially healthy and technically robust.\u201d\n\nHe said that the critical reforms that the government has embarked on are designed to ensure the financial health of the market and technical capacity to remove the deficit in supply to meet the demand of the country.\n\nAccording to him, the government has begun the implementation of the transmission expansion plan which works in sync with the FGN/Simens Presidential Power Initiative with phase one 7,000mw, phase two 11,000Mw and phase three 25,000MW supply.\n\nAsked to state the timeline for bridging the Gap, Ewelukwa revealed that \u201cbecause this government is keen to implement these reforms, to be honest with you, we are having sleepless nights to achieve these. They are milestones. They are targets.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that at inception, the NBET took over the Power Purchase Agreements that the defunct Power Holding Company (PHCN) signed with Agip, which had a gas component.\n\nEwelukwa noted that this is accountable for while the company is involved in the transaction for supplying gas to the Calabar Generation Company.\n\nHe explained that NBET\u2019s function in a Transition Electricity Based Market is characterized by a market-based agreement for electricity trading.\n\nEwelukwa noted that the NBET is designed to be a temporary bridge in the electricity market.\n\nNBET, he said, has a long term role to drive market competition by ensuring that it is moved from a government centres market to a private sector-driven electricity market.\n\nContinuing, he vowed that going forward: \u201cWe no longer need to buy power as a central procurer of electricity rather the power we have purchased we will stand the process of handing it over to the DisCos and the GenCos so that the DisCos can now say I want to buy power directly from GenCos.\n\n\u201cWe are enthusiastically looking at the point when we will actually start the innovation process of handing over the PPAs we signed to distribution licensees and eligible customers as the case may be.\u201d",

Against the backdrop of the opposition Party\u2019s doomsday wishes for the country, deflated PDP says the NBS Report is fake.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the PDP is still stuck on the voodoo economics it used to hide stealing and the shocking mismanagement of the economy under its watch until Nigerians voted the PDP out in favour of the APC government to restore sanity in the economy and other sectors of our national life.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party then joined other well-meaning Nigerians to celebrate the many positives of the country\u2019s sustained economic growth which consolidates our rank as Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nAkpanudoedehe maintained, \u201cOur economic growth is not mere happenstance, but as a result of deliberate programmes and policies of the President Muhammadu Buhari government to reflate, diversify and grow the economy from its former shoddy state.\n\n\u201cAs a direct result of this government\u2019s non-oil sector economic diversification drive, agriculture; trade; Information and Communications Technology; and Financial and Insurance Institutions, accounted for positive GDP growth, as reported by the NBS.\n\n\u201cSignificantly, the non-oil sector grew by 4.73%, contributing 94.81% to the nation\u2019s GDP in the fourth quarter 2021.\u201d\n\nThe party drew the attention of PDP to Thursday\u2019s report of Nigeria\u2019s second peer review by the AU-NEPAD which noted thus: \u201c\u2026tremendous progress and success have been made in many areas, particularly in infrastructure development, agricultural revolution, humanitarian services, fight against corruption and so many more for which Nigeria was highly commended by the forum of Heads of State and Government at the 31st Ordinary Session of the AU on the 4th of February, 2022.\u201d\n\nAPC then enjoined \u201cthe PDP not to be the enemy within as it laboriously tries to in the guise of opposition politics.

          "title": "Adulterated fuel: Coalition absolves NNPC of blame, asks FG to sanction oil marketers",
          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nAs Nigerians groan under the scathing effects of adulterated petrol and protracted scarcity, a coalition of civil societies has totally absolved the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) of any culpability, but put the blame on oil marketers.\n\nThe coalition, comprising Nigeria First and 100 Pro-Buhari Support Group at a press briefing in Abuja on Friday urged the federal government to immediately sanction oil marketers for the ensuing chaos, which it described as economic sabotage.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Convener of the Coalition, Richard Augustine said it was unfortunate that those responsible for this malaise (oil marketers) have succeeded in misleading unsuspecting members of the general public into believing that the NNPC was the importer of the toxic petrol that has brought untold hardship on the populace.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe wish to state that the importation of petroleum products into the country is a complex exercise that requires the inputs of numerous stakeholders, including the NNPC, oil and gas traders and marketers and others in the value chain.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the attempt to heap the blame on the doors of the NNPC is an attempt at being clever by half in the sense that there are specifications that have been established with regards to the quality and quantity of PMS to be imported into the county by the relevant authorities through the government\u2019s direct sales and direct purchase vendors agreement. (DSDP)\n\n\u201cWe must be mindful that the DSDP agreement is a type of swap whereby a certain amount of crude is exchanged in return for the equivalent amount of refined petroleum products. One of the criteria is that international companies must have a Nigerian affiliate or subsidiary or partnership with a Nigerian company engaged in downstream oil and gas business, particularly petroleum products trading.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that importers of petroleum products into the country has left the realm of the NNPC to the international corporations and their Nigerian affiliates or partners. This has also ensured that the Nigerian affiliates or partners must guarantee the product quality and quantity.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIt is thus our considered opinion that if the above is the case, we consequently wonder how the NNPC can be seen as culpable when the Nigerian partners are responsible for liaising with their foreign partners in ensuring adherence to specifications suitable for the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state unequivocal terms that these Nigerian affiliates behind the importation and marketing of petroleum products in Nigeria have refused to admit their culpability and instead resorted to blaming the NNPC for reasons best known to them\u201d, Augustine explained.\n\nHe added that the role of the NNPC is to deliver monthly crude oil lifting on a Free on Board (FOB) basis to the supplier who shall, in return, deliver petroleum products of Nigerian standard specification to NNPC on a Delivered at Place (DAP) basis, at designated safe port (s) in Nigeria, and the petroleum products to be delivered shall be equivalent in value to the Crude Oil received from NNPC subject to the general terms and conditions.\n\n\u201cIt is thus an uncharitable endeavour for these companies to refuse to take full responsibility for breach of contract by importing petroleum products that fall short of Nigerian standards into the country.\n\n\u201cWe are consequently tempted to believe that the companies involved in importing the adulterated petroleum products into the country must have willingly undertaken to compromise standards to maximize profit.\n\n\u201cThis position is hinged on the fact that it is common knowledge that the NNPC has on numerous occasions raised the alarm on the nefarious activities of oil marketers in this regard. We are also aware that the NNPC has multiple checks to ensure adherence to stipulated terms and conditions in importing petroleum products into the country. But the greed and exploitative tendencies of petroleum product marketers are always at play and responsible for what is experienced in the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria First wishes to absolve the NNPC of any blame in this regard. It has been established beyond reasonable doubt through extensive analysis of the petroleum importation regime in Nigeria under the current leadership of the NNPC under Mele Kyari, the entrenchment of accountability and transparency has been the watchword\u201d he added.",

It also poses a great threat to current and future investments in Edo State and Nigeria as a whole, especially the agricultural sector, which is the focal point of diversification of both the Obaseki and the Buhari administrations.\n\n\u201cThe time has come for the Buhari and Obaseki administrations to take concerted and decisive actions against these terrorists, otherwise investment in the agricultural sector will be greatly discouraged just as was the case with pipeline vandalization in the past, with the resultant negative effect on livelihoods and revenue accruing to both state and federal government coffers.\n\n\u201cThe Police must immediately undertake a thorough investigation and bring all those linked to the heinous attacks to book, thereby showing that they are a force to be reckoned with, and reinstating confidence in their ability to fight crime.

          "title": "365 Days to Presidential Election, the Aspirants are Emerging",
          "text": "Obinna Chima and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nToday makes it exactly a year to the 2023 presidential election and aspirants in the two main political parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 as well as some other parties, are positioning for the most coveted office in the land. They have started to throw their hats in the ring to indicate their interest.\n\nEven though the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has yet to blow the whistle to signal the start of electioneering, the political space is buzzing with the activities of potential aspirants who have started doing the leg work early \u2013 meeting critical stakeholders in an effort to sell their aspiration and win critical endorsement.\n\nAlthough about 11 individuals from diverse backgrounds have formally declared their intentions to vie for their party\u2019s ticket, many of the big names being touted as nursing presidential ambitions are yet to make a formal announcement even though their footprints are all over the political space. Every occasion, official or unofficial is now a rally of sort with political undertone.\n\nIn the next few months the political space is expected to be crowded with the big names currently holding consultations in secret and in not so secret places \u2013 finally coming out to formally make their pitch.\n\nHere are those who have declared so far.\n\nBola Tinubu\n\nSince the former Lagos State Governor, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his desire to succeed him, he has been busy moving round the country and consulting with different interest groups and individuals. Already, groups such as SWAGA, the acronym for \u201cSouth-West Agenda for Asiwaju,\u201d populated by Tinubu\u2019s acolytes and yes men, are already touring the length and breadth of the country to sell his candidature.\n\nSam Ohuabunwa\n\nThe immediate past president of the Nigerian Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa, has declared to contest the position of the President in the 2023 general elections on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ohuabunwa who had lamented worsening socio-economic and political conditions in the country, strongly believes he has what it takes to transform Nigeria. He said the greatest challenge that propelled his presidential ambition was the need to produce a new Nigeria where injustice is ruled out.\n\nAnyim Pius Anyim\n\nThe former Senate President, and one time Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Ayim Pius Anyim has declared his interest in the presidential race. He feels it was time for someone from the South-east to lead the country and has vowed to contest, whether the presidential slot is zoned to his zone or not. He strongly believes the next president should be able to rebuild, protect lives and property, revive the economy, create jobs and rehabilitate the collapsed educational system. According to him, the task ahead called for a candidate who possesses the political pedigree, vision and credentials to lead the PDP to accomplish the tasks. He believes he has what it takes to govern the country, particularly in these trying times.\n\nDele Momodu\n\nDele Momodu last month declared his presidential ambition in his hometown, Ihevbe, Owan East Local Government Area of Edo State. According to the journalist and publisher of Ovation International magazine, he remains the most qualified among those aspiring to take over from Buhari next year. He insists that he might not have been a governor, senator, minister but he has sat with the high and mighty, adding that he\u2019s qualified to become the president of the country.\n\nKingsley Moghalu\n\nA former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Kingsley Moghalu has also declared his intention to contest for president in 2023. Moghalu had said his decision to contest again for president was driven by concern for suffering Nigerians who seek an alternative to the status quo. The former CBN deputy governor contested the presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) in 2019 and has since moved to the African Democratic Congress (ADC).\n\nChukwuka Monye\n\n43-year-old technocrat, Chukwuka Monye, in January, said the time to take over the governance from the older generation is now. To this end, the Delta State-born social innovator has declared his intention to contest for the president in the 2023 general elections. Monye whose slogan is \u201cour future is now\u201d wondered how the founding fathers would be content with Nigeria\u2019s current state. Monye, is however, yet to state the party platform which he intends to contest.\n\nRochas Okorocha\n\nThe Imo West senator, Rochas Okorocha, recently made known his interest to contest for the office of the president in the 2023 general elections. In a letter to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, dated January 25, the former Imo State governor said what Nigeria needs right now is someone who is \u201cdetribalised\u201d and can unite the country. This would be the third consecutive time the politician who claims to have built several schools for under-privileged Nigerians across the country would be throwing his hat in the ring.\n\nAminu Tambuwal\n\nAminu Tambuwal, is the current Sokoto state governor. The politician would be seeking to realise his ambition under the Peoples Democratic Party. The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who declared his intention after a high-level stakeholder meeting in Sokoto, recently, said that he is not only well prepared but also ready to fix the numerous problems of the country. Generally perceived as urbane, Tambuwal will face off against other contenders in the opposition party during the party\u2019s convention.\n\nDavid Umahi\n\nThe present Ebonyi State Governor , David Umahi, declared his 2023 presidential ambition at the State House, in Abuja, coming about 24 hours after former Governor of Lagos State, Tinubu, also indicated an interest in the race. Both men are members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Umahi, speaking at a press briefing after meeting with Buhari, said his presidency will replicate his \u201cprogressive efforts\u201d in Ebonyi at the national level. The Chairman of the South-east Governors\u2019 Forum said he intends to bring a business-like spirit to governance, claiming that Buhari responded to his interest by asking him to seek the support of the people when he met with him to intimate the president of his intention.\n\nYahaya Bello\n\nThe Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, was one of the earliest Nigerians to have shown interest to aspire for the 2023 presidency under the banner of the ruling APC. Bello, however opened up in Bauchi, while addressing APC legislators as well as women groups from the North-east during an extraordinary meeting held in Bauchi at Hazibal hotel sometime ago.\n\nThe Kogi governor who has always touted his youthful age as an advantage, has described the task ahead as an enormous one.\n\nSani Yerima\n\nThe ex-Zamfara governor, Sani Yerima, has also declared his intention to govern the country. The politician while speaking during a BBC Hausa Service programme \u201cGane Mani Hanya\u201d monitored in Gusau, said since Buhari is ending his second term, he (Yerima) would continue to pursue his presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cIf God spares my life, by 2023 I would go into the contest for the post of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria \u201d Yerima said.\n\nKhadijah Okunnu-Lamidi\n\nAn entrepreneur and youth development advocate, the young Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi, has promised to make Nigeria work for its diverse populace if given the platform to do so. She promised to harness the power of Nigerian teeming youths to unleash the country\u2019s latent potential, which she described as a force to be reckoned with globally. She is the daughter of former Federal Commissioner of Works and Housing, Lateef Femi Okunnu (SAN).\n\nSome of Those Yet to Declare\u2026\n\nYemi Osinbajo\n\nWith the increasing number of groups expressing support for the vice president, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, and urging him to join the 2023 presidential race, there are expectations that he would declare his interest in the coming days. Osinbajo clearly comes across as someone, who wants to run for president, but appears to be keeping his cards close to his chest for now. His body language says as much. However, Nigerians are watching to see how Osinbajo would go toe-to-toe with his mentor, Tinubu, to actualise his ambition.\n\nAtiku Abubakar\n\nDespite the seeming opposition against his candidature, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar wants to run again for the presidency in 2023. Atiku\u2019s son, Adamu, had disclosed that his father would contest for president in 2023. While some interest groups recently advised the former vice president not to contest and have labelled him the serial presidential aspirant, Atiku does not seem to care. He is simply interested in becoming the president of Nigeria.\n\nGodwin Emefiele\n\nThere has been an increasing call for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, to join the presidential race. A technocrat with alluring pedigree \u2013 No doubt a breath of fresh in the political arena. Although Emefiele has not confirmed to anyone that he is running for president even as he is constitutionally qualified to so do, he has said he remains focused on his job and would continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government\u2019s economic recovery drive. Emefiele also believes it\u2019s the prerogative of President Buhari to plan his succession for the continuing peace and progress of Nigeria.\n\nBukola Saraki\n\nThe former Governor of Kwara State has not held any elaborate event to declare his ambition, but he has hinted on several occasions on his active Twitter and Facebook accounts, that he would likely be running for the most-sought-after position. On one occasion recently, the former President of the Senate, relayed an encounter with a follower on Twitter, who charged him to run and in his response, hinted at the possibility.\n\n\u201cEarlier, I replied to a follower of mine on Twitter, who like thousands of you, has been clamouring for a united front to #RescueNigeria. As we prepare for the journey ahead, I hope we can all join hands to get the ticket of our great party, PDP, and build a nation that works for all of us,\u201d he had said.\n\nRotimi Amaechi\n\nEven though former Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi has not declared his intention, some interest groups in the country have been nudging him to throw his hat in the battle to succeed the president. Some believe that at 56, Amaechi does not have the burden of old age-related health challenges associated with some aspirants. Many people have linked the 2023 presidency to his recent coronation as: Dan Amanah Daura, which translates to mean the \u2018Trusted son of Daura.\u2019\n\nBala Mohammed\n\nBauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed has said he is likely to run for president in the 2023 election under the PDP. Presently, he is consulting with stakeholders across the country and recently met with former president Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NCC to licence operators after February 27\n\nEmma Okonji in Lagos and Oghenevwede Ohwovoriole in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday in Abuja, officially handed over Spectrum Allocation for 5G deployment to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, who doubles as the Chairman of the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), did the official handover of the Spectrum Allocation for 5G licence to the NCC during a workshop on the National Policy on 5G Networks and handover of Spectrum Allocation for deployment, in Abuja.\n\nAside the official handover of the 5G spectrum to the NCC, the Minister also did an official public handover of the National Policy on 5G Network for Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy to the NCC.\n\nBased on the official handover of the 5G spectrum, the NCC was expected to licence winners of the 5G spectrum after February 27, when it must have given full update of the payment of the licence fees by the winners, to enable 5G network rollout in the country.\n\nNCC was expected to make formal announcement on the update of payment for 5G licence on February 27, 2022, in line with the Information Memorandum for 3.5GHz spectrum, which is the 5G licence spectrum.\n\nThe Commission had on December 13, 2021, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, successfully auctioned two slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum band to MTN Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited, at a bid price of $273.6 million for each operator.\n\nThe successful auction of the 3.5GHz spectrum band would pave way for the issuance of a fifth generation (5G) licence that would facilitate the deployment of 5G network across Nigeria.\n\nAfter the successful auction of the spectrum, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, had announced that the winners were expected to make payment for the spectrum license, on or before February 24, 2022, to enable them roll out the 5G network across the country.\n\nBefore the successful spectrum auction in December last year, the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), was occupying five slots in the 3.5GHz spectrum, but vacated two slots, which were handed over to the National Frequency Management Council, chaired by the Minister.\n\nPantami advised state governors to look beyond the money they would collect from network operators who will deploy the 5G in their states, but see the gain that its deployment would bring to their respective states and the Nigerian economy in general.\n\nPantami said, \u201cThe issue of right of way becomes a challenge from time to time. The government has addressed the issue more than ninety per cent but from time to time issues may come. I do hope that they will understand the economic benefit. The security benefits and many more of these technological advancement.\n\n\u201cIt is beyond right of way charges. It goes beyond that. So let us try to make the process very easy for operators so that they will be able to deploy 5G.\u201d\n\nHe added that the adoption of 5G technologies and its roll out would support in the development of Nigeria\u2019s digital economy\n\n\u201c5G will provide very fast and reliable communication for our security personnel and allow then to swiftly access relevant data required to carry out their duties. The time required to access data for records from hours minutes.\n\n\u201c5G will allow for real time high quality and data intensive surveillance of relevant areas using high definition cameras.\n\n\u201cEmerging technologies like Blockchain can significantly improve transparency to the delivery of government services at all levels.\n\n\u201cThe World Economic Forum attests to the potential of Blockchain to increase the efficiency and fairness of government system and by extension limit opportunities for corruption.\n\nIt can significantly improve transparency in procurement procedures enhance land and registry system, ensure that government documents are not accessed by unauthorised personal,\u201d he stressed\n\nThe minister also spoke on the national policy on 5G deployment in the country, saying, \u201cthe National Policy for 5G diploma in Nigeria for our country\u2019s digital economy is also going to be distributed after the luncheon we use the occasion for the public presentation of the policy and we encourage our stakeholders to look into it and ensure a very successful implementation of the policy on what we had been doing.\n\n\u201cAccording to February 2021 report by Accentuate, 5G-enabled factories can see up to 2O-30 per cent in overall productivity gains including improvement of 50 per cent in assemble time.\n\nThese are only a few examples to show how 5G can have a positive impact on our economy,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, Danbatta said: \u201cOn the 25th January, 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari, unveiled the National Policy on 5G Networks at the Presidential Villa.\n\n\u201cThis singular action triggered today\u2019s event \u2013 the presentation of the 5G policy to the general public and for our critical stakeholders to officially witness the National Frequency Management Council presenting the Spectrum allocated for 5G technology to the Nigerian Communications Commission. To all members of the National Frequency Management Council, your efforts are truly appreciated and your recommendations have been immensely helpful.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary General and Chief Executive of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO) and CEO of Tetconsult, UK and Nigeria, Shola Taylor, who presented the lead paper on the benefits of 5G deployment in Nigeria, said: \u201c5G is a reality and the impact on our lives is real and the benefits are endless. Nigeria is already in it. We have started well and must be prepared for the disruption that will come in spite of the challenges. We cannot go back. We cannot remain where we are so the only option is to move forward and move quickly.\u201d\n\nGiving details about 5G network, Taylor said 5G would continue to be attractive and revolutionary in nation building because it offers lower latency, higher capacity, and increased bandwidth. \u201cThis means higher data speeds, faster connections for use by individuals and businesses,\u201d Taylor added.\n\nThe Director General, National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), Aliyu Aziz, said the success of the implementation of the policy would largely depend of good collaboration between all stakeholders in the country.\n\nAlso, the Director General Galaxy Back Bone, Prof. Mohammed Abubarka, said the deployment of 5G and the implementation of the nation\u2019s digital policy would help to achieve President Buhari\u2019s government\u2019s transparency and boost the economy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nGovernor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has expressed commitment to various programmes targeted at youth empowerment and restructuring of the Nigerian economy in order to move it away from its over-dependence on oil revenue.\n\nThe CBN governor who made the remarks at a two-day CBN Fair, which opened in Asaba yesterday, said he was passionate about empowering youths, especially young graduates through various initiatives to support small and medium scale enterprises as well as agricultural support schemes.\n\nHe noted that the unprecedented rice pyramid witnessed in Abuja, recently and the over 160 per cent rise in the number of rice mills in the country was an evidence that the CBN\u2019s intervention in agriculture sector was yielding fruits.\n\nSimilarly, he said the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) of the apex bank and other development finance interventions greatly helped in mitigating the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria through the various palliatives that Nigerians benefited from.\n\nHe stressed the need for all hands to be on the deck to tackle the economic challenges facing Nigeria.\n\nThe Corporate Communications Director, CBN, Mr. Osita Nwanisoba, who represented Emiefele, at the fair, noted that growing a diversified economy that would meet contemporary challenges in a sustainable manner underscored the intervention programmes of the apex bank.\n\nHe stressed the need for Nigerians to understand the history of their economy and to know how they could key into the numerous intervention programmes and schemes designed to restructure the country\u2019s economic base from its monoculture status.\n\nHe assured that the CBN has been consistently proactive in ensuring that its initiatives were in tune with global trends, including digitalisation and smart internet innovations in the financial world.\n\nHe said the fact that Nigeria was the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency, the e-Naira on October 26, 2021, testified to the proactive state of the CBN.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst and foremost, it is important for us to know where we are coming from and where we are going, because the understanding of the past will help us to understand why the CBN is doing what it is doing. Like I said, Nigeria is a mono-product economy; mono-product because 90 per cent of our foreign exchange (FX) revenue come from oil and about 60 per cent of our expenditure also comes from oil. What this means is that whenever there is a shock out there it immediately translates to our economy.\n\n\u201cSo, it becomes even more problematic for the CBN to be able to deal with its mandate. And, we have a clear mandate, which we understand, but we feel that to be able to actualise this mandate, there are other things we need to do, and that is, to stimulate growth, to grow the economy in a sustainable manner.\n\n\u201cWhat the CBN is doing is to diversify the economic base of this country. We are saying that there are so many and so much that we can do. We have agriculture, we have manufacturing. So, why can we deal with these things so that we will be able to produce what we eat and eat what we produce?\n\n\u201cBasically, that is why the CBN is intervening in the critical sectors of the economy. These are sectors that would grow the economy, create jobs, ensure that there is export so that we will be able to moderate our exchange rate and earn even more FX and grow our external reserves.\u201d\n\nOn the significance of the e-Naira to the central bank\u2019s efforts to restructure the economy, the representative of the CBN governor said there was need to move the country in the direction other economies were going.\n\n\u201cI think the first thing we have to understand is that we are gradually moving into what I will call the knowledge economy. We have also seen what digitalisation is doing across the world. Like I said earlier, as countries begin to move away from more fossil fuel to digital economy, it becomes imperative that you need to be at pace with what is going on.\n\n\u201cToday, we to talk about a web economy, we talk about internet economy, we talk about quantum computing and the rest of them.\n\n\u201cSo, Nigeria felt that we needed to deal with this, leveraging on the sophisticated payment infrastructure that we have and launched its own digital currency. It is the first in Africa. It\u2019s quite phenomenal. I think it is the sixth in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecently, we launched the TIES \u2013 the Tertiary Institution Entrepreneurship Scheme \u2013 the whole essence is to empower the youths so that they will unleash their productive potentials.\n\n\u201cTherefore, some of the takeaways from this fair is that the CBN is a listening institution. Like the CBN Governor always say, that he wants a people-centred central bank. Two, to understand that there are interventions of the CBN and to know how to leverage these interventions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has signed an Interconnected Mini-grid Acceleration Scheme (IMAS) deal with eight indigenous solar mini-grid developers for the establishment of 23 mini-grids across 11 states of the country.\n\nExpected to generate a 5.4-kilowatt peak to connect about 27,600 households, and impact over 138,000 Nigerians in two years, the \u20ac9.3 million project is being coordinated by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) with support from the European Union and the German government.\n\nAt the award signing ceremony, the Minister of State, Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba, said the programme was geared towards achieving the country\u2019s vision of generating at least 30, 000 megawatts of electricity by 2030.\n\nJedy-Agba noted that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari was always open to opportunities that would achieve the acceleration of electricity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the national renewable energy and energy efficiency policy, vision 30:30:30 aim at achieving 30,000 megawatts of electricity by the year 2030, with renewable energy contributing 30 per cent of the energy mix. To achieve this, the minister stated that Nigeria would have to construct over a thousand mini-grids of 100 kilowatts.\n\nThe minister added that it was important to continue to find creative and innovative ways to achieve the objective, and one of which was through collaborating with development partners and the private sector.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe understand that one of the major bottlenecks for the private sector\u2019s involvement is financing, hence, the reason the NESP and REA have worked closely to develop and implement the scheme.\u201d\n\nThe eight local solar mini-grid developers include Acob Lighting Technology Limited, Gve Projects, Nayo Tropical Technology Limited, Rubitec Nigeria Limited and Darway Coast Nigeria Limited, Synergy Limited, Sosa-Protergia Joint Development Company Limited, and A4&T Power Solutions Limited.\n\nThey would receive in-kind grants through the REA with support of the European Union and the German Government within the framework of the Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nThe indigenous developers are expected to establish 23 mini-grids across 11 states, which include, Zamfara, Niger, Plateau, Kwara, Kogi, Osun, Ogun, Lagos, Delta, Anambra, and Cross River.\n\nEarlier, the Managing Director of REA, Ahmad Salihijo said the scheme was aimed at bridging the funding gap affecting indigenous developers in the renewable energy sector.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that the signatures we put down today in these documents set a precedent for the new and improved power and energy sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs an agency, we encourage investors to explore the solar mini-grid sector. However, one major constraint to this is usually financing. This is why the REA, with the support of NESP, is working together to alleviate this bottleneck.\n\n\u201cWe do this by providing in-kind grants to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to him, the main objective of the intervention is to design and test a tender model for interconnected solar mini-grids, leading to the foundation of the scheme.\n\n\u201cThe wonderful thing about the IMAS project is that we have ensured that all the developers are Nigerians. This is to say that the Nigerian energy sector has come a long way from what it used to be and we are proud of this,\u201d he explained.\n\nHead of programme, NESP, Benjamin Duke, assured that his team would continue to work to build investors\u2019 confidence in the sector by developing an accurate electricity market intelligence that will provide investors with accurate data about the country\u2019s electricity needs.\n\nAlso speaking at the ceremony, the Executive Director, Rural Electrification Fund (REF), Sanusi Ohiare, said while investors were being encouraged to explore the solar mini-grid sector, one major constraint to their project development was finance.\n\n\u201cHence, the REA with the support of NESP was able to alleviate this major burden by providing capital in-kind grant to selected mini-grid developers on favourable and encouraging terms as contained in the grant agreement,\u201d he noted.\n\nHead of Section, Green Economy at the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms. Inga Stefanowicz, noted that the EU\u2019s financial support for the programme represents the EU\u2019s commitment to support Nigeria in the efforts to enable more investments in the solar mini-grid sector.\n\n\u201cWe hope that our contribution will help improve access to reliable and affordable electricity in Nigeria, especially in the disadvantaged areas of the country, hence advancing the living standard of the rural and peri-urban dwellers using renewable sources of energy,\u201d she stated.\n\nCountry Director of GIZ Nigeria & ECOWAS, Ina Hommers, said the provision of capital in-kind grants to the developers in the solar mini-grid sector through the IMAS aimed to ensure higher investments in the sector.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the grants contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria, in particular SDG 7 on access to affordable and clean energy and SDG 13 on climate action. These represent one of the focal areas of GIZ\u2019s support to Nigeria,\u201d Hommers stressed.\n\nDepending on the ability of the private sector, between 18 to 24 solar mini-grid projects will be deployed in 2022 under the project, serving clean electricity to around 138,000 people in Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Again, NNPC Apologises to Nigerians, Reveals Five Vessels of Substandard Fuel Rejected",
          "text": "\u2022Assures petrol supply will be restored next week\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nGroup Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, yesterday apologised to Nigerians for damages caused by the importation of substandard fuel into the country. Kyari assured Nigerians that normalcy would return to petrol stations by next week, saying the national oil company has taken necessary steps to restore supply in the country.\n\nKyari spoke this in Abuja while addressing the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream, during an investigative hearing on the importation of methanol-blended petrol.\n\nHowever, in a bid to end the fuel scarcity and clear the long queues at filling station in many parts of the country, petroleum products marketing companies, under the umbrella of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), have extended their opening hours in their jetties, depots and filling stations to a minimum of 18 hours.\n\nKyari said with at least 2.1 billion litres of petrol in stock, the fuel queues would end by next week.\n\nThe NNPC boss disclosed that given the current situation, five other vessels conveying their next supply had been rejected and were not allowed to sail into the country\u2019s waters because they were coming from the same shipping terminal that sent the four substandard cargos. He stressed that the current challenge was because Nigeria imported all gasoline.\n\nKyari said, \u201cNot a single litre of petrol is generated in the country, that means 100 per cent of petrol you see in this country is imported. Those imports are done on the basis of existing contractual arrangements that we have. It is called the direct sale- direct purchase process, which is simply with the best of practice to enable our suppliers supply products to us on agreed terms and conditions.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing this since I came on board and its part of our supply mechanism. Even if all our refineries come up today, except Dangote Refinery, we will still be in short supply of premium motor spirit (PMS), because all of our refineries can only make 18 million litres of gasoline. Consumption is certainly above 18million litres.\u201d\n\nKyari further explained that the four cargoes that in question met all the criteria on arrival and that was why they were allowed to discharge into terminals and convey into ship.\n\nWhile noting that there was no way, based on the current specifications, that they would know that the PMS contained methanol, as it was not part of their requirements at the load port, Kyari assured that they have been able to trace all the volumes and quarantine them accordingly.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBy law, NNPC is required to ensure energy security. Therefore, it is our responsibility to ensure that we provide energy security for this country. This company must operate within the laws of this country and this is what we have always done, and this is what we will continue to do.\n\n\u201cFor this current situation, I assure you that we have taken every necessary step to restore supply into this country. We have placed orders significant enough for us to cross into March, with at least 2.1 billion litres of PMS in our custody. The situation you are seeing today I can assure you that by next week, it will vanish.\n\n\u201cAll things being equal, because of distribution issues that we may not have control over, including the movement of trucks, otherwise, we have robust supply arrangement to make sure that we exit this issue.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of those contracts, our suppliers bring products to us and we reconcile with them regularly. Part of those supply arrangements is to give specification to your suppliers. These specifications are bound by regulation and the latest that we are using is the one that is in place since 2006.\n\n\u201cThe current specifications we have is what is the subject of all our import arrangement. So all our partners were given those specifications and on the basis of this, those imports were made. Before a vessel leaves the load port, they have to declare that those vessels meet our specification; they will send it to the importer and confirm that it is the specification. On the basis of that, you allow the sail away of the vessel.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \u201cNow, once it comes to the country, two things happen. We have NNPC surveyors, who are now also required to validate that this product that we have meets the Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cAlso we have the regulatory authority who has to conduct an independent assessment to confirm that this product meets the specification that is in consonance with the existing regulation in the country.\n\n\u201cIn case of all the problems we have seen, four of the cargoes that are particularly in question today met all the criteria on arrival and that was why they were allowed to discharge into terminals and conveyed into ship.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no way, based on the current specification, that you will know these PMS contains methanol. It is not part of their requirements at the load port. So we did not ask them to declare whether it contains methanol because it is not part of our specification.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that methanol is not contamination, it is a regular addictive to PMS. In China, up to 15 per cent PMS contain methanol. On its own it is not a contamination, the key issue is handling methanol. If we knew we will not accept this. Anytime methanol comes in contact with water it emulsifies, it turns into a different chemical.\u201d\n\nKyari lamented that one of the challenges NNPC faced was lack of tracking mechanism to track trucks leaving the depot. He said this had aided smuggling, as some of the fuel was transported to places that might not be in this country.\n\nThe GMD disclosed that NNPC had filed litigation against importers of the methanol-blended PMS considering the effect of the withdrawing the products across the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat did we do? We have put all our suppliers who are our contacts or commercial angle on notice that there would be liquidated damages that will come from this. And also it is typical practice that we compile liquidated damages that the direct supplier did not cost, he will transfer that to the next person until it gets to the originating supplier, so it is a back-to-back arrangement.\n\n\u201cThat is always done so that once you file, it will get to the last one. I do not know how many people are in the chain because this PMS supply business in one cargo you can have three sellers, you can have two, and you may have only one.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the House committee, Hon. Adediji Olamide, in his submission, said ignorance was not an excuse in law. Olamide said the committee would need a lot of documentation that NNPC.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Chairman, House Committee on Petroleum Resources Downstream, Hon. Abdullahi Gaya, noted that the investigative hearing was to ensure that the culprits were brought to book as well as make recommendations towards curbing a reoccurrence of the incident.\n\nHe stated that the task ahead was challenging, including examining the lessons, proffering solutions and way forward, and rejigging supply and regulating the system to make them more effective and efficient.\n\nOil Marketers Move to Clear Fuel Queues, Extend Opening Period to 24 hours\n\nMeanwhile, MOMAN said where possible, its members would extend their opening hours up to 24 hours a day in high density and flagship locations where the security situation permitted. The association stated that its members \u201cshall operate these extended hours until the excessive queues subside.\u201d\n\nThe association made this known yesterday in a statement signed by its Chairman and Managing Director of Ardova Plc, Mr. Olumide Adeosun. The statement added that it was working with the regulatory authorities and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited towards a resolution of the current fuel crisis.\n\nAdeosun said MOMAN\u2019s subject matter experts were active contributors to the technical and commercial committees\u2019 set up by the regulatory authorities to re-stock fuel supplies, resolve the blending of contaminated product and identify losses suffered by customers, operators and third parties.\n\nHe said MOMAN members were also working with designated laboratories to double-check the quality of product (re-blended or new) before they are released into the fuels supply chain.\n\nMost importantly, Adeosun maintained that MOMAN members had committed resources towards enhanced operations and associated activities to reduce the burden of the current fuel scarcity to customers.\n\nThe association urged its customers not to engage in panic buying, as it might take a few days for normalcy to return, stressing that panic buying increases the pressure on the supply chain.\n\nNANS Condemn Attempts to Instigate Crisis, Attack NNPC\n\n,The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has condemned an alleged attempt by some unscrupulous elements to hijack the adulterated fuel saga and resultant fuel scarcity to engage in a protest aimed to instigate crisis in the country and damage the reputation of the NNPC Limited.\n\nNANS also bemoaned the serious fuel supply disruption across the country occasioned by the importation of bad petrol, allegedly, by some approved dealers of the NNPC.\n\nThe students\u2019 body, in a statement issued yesterday and jointly signed by its National President, Asefon Sunday, and Secretary General, Adekitan Lukman, said it was in receipt of credible intelligence that certain individuals had mobilised civil society organisations (CSOs) to embark on protests to paint the NNPC leadership in bad light.\n\nWhile acknowledging the avoidable situation the country had been plunged into as a result of the fuel supply disruption, NANS frowned on those it claimed wanted to make political gain out of a purely operational issue, urging them to have a rethink.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWhile we acknowledge the avoidable situation we are in as a country after almost six years of no queues and scarcity, we frown on those who want to make political gain out of a purely operational issue and urge those behind the attempt to put a spanner in the smooth administrative structure of President Muhammadu Buhari at the NNPC to desist forthwith.\n\nNANS was in receipt of credible intelligence that certain enemies of the Kyari leadership wanted to use the petrol scarcity as a excuse to embark on protests to paint the NNPC leadership in bad light.\n\nThe association demanded a speedy resolution of all issues and the normalisation of fuel supply across the country to ameliorate the hardship being experienced by Nigerians.\n\nNANS, however, commended the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari for an inquiry into the dire fuel importation mishap, which has put a strain on the supply chain and on Nigerians, saying it hoped the inquiry would be decisive and far-reaching.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

A Magistrates\u2019 Court in Yaba requested 21 days and after the 14 day, the boys were granted bail when the police were not done with their investigations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the Lagos State Commissioner of Police (Hakeem Odumosu) and told him about it, he told me that, that was not true that they were not done with their investigations.\n\n\u201cHe even said that on the day it was said that they had released those boys, the courts were not sitting. I then called the Deputy Commissioner of Police, he told me the same thing and told me to give him sometime.\n\n\u201cAfter about two to four minutes, he called me back and he confirmed it, that they were given 21 days for their investigations and the boys had just spent 14 days in detention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey (police) said they were going to write a protest letter. They were already interrogating two of the students and revelations were coming out so they were taken by surprise.\n\n\u201cThe same Commissioner of Police, after some days now publicly declared that at the instance of Mr Governor, the Attorney-General and the DPP, said there was nothing wrong with the boys therefore they\u2019ve released them.\u201d\n\nThe late student\u2019s father also argued that the police did not conclude its investigation before releasing the five students.\n\n\u201cAt what point did they complete their investigation, give all the case files to the DPP to go through and the DPP to come up with their report?\u201d he queried.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is why I am saying there is a very massive conspiracy going on.\u201d\n\nThe development comes as the court disclosed that it would invite more witnesses in the case.\n\nMikhail Kadiri, the coroner, announced this at the conclusion of the proceedings. He said the inquest is a fact-finding exercise and a lot of questions would need to be answered.\n\nWitnesses to be summoned by the coroner include roommates of the late student at Dowen College, the investigating police officer (IPO) of the case in Warri, Delta, and the Dowen College nurse that attended to the deceased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther witnesses to be invited include Opudu Boro, a friend to the Oromoni family, two independent pathologists and Clement Vhriterhire, the doctor who performed the first autopsy on the late student in Warri.\n\nAlso to be invited are students who allegedly played football with the deceased in school on the day he was said to have sustained an ankle injury.\n\nKadiri thereafter adjourned proceedings till February 21 for continuation of hearing.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases",
          "text": "In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.\n\nThe growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021\u2014its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.\n\nScams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called \u201crug pull\u201d. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.\n\nCryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.\n\nDeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.\n\nDeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth\u20141,964%\u2014for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens\u2014all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.\n\nWhile Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent \u201ctokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges\u201d.\n\nApart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.\n\nIn a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won\u2019t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales\u2014private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized \u00a3180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple\u2019s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Ckrowd\u2019s plan to help African creators monetise their content",
          "text": "The term \u201ccreator economy\u201d became popular throughout 2021 when venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and independent creators not only threw the phrase around but also invested heavily in the content industry\u2014an industry that would leapfrog into becoming a $100 billion industry.\n\nContent creators\u2014writers, artists, social media influencers, videographers, gamers, podcasters\u2014are raking in millions of dollars annually by monetising their craft. But only a tiny fraction of these creators are Africans. This means African creators are still struggling to earn much from their craft, compared to their global counterparts.\n\nTwo things may have caused this: one is, global payment networks like Paypal that should connect African creators with the rest of the world have shut Africans out of their network; secondly, lack or shortage of efficient local creator platforms that connect the rest of the world directly to African creators.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile there are some companies already building to solve the first problem, Ckrowd, a content streaming platform and marketplace, is solving the second problem at scale.\n\nCkrowd is positioning itself as the platform that bridges the gap between African content creators or suppliers and their global content consumers by providing creators with the opportunity to earn income while giving \u201cunique, exclusive, and engaging content experiences to their consumers\u201d.\n\nCkrowd was founded out of a will to do more\n\nCkrowd was founded by Olukayode Adebayo in November 2020. But before then, Adebayo, who was freshly back to Nigeria after a stint with the Nigerian embassy in China, had founded a real estate company that morphed into a hospitality business. He then started a media outfit in September 2016, called KAM Africa.\n\nAt KAM Africa, Adebayo started an initiative that would help creative professionals like musicians and actors understand the business part of their craft. But as he continued with the initiative, he realised that there was a need to bring all these promising enterprises together. Nobody builds in isolation, especially in the entertainment scene. So KAM Africa started Amfest, a festival-like event that brings together African creative businesses.\n\nAdebayo\u2019s cross-continental experience helped Amfest to quickly scale out of its founding country Nigeria into Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and even Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe started building business partnerships with other platforms and scaled very fast. It was in the process of supporting the sector that we found out that many of these talents that are now enterprises had a problem with anything that doesn\u2019t involve physical human interaction,\u201d Adebayo told TechCabal. \u201cAt the point of this discovery, COVID-19 happened and it became even clearer as most of them were left without income. So, there was a need to bring them online.\u201d\n\nThe next thing to build became apparent; Ckrowd\u2014the solution to these persistent problems. After doing a lot of research and consultations throughout 2020, Adebayo launched the beta version of Ckrowd early last year and then launched publicly in August.\n\nHow Ckrowd works\n\nThe platform is a direct-to-consumer platform where original and exclusive African content in education, information, and entertainment is distributed directly to local and global consumers in short videos and live stream format. Think of a marriage between OnlyFans, Patreon, and YouTube\u2014in fact, a combination of all the streaming platforms out there\u2014but now for African content.\n\nLast year in December, uduX, a Nigerian streaming platform, partnered with telecoms giant MTN to live stream Wizkid\u2019s \u201cMade in Lagos\u201d concert from London\u2019s 02 Arena to over 238,000 Africans. But the event was quickly moved to YouTube after the day one of the three-days concert. Regardless of what might have caused the relocation, it\u2019s, however, an indication that Africa needs more efficient indigenous platforms that can aggregate content and put more money in the pocket of local creators while providing a seamless experience for local and global consumers.\n\nFor Adebayo, Ckrowd is taking an all-encompassing approach to building for the African creator economy, one that\u2019s a win-win for all the stakeholders.\n\nTo better understand CKrowd\u2019s advantage, let\u2019s look at how existing streaming platforms work: On YouTube, for instance, creators make money according to their view numbers and sometimes from ads. This means, if YouTube pays $0.0001 per view, you\u2019ll need 10,000 views to make $10. In the case of Netflix, let\u2019s say you subscribe at $10 per month, what happens if you are too busy for Netflix that month? Will you be refunded? No!\n\nFrom the creator\u2019s end, 10,000 views for $10 is not sustainable. How many African creators hit hundreds of thousands of views or millions? A small number. For consumers, the subscription model is not good if you can\u2019t flip unused subscriptions.\n\nOn Ckrowd, creators can livestream their content like uduX live and upload on-demand contents like on Netflix. Creators also control their spaces and how they want to be paid\u2014per view or by subscription. Unlike on social media platforms where creators, after creating content and amassing views and followers, would have to go outside the platform to market their views and followers to brands, Ckrowd lets creators set their prices and make their money as they go. It also allows viewers to select how they wish to pay for content\u2014all inside the platform.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to deliver economic value to African creators. The platform pays 70% of total income on content to creators, which we believe is the highest pay-out on digital content to African creators,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nCkrowd is not only for music and film content; educational, culinary, sports, and other forms of content are allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe Ckrowd platform is similar to a large arena in the cloud where you can broadcast live & short on-demand video content and charge access fees on behalf of the creators of that content. This allows the platform to uniquely function as an edtech, mediatech and adtech hybrid,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nCkrowd, from 4 users at its beta launch, has grown to have over 2,000 users on its platform. Last year in October, it raised $160,000 in pre-seed funding; $60,000 of equity funding, and $100,000 export grant investment from an international angel investor group, as well as backing from the Export Expansion Facility Programme from Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nCkrowd plans to use the new capital to expand with new innovative technologies and strategies to get more customers, accelerate growth and promote intra-African creative industries. In addition to that, the company plans to hire more talent, especially in product, Research and Development (R&D) and engineering.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, the startup has already made headway in some of these plans. It acquired a marketing agency last year to power the ads sector of its business. The company said the agency\u2019s channels had access to about 50 million people across Africa, which means Ckrowd can now reach these people through email, SMS, and other channels available. This sounds like a transfer of data without the consent of the owners; however, if these people opted in with the marketing agency, which has now been acquired, then, by extension, they have opted in with Ckrowd.\n\nThe startup also recently announced the appointment of the founder and director of Music Works International Katherine McVicker and co-founder of Cultural Connections of Africa (CCA) Adeleye Fabusoro as executive members to its advisory board. Adebayo also said the company has built its own production studio and is currently partnering with other media houses across the continent, He hinted that they [Ckrowd] will soon start rolling out the results of the partnerships.\n\nCkrowd is taking on big players like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, ShowMax, uduX and even cable television channel who\u2019ve got their claws deep in the streaming market. Will it curve, niche down, or dominate? This is not an easy one to predict but from Adebayo\u2019s confidence in the product and their pan-African play, there\u2019s something to root for in Ckrowd.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nSolving critical bankend freight industry challenges\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\nSolving critical backend freight industry challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.\n\nFor most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.\n\nOne of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.\n\nPartech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.\n\nHe also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company\u2019s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.\n\nThe round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.\n\nNonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.\n\nEarnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMost people with EUPD/BPD aren\u2019t manipulative \u2013 but often those around us can be.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "summary": "Share this article:A cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation.\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works.\nThat decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\nVenture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.",

          "text": "For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria\u2019s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nAccording to the GDP report released Thursday by the NBS, the trade sector grew 8.62 percent.\n\nBefore now, it had contracted by 8.49 percent, 0.38 percent, 0.63 percent, 1.05 percent, and 0.24 percent in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\n\nAlso, the growth rate in 2021 is the highest since 2012 (9.61%).\n\n\u201cThe positive growth can be attributed to the low base effect, full reopening of the economy and the removal of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, which has made activities in the trade sector to be much easier leading to its recovery,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, says.\n\nCommenting in the same vein, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, notes that the recovery shows that businesses and economic activities have improved in the sector\n\n\u201cBut despite the recovery, I am still bothered because the structural challenges such as high cost of foreign exchanges, weak demand, logistics issues, etc. still linger in the sector,\u201d Adewale states.\n\nThe report also highlights that the country\u2019s overall GDP grew by 3.98 percent (year-on-year) in Q4 \u20182021, showing a sustained positive growth for the fifth quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020 when output contracted by -6.10 percent and -3.62 percent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter growth indicates a steady economic recovery accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 percent in 2021,\u201d it states.\n\nIn terms of contribution to GDP, the trade sector contributed 15.66 percent, higher than the 15.46 percent it represented in the previous year, and higher than the 14.93 percent recorded in Q3 \u20182021.\n\nTrade, which is the second biggest sector by output production, can be likened as the barometer of consumer purchasing power. The higher the level of consumption, the better the sector performs.\n\nAnd due to this, the sector has been touted by economists as an important tool in the quest for development as it contributes roughly 15-16 percent to the GDP.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s private sector sets aside N100bn to fight insecurity\n\nBut in Africa\u2019s biggest economy, it had been in and out of negative territory since 2016 over myriad challenges like macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira\u2019s depreciation, weak purchasing power, and household incomes.\n\nRecently, a report by FBNQuest shows that Nigeria\u2019s real household consumption as a proportion of GDP rose to 76 percent in 2021, the highest level since 2010. According to the report, the surge led to a fast recovery post-pandemic for Nigeria\u2019s consumer\u2019s industry.\n\nAdditionally, a 2021 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) reported that the country\u2019s total retail sales rose to $108 billion after it had been trending south, falling to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016 and $135 billion in 2015.\n\nAnalysts at Kearney, a global management consultancy firm, said the Nigerian economy is making a steady recovery from COVID-19.\n\nAlso, Uchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at Lagos Business School, says people have started coming out more and they have been able to spend on other items beyond the discretionary ones, noting, \u201cE-commerce has also made it possible to increase the portfolio of what people buy.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nHon. Rasaq Salinsile led faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, has accused Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of importing thugs into the state for tomorrow\u2019s governorship primary election.\n\nAccording to Salinsile, the thugs were conveyed into the state in 38 vehicles in the early hour of today, Friday.\n\nSalinsile said the vehicles were escorted by a police van into the state through Abere.\n\nHe spoke at a press conference addressed by Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, a governorship aspirant, on Friday, in Osogbo.\n\nThe Chairman alleged the Governor and his faction, IleriOluwa of plans to unleash attack on members of the party who are loyalists of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola in tomorrow\u2019s primary.\n\nSalinsile spoke just as Adeoti doubted the fairness of the primary election.\n\nAccording to Adeoti, the primary election has already been schemed in favour of Oyetola because of his membership of National Caretaker and Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party.\n\nAdeoti said the date of the primary election which had earlier been slated for March 5, was reversed by the NCECPC to February 19, to favour Oyetola.\n\nThe former Secretary to the State Government, said: \u201cWe have it on good authority that the NCECPC was influenced by Oyetola to reverse the date to have the primary before the National Convention coming up on February 26, 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is believed that Oyetola is afraid of contesting a free and fair primary election to be conducted by an objective committee after the convention\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn the spirit of fair play, objectivity and natural justice, Governor Oyetola is not supposed to remain in the membership of the NCECPC. What we are witnessing is a case of a thief adjudicating his own case. He can never convict himself.\n\n\u201cGovernor Oyetola\u2019s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. Tomorrow\u2019s governorship primary cannot be fair, free, and equitable if Governor Oyetola is still a member of NCECPC.\n\n\u201cWe note that like it happened in time of the party congresses, we are reliably informed that Governor Oyetola is the one who hand-picked the chairman and members of the primary election committee. It is within human reasonability not to trust such handpicked committee by an interested party member. Such committee would never be fair to other contenders.\n\n\u201cThere can only be point of convergence for us if Governor Oyetola could resign his membership and the process of conducting the primary begins afresh.\u201d\n\nButtressing his argument on why the primary election will not be free and fair, Adeoti said the register of APC members is not made available to him and his tendency, the Salinsile faction of the party.\n\nAccording to Adeoti, Governor Oyetola has refused to release the register of party members which will be used for the primary election.\n\n\u201cIf there is no deliberate attempt to manipulate the primary process, it is important to make the membership register available, display it for claims and objections before using it for tomorrow\u2019s primary election or any time it will come up\u201d, he said.\n\nAdeoti, however, said in spite of the anomalies raised, he and his supporters will not boycott the primary election.\n\n\u201cMy supporters and I are going to participate in the primary election tomorrow. We are not going to boycott. I want to urge all APC members to go to their Collation centres in their various wards to vote for me.\n\n\u201cI called on the security agencies in the state to provide adequate security for our people. As said earlier, the Governor\u2019s camp is planning violence, but we are resolute and believe that the security agents will act responsibly\u201d, Adeoti declared",

The new sticker is aimed at stemming the activities of fraudsters and touts as well as middlemen who try to impersonate the staff of the Agency.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "2023: Power not served a la carte, youth told",
          "text": "\u2018\u2026None of the parties has youth-based ideology\u2019\n\n\u2026Youths have been govs, but couldn\u2019t change anything \u2013 Abdulrahman\n\n\u2018\u2026They don\u2019t have the required political structure\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2026Young Nigerians need the bigwigs to achieve something tangible\u2019\n\n\u2026We\u2019re experienced, capable \u2013 Young Nigerians\n\nAs the political scheming for the 2023 general elections continues to gather momentum, many aspirants, including the youth, have declared their intentions to run for one office or the other. As the declaration, consultations and mobilisation continue, ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU wonders if the youth have any chance.\n\nNigeria is the largest and most populous black nation on earth, with a population of over 200 million citizens. Interestingly, out of this population, there are over 84 million registered voters. Notably, the Nigerian youth aged 18-40 constitute more than 60 per cent of the registered voters. This is an indication that the Nigerian youth have the power to change the direction of Nigeria, even if the political leadership is not ready to share power with them. They have the power to determine who leads and how they lead Nigeria.\n\nHowever, despite this power, old politicians still lead and dictate what happens in the country\u2019s political sphere. The youth don\u2019t usually occupy the critical elective positions. As many political analysts said, power is not served a la carte. A few pundits, politicians and other political stakeholders have expressed concern over the chances of Nigeria youths as we approach the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u2018Our demands\u2019\n\nA group of young Nigerians under the aegis of Youth Engagement and Inclusion Agenda have demanded that for a new Nigeria, each candidate seeking to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari must reserve specifically the vice-president\u2019s seat for the youth. The group also asked that governorship candidates toe the same line and zone the deputy governorship seats to the youth, noting that they are the next generation of leaders.\n\nAt a recent event, the group stated that the move was to prevent a leadership vacuum that might arise when the present crop of leaders retire from active politics as well as the need to proffer solutions to the country\u2019s challenges. It added that \u201cthis will enable the youth to garner the needed experience to rescue Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s convener, Idris Aregbe, declared that their requests were not too difficult to be approved by any of the presidential candidates. He noted that their concern was not about political parties, but that Nigerian youths should occupy critical leadership positions.\n\nHe also acknowledged that the youth were very influential and that their numbers could swing the votes in the right direction for the benefit of all.\n\n\u201cWe believe so much in ourselves as youths and the numbers that we have which is also our strength and that is why we have decided to come together as well as speak with one voice.\n\n\u201cThis is a group of people that understand what politics is all about and we will definitely work to ensure that we get it right. This is a youth agenda that will ensure inclusion for the youth. We are ready to ensure that the youths get their desired positions in the government come 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are one Nigeria and the only thing that separates Nigerians is either you are youth or the elderly. We are willing to ensure that the youth become part of governance in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nA member of the group, Japheth Odesanya, said they were determined to ensure that beginning from 2023, the country is governed by anyone ready to build the youth and make key stakeholders in the government.\n\n\u201cWe will use all our energy, as youths, to galvanise and mobilise young Nigerians to see this through because the time has come for the youths to start manning key leadership positions across the country,\u201d Odesanya said.\n\nNYCN\u2019s position\n\nIn his remarks, the president, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Ambassador Sukubo Sara-Igbe Sukubo, said Nigerian youths stood a chance in the 2023 general elections.\n\nSpeaking on the telephone with this reporter, Sukubo said, \u201cWe have the numbers, we have the experience and we have the energy. So, we will determine what will happen in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIf you notice, there is more agitation for a younger candidate for all offices. Interestingly, more of the demands for a younger person into political positions have come from the elder statesmen like former heads of state, Abdulsalami Abubakar, Ibrahim Gbadamosi Babangida and former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cThis is because they have seen it all and they believe that Nigerian youths have the capacity, in terms of experience, technological knowledge and energy to lead and proffer lasting solutions to some of our problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sukubo, \u201cIf you have been following the on-going voter registration, you will have an idea of what to expect. You see, 2023 will certainly be different from 2019. If you notice those that have registered to vote, more youths have shown interest to aspire for one office or the other. It means more youths will be involved and they will participate actively to determine who leads the country.\n\n\u201cSo, youths who are aspiring for elective positions stand a chance because we have resolved to support one of us, a youth for most elective positions.\n\n\u201cWe also stand a chance in determining who leads us. So, it is not just about electing fellow youths, we have also strategically positioned ourselves to support only those who will support the youth agenda.\u201d\n\nAnalysts\u2019 views\n\nOn his part, a youth activist and public affairs commentator, Agboola Abdulrahman, said Nigerian youths \u201cdon\u2019t have the political structure that will give them a better chance in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe idea of coming to the political sphere and using one nomenclature to negotiate for political positions has never worked in Nigeria and it will never work. Up till today, there is no party that is sprung up that you can call youth party that has a youth-based ideology.\n\n\u201cWe have so many youths that became governors in this country and it has not changed anything in the polity and country. The most important for me is to have quality people that can deliver the dividends of democracy to the people.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of energy for you to galvanise your energy to win an election in the country, except you are talking about people contesting in the House of Representatives level that is popular within their constituency. And even within this constituency we are talking about, they still require the support of the political bigwigs to achieve something tangible.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cSo, the question is how many young people in Nigeria are now political bigwigs for them to make something out of 2023 general elections?\n\n\u201cIn the demography of youths, what is the level of political participation at the leadership level? PDP organised its national convention and the person that emerged as national chairman is an old man. APC will do theirs very soon; let us see if they will give the chance to a young person. So, if party leadership will not go to young people, how will you expect other offices or positions to go to them?\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to politics it has to do with your test. Who are you? What is your orientation? Who groomed you? What is your background? As we go into the 2023 elections, there is no young person in Nigeria that has that popularity, charisma or the political structure to emerge as governor, president. This is about political party structure; if the youth don\u2019t have the political party and structure that is sponsoring them then there is no chance for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the youth we are talking about, do they have the contact, the connectivity and they participate actively in the entire process? From what we have seen over the years, it means this thing is not age backed. It is about their involvement, what they can do and how committed they are. If the youth are serious they should start from their constituency.\n\n\u201cYoung people who are serious, who believe they have the energy, intellectual capacity and popularity start from their constituency. They should mobilise, join a platform or form their platform for a political structure. If they can not do this, then I don\u2019t think they stand any chances.\u201d\n\nLikewise, a political analyst, Aminu Mohammed, believes that the youth stand a chance in 2023 only if they are united, noting that their participation in the process is key to their chances.\n\nIn a chat with Blueprint Weekend, Mohammed said, \u201cOver the years, as a matter of fact, whenever is time for another general election this youth thing becomes a topical matter. But what happens during and after the elections? The youth go to bed.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that the democratic processes in Nigeria and most of the world largely depends on the Youths. They have the number, the energy and know-how to turn around things in Nigeria. But do they use all these to their advantage and the advantage of their country? Certainly, not in the case of Nigeria!\n\n\u201cThey have used their energy, numbers and know-how wrongly. They are allowed themselves to be used. Instead of participating in an electioneering process, they prefer to remain on social media and allow the old ones to take over their chances.\n\n\u201cThough like a few others, I believe Nigerian youths stand a chance in every election as candidates and even to determine what will happen as the electorates, but their chances depend on many things. It depends on their strategy, unity of purpose and their level of involvement in party politics, before the election, during the election and even after the election.\n\n\u201cSo, their chances in 2023 depend on their level of seriousness and what they set out to achieve. Youths would not make any meaningful impact in 2023 if they are not united, actively involved and committed to their plans.\u201d\n\n\u2018Won\u2019t be business as usual\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, a new youth group under the auspices of We2gedaNG Movement has vowed to kick against godfatherism, moneybags politics and thuggery, adding that \u201c2023 will not be business as usual.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s chairman, Board of Trustees, Ibrahim Abdulkareem, who made the vow while unveiling the Movement, said, \u201cWe2gedaNG was initiated out of a passion to re-unite the young generation of Nigeria regardless of religion, tribal and political sentiments and build a transparent and competent leadership structure in the country.\n\n\u201cThe mission of We2gedaNG is premised on building youth that will develop new Nigeria. It is no longer business as usual. We would not allow anybody to use and dump us the youth anymore. We have come to realise that it is only during elections that politicians use religion and tribal sentiment to canvass support. This time, it will not work.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to eliminate godfatherism in our politics, moneybags will not work. We would not allow them to use young people as thugs. We are ready to mobilise and rehabilitate the youth and ensure they know the right direction.\n\n\u201cWe will use social media networks to engage and evaluate aspiring leaders. It is time the government must value the life of the youth. We are not part of the decision making and unfortunately, when the decision is taken, it is to our detriment. We will raise an army of youth that will build new Nigeria that will work for us.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, called on European leaders as partners in promoting democracy and good governance to lend their weight behind measures put in place by the African Union to stem the tide of unconstitutional leadership changes, rearing its head again on the continent.\n\nIn his contribution to the roundtable discussion on Peace, Security, and Governance at the ongoing 6th EU-AU Summit, President Buhari equally stressed the need to nip the root causes of extremism, conflicts, and tensions in Africa at inception.\n\nREAD ALSO: PDP Governors Ask Buhari To Resign As Petroleum Minister\n\n\u201cAfrica has continued to witness different waves of violent extremism, community-based conflicts, and inter-ethnic tensions, notably in rural areas. For many decades, our continent has been deprived of political stability and socio-economic development due to terrorism and violent extremism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the current state of democracy on the continent, which has become a great source of concern to many of us, with increasing cases of unconstitutional change of governments across the continent, particularly in West Africa. This is in addition to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe African Union has often responded to these challenges through its different structures, such as the African Peace and Security Architecture and the African Governance Architecture.\n\n\u201cThrough enhanced collaboration with our development partners, especially the European Union, we can identify areas of cooperation for quick and substantive results.\n\n\u201cAs leaders and policymakers, it is important for our partnership to place priority on tackling the root causes of conflicts in Africa, as well as taking measures in safeguarding peace and security if we are to achieve the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n\u201cWe also call for stronger support from the European Union in the condemnation and imposition of weighty sanctions on countries that engage in unconstitutional change of governments, as well as manipulation of constitutions in favor of extension of term limits.\u201d\n\nAccording to his spokesman, Garba Shehu, the Nigerian leader added that it was imperative to ensure that election processes in Africa have outcomes that truly reflect the wishes of the electorate, as to go contrary to these is courting instability.\n\nHe said, \u201cwe have a responsibility to reduce conflicts that stem from lack of good governance, unaccountability, corruption and social exclusion.\n\n\u201cFree, fair, credible, and transparent elections remain crucial elements in ensuring peace and security and promoting constitutional order, democracy, and inclusive governance on the continent.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, imperative for our partnership to also focus on strengthening election processes in Africa and prevent interference to influence the process and outcomes of elections.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also called for the concretization and transformation of promises of cooperation made by the European leaders to actions.\n\n\u201cI wish to underscore the need to convert our pledges on political cooperation in the area of peace, security, and conflict prevention into concrete initiatives such as joint field missions, shared understanding and analysis on crisis situations, as well as joint early action and swift implementation of agreed positions.\n\n\u201cThe movement and operation of terrorists and violent extremist groups along the Sahel could better be addressed through an improved Continental Early Warning Mechanism. Consequently, we believe there is a clear need to strengthen our cooperation on security with the European Union, particularly through improved intelligence sharing and acquisition of military equipment and hardware.\n\n\u201cWe invite the EU to upscale its support for the G5 Sahel and the Multinational Joint Taskforce in the Lake Chad Region as we strive to further degrade the Boko-Haram insurgents and their Islamic State in the West Africa Province counterparts. Africa also looks up to Europe for enhanced support in the area of combating Illicit financial flows and terrorism funding that aid the activities of terrorists and violent extremist groups,\u201d the president added.\n\nHe called for all hands to be on deck to ensure that Africa\u2019s Blue Economy Agenda for development is realized.\n\n\u201cI must emphasize the importance of expanding regional and international cooperation on ocean governance, on the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing as well as on maritime security, including piracy, illicit trafficking and other maritime crimes and threats as reflected in the 2050 Africa Integrated Maritime Strategy,\u201d the Nigerian leader added.",

          "title": "Nigeria, Five Other African Countries To Begin Production Of Covid Vaccines \u2013 WHO",
          "text": "Nigeria and five other African countries have been chosen to begin production of COVID-19 vaccines, with the continent having had limited access to jabs.\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019m delighted to announce the first six African countries that will receive technology from the hub to produce their own mRNA vaccines: Egypt, Kenya Nigeria, Senegal South Africa, and Tunisia,\u201d Director-General of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Ghebreyesus, announced on Friday.\n\nAccording to the WHO, they were selected as the first recipients of technology from the organisation\u2019s global mRNA vaccine hub, in a push to ensure the African continent can make its own jabs to fight COVID and other diseases.\n\nRead Also: BioNTech To Ship Mobile COVID-19 Vaccine Labs To Africa\n\n\u201cI was honoured to visit the Hub last week. And it\u2019s already producing results, with Afrigen\u2019s announcement that it has produced its own mRNA vaccine, based on publicly-available information about the composition of an existing vaccine,\u201d Ghebreyesus said.\n\n\u201cWe expect clinical trials to start in the 4th quarter of this year, with approval expected in 2024. We expect the benefits of this initiative will extend far beyond #COVID19, by creating a platform for vaccines against other diseases including malaria and tuberculosis\u201d.\n\n\u201cWHO will work with the companies and the government in each country to develop a roadmap for training and production, based on their needs and capacities.\n\n\u201cThank you all, and we look forward to working with all of you to make this project a success, for the healthier, safer and fairer Africa\u201d.\n\nAccording to the WHO boss, no other event like the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods is limiting, and dangerous.\n\nHe, therefore, stressed that the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need.\n\nTedros has continually called for equitable access to vaccines in order to beat the pandemic, and rails against the way wealthy nations have hogged doses, leaving Africa lagging behind other continents in the global vaccination effort.\n\nA ceremony marking the mRNA tech transfer announcement was held Friday in Brussels at the summit between the European Union and the African Union.\n\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said: \u201cWe have been talking a lot about producing mRNA vaccines in Africa. But this goes even beyond. This is mRNA technology designed in Africa, led by Africa and owned by Africa.\u201d\n\nSelf-reliance\n\nCurrently, only one per cent of the vaccines used in Africa are produced on the continent of some 1.3 billion people.\n\nThe WHO set up a global mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa last year to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines.\n\nThe global hub\u2019s role is to ensure that manufacturers in those nations have the know-how to make mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.\n\nAs used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines, mRNA technology provokes an immune response by delivering genetic molecules containing the code for key parts of a pathogen into human cells.\n\nPrimarily set up to address the Covid-19 pandemic, the global hub has the potential to expand manufacturing capacity for other vaccines and products, such as insulin to treat diabetes, cancer medicines and, potentially, vaccines for diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.\n\nThe scheme\u2019s ultimate goal is to spread capacity for national and regional production to all health technologies.\n\n\u2018Mutual Respect\u2019\n\nThe WHO said it would work with the first six countries chosen to develop a roadmap of training and support so they can start producing vaccines as soon as possible.\n\nTraining will begin in March.\n\nThe South African hub is already producing mRNA vaccines at laboratory scale and is currently scaling up towards commercial scale.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said Friday\u2019s announcement \u201cmeans mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent\u201d.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said supporting African health sovereignty was one of the key goals of starting up local production, \u201cto empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time\u201d.\n\nMore than 10.4 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered around the world, with nearly 62 percent of the global population having received at least one shot.\n\nHowever, just 11.3 per cent of Africans had been fully immunised by the start of February.\n\nIn Nigeria, many are yet to be vaccinated despite efforts by authorities to make citizens get the jab.\n\nOn Thursday, the country recorded 45 new cases of the virus, bringing its total number of confirmed cases to 254,182.\n\n230,530 cases are, however, said to have recovered, while 3,141 deaths have been recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe 45 new cases were reported from eight states \u2013 Lagos (18), Cross River (7), FCT (7), Oyo (5), Kano (3), Nasarawa (3), Ekiti (1) and Rivers (1).\n\nAcross the world, the vaccine continues to rage on.\n\nHere are some of the latest developments on the impact of the virus:\n\nCanadian Police Deployed\n\nCanadian police mass in the capital, readying to clear a trucker-led anti-Covid curb protest that has choked Ottawa\u2019s streets and provoked the government to call on rarely-used emergency powers.\n\nIsrael to end green pass\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett announces the requirement to show proof of coronavirus vaccination to enter various sites will soon end, as the wave of infections wanes.\n\nWorld \u2018better prepared\u2019\n\nThe world is becoming \u201cbetter prepared\u201d to deal with future variants of the virus, the CEO and co-founder of German vaccine-maker BioNTech tells AFP, as the company works on an Omicron-specific shot.\n\nJapan eases strict border bar\n\nJapan will ease its strict virus border rules to allow students and businesspeople into the country from March, but tourists will still be barred.\n\nPortugal to lift most Covid rules\n\nPortugal will no longer require people to present a health pass when going to restaurants and hotels, the government says, without providing a fixed date. Proof of vaccination is still necessary to enter the country.\n\nSwiss president tests positive\n\nOn the day Switzerland lifts almost all remaining coronavirus restrictions, the government announces President Ignazio Cassis has tested positive.\n\nCovid-19 pill\n\nA South Africa regulator says it has approved the use of Merck\u2019s Covid-19 pill for high-risk adults.\n\nUS jabs for Egypt, Nigeria\n\nThe United States ships nearly 5.2 million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to Egypt and Nigeria, a White House official tells AFP.\n\nDjokovic ready for Dubai comeback\n\nTennis world number one Novak Djokovic prepares for his comeback in Dubai, after a coronavirus vaccine row kept the Serb from defending his Australian Open title.\n\nAussie tennis star probed\n\nAustralian tennis player Alex de Minaur hits back at allegations he is being investigated over the purchase of false Covid passes, insisting: \u201cI have a completely valid, accurate and true vaccination record.\u201d\n\nOver 5.8 million dead\n\nCoronavirus has killed at least 5,848,104 people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to an AFP tally compiled from official sources Thursday.\n\nThe US has recorded the most Covid deaths with 928,519, followed by Brazil with 640,774, and India 510,413.\n\nTaking into account excess mortality linked to Covid-19, the WHO estimates the true death toll could be two to three times higher.",

          "text": "Storm Eunice killed at least eight people in Europe on Friday, pummelling Britain with record-breaking winds and forcing millions to take shelter as it disrupted flights, trains and ferries across Western Europe.\n\nLondon was eerily empty after the British capital was placed under its first ever \u201cred\u201d weather warning, meaning there was \u201cdanger to life\u201d. By nightfall, police there said a woman in her 30s had died after a tree fell on a car she was a passenger in.\n\nMeanwhile a man in his 50s was also killed in northwest England after debris struck the windscreen of a vehicle he was travelling in, according to Merseyside Police.\n\nREAD ALSO: Shelling, Evacuations Fuel Tensions On Russian-Ukrainian Border\n\nBeyond Britain, falling trees killed three people in the Netherlands and a man in his 60s in southeast Ireland, while a Canadian man aged 79 died in Belgium, according to officials in each country.\n\nA motorist was killed when their car crashed into a tree that had fallen across a road near Adorp in the Netherlands\u2019 northern province of Groningen.\n\nDozens of homes were evacuated in The Hague amid fears a church steeple could collapse. Footage showed the steeple wobbling and a large piece of debris falling on a car.\n\nAs well as in London, the highest weather alert level was declared across southern England, South Wales and the Netherlands, with many schools closed and rail travel paralysed, as towering waves breached sea walls along the coasts.\n\nMeanwhile Eunice\u2019s winds knocked out power to more than 140,000 homes in England, mostly in the southwest, and 80,000 properties in Ireland, utility companies said.\n\nAround the UK capital, three people were taken to hospital after suffering injuries in the storm, and a large section of the roof on the capital\u2019s Millennium Dome was shredded by the gales.\n\nOne wind gust of 122 miles (196 kilometres) per hour was measured on the Isle of Wight off southern England, \u201cprovisionally the highest gust ever recorded in England\u201d, the Met Office said.\n\nAt the Tan Hill Inn, Britain\u2019s highest pub in Yorkshire, staff were busy preparing even if the winds remained merely blustery in the region of northern England.\n\n\u201cBut with the snow coming in now, the wind\u2019s increasing, we\u2019re battening down the hatches, getting ready for a bad day and worse night,\u201d pub maintenance worker Angus Leslie told AFP.\n\n\u2018Sting jet\u2019\n\nScientists said the Atlantic storm\u2019s tail could pack a \u201csting jet\u201d, a rarely seen meteorological phenomenon that brought havoc to Britain and northern France in the \u201cGreat Storm\u201d of 1987.\n\nEunice caused high waves to batter the Brittany coast in northwest France, while Belgium, Denmark and Sweden all issued weather warnings. Long-distance and regional trains were halted in northern Germany.\n\nFerries across the Channel, the world\u2019s busiest shipping lane, were suspended, before the English port of Dover reopened in the late afternoon.\n\nHundreds of flights were cancelled or delayed at London\u2019s Heathrow and Gatwick airports and Schiphol in Amsterdam. One easyJet flight from Bordeaux endured two aborted landings at Gatwick \u2014 which saw wind gusts peak at 78 miles per hour \u2014 before being forced to return to the French city.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who has placed the British army on standby, tweeted: \u201cWe should all follow the advice and take precautions to keep safe.\u201d\n\nEnvironment Agency official Roy Stokes warned weather watchers and amateur photographers against heading to Britain\u2019s southern coastline in search of dramatic footage, calling it \u201cprobably the most stupid thing you can do\u201d.\n\nClimate impact?\n\nLondon\u2019s rush-hour streets, where activity has been slowly returning to pre-pandemic levels, were virtually deserted as many heeded government advice to stay at home.\n\nTrains into the capital were already running limited services during the morning commute, with speed limits in place, before seven rail operators in England suspended all operations.\n\nThe London Fire Brigade declared a \u201cmajor incident\u201d after taking 550 emergency calls in just over two hours \u2014 although it complained that several were \u201cunhelpful\u201d, including one from a resident complaining about a neighbour\u2019s garden trampoline blowing around.\n\nThe RAC breakdown service said it was receiving unusually low numbers of callouts on Britain\u2019s main roads, indicating that motorists are \u201ctaking the weather warnings seriously and not setting out\u201d.\n\nThe storm forced Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, to postpone a trip to South Wales on Friday \u201cin the interests of public safety\u201d, his office said Thursday.\n\nAnother storm, Dudley, had caused transport disruption and power outages when it hit Britain on Wednesday, although damage was not widespread.\n\nExperts said the frequency and intensity of the storms could not be linked necessarily to climate change.\n\nBut Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said a heating planet was leading to more intense rainfall and higher sea levels.\n\nTherefore, he said, \u201cflooding from coastal storm surges and prolonged deluges will worsen still further when these rare, explosive storms hit us in a warmer world\u201d.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Canadian police are poised to clear out on Friday hundreds of truck drivers from Ottawa who have staged a three-week-long protest against pandemic restrictions that has crippled the capital and prompted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to assume emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years.\n\nThe drivers, joined by thousands of demonstrators and some 400 vehicles, turned the streets around Parliament into a noisy party zone since first arriving on Jan. 28, in what has become one of the worst crises to hit Trudeau since he took power in 2015. Police made a handful of arrests Thursday evening, including of Chris Barber, one of the main fundraisers and organizers, after authorities said action was imminent. Barber went without resistance after police told him he was being arrested for mischief. \u201cWe absolutely are committed to end this unlawful demonstration. We have the plan, we have the commitment, we have the resources,\u201d interim police chief Steve Bell told reporters on Thursday. Police will set up a perimeter with 100 checkpoints around downtown to stop people without legitimate reason from entering, he said.\n\n\u201cThis weekend will look very different than the past three weekends,\u201d he added. Previous chief Peter Sloly quit this week amid residents\u2019 fury about what they saw as police inaction. The truckers\u2019 protests started against vaccine mandates for cross-border drivers, a measure in place in the United States, too. But slowly it spread across Canada and morphed into an anti-government movement. Protesters blocked several land crossings with the United States, including the busiest, the Ambassador Bridge which connects to Detroit, for six days, hurting both economies.\n\nCalling the blockades a threat to democracy, Trudeau invoked emergency measures on Monday giving his government temporary powers to end the unrest. Government officials said they were worried about extremists causing violence.\n\n\u201cEnd the mandates, give us our rights and this is over,\u201d said Chris Dacey on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ll all go back to our families.\u201d The border blockades turned the pressure on Trudeau to act swiftly, and U.S. President Joe Biden asked him to use federal powers. Many protesters on Parliament Hill said they would not leave until their demands were met. \u201cThe illegal blockades and occupations have to stop and the borders have to remain open,\u201d Trudeau told legislators on Thursday as Parliament started debate on the Emergencies Act, which needs to be passed within seven days of an announcement. RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nBut the official opposition Conservative Party says there was no need for the Emergencies Act, especially since the border blockades are over. Conservative Parliamentarian Jeremy Patzer told the House of Commons on Thursday that people around the world were alarmed to see Trudeau \u201ccome down on peaceful protesters with a sledgehammer.\u201d",
