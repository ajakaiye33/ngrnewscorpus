          "text": "The President of the Association of Foreign Relations Professionals in Nigeria, Ambassador Ganiyu Lawal, has urged the Nigerian government to remain neutral as the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its second day.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reported that Lawal, on Friday, told reporters that diplomacy remained the best way to resolve conflicts.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday, February 24, 2022.\n\nAccording to NAN, Lawal advised that, rather than taking sides, Nigeria should join other nations in suing for peace.\n\n\u201cAt this time, it is important that the Nigerian government should remain neutral, as we have been non-align all along.\n\n\u201cNigeria should join other countries suing for peace, because the world needs peace at this time more than ever.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government has made arrangements for her citizens who want to leave to leave as soon as the airports are opened.\n\n\u201cWhere it is not possible, a safe corridor will be negotiated for evacuation of civilians,\u201d Lawal said.\n\nCommenting on the crisis, Lawal berated actors for not observing rules of engagement or towing the path of diplomacy.\n\nHe said that the world had a strong diplomatic architecture put in place to forestall bullying of smaller countries by bigger powers, through collective security efforts.\n\nHe said further, \u201cHowever, in the face of glaring bullying by bigger power, the whole world will rise against it under the principle of collective security.\n\n\u201cAnd the bigger power will be defeated, no matter how strong, since it cannot simultaneously do battle on multiple fronts.\n\n\u201cThe implication is to allow peace to reign and refrain from provocative moves that threatens world peace, respect for the rule and spirit of the rule of engagement,\u201d Lawal added.\n\nThe AFRPN president further said that the ongoing crisis would have a ripple effect on the economies of Africa, and Nigeria in particular, as African countries rely on importation, NAN reported.\n\nLawal stated that it is high time African nations started trading internally amongst one another to avoid the kind of effect that conflicts like this would have on import-based economies.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 into law.\n\nPresident Buhari signed the Bill at the Council Chamber of the Presidential Villa in Abuja, on Friday.\n\nThe Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo; President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, were present to witness the signing of the Bill.\n\nIn his address, President Buhari said in line with established tradition, he received inputs from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of government after careful and thorough reviews of the Bill and its implications to democratic processes in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is gratifying to note that the current Bill comes with a great deal of improvement from the previous Electoral Bill 2021. There are salient and praiseworthy provisions that could positively revolutionize elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations. These innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively.\n\n\u201cThe Bill would also improve and engender clarity, effectiveness and transparency of the election process, as well as reduce to the barest minimum incidences of acrimony arising from dissatisfied candidates and political parties.\n\n\u201cThese commendable efforts are in line with our policy to bequeath posterity and landmark legal framework that paves the way for credible and sound electoral process that we would all be proud of.\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive. I am making this bold declaration because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3, 9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.\n\n\u201cThis, however, cannot be said about one provision as contained in the proposed Bill, which provision constitutes fundamental defect, as it is in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (12) constitutes a disenfranchisement of serving political office holders from voting or being voted for at Conventions or Congresses of any political party, for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election in cases where it holds earlier than 30 days to the National Election. The section provides as follows: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis provision has introduced qualification and disqualification criteria that ultra vires the Constitution by way of importing blanket restriction and disqualification to serving political office holders of which they are constitutionally accorded protection.\n\n\u201cThe practical application of section 84(12) of the Electoral Bill, 2022 will, if assented to, by operation of law, subject serving political office holders to inhibitions and restrictions referred to under section 40 and 42 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that the only constitutional expectation placed on serving political office holders that qualify, by extension as public officers within the context of the constitution is resignation, withdrawal or retirement at least 30 days before the date of the election.\n\n\u201cHence, it will be stretching things beyond the constitutional limit to import extraneous restriction into the constitution on account of practical application of section 84(12) of the bill where political parties\u2019 conventions and congresses were to hold earlier than 30 days to the election.\n\n\u201cArising from the foregoing, with particular regards to the benefits of the Bill, industry, time, resources and energy committed in its passage, I hereby assent to the Bill and request the Nationally Assembly to consider immediate amendments that will bring the Bill in tune with constitutionality by way of deleting section 84(12) accordingly.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "NCC boss, Danbatta gives insights on Revenue Assurance Solution approved by FEC",
          "text": "The Executive Vice Chairman, EVC, of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, Umar Garba Danbatta, has provided some insights into the development of Revenue Assurance Solution, RAS, which is designed to improve a very important aspect of the Commission\u2019s regulatory initiatives.\n\nThe EVC and Chief Executive Officer spoke during a virtual interactive session with stakeholders on the deployment of RAS in the Nigerian telecommunications industry.\n\nDanbatta explained that the annual Operating Levy, AOL, is a very important tool in the regulation of the telecommunications industry, adding that in Nigeria, its importance is well expressed in the Nigerian Communications Act 2003.\n\n\u201cAOL can be described as the taproot of an efficient and effective telecommunications regulatory environment,\u201d the EVC said, adding that the \u201cmechanisms for collection and computation of AOL, are of interest and importance to both the regulator and the operating networks.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Danbatta explained, \u201cSince the NCA 2003 came into force, various efforts have been made towards achieving a very effective AOL administration, pursuant to the powers of the Commission under Section 72 of the NCA Act 2003.\n\n\u201cOne of these key efforts include the making of the Regulations 2014, which is also currently undergoing review.\n\n\u201cSome of the major objectives of the AOL Regulations, as provided in Part 1 (2) of the AOL Regulations 2014, are to:\n\n(a) Create and provide a regulatory framework for the effective and efficient administration by the Commission of the Annual Operating Levy regime and all matters related thereto;\n\n(b) Stipulate the mode and methods of assessment of Annual Operating Levy and the payment modes thereof; and,\n\n(c) Specify guiding standards and principles for the administration by the Commission of the Annual Operating Levy regime.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has committed time and efforts to give vent to the provisions of this regulation in particular, and the administration of AOL, generally, in the best interest of the industry.\n\n\u201cThe Commission believes that the deployment of appropriate revenue assurance solutions would enhance monitoring and regulatory activities around AOL administration, and confer higher levels of integrity and fidelity on the AOL figures obtainable in the industry.\n\n\u201cIn some countries where the systems have been deployed, including some African countries, appropriate revenue assurance systems have resulted in higher revenues and plugging of leakages.\n\n\u201cModern revenue assurance systems have also shown to be equipped with additional capacities to generate and analyse information beyond those required for revenue computation.\n\n\u201cHence, our desire to deploy the most appropriate revenue assurance systems in the Nigerian telecommunications industry began in 2015 when Commission published an invitation to bid for the services.\n\n\u201cWith the emergence of a preferred bidder, 3R Company Nigeria Ltd, the Bureau of Public Procurement, BPP, offered no objection but further advised that due to the scope of the project, the solution would be more appropriately procured under a Public-Private Partnership, PPP, arrangement and further recommended that the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission, ICRC, be invited to guide the process as mandated by its regulations.\n\n\u201cPursuant to this development, the Commission set up a Project Delivery Team, PDT, which worked with a consortium of legal advisers, financial modellers and PPP experts under the guidance of ICRC, took the appropriate steps required under the ICRC Regulation 200\n\n\u201cPart of the process, include proper due diligence of the preferred partner, which received a clean bill of health from the Office of the National Security Adviser, NSA.\n\n\u201cThe Commission also subjected the software and hardware components of the proposed system to the certification of the National Information Technology Development Agency, NITDA.\n\n\u201cOn December 17, 2021, the transaction received the Certificate of Compliance from the ICRC in line with the Provisions of the ICRC Act 2005.\n\n\u201cOn the strength of this status, our Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isah Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) graciously presented the NCC RAS project to the Federal Executive Council Meeting of January 26, 2022, where the final approval form the implementation of the solution was finally approved.\n\n\u201cWe have invited you to share in this major milestone. We want to carry the industry along this very important path towards effective revenue assurance in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased that the Federal Executive Council, FEC, considered it appropriate to approve this transaction.\n\n\u201cWe also considered this approval as a very significant milestone that needs to be shared with you, our key stakeholders for purposes of cooperation and collaboration to make a success of this initiative.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian telecommunications industry, and revenue events engaged by the network operators, demand effective, accurate, and technology-driven revenue assurance solutions which NCC-RAS represents.\n\n\u201cTherefore, this project relieves the Commission of the initial financial burden that will be required for the deployment of the RAS project.\n\n\u201cIt will also ensure that accurate revenue generated by the licensed network operators are tracked, analyzed and utilized for the benefit of the industry.\n\n\u201cBeyond revenue assurance, when deployed, the NCC RAS will bring a lot of solutions to the industry, including more effective and enhanced monitoring and regulation of the licensed telecommunications operators by the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe system is designed to be connected to the licensed telecommunications operators\u2019 systems and will have the capability of capturing and reporting in near real-time billing activities by the operators for the purposes, amongst others, of computing and assuring with minimal, if any, error margin, the accrued AOL payable to the NCC by the licensees.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in addition to plugging possible loopholes and leakages in the revenue computation and collection processes, the RAS would enable the Commission to validate the information, records and data that are supplied to the Commission by the licensees from time to time regarding, amongst others, the revenue stream and profitability of the telecommunications industry.\n\n\u201cThe RAS project is very significant to the telecommunications industry.\n\n\u201cThe private partner, a consortium is known as 3R Revenue Assurance Solution Ltd, (3RRAS) will be responsible for the system for a Ten Years tenure as provided in the requisite Full Business Case (FBC) under a Design, Finance, Build, Operate, and Transfer, DFBOT and the Public-Private Partnership Agreement, PPPA.\n\n\u201cWe are also particularly delighted that this private partnership initiative contributes to our commitment to strategic partnering which is one of the key pillars of our Strategic Management Plan 2020-2024.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cIn some countries where the systems have been deployed, including some African countries, appropriate revenue assurance systems have resulted in higher revenues and plugging of leakages.\n\u201cModern revenue assurance systems have also shown to be equipped with additional capacities to generate and analyse information beyond those required for revenue computation.\nWe want to carry the industry along this very important path towards effective revenue assurance in the industry.\n\u201cThe Nigerian telecommunications industry, and revenue events engaged by the network operators, demand effective, accurate, and technology-driven revenue assurance solutions which NCC-RAS represents.\n\u201cTherefore, this project relieves the Commission of the initial financial burden that will be required for the deployment of the RAS project.",

          "text": "The Oyo State chapter of Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) has urged the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, and the Commissioner of Police in the state, Ngozi Onadeko, to without waiting more time fish out the policeman who killed a member of the organisation.\n\nThe association noted that the need to bring the erring policeman to book is necessary so as the death of their member is not in vain.\n\nDAILY POST had earlier reported that a member of OPC identified as Morufu Ganiyu on Saturday, died as a result of gunshot wounds he sustained during an encounter with a policeman in Ibadan. Our correspondent gathered that Ganiyu was, until his death, a leader of a private security outfit in the area.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that the policeman attached to Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (F-SARS), Lagos State, Obasanjo Atoyebi shot Ganiyu on Thursday, 17th February this year. The incident occurred at Imalefalafia junction, Oke-Ado area of Ibadan.\n\nAtoyebi is reportedly fond of shooting into the air twice every night whenever he is in Ibadan, where his family resides.\n\nInvestigation revealed that around 11:30 pm on Thursday, 17th February, when Atoyebi came back home, he fired twice in the air. It was gathered that Ganiyu was in the vicinity that night to supervise his boys when he heard the gunshots.\n\nSome of the residents of the area, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Ganiyu moved to the area to confront Atoyebi on why he was shooting unnecessarily.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that the policeman allegedly shot the OPC member twice in the process. The deceased later died on Saturday as a result of the injury he sustained.\n\nOPC coordinator in the state, Rotimi Olumo, while calling for proper investigation, urged both the police at the federal and state levels to fish out the policeman who shot their member which resulted in his death.\n\nOlumo who spoke with DAILY POST on Friday explained that the arrest and prosecution of the policeman would serve as a deterrent to other erring officers.\n\n\u201cThe incident occurred on Thursday, 17th February this year. We learnt that one of our members named Morufu Ganiyu who is providing private security for the car dealers at Imalefalafia up till Iyana Ososami area was shot twice by a policeman known as Obasanjo Atoyebi.\n\n\u201cObasanjo Atoyebi has one wife there and he usually comes at midnight. The people of the areas have complained bitterly about his unnecessary shootings at midnight whenever he arrived.\n\n\u201cOn that fateful day, Obasanjo Atoyebi fired gunshots when he arrived the area in the midnight. He has a pistol that he usually puts it in his pocket. Morufu Ganiyu challenged him on why he arrived at that time and why the unnecessary shootings.\n\n\u201cObasanjo Atoyebi then shot him twice. He first shot him in the chest and when he discovered that he did not die, he later shot him in the stomach.\n\n\u201cThose who were around rushed him to a hospital where they removed the bullets. They removed the one at the chest but, the man died because they could not remove the one in the stomach.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is that once a soldier is a soldier forever. He is a Yoruba man. Morufu Ganiyu was one of our coordinators.\n\n\u201cIs it alright for a policeman to be killing members of the public? Whether a dismissed policeman or serving policeman.\n\n\u201cWe are using this medium to inform the federal and state governments that Obasanjo Atoyebi should not go unpunished. Morufu Ganiyu should not die in vain. If the activity of a person like Ayoyebi is not challenged many of them will do such a thing.\n\n\u201cWe are using this medium to tell the IGP and the commissioner of police in Oyo State to fish out Atoyebi for him to pay for the offence he committed\u201d.\n\nBut, efforts made to get a reaction from the spokesman of Oyo State Police command, Adewale Osifeso, proved abortive as calls put through to his phone were not answered. He also did not respond to text messages sent to him for comments.",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae and Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi and his Kano State counterpart, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, as well as some other eminent Nigerians have suggested ways the nation should take to overcome its current challenges and attain greatness.\n\nPresident Buhari urged Nigerians to look for quality leadership who are driven by vision and experience, while Dr. Gowon said the country requires a leader with a mindset that sees beyond the 21 century.\n\nBoth leaders agreed that the vision of the nation\u2019s founding fathers had not been realised, but said it is work in progress and hoped for a better future.\n\nDignitaries at the event included All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart, Chief Bisi Akande, Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Abubakar Bagudu (Kebbi), Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Works and Housing Minister Babatunde Fashola (SAN) and Dr. Tope Fasua (who represented APC stalwart, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu).\n\nOthers are: former Ogun State Governor Ibikule Amosu; Finance, Budget and National Planning Minister, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed; Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo (SAN); Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor; and Minister of State for Mine and Steel Development, Uchechukwu Ogah.\n\nFayemi said the nation needs purposeful leadership with the capacity to harness its potentials and address its challenges.\n\nGanduje urged more intellectuals to be involved in governance and quit seeing politics as a dirty game.\n\nThe eminent Nigerians spoke yesterday in Abuja at the public presentation of a book, titled: Unfinished Greatness: Envisioning A New Nigeria, written by Fayemi.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, hailed Fayemi for writing the book and for his contributions to governance in the country.\n\nOn the importance of visionary leadership, he said: \u201cPractice and politicking without a vision can also become extremely unproductive for a country that needs to move forward.\n\n\u201cSo, it is a combination of people of vision, intellect and practice; experience, record of achievement in public service, that, in my view, qualify people for leadership.\n\n\u201cIt is not a question of a choice between practitioners and intellectuals but a combination of vision for a society; a combination of experienced people who have demonstrated capacity in articulating the need of a society and helping to implement that.\u201d\n\nGowon, who chaired the event, argued that although the nation may not have adequately addressed its leadership question since Independence, it should not be deterred from its search.\n\n\u201cThe second notion of envisioning a new Nigeria addresses the leadership question. Our country may not have got this right for much of our 62 years as an independent nation, but I think we have all done our best; that this should not undermine our search for quality leadership \u2013 the kind with a mindset that sees father than even the 21 century.\n\n\u201cWe speak of leadership that seeks to make our unity and diversity work. We speak of leadership that makes our borders \u2013 internal and external -safe for everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nFayemi noted that although no country is immune from challenges, state and nation-building, all over the world, remain a permanent work in progress but driven by committed and visionary leaders.\n\nThe keynote speaker and Research Director at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, urged Nigerian leaders to evolve local solutions to the nation\u2019s challenges.\n\nThe book reviewer, a visiting lecturer at the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance in the Netherlands, Dr. Joe Abah, noted that the book makes a compelling argument for the need to restructure Nigeria and for decentralisation and devolution of powers, predicated on an honest national dialogue.",

          "text": "*Biden: Attack was premeditated, brutal assault\n\n*Clinton: This was unjustified\n\n*George W. Bush: Invasion \u2018unprovoked and unjustified\u2019\n\n*Johnson: \u2018Our worst fears have come true\u2019, imposes full asset freeze on Russia, Belarus\n\n*G-7 leaders: Putin \u2018has put himself on the wrong side of history\u2019\n\n*US, Western nations roll out barrage of sanctions on Russia\n\n*Lawmakers seek immediate evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine, Gbajabiamila issues Monday deadline\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu, Peter Uzoho and Bayo Akinloye with agency report\n\nGlobal outrage followed yesterday\u2019s attacks launched by Russia on major cities and infrastructure in Ukraine, with the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), among others, describing it as an unprovoked aggression, and imposing a series of sanctions on Russia.\n\nRussian media had quoted President Vladimir Putin as saying he had given approval for the operation in the Donbas region of Ukraine, where Moscow earlier recognised rebel-held territories in Luhansk and Donetsk, and said they had asked for \u201chelp\u201d.\n\nOwing to the attack, oil prices jumped yesterday, with Brent rising above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014, after the attack exacerbated concerns about disruptions to global energy supply. On the other hand, global markets plunged.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the invasion by land, air, and sea began after a pre-dawn TV address, where the Russian President demanded that Ukraine\u2019s military lay down their arms. Initial reports of casualties included Ukrainian civilians and soldiers, and Russian troops.\n\nThe Ukraine\u2019s leader had said his country \u201cwon\u2019t give up its freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted.\n\nUkraine declared martial law and severed all diplomatic relations with Russia. It said weapons would be given to anyone who wanted them.\n\nThe Russian attack began around 4:30 am in Ukraine yesterday, with a barrage of over 100 ballistic, cruise and surface-to-air missiles, and included 75 medium and heavy bombers. Experts said the invasion was the largest in Europe since World War II. The fighting, described as an initial phase, could potentially become very bloody and very costly, they added.\n\nExplosions were heard in major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Odessa. Oleksii Arestovich, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said at least 40 people had been killed and dozens others wounded in the attack so far.\n\nUkrainian authorities said Russian forces had hit military assets and other defence facilities, while footage shared by Ukrainian border guards showed Russian military vehicles moving across the border from Crimea.\n\nZelenskyy had announced that Ukraine had cut diplomatic ties with Russia, declaring martial law and offering to issue weapons to anyone who wants to defend the country. Despite pleas to stay home, people in Kyiv were jamming roads to leave.\n\nBut as global outrage swelled, Putin met with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan yesterday. The prime minister\u2019s office posted a video to Twitter of the two leaders shaking hands and said the pair would discuss \u201cthe entire gamut of Pakistan-Russia bilateral cooperation, and exchange views on regional and global issues of mutual interest.\u201d\n\nU.S Reaction\n\nPresident Joe Biden yesterday forcefully condemned Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a premeditated attack and a brutal assault \u201cwithout provocation, without justification, without necessity.\n\n\u201cVladimir Putin has been planning this for months.\u201d\n\nBiden announced new sanctions that included banning exports to Russia.\n\n\u201cWe have purposely designed these sanctions to maximise a long-term impact on Russia and to minimise impact on the United States and our allies,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden used his strongest language to date about Putin, saying the U.S. and allies will make sure he becomes \u201cpariah on the international stage.\u201d\n\nBiden met earlier yesterday morning with his national security team and world leaders, hours after Putin ordered the attack on Ukraine in the predawn darkness.\n\nThe U.S. already has about 90,000 troops in Europe and has deployed more to the continent as tensions simmered in the weeks before Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this month, about 5,000 US-based forces were sent to Europe and US military personnel already there had been shifting to help bolster NATO\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nBiden said members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy, as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and others had joined a global coalition to amplify a united response. He also said G-7 leaders agreed to limit Russia\u2019s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen. The president said the US would block four more major banks in addition to the sanctions imposed on VTB and Russia\u2019s military bank.\n\nBiden said the United States was taking steps to defend NATO allies.\n\nThe organisation will convene a summit today, which would \u201cbring together the leaders of 30 allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance,\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cThis aggression cannot go unanswered. America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom,\u201d he added.\n\nBiden said his administration was going to use \u201cevery tool\u201d to protect Americans and businesses from rising gas prices.\n\nHe called on American oil and gas companies to \u201cnot exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.\u201d\n\nThe US president said, \u201cOur sanctions package is specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue. We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption.\u201d\n\nThe White House sounded the alarm last week to prepare the country for potential cyber-attacks on US companies or key parts of U.S. critical infrastructure, including pipelines, banks, commercial aviation, and hospitals.\n\nClinton Condemns \u2018Unprovoked and Unjustified\u2019 Russian attack on Ukraine\n\nFormer US President Bill Clinton yesterday condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, joining world leaders, past and present, in rebuking Putin.\n\n\u201cPutin\u2019s war of choice has unravelled 30 years of diplomacy, with the potential for mass civilian casualties and huge displacements both within Ukraine\u2019s borders and beyond,\u201d Clinton said in a prepared statement posted to his Twitter account.\n\nHe called the invasion \u201cunprovoked and unjustified\u201d and a \u201cbrazen violation of international law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world will hold Russia and Russia alone accountable, both economically and politically,\u201d he said.\n\nUK\u2019s Johnson Outlines Severe Sanctions against Russia, Belarus\n\nIn his address today, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged a \u201cvast invasion\u201d is underway and said the world \u201ccannot allow that freedom\u201d of Ukraine to be \u201csnuffed out\u201d.\n\nHe assured the UK will \u201cdo what more we can in the days ahead\u201d, including agreeing a \u201cmassive package of economic sanctions\u201d.\n\nJohnson continued, \u201cOur mission is clear: diplomatically, politically, economically and, eventually, militarily, this hideous and barbaric venture of Putin must end in failure.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister addressed the people of Russia, Ukraine and Britain separately in his address, telling those in Russia that he \u201ccannot believe\u201d the invasion has been launched \u201cin your name\u201d.\n\nHe assured Ukrainians the UK was \u201con [their] side\u201d, and told Brits the government \u201cwill do everything to keep our country safe\u201d, including working with allies for \u201chowever long it takes\u201d to ensure the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine was restored.\n\nJohnson said the United Kingdom was imposing \u201cthe largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen\u201d and that sanctions would also apply to Belarus for its role in Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine.\n\nIn coordination with the US, Johnson said the United Kingdom was imposing a \u201cfull asset freeze\u201d on the Russian-owned bank VTB that will effectively exclude Russian banks from UK\u2019s financial system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to tell the House that the United States is taking similar measures,\u201d Johnson told the House of Commons.\n\nHe said the UK would implement new trade and export restrictions similar to what the US would also impose\n\nThe prime minister said Russian companies, both private and state-owned, would be prohibited from raising funds in the UK, taking loans out of the UK, and making securities transactions in the UK\n\n\u201cThis includes all the major manufacturers that support Putin\u2019s war machine,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of protesters yesterday gathered in London to urge Britain and other democracies to step up action against Russia. Ukrainians living in the UK and activists gathered outside the prime minister\u2019s Downing Street office singing the Ukrainian national anthem.\n\nNatalia Ravlyuk, who helped organise the protest, said they wanted the \u201ctoughest sanctions and total isolation of Russia now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feel betrayed by democratic states because we have been talking about this war for eight years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just need to wake up and stop Putin now,\u201d the Associated Press quoted her as saying.\n\nNATO chief: Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion \u2018cold-blooded\u2019 and \u2018long-planned\u2019\n\nNATO Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, described Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as \u201cdeliberate, cold-blooded and long-planned,\u201d accusing Putin of \u201cusing force to re-write history.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Brussels, Stoltenberg called for a summit of NATO alliance leaders on Friday to address Moscow\u2019s military incursion into neighbouring Ukraine and said the military alliance would be bolstering its land, sea and air forces on its eastern flank. Stoltenberg confirmed NATO did not have any troops inside Ukraine and did not plan to send any, but said the alliance was still committed to providing Kyiv with military and technical support.\n\nUkraine is not a member of NATO but other countries close to the theatre of conflict, including Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Lithuania, are. Under Article 4 of the NATO treaty, all are entitled to direct military support if their \u201cterritorial integrity, political independence or security\u201d is threatened.\n\nG-7 leaders: Putin Has Put Himself on Wrong Side of History\u2019\n\nFollowing a virtual meeting yesterday morning, leaders of the G-7 issued a joint statement announcing they would bring forward \u201csevere and coordinated economic and financial sanctions\u201d and calling on the global community to condemn the attack in the strongest terms possible.\n\nThe leaders of the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada, along with the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Charles Michel, and NATO Secretary-General called the unfolding conflict \u201ca serious threat to the rules-based international order, with ramifications well beyond Europe.\u201d\n\nThe leaders called on Moscow to end the bloodshed and condemned Belarus\u2019 involvement in Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThis has fundamentally changed the Euro-Atlantic security situation,\u201d the statement read. \u201cPresident Putin has re-introduced war to the European continent. He has put himself on the wrong side of history.\u201d\n\nGeorge Bush: Invasion Unprovoked, Unjustified\u2019\n\nIn a similar vein, former US President George W. Bush condemned Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine as \u201cthe gravest security crisis on the European continent since World War II.\u201d\n\nThe invasion was \u201cunprovoked and unjustified,\u201d Bush said in a statement.\n\nBush, who once described Putin as \u201cvery straightforward and trustworthy,\u201d said the US government and the American people must stand in solidarity with Ukraine and its people as they sought freedom \u201cand the right to choose their own future.\n\n\u201cWe cannot tolerate the authoritarian bullying and danger that Putin poses.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cUkraine is our friend and democratic ally and deserves our full support during this most difficult time.\u201d\n\nOil Prices Hit $105 Per Barrel\n\nOil prices jumped yesterday with Brent rising above $105 a barrel for the first time since 2014, after Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine exacerbated concerns about disruptions to global energy supply.\n\nSenior oil market analyst at Rystad Energy, Louise Dickson, told Reuters, \u201cOil prices are soaring with no end in sight as the news of Russia\u2019s full-scale military incursion of Ukraine, immediately putting at risk up to 1 million bpd (barrels per day) of Russian crude oil exports transitioning through Ukraine and the Black Sea,\u201d\n\nAt least three major buyers of Russian oil were unable to open letters of credit from Western banks to cover purchases on Thursday, sources told Reuters.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude rose $6.61, or 6.8 per cent, to $103.45, after touching a high of $105.79.\n\nAlso, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude jumped $4.78, or 5.2 per cent, to $96.88 a barrel, after earlier rising to $100.54. Brent and WTI hit their highest since August and July 2014, respectively.\n\n\u201cRussia is the third-largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter. Given low inventories and dwindling spare capacity, the oil market cannot afford large supply disruptions,\u201d UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said.\n\n\u201cSupply concerns may also spur oil stockpiling activity, which supports prices.\u201d\n\nRussia is also the largest provider of natural gas to Europe, providing about 35 per cent of its supply.\n\nChina warned of the impact of tensions on the stability of the energy market.\n\n\u201cAll countries that are truly responsible should take responsible actions to jointly maintain global energy security,\u201d a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said.\n\nGlobally, oil supplies remain tight as demand recovers from pandemic lows.\n\nReflecting the tightness, the premium on Brent contracts for loading in one month over contracts for loadings in six months, a metric closely watched by traders, hit a record high at $11.55 a barrel.\n\nAnalysts said Brent was likely to remain above $100 a barrel until significant alternative supplies become available from US shale or Iran, for example.\n\nThe United States and Iran have been engaged in indirect nuclear talks in Vienna that could lead to the removal of sanctions on Iranian oil sales.\n\nAnalysts are warning of inflationary pressure on the global economy from $100 oil, especially for Asia, which imports most of its energy needs.\n\n\u201cAsia\u2019s Achilles heel remains its vast import needs for energy, with surging oil prices bound to take a hefty bite out of income and growth over the coming year,\u201d said HSBC economist Frederic Neumann.\n\nHouse Seeks Immediate Evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine\n\nAs the conflict worsens, the House of Representatives has directed its leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa, and Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Hon. Yakub Buba, to liaise with the Foreign Affairs Ministry, National Intelligence Agency, and Ukrainian embassy to see that Nigerian students in Ukraine were immediately evacuated.\n\nMoving a motion of urgent national importance at the plenary yesterday, Hon. Ahmed Munir lamented that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was deteriorating by the hour.\n\nMunir pointed out that Nigeria had a significant number of undergraduate and graduate students currently studying in Ukraine, with a good number of them under government scholarships. This, he said, included a number of Nigerian diplomats and their families in the Kiev Embassy and Nigerian expatriates across Ukraine.\n\nHe expressed concern that if a strategic plan was not put in place to secure and provide safe passage for Nigerian citizens, they may be trapped or worse, harmed.\n\nThe lawmaker urged his colleagues to mandate its Committees on Foreign Affairs and diaspora, in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to ascertain the exact figures of Nigerians affected by this conflict and put in place a comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and evaluation mechanism.\n\nContributing, the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, amended the prayer calling for an interface with the ministry, NIA and embassy for immediate evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine.\n\nGbajabiamila said since a state of emergency had been declared on the conflict, urgent action needed to be taken to ensure safety of the citizens.\n\nThe Speaker told the lawmakers that if nothing positive came out of their meeting with the stakeholders today, then they should immediately contact the chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, regardless of the cost and head to Ukraine tomorrow (Friday) and evacuate the students on Monday.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cThis is a very important motion that we discussed. Time is of the essence. A state of emergency has been declared, I listened to the news yesterday, even America said it\u2019s not going to be bloodless. We should be more proactive and I think it\u2019s better late than never. It\u2019s important that at this point to forget all the bureaucratic bottlenecks, and look out for our citizens, especially students.\n\n\u201cAction needs to be taken now and my thought is that leader of the House Hon. Ado Doguwa, and Chairman, Foreign Affairs, Hon. Buba Yakub, should liaise with the ministry foreign affairs, NIA and embassy in Ukraine and if nothing positive comes out of it, then we should liaise with chairman Air Peace. Whatever it\u2019s going to cost the House, you need to leave this country latest tomorrow and come back on Monday with many of our students.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Al-Makura, Mustapha, Dafe kick; say it\u2019s media game\n\n*Stakeholders insist on open contest for chairmanship\n\n*Ruling party appoints zonal congress committees\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nReports that President Muhammadu Buhari might have settled for a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as his consensus candidate for the office of the national chairman, is true.\n\nBut more details have also emerged on why the president settled for Adamu, despite the fact that he has seemingly unending cases with the nation\u2019s number one anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nNonetheless, three other aspirants to the same office, namely, Tanko Al makura, Saliu Mustapha and Sunny Moni Dafe, had immediately rejected the \u201cpurported\u201d adoption of Adamu by the president.\n\nIn addition to the disavowal by other contestants, a group of concerned APC North-West stakeholders, has insisted that those aspiring to the exalted seat of APC chairmanship should be allowed to test their popularity and therefore, the contest should be thrown open.\n\nThis, notwithstanding, the leadership of the ruling party, has appointed committees for its forthcoming zonal congresses to be held on March 12, 2022.\n\nDifferent sources confided in THISDAY yesterday that the inroads made by Senator Adamu in reconciling aggrieved members of the party that attracted him to Buhari as a likely choice for party\u2019s chairmanship.\n\nBut some governors, especially, those from north central were said to have opposed the choice of Adamu, insisting that since the national chairman, has been zoned to the geo-political, they should be allowed to decide who picks the position.\n\nBesides, the purported endorsement of Adamu has also not gone down well with other aspirants and governors, as they claimed that he was not among the aspirants, as his name only popped up last week before President Buhari travelled to Brussels, Germany.\n\nBefore his departure, the president was said to have asked for the names of all the aspirants and his name was added.\n\nGovernor Sule of Nasarawa State and his counterpart in Kwara State, Abdulrahman Abdurazak, were said to have opposed the choice of Adamu, but backed Al-Makura.\n\nAnother governor from the zone, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, THISDAY was told, also rejected the purported adoption of Adamu.\n\nMustapha, on his part, told THISDAY yesterday that against the media speculations, the President has not adopted Admau, describing it as \u201ca media game.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMy governor (Governor Abdulrazaq of Kwara) told me that the matter of who becomes the next national chairman of our party has not been discussed.\u201d\n\nMustapha, who maintained that the matter was not discussed at the APC governors\u2019 meeting with the president, told THISDAY that the president only approved the zoning of offices as presented to him by the APC-elected governors.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting, no name was mentioned. It was only the approval of the zoning of offices that was presented and the president only approved the zoning and asked the governors to go about it diligently to ensure peace.\n\n\u201cThe President Buhari that I know will not like to do things secretly. This is a media game by those concerned. I don\u2019t know what they want to achieve.\u201d\n\nAnother aspirant, Monidafe, questioned the aid adoption of Adamu, claiming that if it wastrue, why has the president not officially announced it?\n\nSenator Al-Makura, in a statement by Segun Tomo, the Director, New Media, Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO), also denied that Adamu has been adopted as the national chairman of APC.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO) has been drawn to wide speculations and propaganda making the rounds in some news outlets that President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed the candidacy of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu as the next Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cWhile we would have ordinarily ignored the widespread rumours, we have been inundated with calls and apprehension of Sen. Umaru Tanko Al-Makura\u2019s supporters across the country. Therefore, we decided to respond, and set the records straight.\n\n\u201cInformation at our disposal indicate that what transpired at the meeting of the governors with the president was the ratification of the new convention date and agreement on the zoning formula.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of who becomes chairman, the president asked that consultations continue to produce a credible and widely accepted choice as consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cOne does not need a soothsayer to know that Al-Makura fits the bill. Across the length and breadth of the country, Sen. Al-Makura is seen as a bridge-builder, a leader imbued with a calm temperament, renowned with an impeccable mobilization skills and political sagacity that ensured he defeated the then entrenched Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nasarawa State.\u201d\n\nStakeholders Insist on Open Chairmanship Contest\n\nConcerned APC North-West Stakeholders forum, has insisted that those aspiring for the chairmanship of the party should be allowed to test their popularity, openly.\n\nNational Convener of the group, Alhaji Sani Abubakar, in a statement argued that the call was necessitated by the purported move to impose Senator Abdullahi Adamu as chairman of the party.\n\nThe group expressed convern that some of the party\u2019s governors from the North West geopolitical zone were already dropping the name of President Muhammadu Buhari purely to promote the candidacy of Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nThe group cautioned some members of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) to thread with caution so as not to destroy the APC, saying there would be consequences for any act that causes problems for the party.\n\n\u201cThe stakeholders have become aware that members of the PGF from the north-west, who championed this errant position are acting out their own greed and personal agenda, which is that each of them is hopeful of emerging the running mate to an eventual APC presidential candidate from the south.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that people, who currently (individually) hold the mandate for the wellbeing of millions of people as state governors are unable to subjugate their selfish interest for national interest, party loyalty and the long-term stability of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is tragic how these individuals overheated the polity simply out of desperation to occupy a position that is not zoned to their areas. These persons from the north-west looking for the position of vice president that, going by our history as a nation, it is well known that the best the region could get after 2023 is the national chairmanship position of the party.\n\n\u201cAll those pushing for a candidate from the north central to be made a consensus chairman of the party, which has earlier been zoned to the north west, are traitors and seem to only be interested in rubbishing Mr. President\u2019s legacies in office by appending his name as mark of approval to their plans.\u201d\n\nAPC Appoints Zonal Congress Committees\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), has appointed committees for its forthcoming zonal congresses slated for March 12, 2022.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe disclosed this in a statement issued yesterday I\u2019m Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe chairmen of the committees are all members of the CECPC, while secretaries are selected from amongst the deputy governors from their respective geo-political zones.\n\n\u201cMeetings of zonal stakeholders hold on Saturday, 26 February, 2022 at the respective geo-political zones.\u201d Akpanudoedehe disclosed.\n\nFor the North-Central zone, the Governor of Niger SState, Abubakar Bello was appointed chairman, while Prof. Sonni Tyoden will serve as the secretary.\n\nThe party appointed Senator Yusuf Yusuf as the chairman for the North-east Zone, while Mr. Manasseh Jatau, will serve as the secretary.\n\nThe APC appointed Mr. David Lyon as the chairman for the South-south, while Prof. Ivara Esu, will serve as the secretary.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said Senator Abba Ali would serve as the committee chairman for the Northwest zone, while Hadiza Balarabe is the secretary.\n\nHon. Akinremi Olaide was appointed as the chairman for the South-west zone and Dr. Kadiri Hamzat is the secretary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The deal is however subject Ministerial Consent and other required regulatory approvals.\n\nSeplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian energy company listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE), was expected to announce the agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil, with the completion of the transaction subject to ministerial consent and other required regulatory approvals.\n\nThe statement from the company obtained by THISDAY, showed that Seplat Energy Offshore Limited, a wholly owned Nigerian subsidiary of Seplat Energy Plc, entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU for a purchase price of $1,283 million plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.\n\nThe transaction, according to statement, encompasses the acquisition of the entire offshore shallow water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria, which it said is an established, high-quality operation with a highly skilled local operating team and a track record of safe operations.\n\nThe transaction, it said, would create one of the largest independent energy companies on both the NGX and LSE and bolster Seplat Energy\u2019s ability to drive increased growth, profitability and overall stakeholder prosperity. The deal would deliver 186 per cent increase in production from 51,000 bpd to 146,000 bpd or 170 per cent increase in 2P liquids reserves, from 241 MMbbl to 650 MMbbl.\n\nIn addition, it was expected to deliver a 14 per cent increase in 2P gas reserves from 1,501 Bscf to 1,712 Bscf, plus significant undeveloped gas potential of 2,910 Bscf (JV: 7,275 Bscf)\n\nFurthermore, it was expected to increase by 89 per cent, the total 2P reserves from 499 MMboe to 945 MMboe and includes offshore fields with dedicated, MPNU-operated export routes offering enhanced security and reliability.\n\nIn the oil industry, 2P reserves are the total of proven and probable reserves while probable reserves are less likely to be recovered than proven reserves.\n\nBeing the first transaction to be announced since the Nigerian government\u2019s recently ratified PIA, the company stated that the deal would support Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and objectives of the new Act.\n\nSeplat Energy said it was fully committed to working with the Nigerian government to bring the strategically important national assets fully into Nigerian ownership alongside the national oil company, NNPC.\n\nIn addition, it noted that the development of the gas resources would support the government\u2019s objective to achieve a pragmatic, progressive and just energy transition for Nigeria.\n\nThe transaction agreement also includes potential additional contingent consideration of up to $300 million in total, payable over the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2026, and contingent upon average Brent crude oil prices exceeding $70 per barrel and subject to MPNU\u2019s average working interest production exceeding 60 kboepd (JV: 150 kboepd).\n\nThe deal primarily comprises a 40 per cent operating ownership of four oil mining leases (OMLs 67, 68, 70, 104) and associated infrastructure with NNPC being owner of the rest 60 per cent.\n\nIt includes the Qua Iboe Terminal, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest export facilities as well as a 51 per cent interest in Bonny River Terminal and Natural Gas Liquids Recovery Plants at EAP and Oso.\n\nHowever, the contract does not include ExxonMobil\u2019s deep-water assets in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to statement, the cash consideration payable under the transaction will be funded through a combination of existing cash resources and credit facilities of Seplat Energy, and a new $550 million senior term loan facility and $275 million junior offtake facility.\n\nAlso included is a global financing syndicate comprising Nigerian and international banks, as well as commodity trading companies, while contingent payments, if materialised on Brent oil price annual average above $70/bbl, will be funded through share of net cash flows from operations.\n\nUnder the Sale and Purchase Agreement, Seplat Energy will pay a deposit of $128 million, which will be applied towards the purchase price on closing.\n\n\u201cIf the transaction does not proceed, the deposit will be repaid to Seplat Energy where the agreement is terminated by Seplat Energy in certain circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe Transaction does not require the approval of Seplat Energy\u2019s shareholders and will not result in any changes to its Board. The Company currently expects the Transaction to close in H2 2022,\u201d it stated.\n\nCommenting on the deal, Chairman of Seplat Energy, Dr. Bryant Orjiako, said: \u201cThis is a transformational acquisition for Seplat Energy that strengthens our partnership with the national oil company, the NNPC, and consummates the spirit of the newly enacted PIA.\n\n\u201cAs a significantly larger business, with a stronger resource base and greatly enhanced capabilities, we will be better positioned to provide sustainable energy solutions that drive growth and profitability for the benefit of all our stakeholders, particularly our host communities and the wider Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the aims of the federal government\u2019s \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, and this acquisition will accelerate our development of Nigeria\u2019s gas resources to help achieve a just transition for our rapidly growing country.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chief Executive Officer of the company, Roger Brown, said: \u201cThis transaction underpins Seplat Energy\u2019s drive to be a leader in the growth of the indigenous independent energy sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition is a perfect fit with our strategy to build a sustainable business and deliver energy transition in Nigeria. Our financial strength has enabled us to attract high quality local and international capital providers to fund this transaction without diluting our existing shareholders and reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to drive our growth through the extensive low-cost and low-risk production opportunities it delivers in the near term, whilst also developing longer-term opportunities to monetise our significant gas resources through domestic and export opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is a win-win for both companies. Together, we will strengthen our focus on profitability and cash generation to reinvest in Nigeria\u2019s energy development.\n\n\u201cMPNU\u2019s employees and contractors have a strong reputation for safety and operational excellence, and I look forward to welcoming them to the Seplat Energy family,\u201d he stated.\n\nFor months, Mobil\u2019s officials have been holding talks with several Nigerian companies to gauge their interest in the fields, followed with the opening of a \u201cdata room\u201d \u2013 which provided technical information on the fields, such as seismic and production details \u2013 in Nigeria.\n\nThe discussions focused on a number of onshore fields ExxonMobil shares in joint ventures with Nigerian state oil firm, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), including Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 67, 68, 70 and 104.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says Nigeria\u2019s constitution bars him from going beyond two terms as president\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has declared that the nation\u2019s constitution statutorily barred him from going beyond two terms as President.\n\nThis is just as he said he was looking forward to leaving office by May 29, 2023.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, during a courtesy visit to the palace of Emir of Lafia, retired Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad 1, the President stressed that he has no intention whatsoever to stay beyond the constitutionally recognised two terms of office as leader of Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201dThe traditional ruler is on a terminal appointment. Constitutionally, we (elected public office holders) are not. I cannot go beyond two terms and I have sworn by the Holy Quran that I will uphold the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, leaders who take the oath of office, swearing with the Holy Book, must be careful not to abuse the trust of leadership placed on them by the people and God.\n\n\u201dPolitics apart, whenever we are made to swear by the Holy Quran, we have to be very careful. We must make sure that we do not abuse the trust God has given us as leaders.\n\n\u201dI have seen former Governors here and I am looking forward to also becoming a former President,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari thanked the people of Nasarawa State for the rousing welcome, expressing delight that the north-central state was wearing a new look since his last visit in 2019.\n\nHe congratulated the immediate past Governor and Senator representing Nasarawa South Senatorial District, Umaru Tanko Al-Makura and the incumbent, Governor Abdullahi Sule for the laudable initiatives and accomplishments in the state.\n\nWelcoming the president to the over 200-year old palace, the Emir of Lafia thanked him for ending the problem of insufficient power to Nasarawa State with the provision of 330kVA sub-station.\n\nThe Emir, who is also the Chairman, Nasarawa State Council of Chiefs, told the president that the provision of the electricity plant, \u201dhas taken out 80 percent of our problem.\u201d\n\n\u201dOur people have never had it so good. Our people are back to their normal life as entrepreneurs, \u201d he said, adding that the federal government projects that were, \u201dstanding as ghosts\u201d in the state in the past have now become a reality.\n\nThe monarch listed the newly inaugurated CBN Building in Lafia, the Federal Secretariat, UBEC Smart School and completed Ecological projects, just to mention but a few.\n\nOn arrival in the capital for a two-day State visit to Nasarawa state, Buhari inaugurated the Lafia Airport, Vocational and Skills Acquisition Centre, Modern Bus Terminal and the Shinge-Barkini Abdullahi-Kilema road, executed by the State Government.\n\nHe also inaugurated CBN Lafia Branch building and a 330kva Akurba Transmission Substation executed by the Federal Government through the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) to boost power supply in the state and its environs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s 5G race: MTN and Mafab pay $547.2m licence fee",
          "text": "Today, February 24 2022, marks a milestone in the race for Nigeria\u2019s 5th generation (5G) mobile network spectrum. The winners of the bid for 3.5GHz 5G spectrum, MTN and Mafab have each completed payment of the $273.6m licence fee required by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nAside the $273.6 million payment, MTN paid additional $15.9 million, being the bidding sum it offered at the assignment state of the spectrum auction, making it clinch its preferred Lot 1 (3500-3600 Megahertz-MHz) in the 3.5Ghz spectrum; while, Mafab Communications, which bided lower at the assignment stage, consequentially settled with Lot 2 (3700-3800Mhz) at no extra cost.\n\n\u201cI wish to officially announce that NCC has received and confirmed payments from MTN and Mafab for their acquisition of 1 slot of 100Mhz each in the 3.5Ghz spectrum auction, which was successfully conducted by the Commission on December 13, 2021, \u201d Umar Danbatta Executive Vice Chairman, NCC said. \u201cThey both met the deadline of February 24, 2022 as set by the Commission.\u201d\n\nMafab emerges winner\n\nOn December 13, 2021, when the NCC announced that the MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications were the winners of the bid for the 5G licence, it came as a surprise to many as Mafab is an unknown player in the telecommunications space.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Transparency Nigeria Group petitioned the Federal Government and all relevant security agencies to launch an investigation into the business practices of Mafab Communications Limited.\n\n\u201cMafab Communications was incorporated in 2020, has no comprehensive tax history, and appears to have been specifically set up by connected insiders for the purpose of acquiring one of the highly valued 5G licences,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nHow MTN and Mafab won\n\nThe top bidders were Airtel Networks Limited, Mafab Communications Limited and MTN Communications Nigeria Limited, with the bidding price starting at $199,374,000. After 11 rounds of auction over a duration of 9 hours, the bid price rose to over $200 million with all 3 companies still active.\n\nThe auction process came to an end when MTN and Mafab posted an exit bid of $273 million, while Airtel posted a final bid of $270 million. Simply put, Airtel offered to pay the least amount among the three companies for the 5G licence, thus falling out of the race.\n\nPrior to the auction, Airtel, MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications had paid an initial non-refundable 10% deposit of $19.75m each, which was statutory and mandatory to qualify them to participate in the bid process.\n\nThere were also allegations put out that Mafab is connected to former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, but the NCC has denied the allegations.\n\nThe NCC also added to its claims that the auction was free and fair by pointing out that it had earlier awarded Mafab with international data access (IDA), inter-connect data exchange (IDE) and Value-Added Service (VAS) licences. The earliest licence being the IDA issued in October 2020, 4 months after Mafab was incorporated.\n\nMafab Communications Limited was registered on July 8, 2020, according to the company\u2019s website and TechCabal\u2019s search on the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) site. It claims to provide and operate local Interconnect and International carrier services; there\u2019s no information about clients on its website.\n\nThe company is led by Musbahu Muhammad Bashir, the chairman of the Althani Group, an Abuja-based holdco that oversees a group of companies, including Eman Homes & Estate, Althani Investment Limited, Salam Takaful Insurance, and Mafab Communications.\n\nDeployment Phase\n\nAfter payment of the licence fee, the next phase for the bid winners is to deploy the 5G network service across Nigeria. According to the Information Memorandum of the 3.5GHz spectrum licence, the licencees have a rollout obligation plan spanning a period of 10 years, beginning from the date the license is award. Between the first and second year of the licence, the operators are expected to roll out the service in, at least, one state in each geo-political zone.\n\nFrom the third to fifth year, they are obligated to cover all the zones. Between 6 to 10 years, they should cover all the states in the country, according to guidelines set out in the Information Memorandum.\n\nRight of Way and energy costs\n\nAt the deployment phase, the two operators will have to deal with the Right of Way (RoW) fees of different Nigerian states. In 2020, the Nigerian government tried to get different states to reduce their RoW charges for fibre cables and adopt the agreed \u20a6145 per linear metre signed by the National Executive Council.\n\nBut only 7 states agreed to this while 29 states stuck to their guns\u2014states like Benue, Ogun and Lagos charge \u20a62,500, \u20a64,000, \u20a6750 per linear metre. The argument of the 29 states is that RoW is a source of revenue for their governments, but the big picture is that if any of these states reduce the fees, they may attract significant broadband investment from telcos.\n\nTelecom operators also have to contend with the heavy power demand of the 5G network infrastructure. Due to Nigeria\u2019s insufficient power system, telecom operators in the country have to generate and distribute the power they use.\n\nThese are some of the obstacles MTN and Mafab will have to surmount along the journey to deploying 5G network in Nigeria.\n\nWhy 5G matters\n\nThe advent of 5G comes with significant advantages, one of which is higher bandwidths. This translates to the ability to transfer large volumes of data at extremely high speed and very low latency. Simply put, 5G is faster than previous generations of mobile networks. It can, for instance, transfer data at 10 gigabits per second\u2014up to 100 times faster than 4G.\n\nThe increase in data transmission speed is important because new technologies and revolutionary innovations such as driverless cars and remote classrooms require faster connectivity and reduced latency to function optimally.\n\n5G networks are expected to make an estimated contribution of $13.2 trillion in economic value globally according to a recent WEF report. It\u2019s also expected to generate 22.3 million jobs from direct network investments and residual services.\n\nThe race to deploy 5G in Nigeria is still on, as MTN and Mafab head into the deployment phase.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Meet the 19 year old Nigerian building his own blockchain empire",
          "text": "After Njoku Emmanuel\u2019s father seized his laptop for \u201ccoding too much\u201d and not facing his studies, he dropped out of school to focus on coding. 3 years later, he has become one of the best blockchain engineers of his generation, travelled the world, and now runs his own startup Lazerpay, a crypto payment gateway.\n\nNjoku\u2019s greeting was casual, like his outfit\u2014a black round-neck t-shirt on jeans. His boisterous laugh set a natural mood for what would become a long but interesting conversation. It was a busy day in Lagos, and the murmuring voices around him indicated he was joining the video call from his office. The walls behind him had \u201cLazerpay\u201d and some motivational quotes written all over them.\n\n\u201cSorry for the noise, bro,\u201d Njoku said, running his fingers through his locks. \u201cIt\u2019s a busy week. We are going out of beta sometime next week, so all hands on deck!\u201d\n\nTo avoid internet fluctuation, we switched off our cameras and dived into our conversation.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLazerpay, a crypto payment gateway startup Njoku co-founded with Abdulfatai Suleiman and Prosper Ubi, was launched in October, and the reception has been massive. During its beta phase, the crypto startup has been endorsed by several tech and blockchain enthusiasts as a necessary innovation needed to accelerate crypto adoption in Africa. But what is even more remarkable about Lazerpay is Njoku, its 19-year-old CEO, who seemed to have emerged from nowhere to become one of the most sought-after young tech darlings in Africa.\n\nExcept he wasn\u2019t a sudden emergence.\n\nThe Njoku we see today is a product of a seed planted about 7 years ago in Port Harcourt, the biggest city in the South-South region of Nigeria. In 2015, at 13, Njoku and his brothers were casually introduced to computer programming by their aunt, who was a robotic engineer. Since then, Njoku chose to write code and never looked back.\n\nThe lofty dream that followed was wanting to build an operating system like Bill Gates had, or a social media platform like Mark Zukerberg did. He wanted to be the African Mark Zukerberg and told everybody that cared to listen so, including his mother who wouldn\u2019t stop jesting him for it. Njoku began to ask questions and pored through every content on computer programming he came across.\n\nBorn to an engineer father and a school teacher mother, Njoku was a mathematics whiz. He represented his school in the mathematics olympiad, won several medals, and lost a few. When his mates had a single mathematics textbook that had different topics like geometry, permutation and combination, and more, Njoku had a different textbook for each topic\u2014each textbook as big as the all-encompassing ones.\n\n\u201cMy father forbade us from using a calculator to solve our mathematics homework. Every computation had to be done with your head\u2014why else do you have a head?\u201d Njoku said. With this, his problem-solving skill was already top-notch; little wonder he was quick to embrace programming.\n\nBecause gaming was one of his favourite activities\u2014having played video games with his siblings\u2014at the time, he began to learn game development and started using C++ to build games. In 2017, he wrote his final secondary school exams and cleared all his papers, with A+ in mathematics and further mathematics.\n\nSurprisingly, his next challenge will be finishing University.\n\n\u201cUniversity was a waste of my time\u201d\n\nLike most Nigerian parents, Njoku\u2019s parents wanted him to become a medical doctor\u2014his older brother was already studying medicine. But Njoku had chosen his own path, one he wouldn\u2019t let go of for the world.\n\nHe got admission to study electrical engineering at Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) in 2018. This, his engineer father could live with.\n\nNjoku during one of Lazerpay early ideation sessions in Dubai\n\nIn the same year, he joined Quiva Games, a gaming company based in Enugu, as an intern. Everything was going okay; his plate was full\u2014a tasking engineering course and a job where he could build his coding skill. But, after a few classes in his first year, he realised engineering wasn\u2019t as tasking as he had anticipated.\n\n\u201cI thought everything would be advanced, but it was people packed into a small hall to learn social sciences and general studies. I was like \u2018What the hell is going on here?\u2019 And the maths they were teaching at 100 level was like my JSS 3/SS 1 maths. So, it became a waste of my time.\u201d\n\nHe knew he wasn\u2019t going to do this for another 5 years, so he became laser-focused on coding. \u201cAny time I was going to school, I was going to charge my laptop and code. I didn\u2019t tell my parents. When they gave me money to buy textbooks, I used it to buy coding courses on Udemy.\u201d\n\nHis father somehow found out he has been missing classes and invited him home. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was a trick to seize my laptop. I went back to school and had to borrow laptop to finish some projects at hand and keep learning.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 was a blessing in disguise\n\nWhen COVID-19 hit in 2020 and everywhere was locked down, everybody panicked and scared, Njoku was somewhat happy; he\u2019d be away from school without getting into trouble. So, he upped his game and started coding 12 hours a day. He didn\u2019t want to go back to school, and the only thing he had was to learn as fast as he could and get a remote job.\n\nIn March 2020, he got a job as a mobile application developer at Kwivar, a buy-now-pay-later company based in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cThe salary was \u20a670,000. When I got it, nobody could talk to me. I was the biggest boy I knew. My parents couldn\u2019t believe you could get a job during the pandemic when companies were laying people off. Though the salary isn\u2019t enough reason to not study medicine, they finally saw what I had seen since 2015.\u201d\n\nIntroduction to the blockchain\n\nBefore the pandemic, Njoku had already started learning about blockchain. He\u2019d taken Udemy courses on blockchain and had entered the finals of a hackathon project that would be held in Lagos in 2019\u2014the first time he\u2019d ever be in Lagos.\n\n2019 was Njoku\u2019s first time in Lagos: Njoku and other participants at the hackathon.\n\nIn April 2020, a month after he started working at Kwivar, he got another offer as a blockchain developer at Project Hydro, a blockchain company based in the British Virgin Islands. He would be paid $700 monthly in Hydro tokens. At this point, he knew he wasn\u2019t going back to school; everything happening to him agreed with that decision.\n\nFast forward to September 2020, he wanted to leave Kwivar and needed something to replace it. So, he reached out to Ugochukwu Aronu, the co-founder of Xend, the parent company of Quiva Games where he\u2019d interned for 5 months, to check if there was an opening. After sharing what he\u2019d done at Project Hydro\u2014decentralised wallet, snowflake infrastructure for decentralised identity\u2014Aronu invited him to come to Enugu and join his new venture Xend Finance, a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform for credit unions, cooperatives, and individuals, backed by Google and Binance.\n\nAt the time, the pandemic was already easing up, and students had started going back to school. So, Njoku told his father he was going back to school. Aronu made him an offer\u2014\u20a6150,000 net salary, a MacBook, and free accommodation.\n\nThe days at Xend Finance: Njoku and Emeka Nweke, the lead blockchain engineer who taught him how to deploy complex smart contracts\n\n\u201cI went to Port Harcourt to show my parents the offer and told them I was dropping out of school. It was obvious they couldn\u2019t do anything about it. Going back to school just to graduate and earn about half or as much as I was already earning wasn\u2019t wise,\u201d Njoku said.\n\nIt was at this point that his parents knew and accepted Njoku\u2019s crazy idea to drop out. At Xend Finance, he had to step in when the lead blockchain engineer was unavailable, and that accelerated his blockchain knowledge. Despite the close call\u2014since they\u2019d already scheduled to launch by December 2020\u2014he led the build but not without a hiccup.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I had to take charge of an entire project in the middle of building. I fixed the bug, wrote, and deployed smart contracts. But I made a deployment error that cost the company $10,000.\u201d So Aronu told him the money he lost would be deducted from his salary. At that point his salary had jumped to \u20a6300,000. He panicked and started applying to international jobs\u2014at least those ones could pay him enough money to service the debt.\n\nHe would later find out Aronu was only joking, but by then he had gotten an offer from MakerDAO, one of the biggest DeFi companies in the world. He was the first Nigerian engineer on the team. As usual, he went home to show his parents his new offer and his mother couldn\u2019t believe her dropout son could earn over $3,000 per month. But that was the beginning.\n\nAfter MakerDAO, the offers wouldn\u2019t stop coming. He got a contract offer from Instadapp, a DeFi protocol company, for $90 per hour. \u201cI was like, these people don\u2019t know me: I\u2019ll work 20 hours per day!\u201d\n\nHe resigned from Xend Finance and was ready to make his mark on the global blockchain ecosystem. He relocated to Dubai.\n\nDubai was his passport to the world\n\nMakerDAO was having an offsite meetup in Portugal and Njoku was supposed to go, but his visa wasn\u2019t approved on time. He was frustrated, so his aunt, the robotic engineer, advised him to try applying to travel to Europe from Ghana or anywhere outside Nigeria. \u201cShe also suggested Dubai, and I took it. After staying in Dubai for a month, I told her I\u2019m not coming back home.\u201d\n\nIn Dubai, more job opportunities came. He was on top of the world; he could now reject offers and travel the world. For an 18-year-old boy, there was enough money in the bank so he told his father to leave his brother\u2019s medical school\u2019s tuition to him. \u201cMy brother is in Bulgaria, so imagine earning in naira and paying tuition in euro. So it\u2019s only right I took that off my father\u2019s plate.\u201d\n\nHe got a contract offer of $3,000 per week from Avarta, a blockchain security company based in Singapore. He joined them and built their entire blockchain infrastructure.\n\nNjoku and Suleiman, co-founder and CTO at Lazerpay, in Dubai\n\nThen he met Yele Bademosi, founder and CEO at Nestcoin, who would later become one of Lazerpay\u2019s early investors. Bademosi then became Njoku\u2019s mentor, so when he wanted to start Nestcoin, Njoku was one of the first engineers he reached out to. It was around this time that the idea to build Lazerpay began to form.\n\nNjoku dropped everything to focus on Lazerpay. Avarta reached out with a full-time offer of $7,000 per month and $50,000 worth of Avarta token, but he rejected it. They came back with another offer of $15,000 per month, but Njoku was running with his new vision now. Before, the vision was to become a great engineer, but now it\u2019s to become a great founder.\n\nSo Njoku forfeited everything. He left MakerDAO in December 2021 and his Maker token that was worth over $200,000 and would have vested this February. He rejected a salary package worth over $300,000 from Avarta. All because he believed Lazerpay is the future of payment and will be worth much more than everything he\u2019s given up. And also because he was already raising funds and had to put his skin in the game.\n\nHe knew what he wanted from a young age and stood by it. His steadfastness has turned everybody around him into a believer; his parents have now begun nudging his youngest sibling to study software engineering.\n\nNjoku isn\u2019t Zukerberg and may never be, but he\u2019s building his own empire in the blockchain world. At 19, this can only be the beginning of his journey.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Last month, Polygon raised $450 million, to expand its portfolio of ethereum scaling solutions and footprints in the developer ecosystem. Ethereum is a blockchain that has attracted developers across the world, but its slow speed and high transaction costs (gas fees) have made many developers reluctant to use it.\n\nPolygon, a side chain firm attached to ethereum, is improving the functionality of the ethereum blockchain by improving transaction speed and cost. While Polygon\u2019s ultimate goal, at least for now, is to scale ethereum, it is processing more transactions than ethereum\u2019s main chain, mostly because of its $1 gas fee cost. As of today, it has processed 3.4 billion transactions and last month claims its 3 million transactions per day volume is double that of ethereum.\n\nOver the past few years, Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, has grown to host over 7,000 decentralised applications, including metaverse projects like Decentraland and Sandbox; popular NFT marketplace OpenSea; and DeFi projects such as Aave, Curve, Pool, Uniswap, etc.\n\nSandeep Nailwal, Polygon co-founder has said that its $450 million funding is to help Polygon build larger developer ecosystems in several markets. At the forefront of this expansion strategy is Nigeria\u2019s Shodipo Ayomide, Polygon\u2019s new Global Head of Developer Advocacy.\n\nBefore Polygon, Ayomide had previously worked with Nigerian tech publication TechPoint as a software engineer, VanHack as a developer advocate, and Stack Overflow also as a developer advocate. Ayomide had rejected multiple managerial and director-level positions to accept his offer at Polygon because he believes \u201cit is the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t focused on money or passion, but what excites me is a place I am building something that a billion people are using or is impacting a billion people around the globe. It means I am part of something huge and something bigger than myself.\u201d\n\nAyomide will be working with various teams like the hackathon, community, content team, and an engineering and open-source team, to create written and video content, organise meetups and establish relationships in the Web3 ecosystem of cities across the world.\n\nOne of the developer ecosystem expansion strategies is to establish Polygon Guilds, a structure that will help educate \u201cWeb2 developers\u201d and onboard them to Web3. This guild model will adopt a similar approach to Google Developer Group, a small meetup across different locations where people can learn about Google technologies.\n\nPolygon Guilds are in over 19 cities, a large number of them are in Africa\u2014Lagos, Abuja, Delta, Warri, Port Harcourt, Nairobi, and Mombasa. Polygon is also expanding its presence in France, India, the Netherlands, and the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, Polygon created the Polygon Academy, which intends to be a comprehensive guide for anybody that wants to understand Web3. This academy consists of eight modules and learners will earn an NFT when they complete them.\n\nThe end game of Polygon, Naiwal also said, is to become the AWS of Web3, and if Web3 is going to be as big as investors are saying it would be, its recent efforts will no doubt be a win for African developers.\n\nShare this article",

One of two methods are available to deactivate all plugins.\n\nUse phpMyAdmin to deactivate all plugins.\n\nIn the table wp_options, under the option_name column (field) find the active_plugins row Change the option_value field to: a:0:{}\n\nOr reset your plugins folder via FTP or the file manager provided in your host\u2019s control panel. This method preserves plugin options but requires plugins be manually reactivated.\n\nVia FTP or your host\u2019s file manager, navigate to the wp-contents folder (directory) Via FTP or your host\u2019s file manager, rename the folder \u201cplugins\u201d to \u201cplugins.hold\u201d Login to your WordPress administration plugins page (/wp-admin/plugins.php) \u2013 this will disable any plugin that is \u201cmissing\u201d. Via FTP or your host\u2019s file manager, rename \u201cplugins.hold\u201d back to \u201cplugins\u201d\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow to clear the \u201cBriefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance\u201d message after doing automatic upgrade? # How to clear the \u201cBriefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance\u201d message after doing automatic upgrade?\n\nAs part of the automatic upgrade WordPress places a file named .maintenance in the blog base folder (folder that contains the wp-admin folder). If that file exists, then vistors will see the message Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. Check back in a minute.\n\nTo stop that message from being displayed to vistors, just delete the .maintenance file. The automatic upgrade should be executed again, just in case it failed.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhen an update is released, notification of that release is displayed at the top administration screens saying WordPress x.x.x is available! Please update now. Not every blog will see that message at the same time. Your blog is programmed to check for updates every 12 hours, but the timing of that check is purely random. So if your blog just checked for updates minutes before an update was released, you won\u2019t see the update message until your blog checks for updates 12 hours later.\n\nIf you want your blog to check right now for updates, you can delete the update_core option name record in your wp_options table. Note that plugins and themes each have their own check and update cycle, controlled by the records update_plugins and update_themes, in wp_options.\n\nRelevant discussion thread:\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhy did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade? # Why did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade?\n\nA core upgrade copies all the new files from the distribution over the old ones, so if you changed existing files in the WordPress default theme (e.g. wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/style.css), those changes got overwritten with the new version of that file.\n\nPlease note, a core upgrade goes through a list of \u201cold files\u201d, as defined in wp-admin/includes/update-core.php, and deletes those files. Any files not on the list, and not in the distribution, are preserved.\n\nRemember, that before upgrades, whether automatic or manual, both the WordPress Files and database should be backed-up as explained in WordPress Backups.\n\nA better way to modify the default theme is by using a child theme. It\u2019s a little more work to set up, but worth the effort because your customizations will be safe when the main theme is updated.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do you repair a MySQL database table? # How do you repair a MySQL database table?\n\nEvery once in a while, it may be necessary to repair one or more MySQL database tables. According to the How to Repair MyISAM Tables at dev.mysql.com there are a number of reasons to repair a table including errors such as \u201ctbl_name.frm is locked against change\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t find file tbl_name.MYI (Errcode: nnn)\u201d, \u201cUnexpected end of file\u201d, \u201cRecord file is crashed\u201d, or \u201cGot error nnn from table handler\u201d.\n\nHere are the steps to repair a table in a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin:\n\nLogin to hosting account. Login to phpMyAdmin. Choose the affected database. If you only have one database, it should choose it by default so you don\u2019t need to do anything. In the main panel, you should see a list of your database tables. Check the boxes by the tables that need repair. At the bottom of the window just below the list of tables, there is a drop down menu. Choose \u201cRepair Table\u201d\n\nRemember, that it is advisable to have a current backup of your database at all times. See also WordPress Backups\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do I empty a database table? # How do I empty a database table?\n\nRefer Emptying a Database Table\n\nTop \u2191\n\nEmailed passwords are not being received # Emailed passwords are not being received\n\nDescription: When users try to register with your blog or change their passwords by entering their username and/or email, WordPress indicates that their password has been emailed to them, but it is never received.\n\nReason and Solutions: WordPress uses the standard PHP mail() function, which uses sendmail. No account information is needed. This is not generally a problem if you are using a hosting service, but if you are using your own box and do not have an SMTP server, the mail will never send. If you are using a *NIX box, you should have either postfix or sendmail on your machine; you will just need to set them up (search the Internet for how-to\u2019s). If you do not want to go through setting up a complete mail server on your *NIX box you may find msmtp useful \u2014 it provides \u201cA secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail hub\u201d. On a Windows machine, try a sendmail emulator like Glob SendMail.\n\nMore help can be found on this thread of the WordPress Support Forums: https://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=24981.\n\nWindows Host Server Specific: Check your \u201cRelay\u201d settings on the SMTP Virtual Server. Grant access to 127.0.0.1 . Then in your php.inifile, set the SMTP setting to the same IP address. Also set smtp_port to 25 .\n\nEnsure Proper Return Address is Used: By default, the WordPress mailer fills in the From: field with wordpress@yourdomain.com and the From: name as WordPress.\n\nThis is fine if this is a valid e-mail address. For example, if your real e-mail is wordpress@yourdomain.com, your host should pass the email on for delivery. It will probably send your mail as long as yourdomain.com is setup to send and receive mail, even if wordpress is not a valid mail box. But if you set you real email as the From: address and it\u2019s something like wpgod@gmail.com, the mail may not send because gmail.com is not a domain handled by the mail server.\n\nTreated as Spam: Your email message may have been routed to a spam folder or even worse, simply discarded as malicious. There are a couple measures you can use to convince recipient\u2019s mail servers that your message is legitimate and should be delivered as addressed.\n\nSPF: (Sender Policy Framework) This is the most common anti-spam measure used. If you are on a hosted system, there is a good chance your host has set this up for the mail server you are using. Have WordPress email you and check the message headers for evidence that the message passed the SPF check. You can get a message sent by following the Forgot Password link on the login page. To keep your old password, do not follow the link in the message.\n\nIf your system email failed the SPF check, you can set up the credentials if you have access to your DNS records and your mail server\u2019s domain belongs to you. Check the return path of the email your system sent. If the mail server listed there has your domain name, you can set up SPF credentials. There are several how-tos on the Internet.\n\nDKIM: (Domain Key Identified Mail) This system is also used. You can use both SPF and DKIM in the same message. Again, just as with SPF, you can check if your receiving mailserver verified your host\u2019s domain key by examining the mail header. There is a fair chance no signature key was provided, indicating your host chose to not use this protocol. Also as with SPF, if you can edit your DNS records and the mail server belongs to your domain, you can set up DKIM credentials yourself. Some how-tos exist if you search the Internet.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhy can\u2019t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria? # Why can\u2019t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria?\n\nClearing your browser cache and cookies may resolve this problem. See also I Make Changes and Nothing Happens\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem? # How do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem?\n\nDescription: You get a warning message on your browser that says:\n\nWarning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at\n\nReason and Solution:\n\nIt is usually because there are spaces, new lines, or other stuff before an opening <?php tag or after a closing ?> tag, typically in wp-config.php. This could be true about some other file too, so please check the error message, as it will list the specific file name where the error occurred (see \u201cInterpreting the Error Message\u201d below). Replacing the faulty file with one from your most recent backup or one from a fresh WordPress download is your best bet, but if neither of those are an option, please follow the steps below.\n\nJust because you cannot see anything does not mean that PHP sees the same.\n\nDownload the file mentioned in the error message via FTP or the file manager provided in your host\u2019s control panel. Open that file in a plain text editor (NOT Microsoft Word or similar. Notepad or BBEdit are fine). Check that the very first characters are with no blank lines or spaces after it. Before saving, or use the Save as dialog, ensure the file encoding is not UTF-8 BOM but plain UTF-8 or any without the BOM suffix.\n\nTo be sure about the end of the file, do this:\n\nPlace the cursor between the ? and > Now press the DELETE key on your computer Note to MAC users: The \u201cDELETE\u201d key on a PC deletes characters to the right of the cursor. That is the key noted here. Keep that key pressed For at least 15 seconds Now type > and save without pressing any other key at all. If you press another key, you will bring the problem back. DO NOT PUT CODE IN UNNECESSARY CODE BLOCKS, PUT THEM IN A SINGLE PHP BLOCK.\n\nWrong:\n\n<?php some code; ?> <?php some other codes; ?>\n\nCorrect:\n\n<?php code; some other code; ?>\n\nUpload the file back to your server after editing and saving the file.\n\nNote: Also check the encoding of the file. If the file is encoded as UTF-8 with BOM, the BOM is seen as a character which starts the output.\n\nInterpreting the Error Message:\n\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/blog/wp-config.php:34) in /path/blog/wp-login.php on line 42 , then the problem is at line #34 of wp-config.php , not line #42 of wp-login.php . In this scenario, line #42 of wp-login.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #34 of wp-config.php .\n\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/wp-admin/admin-header.php:8) in /path/wp-admin/post.php on line 569 , then the problem is at line #8 of admin-header.php , not line #569 of post.php . In this scenario, line #569 of post.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #8 of admin-header.php .\n\nTop \u2191\n\nTo resolve this and similar issues, disable your plugins one at a time until you find the source of the issue. Generally, this will be due to two or more plugins trying to use the same resources (for example, JQuery or other Java-based tools).\n\nIn addition, it could be that there is a problem with your browser. A common resolution is to empty the browser\u2019s cache. Please consult the documentation for your preferred browser to learn how to do this.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nIf an error 404 occurs when using the Pretty Permalink choices such as Day and Name in Administration > Settings > Settings_Permalinks_Screen it could be a result of the mod_rewrite module not being activated/installed. The solution is to activate mod_rewrite for the Apache web-server. Check the apache\\conf\\httpd.conf file for the line # LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so\n\nand delete the # in front of the line. Then stop Apache and start it again. Note: you may have to ask your host to activate mod_rewrite.\n\nSee also Using Permalinks.

Then you can quickly have diagnosis, and if it is lassa fever you will be treated.

This year is much better than previous years. We are better prepared for the outbreak this time. We have more Personal Protectiveness Equipments. We have more ventilators, more dialysis machines, oxygens, monitors that help us to manage these patients.\n\n\u201cFew days ago I received oxygen plant from the federal government. It is going to help us produce oxygen three times more than our previous capacity\u201d, he said.\n\nOn preventive measures, he said: \u201cLassa fever is real. There are measures to take to prevent the infection. Avoid contact with rats as much as possible. Make sure that the holes where rats enter your houses are blocked.\n\n\u201d Make sure you don\u2019t keep refuses around your houses because the rats will come to those refuses, and then enter your house. Make sure foods are well protected, and when you want to eat left over food boil or reheat the food.

          "title": "Nigeria should be restructured before 2023 election \u2013 Elliot Uko",
          "text": "By Obinna Ezugwu\n\nEvangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, founder of Igbo Youth Movement ( IYM) and Secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), has insisted that Nigeria should be restructured before 2023 election, as according to him, it\u2019s the only way to salvage it and not another election.\n\nEvangelist Uko who gave the advice in a statement on Wednesday, noted that it was regrettable that many have forgotten about restructuring, as all the agitations are now focused on power shift, while noting that power shift alone cannot resolve the contending issues of the Nigerian federation.\n\n\u201cThe political class, clearly excited and overjoyed at the great opportunity power shift ushers, are all presently grinning from ear to ear, over the mood of the country, the subtle agreement by powerful and influential members of the international community and the leadership of the land, that the Presidential seat should move away from the North, at this time,\u201d Uko said.\n\n\u201cThe need to restore sanity in the land, the imperative of weakening the uncontrolled agitation and the inevitable reality that the Government is clearly overwhelmed by the raging inferno in the land, regrettably and unwittingly enabled and fanned by avoidable high handedness, nauseating nepotism, glaring mediocrity and bad governance, coupled with application of wrong strategy in handling the agitation, all influenced the power shift decision.\n\n\u201cErroneous tacit support of the horrific brigandage of a favoured nomadic herdsmen, who in their blind attempt to intimidate and subdue aborigines all over the country, unleashed indescribable terror in the country, convincing all that their land grabbing gambit, has powerful backing, further setting the country on the road to Armmegedon, also made it imperative for certain concessions to be made, if the land would be healed.\u201d\n\nHe warned politicians intending to play politics as usual to understand that things have changed, and they must now shun greed and face the truth about the country.\n\n\u201cProfessional politicians, who are also well-known opportunists and grand exploiters, are now jumping into the fray with their own ideas of power shift. Greed, hubris and conspiracy reign,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOpportunists, exploiters and political hustlers of all shades, are now crawling out of their crevices, hibernation and graves like gouls, finally finding their voices and jostling to take advantage of power shift designed to heal the land, enthrone some kind of fairness and restore faith in the country. And now, everybody wants to be President.\n\n\u201cThese professional power mongers and specialist opportunists who do not appreciate the real reason power shift became inevitable nor do they care a hoot about how it came about, are about to make a mess of eating boiled eggs, as usual.\n\n\u201cDesperate to exploit and hijack the zoning of the Presidential seat southward, these politicos are warming up to display once again their famed self-centered attitude that defined our political space and fortunes as a people for so long. Greed and hubris is clearly powering their decisions and conspiracies. Non is giving thought to the real issues that made this power shift possible.\n\n\u201cNon of them regrettably, care about the real reason power shift became inevitable.\n\n\u201cWere precious lives lost in the agitation that gave impetus to the inevitability of this power shift? Will power shift ordinarily bring resolution and closure to the agitation? Are those angling and jostling to run for President equipped with the neccesary grit, knowledge and wisdom to heal the land at this time? Does power shift mean automatic end to agitations?\u201d he inquired.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe decision to yield to power shift at this time, though very commendable and trite, cannot be substituted for the inevitable reconstruction of the polity along true federalism and devolution of powers.\n\n\u201cPower shift is neccesary and healthy because it is wrong to concentrate Presidential power to one particular region as if others are eternal spectators or second class citizens, but it will be suicidal to pretend that power shift automatically resolves structural deficiencies and inadequacies that gave birth to over 90% of the political, social and economic issues troubling the country today.\n\n\u201cThe current excitement amongst the political class should be urgently traded for soberness and deep reflection on how to genuinely revert to a functional structure that will move the country forward and restore trust and confidence in the system, thereby genuinely healing the land.\n\n\u201cGreed for central power and hubris will most definitely lead to unnecessary errors and mistakes that may lead to untoward consequences.\n\n\u201cConspiracy to outwit, blackmailed and isolate others will lead to unfilled gaps that may eventually bring up unfavourable developments.\n\n\u201cUngoing unholy conspiracies, greed for central power and unbridled arrogance being displayed by politicos who did not in any way contribute to the pressure that made power shift possible, might cost my region and the entire country the most of this golden opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe may wish to remind ourselves that the need and cry for justice, equity, sense of belonging, fairness and level playing field for all, inspired the now-agreed power shift. That lack or absence of equal opportunities and fair treatment for all, resulting to disaffection and loss of faith, led to bitterness and agitations.\n\n\u201cThat the unjust unitary structure deliberately skewed against certain people and region, provided ammunition powering lack of interest in the system and then, agitations.\n\n\u201cThat the brutal and unkind response and erroneous strategy of containment applied by the authorities, only deepened and convoluted the crisis to the point that the land began to hemorrhage, resulting to economic paralysis and sparks of violence leading to killings, arson and shutdowns.\n\n\u201cThat the now-disappeared brutal brigandage of ruthless armed herdsmen, contributed greatly to the apprehension and fears that led to the emergence of armed militias all over the land, that stole peace away from the land, creating sharp divisions and deepening the crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is also important for all to remember that the cry for a restructuring of the country has been on for decades. The refusal to restructure the country before now, created over half of our problems.\n\n\u201cThat the Patriots, NADECO, eminent citizens, Afenifere and other regional bodies have been consistent in their plea for a peaceful and consensual reorganisation of the country\u2019s unkind and unhealthy unitary structure foisted on the country by military regimes. That this unresolved structural issues will not be resolved by power shift. That from the Aburi accord, the Abacha political conference, the Obasanjo National Conference, to the Jonathan CONFAB, the nation has been yearning for a holistic and wholesome reconstruction to true federalism and devolution of power, consensually agreed in order to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cThat the consensual restructuring of the country would enthrone stability, peace and harmony, giving every section a sense of belonging, granting political progress and economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe understanding that the task ahead is grave and delicate would help remove self-centered excitement that breeds conspiracy of power, greed and hubris. May this opportunity not be mishandled as usual.\n\n\u201cBy allowing greed for power, arrogance and conspiracies to becloud our senses and make the mistake of forgetting the onerous and sensitive task ahead in rejuvenating and rebuilding our country, we may be bungling this unique opportunity.\u201d",

We know their antics and we can only remind them that only God has the capacity to enthrone and to dethrone. We were all alive in 2018 when despite at the precipice of victory, the PDP by a strange twist of fate, ended up losing the election. This reminds us that no matter what we do as individuals, the final verdict on our ambitions will still come from God.\u201d\n\nHe l condoled with the family of the party members who lost their lives in Iwo during the congress.\n\n\u201cI commiserate with the families of those young men who were killed in the course of the violence that erupted in Iwo, Ife, Ipetumodu and parts of Osogbo and I condemn these violent acts in very strong terms. Nobody has to die for anybody\u2019s ambition. Nobody deserves to lose their lives for the actualization of another person\u2019s desires. While I pray that God grants the families of those slain the fortitude to bear the loss, I also call on Law enforcement Agencies to expedite actions in bringing the perpetrators to book,\u201d he said.",

And as the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has said, too much analysis can lead to paralysis.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSo, governance should be a combination of intellectuals and people that are experienced in governance.

We need a combination of experienced people and the academia who identify the needs of the society.\n\n\u201cMr President is of the view that the more experience we have, the more people can get it better,\u201d Gambari said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, said people often see politics as a dirty game but added that it is not.\n\n\u201cPolitics is not a dirty game,\u201d Ganduje said while encouraging intellectuals to join politics.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing intellectualism in governance and intellectualism in politics. There is no doubt, this is a welcome development.\n\nIt is good for intellectuals to take a role in politics because they analise and lead the people because there are always conflicting variables,\u201d Ganduje said of Fayemi.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, intellectuals are afraid of governance because they see politics as a dirty game. But Politics is not a dirty game. There is a connection between intellectualism and governance,\u201dGanduje said.\n\nThe keynote speaker who is a Senior Programme Staff, South Asia Institute, Prof Adebayo Olukoshi, said Africa has not found the right leadership but added that the people must be determined to have a Singapore, Brazil and become big players in the international system.\n\n\u201cDigging a bit deeper, if we must transform a nation, we must look at dignity. While character can change a nation, it is dignity that transforms a nation. China is a good example,\u201d he said.",

They should, however, ensure that they do all the needful to validate all their resident documents for ease of return to the country when desired.\n\n\u201cStudents seeking temporary relocation are enjoined to seek proper clearance and guarantee form from their respective institutions during this period.\n\n\u201cFor those who are still considering it appropriate to remain in the country, be rest assured that the embassy remains open for its consular duties and responsibilities at all times.\u201d\n\nReps intervene\n\nEarlier in its invention, the House of Representatives had called for the immediate evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine.\n\nThe lawmakers feared many Nigerian students in Ukraine could be caught in the crossfire.\n\nThe call came Thursday following motion of Urgent Importance to evacuate Nigerian students in Ukraine, presented by Ahmed Munir, who solicited for urgent intervention of the House.\n\nAlso in its resolution, the House mandated the majority leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa and chairman, House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Buba Yakub, to liaise with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Nigeria Intelligence Agency (NIA) with the view to airlifting the Students back to Nigeria without further delay.\n\n\n\nThe House also mandated the Majority Leader and his team to travel to Ukraine Friday and come back with as many Nigerian students as possible by Monday.\n\n\n\nThe House in addition, noted that if nothing was achieved with the arrangement, then it would work with the local airline, Air Peace, to see how the students can be evacuated in a way and manner that would be devoid of any further delay.\n\n\n\nThe committees on Foreign Affairs and Diaspora has been mandated in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ascertain the exact figures of Nigerians affected by this conflict and put in place comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and mechanism.\n\nSpecifically, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila agreed with a lawmaker, Leke Abejide, to interact with the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema to evacuate Nigerians from Ukraine by Monday, February 28.\n\nHowever, some lawmakers feared it may be too late, saying the evacuation ought to have been done long ago.\n\nOhanaeze urges action\n\nMeanwhile, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide Thursday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently rescue indigenes of the country trapped in Ukraine.\n\nA statement by the President General of the group, Okechukwu Isiguzoro said Nigerians in Ukraine who are mainly students and those in medical tourism were stranded.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, as a result of the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine and subsequent Russian military invasion in Ukraine, to facilitate the evacuation exercise of over 3,500 Nigerians mainly Igbo, who are stranded in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cFrom the reports available to us through the Ohanaeze Ukraine chapter and Nigerian community leadership, there are lots of Nigerians, especially students, medical tourists, and others who are trapped, stranded in Ukraine and deserve to be evacuated from the crisis-ridden country before the war escalates.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should take responsibility for their safety and security and evacuate them immediately.\n\n\u201cNigerian Government should establish contact with her Foreign Mission and Embassy in Kyiv to facilitate the process of making it easier for the evacuation exercise of Nigerians from Ukraine back to Nigeria, as attempts to reach out to the Nigeria Diaspora Commission office is yet to yield adequate results, as Federal Government invention is needed now.\u201d\n\nPoland, Hungary, Slovakia\n\nAnd in what looks like a succour, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia are making preparations to receive Ukranians fleeing Ukraine as a result of Russia\u2019s attack on their country, Reuters reported.\n\nWhile Poland is setting up reception points on its border, Hungary and Slovakia are planning to send troops to manage the likely influx.\n\nThe countries on the European Union\u2019s eastern flank were all part of the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact and are now members of NATO. Among them, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania all share land borders with Ukraine.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine amidst calls for dialogue and diplomacy. According to Reuters, it is the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two confirming the West\u2019s worst fears. It prompted fears of a massive flood of refugees fleeing Ukraine, a nation of 44 million people.\n\nPoland called for the \u201cfiercest possible sanctions\u201d against Russia and the Czech foreign minister called the invasion a \u201cbarbaric act of aggression\u201d.\n\nHungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, despite good ties with Russia, condemned Moscow\u2019s actions. He said Hungary would prepare humanitarian aid for Ukraine and was ready to receive refugees.\n\nUkrainians started trickling into Poland, with dozens arriving at the normally quiet Medyka crossing on Thursday, some carrying luggage and accompanied by children.\n\nPolish hospitals were preparing beds for wounded Ukrainians, the health ministry said, and the Polish army raised the level of preparedness of some units.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything to ensure that every person who enters the territory of Poland has access to healthcare, including hospitalisation,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nPoland said it would set up reception points for refugees on its borders, PAP news agency quoted Polish Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Pawel Szefernaker as saying.\n\nSmall groups of people also fled into Hungary on Thursday through the Beregsurany crossing, some coming from as far as Kyiv, a Reuters witness said.

Ukraine defeated that evil and will defeat this one.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: EU Leaders Agree \u2018Maximum Impact\u2019 Sanctions On Russia\n\nAt least 137 \u201cheroes\u201d were killed during the first day of fighting, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday, as he called up conscripts and reservists nationwide to fight in a general mobilisation.\n\nZelensky said there was now a \u201cnew iron curtain\u201d between Russia and the rest of the world, like in the Cold War, adding in a later speech his nation had been \u201cleft alone\u201d.\n\n\u201cWho is ready to fight alongside us? I don\u2019t see anyone.\u201d\n\nAnd while the United States moved to impose sanctions on Russian elites and banks, it stressed that American forces would not head to eastern Europe to fight in Ukraine.\n\nNATO said it had activated \u201cdefence plans\u201d for allied countries.\n\nBut NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said there was no plan to send alliance forces into Ukraine.\n\n\u2018War on Europe\u2019\n\nAmong the highest-profile strategic developments on Thursday, Ukraine said Russian forces had seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant \u2014 prompting concern from international nuclear watchdogs.\n\nZelensky called the attack on Chernobyl \u201ca declaration of war on all of Europe\u201d while 18 people were killed at a military base near the Black Sea port of Odessa in the deadliest single strike reported by Kyiv.\n\nWitnesses also told AFP that Russian paratroopers wrested control of the strategic Gostomel airfield, on the northwestern outskirts of Kyiv.\n\n\u201cThe helicopters came in and then the battles started. They were firing machine guns, grenade launchers,\u201d resident Sergiy Storozhuk said.\n\nRussian ground forces had initially moved into Ukraine from the north, south, and east, forcing many Ukrainians to flee their homes as the sound of bombing reverberated.\n\nMoscow\u2019s defence ministry said Thursday its forces had \u201csuccessfully completed\u201d their objectives for the day, earlier claiming to have destroyed over 70 Ukrainian military targets, including 11 airfields.\n\nWestern intelligence confirmed Moscow had established \u201ccomplete air superiority\u201d over Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian forces said they had killed \u201caround 50 Russian occupiers\u201d while repulsing an attack on a town on the frontline with Moscow-backed rebels, which could not immediately be confirmed by AFP.\n\nUkraine also said a military plane with 14 people on board crashed south of Kyiv with officials still determining how many people died, while a transport plane crashed in Russia killing the crew.\n\nOlena Kurilo was among 20 people wounded by flying shards of glass following a blast in the eastern Ukrainian town of Chuguiv.\n\n\u201cNever, under any conditions will I submit to Putin. It is better to die,\u201d the 52-year-old teacher said, her face covered in bandages.\n\nIn the Ukrainian village of Starognativka near the frontline where separatists have faced off against Kyiv\u2019s forces, official Vladimir Vesyelkin said missiles had rained down since Friday morning, and power was out.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to wipe the village off the face of the earth,\u201d he said.\n\nSanctions\n\nWeeks of diplomacy failed to deter Putin, who massed over 150,000 troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders in what the West said was Europe\u2019s biggest military build-up since World War II.\n\nWestern allies had initially imposed some sanctions on Russia in an en effort to deter Putin, then followed through on Thursday with vows to try and heavily punish Russia economically.\n\nUS President Joe Biden announced export controls against Russia to cut off more than half of the country\u2019s high-tech imports, alongside sanctions on Russian elites he called \u201ccorrupt billionaires\u201d, and banks.\n\nHe will meet Friday with fellow Nato leaders in an extraordinary virtual summit to discuss the security situation in and around Ukraine later.\n\nThe EU moved to impose \u201cmassive\u201d sanctions on Russia\u2019s energy and finance sectors, while French President Emmanuel Macron called Putin to \u201cdemand immediate halt\u201d to the offensive \u2014 but said the door must be kept open for dialogue.\n\nThe fighting spooked global financial markets, with stocks plunging and oil prices soaring past $100.\n\nIMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said the unrest carried \u201csignificant economic risk\u201d for the world, but Putin insisted he did not seek to undermine the global economic system.\n\nDemonstrations across Europe\n\nIn a televised address, the Russian president justified the assault as a defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin earlier said the leaders of the two separatist territories had asked Moscow for military help against Kyiv after Putin recognised their independence on Monday.\n\nA conflict between the separatists and government forces has dragged on since 2014, killing more than 14,000 people on both sides.\n\nRussia has also long demanded that Ukraine be forbidden from ever joining NATO and that US troops pull out from Eastern Europe.\n\nIn the Baltics, Lithuania declared a national emergency. Latvia, Lithuania, and Czech Republic, also stopped issuing visas to Russians.\n\nDemonstrators took to the streets of European capitals to condemn the Kremlin but a small anti-war protest in Moscow was quickly halted by police, with over 1,700 people detained at rallies across Russia.\n\nThe first Ukrainian refugees have begun to trickle into Hungary, Romania, and Poland while the UN said 100,000 had been displaced by the fighting.\n\n\u201cAnyone who can is fleeing,\u201d said Krisztian Szavla, one of the first refugees who arrived Thursday in Hungary from Ukraine\u2019s western Transcarpathia region.",

          "title": "US: Three Minneapolis Ex-Police Officers Guilty of Violating George Floyd\u2019s Rights",
          "text": "Three former Minneapolis police officers were found guilty by a federal jury on Thursday of depriving George Floyd of his civil rights by failing to give aid to the handcuffed Black man pinned beneath a colleague\u2019s knee.\n\nThe jury also found that the conduct of officers Tou Thao, 36; J. Alexander Kueng, 28; and Thomas Lane, 38, during the arrest on May 25, 2020, caused Floyd\u2019s death, a finding that can affect the severity of their sentence.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIt is a rare instance of police officers being held criminally responsible for a colleague\u2019s excessive force. All three men were convicted of denying Floyd\u2019s constitutional right to medical care while in police custody.\n\nThao and Kueng were also convicted on a charge of denying Floyd\u2019s right to not face excessive force by failing to stop their colleague Derek Chauvin from kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. Chauvin was convicted last year in a state court of Floyd\u2019s murder.\n\nThao, Kueng and Lane will remain free on bail pending their sentencing hearing, which has yet to be scheduled. Prosecutors have not yet said what sentence they will request, but the men may face years in prison.\n\n\u201cThis is just accountability,\u201d Philonise Floyd told reporters after the verdict was read. \u201cIt could never be justice because I can never get my brother back.\u201d\n\nThe verdict marked a second victory this week for prosecutors in the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division, coming just two days after a jury in Georgia found three white men guilty of federal hate crimes in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a young Black man who was gunned down while running through a mostly white neighborhood.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s historic for our country, because oftentimes officers kill Black and brown men and women, and we get little to no consequences,\u201d said Brandon Williams, George Floyd\u2019s nephew. \u201cA lot of times we don\u2019t even get charges, let alone convictions.\u201d\n\nKILLING SPARKED PROTESTS\n\nFederal prosecutors argued in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul that the men knew from their training and from \u201cbasic human decency\u201d that they had a duty to help Floyd as he begged for his life before falling limp beneath Chauvin\u2019s knee.\n\nFloyd\u2019s killing sparked protests in cities around the world against police brutality and racism.\n\nIt also led lawmakers to propose such measures as restricting chokeholds, banning \u201cno-knock warrants,\u201d and legislating to curtail the U.S. Supreme Court doctrine known \u201cqualified immunity\u201d that limits lawsuits over police use of excessive force.\n\nThose proposals were included in the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives last year. Philonise Floyd on Thursday again urged lawmakers to pass the measure that has stalled in the Senate, where Democrats are unlikely to get the necessary Republican votes.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison last year after a state murder trial. Although race was not part of the state or federal charges, Chauvin\u2019s conviction was seen as a landmark rebuke of the disproportionate use of police force against Black Americans. In December, Chauvin pleaded guilty to the federal charge of violating Floyd\u2019s rights.\n\nUnder Chauvin\u2019s plea agreement, federal prosecutors will seek a 25-year sentence, concurrent with his state prison sentence. His three former colleagues are also due to stand trial in Minneapolis in June on state charges of aiding and abetting Floyd\u2019s murder.\n\nBYSTANDER VIDEO\n\nWidely seen cellphone video showed Thao stood steps away from Floyd, rebuffing the demands by horrified onlookers that Chauvin get off Floyd\u2019s neck. Kueng and Lane were to Chauvin\u2019s right, pinning down Floyd\u2019s buttocks and legs.\n\nAll three testified in their own defense. Each acknowledged they knew they had a duty of care to people in their custody. But they and their lawyers told jurors they did not realize at the time that Floyd was in dire need of medical aid or that Chauvin\u2019s use of force was excessive.\n\nProsecutors repeatedly played videos showing Floyd\u2019s distress was plain to bystanders, including children and an off-duty firefighter, who shouted that Floyd was passing out and begging the police to check his pulse.\n\nThe three defendants all described deferring to the authority of Chauvin, the most senior officer at the scene with 19 years at the Minneapolis Police Department. read more\n\nKueng and Lane, who first handcuffed Floyd on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill in a nearby store, also noted they were rookies only a few days out of training, which lasted more than a year. Thao had been on the force for eight years.\n\nMedical experts have testified that Floyd almost certainly would have survived the arrest if he had been rolled onto his side once the officers restrained him, as the officers acknowledged they had been taught to do.",

          "title": "World Leaders Fine-Tune Sanctions Meant to Punish Russia",
          "text": "Twenty million dollars in U.N. humanitarian funds for Ukraine. A raft of new, stronger sanctions against Russia from Japan, Australia, Taiwan and others. And a cascade of condemnation from the highest levels.\n\nAs Russian bombs and troops pounded Ukraine during the invasion\u2019s first full day, world leaders on Friday began to fine-tune a response meant to punish the Russian economy and its leaders, including President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle.\n\nWhile there\u2019s an acute awareness that a military intervention isn\u2019t possible, for now, the strength, unity and speed of the financial sanctions \u2014 with the striking exception of China, a strong Russian supporter \u2014 signal a growing global determination to make Moscow reconsider its attack.\n\n\u201cJapan must clearly show its position that we will never tolerate any attempt to change the status quo by force,\u201d Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters Friday while announcing new punitive measures that included freezing the visas and assets of Russian groups, banks and individuals, and the suspension of shipments of semiconductors and other restricted goods to Russian military-linked organizations.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is an extremely grave development that affects the international order, not only for Europe but also for Asia,\u201d Kishida said.\n\nCountries in Asia and the Pacific have joined the United States, the 27-nation European Union and others in the West in piling on punitive measures against Russian banks and leading companies. The nations have also set up export controls aimed at starving Russia\u2019s industries and military of semiconductors and other high-tech products.\n\nThe moves follow Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Putin\u2019s forces conducted airstrikes on cities and military bases, and his troops and tanks rolled into the nation from three sides. Ukraine\u2019s government pleaded for help as civilians fled. Scores of Ukrainians, civilians and service members alike, were killed.\n\n\u201cAn unthinkable number of innocent lives could be lost because of Russia\u2019s decision,\u201d New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. She announced targeted travel bans against Russian officials and other measures.\n\nAt the United Nations, officials set aside $20 million to boost U.N. humanitarian operations in Ukraine. Separately, the U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Friday on a resolution condemning Russia and demanding the immediate withdrawal of all its forces. Moscow, however, is certain to veto it.\n\nU.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said the $20 million from the U.N.\u2019s Central Emergency Response Fund will support emergency operations along the contact line in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk and in other areas of the country, and will \u201chelp with health care, shelter, food, and water and sanitation to the most vulnerable people affected by the conflict.\u201d\n\nThe West and its allies have shown no inclination to send troops into Ukraine \u2014 a non-member of NATO \u2014 and risk a wider war on the continent. But NATO reinforced its member states in Eastern Europe as a precaution against an attack on them, too.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency, meanwhile, extended to 200 nautical miles the airspace it considers risky, and warned of \u201cthe threat of missile launches to and from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nProtests by Ukrainians and their supporters were held Friday in Taiwan, Mongolia, Australia and elsewhere. Public buildings, sports stadiums and landmarks in the Australian city of Melbourne were illuminated in Ukraine\u2019s national colors of blue and yellow.\n\nJapan\u2019s new sanctions follow an earlier set of measures that include the suspension of distributing and issuing new Russian government bonds in Japan \u2014 a move aimed at cutting funding for Russia\u2019s military \u2014 a trade ban with two Ukrainian separatist regions and the freezing of their assets and visas.\n\nJapan, which has long sought to regain control of Russian-held northern islands seized at the end of World War II, took a milder stance toward Moscow during Russia\u2019s 2014 Crimea annexation. Tokyo\u2019s response to the current invasion has been considered tougher and faster, something that may be linked to a deep worry in Tokyo over China\u2019s increasingly assertive military actions in the region.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said his nation will join international sanctions, but won\u2019t consider unilateral sanctions.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s comparative caution is likely because its economy is heavily dependent on international trade. It also worries that strained ties with Moscow could undermine efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis. Russia is South Korea\u2019s 10th largest trading partner, and Moscow is a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council and maintains friendly ties with North Korea.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi phoned Putin late Thursday and appealed for an \u201cimmediate cessation of violence,\u201d his office said in a statement.\n\nIndia\u2019s permanent U.N. representative pushed for \u201curgent de-escalation\u201d through \u201csustained and focused diplomacy,\u201d but stopped short of either condemning Russia or acknowledging Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nThe cautious statement reflects India\u2019s delicate position. It relies heavily on Russia, a historic partner, for military equipment but has sought to strengthen ties with the West over the years.\n\nTaiwan announced Friday that it would join in economic sanctions against Russia, although it did not specify what type of measures those would be. Sanctions could potentially be focused on export control of semiconductor chips, local media reported. Taiwan is the dominant manufacturer of such chips, a critical component used in technologies from cars to laptops to cellphones.\n\nWhile most nations in Asia rallied to support Ukraine, China has continued to denounce sanctions against Russia and blamed the United States and its allies for provoking Moscow. Beijing, worried about U.S. power in Asia, has increasingly aligned its foreign policy with Russia to challenge the West.\n\n\u201cAt a time when Australia, together with the United Kingdom, together with the United States and Europe and Japan, are acting to cut off Russia, the Chinese government is following through on easing trade restrictions with Russia and that is simply unacceptable,\u201d Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t go and throw a lifeline to Russia in the middle of a period when they\u2019re invading another country,\u201d he added, referring to a report in The South China Morning Post that China had announced it was fully open to Russian wheat imports.\n\nIn Tokyo, Ukraine\u2019s top diplomat for Japan urged China to join international efforts to stop the Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cWe would very much welcome that China will exercise its connection with Russia and talk to Putin and explain to him it is inappropriate in the 21st century to do this massacre in Europe,\u201d Ambassador Sergiy Korsunsky told reporters.",

Dozens have been reported killed. Russian troops seized the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant north of Kyiv as they advanced on the city from Belarus.\n\nU.S. and Ukrainian officials say Russia aims to capture Kyiv and topple the government, which Putin regards as a puppet of the United States.\n\nZelenskiy said he understood Russian troops were coming for him but vowed to stay in Kyiv.\n\n\u201c(The) enemy has marked me down as the number one target,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a video message. \u201cMy family is the number two target.

He also says Ukraine is an illegitimate state whose lands historically belong to Russia.\n\nUkrainian forces downed an enemy aircraft over Kyiv early on Friday, which then crashed into a residential building and set it ablaze, said Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister.\n\nIt was unclear whether the aircraft was manned or whether it could be a missile. Kyiv municipal authorities said at least eight people were injured when the object crashed into an apartment block.\n\n\u201cHorrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv,\u201d Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter. \u201cLast time our capital experienced anything like this was in 1941 when it was attacked by Nazi Germany.\u201d\n\nAuthorities said intense fighting was under way in the city of Sumy in the northeast.\n\nA border post in the southeastern Zaporizhzhya region had been hit by missiles, causing deaths and injuries among border guards, and air raid sirens sounded over the city of Lviv in the west of the country.\n\nAsked if he was worried about Zelenskiy\u2019s safety, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, President Zelenskiy remains in Ukraine at his post, and of course we\u2019re concerned for the safety of all of our friends in Ukraine \u2013 government officials and others.\u201d\n\nSANCTIONS BUILD\n\nA democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and has recently stepped up efforts to join the NATO military alliance and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow.\n\nThe United States, Britain, Japan, Canada, Australia and the EU unveiled more sanctions on Moscow on top of penalties earlier this week, including a move by Germany to halt an $11 billion gas pipeline from Russia.\n\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell described the bloc\u2019s measures as \u201cthe harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented\u201d.\n\nChina came under pressure over its refusal to call Russia\u2019s assault an invasion.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, speaking to reporters at the White House, said: \u201cAny nation that countenances Russia\u2019s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.\u201d He declined to comment directly on China\u2019s position.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council will vote on Friday on a draft resolution that would condemn Russia\u2019s invasion and require Moscow\u2019s immediate withdrawal.

          "title": "In First Major Post-PIA Deal, Seplat Acquires Mobil Producing Oil Assets in Nigeria",
          "text": "Seplat Energy on Thursday announced its acquisition of oil and gas assets belonging to Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), in a deal seen as the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by President Muhammadu Buhari in August last year. The deal is however subject to Ministerial Consent and other required regulatory approvals.\n\nSeplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian energy company listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE), was expected to announce the agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil, with the completion of the transaction subject to ministerial consent and other required regulatory approvals.\n\nThe statement from the company showed that Seplat Energy Offshore Limited, a wholly owned Nigerian subsidiary of Seplat Energy Plc, entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU for a purchase price of $1,283 million plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.\n\nThe transaction, according to statement, encompasses the acquisition of the entire offshore shallow water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria, which it said is an established, high-quality operation with a highly skilled local operating team and a track record of safe operations.\n\nThe transaction, it said, would create one of the largest independent energy companies on both the NGX and LSE and bolster Seplat Energy\u2019s ability to drive increased growth, profitability and overall stakeholder prosperity. The deal would deliver 186 per cent increase in production from 51,000 bpd to 146,000 bpd or 170 per cent increase in 2P liquids reserves, from 241 MMbbl to 650 MMbbl.\n\nIn addition, it was expected to deliver a 14 per cent increase in 2P gas reserves from 1,501 Bscf to 1,712 Bscf, plus significant undeveloped gas potential of 2,910 Bscf (JV: 7,275 Bscf)\n\nFurthermore, it was expected to increase by 89 per cent, the total 2P reserves from 499 MMboe to 945 MMboe and includes offshore fields with dedicated, MPNU-operated export routes offering enhanced security and reliability.\n\nIn the oil industry, 2P reserves are the total of proven and probable reserves while probable reserves are less likely to be recovered than proven reserves.\n\nBeing the first transaction to be announced since the Nigerian government\u2019s recently ratified PIA, the company stated that the deal would support Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and objectives of the new Act.\n\nSeplat Energy said it was fully committed to working with the Nigerian government to bring the strategically important national assets fully into Nigerian ownership alongside the national oil company, NNPC.\n\nIn addition, it noted that the development of the gas resources would support the government\u2019s objective to achieve a pragmatic, progressive and just energy transition for Nigeria.\n\nThe transaction agreement also includes potential additional contingent consideration of up to $300 million in total, payable over the period 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2026, and contingent upon average Brent crude oil prices exceeding $70 per barrel and subject to MPNU\u2019s average working interest production exceeding 60 kboepd (JV: 150 kboepd).\n\nThe deal primarily comprises a 40 per cent operating ownership of four oil mining leases (OMLs 67, 68, 70, 104) and associated infrastructure with NNPC being owner of the rest 60 per cent.\n\nIt includes the Qua Iboe Terminal, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest export facilities as well as a 51 per cent interest in Bonny River Terminal and Natural Gas Liquids Recovery Plants at EAP and Oso.\n\nHowever, the contract does not include ExxonMobil\u2019s deep-water assets in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to statement, the cash consideration payable under the transaction will be funded through a combination of existing cash resources and credit facilities of Seplat Energy, and a new $550 million senior term loan facility and $275 million junior offtake facility.\n\nAlso included is a global financing syndicate comprising Nigerian and international banks, as well as commodity trading companies, while contingent payments, if materialised on Brent oil price annual average above $70/bbl, will be funded through share of net cash flows from operations.\n\nUnder the Sale and Purchase Agreement, Seplat Energy will pay a deposit of $128 million, which will be applied towards the purchase price on closing.\n\n\u201cIf the transaction does not proceed, the deposit will be repaid to Seplat Energy where the agreement is terminated by Seplat Energy in certain circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe Transaction does not require the approval of Seplat Energy\u2019s shareholders and will not result in any changes to its Board. The Company currently expects the Transaction to close in H2 2022,\u201d it stated.\n\nCommenting on the deal, Chairman of Seplat Energy, Dr. Bryant Orjiako, said: \u201cThis is a transformational acquisition for Seplat Energy that strengthens our partnership with the national oil company, the NNPC, and consummates the spirit of the newly enacted PIA.\n\n\u201cAs a significantly larger business, with a stronger resource base and greatly enhanced capabilities, we will be better positioned to provide sustainable energy solutions that drive growth and profitability for the benefit of all our stakeholders, particularly our host communities and the wider Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the aims of the federal government\u2019s \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d, and this acquisition will accelerate our development of Nigeria\u2019s gas resources to help achieve a just transition for our rapidly growing country.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chief Executive Officer of the company, Roger Brown, said: \u201cThis transaction underpins Seplat Energy\u2019s drive to be a leader in the growth of the indigenous independent energy sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition is a perfect fit with our strategy to build a sustainable business and deliver energy transition in Nigeria. Our financial strength has enabled us to attract high quality local and international capital providers to fund this transaction without diluting our existing shareholders and reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to drive our growth through the extensive low-cost and low-risk production opportunities it delivers in the near term, whilst also developing longer-term opportunities to monetise our significant gas resources through domestic and export opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is a win-win for both companies. Together, we will strengthen our focus on profitability and cash generation to reinvest in Nigeria\u2019s energy development.\n\n\u201cMPNU\u2019s employees and contractors have a strong reputation for safety and operational excellence, and I look forward to welcoming them to the Seplat Energy family,\u201d he stated.\n\nFor months, Mobil\u2019s officials have been holding talks with several Nigerian companies to gauge their interest in the fields, followed with the opening of a \u201cdata room\u201d \u2013 which provided technical information on the fields, such as seismic and production details \u2013 in Nigeria.\n\nThe discussions focused on a number of onshore fields ExxonMobil shares in joint ventures with Nigerian state oil firm, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), including Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 67, 68, 70 and 104.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Reports that President Muhammadu Buhari might have settled for a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as his consensus candidate for the office of the national chairman, seem to be true.\n\nBut more details have also emerged on why the president settled for Adamu, despite the fact that he has seemingly unending cases with the nation\u2019s number one anti-corruption agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nNonetheless, three other aspirants to the same office, namely, Tanko Al makura, Saliu Mustapha and Sunny Moni Dafe, had immediately rejected the \u201cpurported\u201d adoption of Adamu by the president.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIn addition to the disavowal by other contestants, a group of concerned APC North-West stakeholders, has insisted that those aspiring to the exalted seat of APC chairmanship should be allowed to test their popularity and therefore, the contest should be thrown open.\n\nThis, notwithstanding, the leadership of the ruling party, has appointed committees for its forthcoming zonal congresses to be held on March 12, 2022.\n\nDifferent sources confided in THISDAY on Thursday that the inroads made by Senator Adamu in reconciling aggrieved members of the party that attracted him to Buhari as a likely choice for party\u2019s chairmanship.\n\nBut some governors, especially, those from north central were said to have opposed the choice of Adamu, insisting that since the national chairman, has been zoned to the geo-political, they should be allowed to decide who picks the position.\n\nBesides, the purported endorsement of Adamu has also not gone down well with other aspirants and governors, as they claimed that he was not among the aspirants, as his name only popped up last week before President Buhari travelled to Brussels, Germany.\n\nBefore his departure, the president was said to have asked for the names of all the aspirants and his name was added.\n\nGovernor Sule of Nasarawa State and his counterpart in Kwara State, Abdulrahman Abdurazak, were said to have opposed the choice of Adamu, but backed Al-Makura.\n\nAnother governor from the zone, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, THISDAY was told, also rejected the purported adoption of Adamu.\n\nMustapha, on his part, told THISDAY on Thursday that against the media speculations, the President has not adopted Adamu, describing it as \u201ca media game.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMy governor (Governor Abdulrazaq of Kwara) told me that the matter of who becomes the next national chairman of our party has not been discussed.\u201d\n\nMustapha, who maintained that the matter was not discussed at the APC governors\u2019 meeting with the president, told THISDAY that the president only approved the zoning of offices as presented to him by the APC-elected governors.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting, no name was mentioned. It was only the approval of the zoning of offices that was presented and the president only approved the zoning and asked the governors to go about it diligently to ensure peace.\n\n\u201cThe President Buhari that I know will not like to do things secretly. This is a media game by those concerned. I don\u2019t know what they want to achieve.\u201d\n\nAnother aspirant, Monidafe, questioned the aid adoption of Adamu, claiming that if it wastrue, why has the president not officially announced it?\n\nSenator Al-Makura, in a statement by Segun Tomo, the Director, New Media, Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO), also denied that Adamu has been adopted as the national chairman of APC.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO) has been drawn to wide speculations and propaganda making the rounds in some news outlets that President Muhammadu Buhari has endorsed the candidacy of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu as the next Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cWhile we would have ordinarily ignored the widespread rumours, we have been inundated with calls and apprehension of Sen. Umaru Tanko Al-Makura\u2019s supporters across the country. Therefore, we decided to respond, and set the records straight.\n\n\u201cInformation at our disposal indicate that what transpired at the meeting of the governors with the president was the ratification of the new convention date and agreement on the zoning formula.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of who becomes chairman, the president asked that consultations continue to produce a credible and widely accepted choice as consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cOne does not need a soothsayer to know that Al-Makura fits the bill. Across the length and breadth of the country, Sen. Al-Makura is seen as a bridge-builder, a leader imbued with a calm temperament, renowned with an impeccable mobilization skills and political sagacity that ensured he defeated the then entrenched Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nasarawa State.\u201d\n\nConcerned APC North-West Stakeholders forum, has insisted that those aspiring for the chairmanship of the party should be allowed to test their popularity, openly.\n\nNational Convener of the group, Alhaji Sani Abubakar, in a statement argued that the call was necessitated by the purported move to impose Senator Abdullahi Adamu as chairman of the party.\n\nThe group expressed convern that some of the party\u2019s governors from the North West geopolitical zone were already dropping the name of President Muhammadu Buhari purely to promote the candidacy of Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nThe group cautioned some members of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) to thread with caution so as not to destroy the APC, saying there would be consequences for any act that causes problems for the party.\n\n\u201cThe stakeholders have become aware that members of the PGF from the north-west, who championed this errant position are acting out their own greed and personal agenda, which is that each of them is hopeful of emerging the running mate to an eventual APC presidential candidate from the south.\n\n\u201cIt is most unfortunate that people, who currently (individually) hold the mandate for the wellbeing of millions of people as state governors are unable to subjugate their selfish interest for national interest, party loyalty and the long-term stability of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is tragic how these individuals overheated the polity simply out of desperation to occupy a position that is not zoned to their areas. These persons from the north-west looking for the position of vice president that, going by our history as a nation, it is well known that the best the region could get after 2023 is the national chairmanship position of the party.\n\n\u201cAll those pushing for a candidate from the north central to be made a consensus chairman of the party, which has earlier been zoned to the north west, are traitors and seem to only be interested in rubbishing Mr. President\u2019s legacies in office by appending his name as mark of approval to their plans.\u201d\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), has appointed committees for its forthcoming zonal congresses slated for March 12, 2022.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe disclosed this in a statement issueed on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe chairmen of the committees are all members of the CECPC, while secretaries are selected from amongst the deputy governors from their respective geo-political zones.\n\n\u201cMeetings of zonal stakeholders hold on Saturday, 26 February, 2022 at the respective geo-political zones.\u201d Akpanudoedehe disclosed.\n\nFor the North-Central zone, the Governor of Niger SState, Abubakar Bello was appointed chairman, while Prof. Sonni Tyoden will serve as the secretary.\n\nThe party appointed Senator Yusuf Yusuf as the chairman for the North-east Zone, while Mr. Manasseh Jatau, will serve as the secretary.\n\nThe APC appointed Mr. David Lyon as the chairman for the South-south, while Prof. Ivara Esu, will serve as the secretary.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said Senator Abba Ali would serve as the committee chairman for the Northwest zone, while Hadiza Balarabe is the secretary.\n\nHon. Akinremi Olaide was appointed as the chairman for the South-west zone and Dr. Kadiri Hamzat is the secretary.\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Juliet Akoje in Abuja",
