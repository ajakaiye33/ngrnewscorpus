          "text": "Ifechukwu Orjiani\n\nDiabetes can be difficult, due to its physical, emotional, financial, social and mental implications. People living with diabetes constantly have to take medication to steady their blood sugar levels, check their blood sugar regularly and be careful of how they live in general. As such, a diabetes diagnosis and condition impact a patient\u2019s loved ones.\n\nIf you know someone with diabetes and you are unsure of how best to help, support and care for them, this article will show you how to do so.\n\nBeing supportive of someone living with diabetes and actively contributing to daily care can help them enjoy the healthiest life possible. To do this, you should offer physical, mental and emotional care.\n\nPhysical care entails monitoring medication, diet and exercise. Remind them to constantly check their blood sugar, and maintain a daily record of their weight, blood sugar readings, medicine schedule, meals, exercise and mood are needed. Ensure there is a medicine routine and medicines are taken at the right times and dosage. Use a pill organiser if needed and offer help if your loved one cannot open or administer their medication themselves. Offer to keep a record of their symptoms or other concerns, and help them talk about them with their doctor. You can also help them make and get to doctor appointments.\n\nMake sure that their diets are high in protein, whole grains, healthy fats, fruits and vegetables. Oily, fatty, fried foods and foods (or drinks) high in refined sugars should be avoided. Drinking lots of water and eating healthy snacks help too. Exercise improves insulin sensitivity, reduces blood glucose, controls weight, reduces anxiety, improves mental health reduces the risk for cardiac diseases so it should be prioritised too. Other physical care activities are grooming, bathing, dressing, etc.\n\nAlso, help them join a wellness community, like LiveWell Club, where Nigerians living with diabetes can gain practical knowledge and share experiences that support their treatment, diet and lifestyle changes.\n\nAs diabetes increases the incidence of depression and anxiety; swings in blood sugar can make one jittery, confused, anxious or irritable; mental and emotional care should not be ignored. Offer support, encourage your loved one to join a group or talk about professional counselling if needed. Also, nudging them to engage in daily activities that might help ease stress (taking walks, deep breathing exercises, listening to music, watching a funny movie) are ways to reduce the mental toll of the diabetes journey.\n\nNow, let me share with you five care tips you need when caring for people leaving with diabetes 2.\n\nIn your quest to ensure your loved one stays healthy and avoids diabetes complications, first, educate yourself. Care is curiosity. Learn everything you can about diabetes and your loved one\u2019s specific situation. Research online; offer to accompany them to appointments or diabetes support group meetings. Learn how to prevent emergencies or complications, and how to identify symptoms of low (hypoglycemia) or high (hyperglycemia) blood sugar.\n\nSecond, be patient. Care is compassion. Give your loved one some time to process what can be a lot of information at once. Be patient with the extra time they may need to perform foot care as they get ready in the morning, read nutrition labels when grocery shopping, monitor blood glucose or administer insulin. Don\u2019t disregard the fact that managing diabetes is hard. There\u2019s a thin line between providing support and nagging. If you start lecturing or acting like the diabetes police, they may shut down and refuse your help, and you don\u2019t want that.\n\nThird, make changes, too. Care is commitment. Join them in making healthy lifestyle modifications. Set small goals such as making good food choices, quitting smoking and staying active.\n\nFourth, speak positively. Care is communication. Encourage them in ways they understand and appreciate. Ask, often, how you can help. Be specific about what you\u2019re able to help with. Don\u2019t offer what you\u2019re not willing to provide. If your offer is turned down, let them know the door is open if and when they\u2019re ready. Offer positive support, not negative stories. Although complications can happen, you should keep conversations positive. They don\u2019t need to hear about people who died or had limbs amputated.\n\nFifth, be observant. Care is consciousness. Sometimes, people with type 2 diabetes experience a drop in blood sugar. This can cause cloudy thinking, fatigue and weakness. Find out if your loved one is at risk for low blood sugar and then learn what the symptoms are and how to treat if they are at risk. Be mindful of these symptoms and speak up immediately if you notice a change in behaviour. It\u2019s also helpful to plan how to handle a diabetes-related emergency or what to do in the event of a blood sugar drop. Since low blood sugar can cause confusion, your loved one may be unable to articulate the steps to raise their blood sugar at the moment. In the case of emergencies, contact the medical team immediately.\n\nFinally, a bonus tip: Take care of yourself. Care is cognisance. Recognise your limits and know when to step back. Remember that ultimately, the person with diabetes is responsible for managing it, not you. It helps to have a community of fellow caregivers to help ease your journey.\n\nA diabetes community or support group is very beneficial for the physical and mental health of people living with diabetes, as well as their caregivers.\n\nIfechukwu Orjiani, a certified diabetes nurse educator, writes from Lagos; 09055790893\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2014 Wants Nigeria designated as \u2018country of particular concern\u2019\n\nDayo Johnson, Akure\n\nThe United States Senate has decried the continued attacks and killings of Christians in Nigeria, saying the Nigeria government has failed to take meaningful steps to mitigate worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe US Senate in a letter addressed to the US Secretary of State, Honorable Antony Blinken Secretary, also faulted the US decision to remove Nigeria\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC).\n\nThe US Senate in a letter signed by Senators: Josh Hawley; Mike Braun; Tom Cotton; Marco Rubio and James M. Inhofe particularly listed the June 5th Owo terror attack and the killing of Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu as evidences of persecution of Christians in Nigeria.\n\nThe letter reads:\u201dAs you are well aware, horrific acts of deadly violence have been committed against Nigerian Christians in recent weeks, including the massacre of churchgoers on Pentecost Sunday and the stoning of a Christian college student.\n\n\u201cSadly, such violence has become all too familiar for Christians in Africa\u2019s most populous country. Last year, however, you inexplicably removed Nigeria\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) despite no demonstrable improvement in the country\u2019s religious freedom conditions.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, the situation in Nigeria has grown worse. We previously urged you to immediately reverse your misguided decision, and we write today to renew our call.\n\nRecent high-profile acts of violence underscore the intense religious persecution that is regularly experienced by Nigerian Christians.\n\n\u201cOn Pentecost Sunday, gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria\u2019s Ondo state, reportedly killing at least 50 churchgoers. Last month, a violent mob brutally stoned to death Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu, a student at Shehu Shagari College of Education in northwest Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, some Islamist students were enraged by a \u201cblasphemous\u201d message Deborah had posted in a WhatsApp group, in which she said that \u201cJesus Christ is the greatest. He helped me pass my exams.\u201d Merely expressing one\u2019s Christian faith has apparently become tantamount to a death sentence in many parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cReligious violence and intolerance directed toward Nigerian Christians has worsened in recent years. One report documented more than 4,650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021. Accordingly, Nigeria earns the dubious honor\u2014for the second consecutive year\u2014of being the deadliest country on earth for Christians.\n\n\u201cWe wrote last year that \u201c[n]ot only has the government of Nigeria failed to take meaningful steps to mitigate such violence, but Nigerian authorities restrict and crack down on religious minorities and detain individuals indefinitely on blasphemy-related charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe remain concerned that the Nigerian government is failing to protect the religious freedom and basic safety of its Christian citizens.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, as this year\u2019s annual reports from the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and from your own Department make clear, Nigerian government authorities directly participate in the persecution of Christians, Muslims, and even non-theists, most notoriously through arrests and convictions under blasphemy laws.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: continued enforcement of state-sanctioned blasphemy laws enables the type of deadly violence that killed Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu and so many others.\n\n\u201cWhen we previously wrote you, we were met with a response which failed to answer our questions about why the State Department views Nigeria as not having engaged in or tolerated \u201csystematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom\u201d or even \u201csevere violations of religious freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable, especially because you are required by federal law to consider the recommendation of USCIRF\u2014which, since 2009, has been to designate Nigeria as a CPC. In fact, USCIRF reiterated in its 2022 Annual Report that it was \u201cappalled\u201d at the removal of Nigeria\u2019s CPC designation.\n\n\u201cDespite public statements from you and other State Department officials condemning the recent bloodshed in Nigeria, the fact remains that the Department still does not officially regard Nigeria as a severe violator of religious freedom.\n\n\u201cThe State Department released its 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom on June 2, which starts the 90-day timeline for the Department to make its religious freedom designations.\n\n\u201cGiven the abysmal state of religious freedom in Nigeria, it is incumbent upon you to reverse last year\u2019s decision and redesignate the country as a CPC. The moment demands that you do so without delay.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), has blamed the Federal Government for the scarcity of the Premium Motor Spirit(PMS), popularly known as petrol in the country. The union said the scarcity of the product is caused by the government\u2019s misplaced priority.\n\nSpeaking during the 5th Quadrennial Delegates Conference of the Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) branch of NUPENG in Ibadan the Oyo State capital, NUPENG President, Comrade William\n\nAkporeha explained that rather than blaming tanker drivers for petrol scarcity, the blame should be put on the doorstep of the government, who he said had refused to build new refineries in the last 30 to 40 years.\n\nHe queried the rationale for importing petrol and diesel when these products could be refined locally if the refineries are working.\n\nAkporeha said: \u201cWhy are the scarcity of petrol? Where is the product? The scarcity is not caused by tanker drivers but government\u2019s misplaced priority. If the product is available, members will move it around.\n\n\u201cBy importing the product, you are exporting capital, exporting jobs by doing so,\u201d the NUPENG boss said. To turn the tide, he called on the Federal Government to put the refineries to ensure that petroleum products are refined locally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s rocket science to do that. The refineries we have today were built by the military 30 to 40 years ago\u201d.\n\nHe described PTD as the most sustainable aspect of NUPENG, saying that their roles affect everybody in the country.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the outgoing National Chairman, PTD Branch of NUPENG, Comrade Salimon Akani Oladiti, said the ban on night travelling by tanker drivers have helped in saving lives and drastically reducing the rate of accidents, especially at night.\n\nHe also said through the collaboration with stakeholders especially the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the rate of accidents involving Tanker Drivers had reduced while Tanker Drivers\u2019 involvement in Petroleum Pipeline vandalization has been tackled with all the seriousness it deserves.\n\nOladiti recalled his concerns for the safety of lives of Petroleum Tanker Drivers dated back to his younger days as a driver and on the assumption of office in 2014, he made a policy to inculcate discipline among members hence the decision to ban night traveling.\n\n\u201cWe launched a vigorous campaign to ban night movement of Petroleum Products. Today, the ban on night traveling has saved lives and reduced drastically the rate of accidents, especially at night,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that while accidents involving tanker drivers had reduced, fuel scarcity has been minimized due to the commitment of PTD members who are always on duty.\n\nHe disclosed that the PTD partnership with NARTO, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the FRSC, and other relevant stakeholders has brought incessant strikes by PTD members to the barest minimum.\n\nHe also commended the FRSC Corps Marshall, Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi for collaborating with PTD to introduce the use and enforcement of speed limits in their trucks.\n\n\u201cThis measure helped in a tremendous way to reduce incidences of Tanker accidents on our roads. Instead of being enemies, we have partnered so well like friends and mutually helped to reduce carnage on our roads. For that, our wonderful Corps Marshal deserves a special award today,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said his administration also remodeled and renovated PTD head office in Abuja; built befitting zonal offices; embarked on diversification of sources of income for PTD; acquisition of land for housing and ultra-modern tanker parks; the welfare of members; human capital development via local and international for members; and ban on night traveling to enhance safety of lives of members.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nAhead of the constitution of the campaign organisation of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the crisis rocking the party appears far from over.\n\nThe latest development, Saturday Sun reliably gathered, may put a clog in the wheel of the opposition party\u2019s determination to triumph in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe festering crisis in the party, which assumed a new dimension last month following the announcement of Ifeanyi Okowa as the running mate to Atiku, Saturday Sun has learnt, started a few weeks after Iyorchia Ayu was elected National Chairman of the PDP.\n\nA source in the PDP told Saturday Sun that the widening gulf has now pitted six PDP governors, predominantly from the South, against Atiku\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nThe source listed some of the governors as Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Samuel Ortom of Benue State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Ishaku Darius of Taraba and Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, as governors unwilling to support Atiku\u2019s bid.\n\nConfirming the bad blood in the rank and file of the party, Ortom had, during the weak, said he might not work for the actualisation of Atiku\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nHe said: \u201cAll that was needed even before the pronouncement, after we did our recommendation, Wike would have been reached out to, he is a human being.\n\n2023: Court stops INEC from ending ... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 2023: Court stops INEC from ending voter registration\n\n\u201cThis is a man who has built the party today in PDP. He has fought all night and all day to see that this party remains together. So, he would have been reached out to, to say that this is the decision we are taking and this is the reason we are taking this decision, and I think he would have understood.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP source, trouble started when Ayu was elected national chairman of the PDP. The source said leaders of the party had agreed to zone the chairmanship of the PDP to the North, while the South, like the All Progressives Congress (APC), would produce the presidential candidate.\n\nHe said as soon as Ayu assumed office, he jettisoned the arrangement he inherited and started working for the emergence of Atiku, who is seen as his close political ally, to emerge as the candidate. The source, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said despite attempts by governors and other leaders of the party to prevail on Ayu to respect the agreement that he inherited, the former Senate President remained adamant.\n\n\u201cWhen it was obvious that Ayu wasn\u2019t ready to listen and zone the presidential ticket to the South, governors and other leaders decided to leave the contest open. But they agreed to support a Southern aspirant, but people like Okowa, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State and other people, especially from the South South, started working to ensure that a Northern candidate emerged,\u201d he narrated.\n\nRevealing further, the source said when Wike lost the primary election to Atiku, party leaders agreed that it would be best to pick him as the running mate to Atiku. He revealed the aforementioned governors met with Atiku and other leaders to pick Wike as a popular choice, but were ignored by Ayu and Atiku, who are believed to be micro-managed by some powerful Northern leaders. Unable to have their way, he said the six governors decided not to play any active role during the presidential campaign of Atiku. He said though they may not defect to the APC, they\u2019re likely to sabotage the chances of the PDP from within.\n\n\u201cThe governors can\u2019t and won\u2019t defect. They understand that clearly. If they defect now, their candidates can\u2019t win elections. Some of them are gunning for a second term. But they\u2019ll sabotage Atiku the same way PDP governors sabotaged President Goodluck Johnathan in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf you recall, many governors of the PDP, especially from the North, worked for the emergence of Buhari. They didn\u2019t leave the PDP, but they sabotaged it from within. That\u2019s what may play out in the case of Atiku.\n\n\u201cThere is a general consensus from Southern leaders that power should return to the region. And many PDP governors are close friends of the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. They will work for him. If that happens, hold Atiku and Ayu responsible,\u201d the angry source further revealed.\n\nSaturday Sun has also reliably gathered that Tinubu\u2019s men have started reaching out to the aggrieved governors and other key Southern leaders of the PDP. It was learnt that Tinubu\u2019s current vacation in Europe is part of the arrangement to meet with some of the governors who are also out of the country for the summer holiday.\n\nCurrently, Wike and Ikpeazu are in Turkey on their annual vacation. Beside Tinubu who is in Europe, other key PDP and APC leaders, are reportedly out of the country too for some clandestine meetings, ahead of the kick off of the campaigns in September. Despite the festering crisis, Atiku has assured that he will reconcile the various factions and address concerns raised. In a Facebook post, he wrote: \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party will remain united. Focus on our actions. We are taking action to address the feelings of all party members. The unity in our community is my priority. Our resolve to unify Nigeria starts in our party and moves to the community, then on to society.\n\n\u201cEvery governor, legislator, and other elected officials produced by our party, and party members and loyalists are much loved and respected by me. When they speak, I listen. I do not only listen. Appropriate actions have been taken, are being taken, and will continue to be advanced.\u201d",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nContrary to general assumption, the smashing of kidnappers\u2019 hideouts in parts of Anambra State is far from bringing an end to the criminal enterprise in the South East, as more of such dens have been discovered in the region.\n\nSaturday Sun investigations showed that the Umunneochi/Lokpanata axis of Abia State, Mbano/Mbaise and Isi-Uzo areas of Imo and Enugu States, respectively, harbour notorious camps of kidnappers.\n\nIt was also gathered that bandits operating in the Umunneochi and Isi-Uzo are majorly herders.\n\nAccounts of survivors of their dastardly attacks revealed that these criminals work hand in gloves with natives of such communities.\n\nOne of their latest escapades was the abduction of seven indigenes of Isiugwu Ohafia, in Ohafia Local Government Area of Abia State on Saturday, June 25, 2022, along the notorious Umunneochi section of the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway.\n\nThough four of the abductees were initially freed by their abductors to go home and quickly mobilise ransom for the release of their remaining kinsmen, it was learnt that the captives regained their freedom within the week after some ransom was delivered.\n\nThe foregoing incident occurred at the same area where the Prelate of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Dr Samuel Kanu-Uche and some of his clerics and assistants were abducted few weeks ago with N100million ransom paid. Indigenes of the area insist that a web consisting of security operatives including soldiers and Fulani herders was responsible for the nefarious acts. It was also discovered that their methods and tactics were almost similar notwithstanding the gang and where they operated.\n\nIn Enugu State, at least four indigenes of Ikem community in Isi-Uzo local government area have been abducted in the past two weeks with different sums of ransom paid for their release.\n\nThe victims were the Catechist of Saint James Catholic Church, Ishioroto-Ikem Lawrence Ndu; an Italy-based evangelist, Emeka Odo, his brother Ikechukwu Odo; and the most recent victim, Ejike Agbodo, a commercial bus driver who was abducted while on duty along Ikem-Benue State road.\n\nNarrating his experience, the Italy-based evangelist, Emeka Odo disclosed that the over 10 kidnappers who abducted them along Ikem- Obollo Afor road were all Fulani that wielded AK-47 rifles. Odo who quickly went back to his base shortly after he regained freedom, narrated that they were flagged down in their car, commandeered into the bush and were taken through bush tracks to Eha-Amufu and Benue State border, adding that they paid ransom before they were freed.\n\nOdo said that his abductors spoke Hausa and Fulfulde languages, claiming that most of them came from Niger Republic. Evangelist Odo told Saturday Sun that the criminals claimed that the have run a ring around the Eastern parts of the country. \u201cThey told us that they own all bush paths from Delta to all parts of South East and that they do anything they want to do,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also revealed that even people from Benue State who were kidnapped were brought to their bush camp in Eha-Amufu, Enugu State, where he said the kidnappers had sacked the indigenes. The spate of insecurity in the Eha-Amufu area of Isi-Uzo, Enugu State has continued to be a source of concern as several farmers have lost their lives with many others chased out of their farm settlements by marauding herders.\n\nIn January this year, an attack at Abor Community in Eha-Amufu, claimed one life with three others critically wounded. About two weeks earlier, Saturday Sun gathered that armed herders attacked Mgbuji farm settlements, also in the local government, resulting in the death of at least three farmers while the herders relocated to another farm settlement in Abor.\n\nPrecisely on January 27, at least six persons were feared dead following an attack by suspected herdsmen at a farm settlement in Mgbuji and Ebo, Eha-Amufu. It was further gathered that the particular attack lasted about eight hours.\n\nA community leader in Mgbuji, Eric Ebeh had confirmed the attack at the period. Then on March 26, 2022, six persons, including pregnant women, were again killed in another attack by suspected herdsmen in Mgbuji and Ebo autonomous communities in Eha-Amufu.\n\nMany residents of the communities were also said to be missing while houses and motorcycles were burnt during the attack on seven farm settlements. Trouble started when youths of the area chased some herders out of their farms for allegedly allowing their cows to destroy hectares of cassava plantation. In the ensuing struggle between the youth and the herders, some cows were reportedly killed, causing the herdsmen to launch a reprisal.\n\nThey were said to have invaded the settlements with AK-47 rifles and shot indiscriminately. Expressing his frustration, a community source had said: \u201cAfter soldiers left the community for about four days, the Fulani herdsmen launched the attack on Thursday. When we heard rumours that they were preparing to invade our communities, we promptly alerted the police and the military.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is why all the soldiers deployed to the settlements were withdrawn. I must tell you that except one soldier from the South-South, all the soldiers deployed to the community were northern Muslims. On one of the occasions, they even opened fire on our local vigilantes who were patrolling the settlements to repel attacks by the invaders.\n\n\u201cSo, the herders came in full force and killed many people and burnt houses and property. There is high tension here. As we speak, we have recovered bodies of six people that were killed and so many are missing.\u201d\n\nBetween January and March, no fewer than seven brutal attacks had been launched on the agrarian community. It was learnt that one of the victims, Ejike Odo, got a report that his sister who went to the farm was attacked by herdsmen while she was returning from farm, and he rushed to the farm to rescue her.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the herdsmen who were about four overpowered him, stabbed him several times before slitting his throat,\u201d a community leader who gave his name as Justus Nwonye said. Also in May, 2022, suspected herdsmen reportedly killed a young man in Okpulugwu Agu-Amede community in Eha-Amufu.\n\nAlso, no fewer than six pilgrims were on Sunday, June 19, abducted near a Monastery at Ibite Awhum community in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State, when some gunmen suspected to be Fulani invaded the town. However, sources from the community said that help came the way of the victims following a joint operation of forest guards from Udi and Enugu East Local Government Councils.\n\nWhile the skirmishes involving the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) sponsored Eastern Security Network (ESN) continued in the Orlu Senatorial District of Imo State and extending to Ihiala in Anambra State, kidnapping has upped in the Mbano/Mbaise areas of the state. Some of their camps and gangs had been identified and destroyed by security forces.\n\nMeanwhile, the whereabouts of the traditional ruler of Isuokoma community, in Onicha LGA of Ebonyi State, Eze Ambrose Ogbu and the woman leader of the area, Mrs Juliana Uzor, who were abducted in separate incidents about two weeks ago were still unknown. The woman leader was abducted at her farm while the monarch\u2019s incident happened in his palace.\n\nAgain gunmen invade, bomb Kogi poli...

Indigenes said the two incidents have caused serious fear and panic in the hitherto peaceful settlement.\n\nThe apex Igbo socio-cultural and political body, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address the precarious security situation instead of dissipating energy and resources trampling on members of IPOB. Its spokesman, Alex Ogbonnia said: \u201cOhanaeze contends that if Mr President confronts the menace of the Fulani herdsmen who have been terrorizing several states, communities and individuals for over seven years now with similar obsession and commitment deployed to IPOB, Nigeria will be a better place.\u201d",

          "title": "FG to Rake in N23bn from Onitsha River Port in 30 Years \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Kasim Sumaina in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Minister of State for Transportation, Senator Gbemisola Saraki, has revealed that the Onitsha River Port is positioned to generate over N23 billion to the federal government in 30 years.\n\nSenator Saraki disclosed this in Abuja on Thursday, during the signing of an agreement between the federal government and Universal Elysium Consortium Limited on the concession of the Onitsha River Port.\n\nAccording to the minister, the port will among other things ensure that the 60 per cent shipped cargoes which hitherto go through Onne Port in River State would be transported directly to Onitsha.\n\nShe added that the port had lots of economic benefits to the country, noting, \u201cThere is a lot of economic growth, there is going to be creation of wealth, creation of jobs, security and greater development\n\nSaraki further hinted that \u201cthe Baro, Lokoja and Oguta ports, which are at different stages of completion, will be considered after the Onitsha Port. The most important thing is that we already have interest from potential investors who want to actually take over these ports.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for the Onitsha River Port, we hope it is a catalyst for other river ports, so that it will decongest other ports and bring about growth. You know the traffic on our roads, the state of our roads as well as the tankers and freight being moved on our roads have now reduced.\n\n\u201cAnd so it is a very good thing and we are exceptionally proud that at long last we have actually achieved this. It\u2019s being signed and we look forward to the growth there to materialize,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Managing Director, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Dr. George Moghalu, who signed on behalf of the federal government, disclosed that the Onitsha Port has a lot of potential in terms of revenue generation and job creation.\n\nMoghalu, while speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the event said: \u201cThis is a milestone. It is a project that by the time I came into the office in 2019, they had been on it five years before trying to get this one port concession.\n\n\u201cSo, it has been very tasking, a lot of departments involved as it is not something that is domiciled only in NIWA. It requires the involvement of various organisations.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NIWA boss, Onitsha River Port is the gateway to the South-east and will address the pressure on the roads and reduce the volume of cargo transported via roads to the South-east because the roads are not designed to carry the kind of weight they are carrying.\n\nHe said, \u201cOver 60 per cent of the containers that arrive Nigeria through Onne, Tin Can or Apapa Port ends up in Onitsha and what it translates is that these containers are moved by trailers. Onitsha Port is very well positioned to play a key role in addressing all these.\u201d\n\nMoghalu, however, commended the concessionaires in the efforts they were already making in bringing in investors into the country and expressed hope that the concessioning would open up opportunities for other ports in the country to be given due consideration.\n\nOn his part, Acting Director-General, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC), Mr. Michael Ohiani, said that the 30 years concession would generate over N23 billion to the federal government.\n\n\u201cAfter a rigorous procurement process, Universal Elysium Consortium emerged as the preferred concessionaire for the concession of Onitsha River Port.\u201d\n\nOhiani said that over the 30-year concession period, the concessionaire will be responsible for all the activities and maintenance of the port, adding, \u201cThe asset along with the entire infrastructure will be returned to the authorities at the end of the concession period.\u201d\n\nThe Concessionaire, Onitsha River Port, Dr. George Nwagwu, noted that they are very comfortable being the concessionaire of Onitsha River Port.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe have always been leaders in private sector led finance for infrastructure in Nigeria. So, we are not new and for me, it\u2019s a challenge we are ready to take and the one that we make sure it works.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to spend considerable amount of money to rehabilitate the port and put it into use and make sure that it runs well. The concession is to rehabilitate, operate and after 30 years, transfer back to the government. We are supposed to make an investment of about N4 billion in the first instance and over the years, we will continue to make money,\u201d Nwagwu said.",

          "text": "Ahamefula Ogbu\n\n\n\nEroton Exploration and Production Company Limited, an indigenous oil and gas company has blamed sabotage for the oil spill which was reported at its facility at the Cawthorn Channel 15 Well head and condemned it as reprehensible and a negative action against the environment.\n\nA statement by the company yesterday empathised with the host and impacted communities whom they promised responsible and professional conduct in its operations which conform to global best practices.\n\n\u201cThe incident is attributed to sabotage from unknown persons, as the short string has been shut-in since 1988 due to High Gas Oil Ratio (HGOR), while the long string watered out and quit in 1991,\u201d a statement Eroton\u2019s Head of External Affairs and Corporate Communications, Mercy Max-Ebibai.\n\nAccording to her, \u201ca preliminary Joint Investigative Visit (JIV) found that the entire valves on the Christmas Tree, wellhead accessories (such as the control valves, tree caps, etc.) were removed. The vandals also removed the Well platform and gangway making it more complicated to intervene on the flowing well. The removal of the platform means our technicians have nothing to stand on in attempting to control the unplanned flow as the well is standing at about 30feet above sea level.\n\n\u201cOn inspection by our team of engineers and service contractors (marred by poor visibility from crude flow and height), it was observed that the crude oil leak is most likely from three (3) points: the Well Christmas Tree Cap, Swab and Wing Valves, which were carted away by the vandals.\u201d\n\nShe explained that so far, all regulatory obligations had been adhered to with the relevant authorities duly notified within the allowed window like statutory Form A to NOSDRA, NUPRC, NNPC and other JV partners, the Ministry of Environment and the principal representatives of the respective Community Development Boards (CDB).\n\nMax-Ebibai confirmed that representatives of all the stakeholders took part in the preliminary joint investigation, adding that in spite of numerous challenges encountered, oil spill containment activities had continued.\n\n\u201cThe containment booms have been deployed and reinforced to contain the spill spread. Oil recovery has commenced with the mechanical skimming of free phase oil, whilst a Wild Well control vendor, and our engineers are being deployed to site to establish Well Control across all the flowing points on the Christmas Tree with a view to get the well under control.\n\n\u201cConstruction of a platform which would be installed around the flowing well to provide a standing point at height for the intervention technicians is currently in progress; the company is proactively reprioritising its security architecture to ensure additional measures in the monitoring of these vulnerable sites, to minimize potential vandalism and spill incidents such as this in the future,\u201d she said.\n\nEroton said it was pained at the effect on the community and environment but would investigate spill volume and environmental impact once containment was completed in line with its tradition of fostering the subsisting good relationship with their host communities, the company will find a middle ground to alleviate the impact of the unfortunate spill.\n\nIt said it would fulfill all its obligations notwithstanding that, \u201ccompensations are not paid for well vandalism and sabotage incidents, promising to the Clean-up exercise following the planned JIV would also be concluded in the shortest possible time with all safety precautions and observance from all stakeholders.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe new Governor of Rotary International District 9125, Goddy Nnadi, yesterday, unveiled his goals for the 2022/2023 Rotary Year.\n\nNnadi who spoke at a press conference in Abuja, said promotion of healthcare, blood donation, mental health, water, sanitation and peace building would be top on his priority projects as Governor of the District in the next one year.\n\nHe said the Rotary District 9125 would be collaborating with the National Blood Service Commission in promoting the culture of blood donation in order to save accident victims and patients in dire need of blood transfusion.\n\nHe added that the District under his administration would also promote awareness on and treatment of mental health issues which is fast becoming a major issue for society and families.\n\nHe said the District is finalising arrangements to build a 24-hour service hospital in Abuja to be manned by rotarians in the medical field within the city.\n\nAccording to him water and sanitation geared towards curbing open defecation in schools would be a another top priority for his administration.\n\nHe said the District would also promote and encourage peace Building efforts by collaborating with relevant authorities through its Institute of Peace Building.\n\nRotary District 9125 is composed of 143 clubs, spread across 23 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), which makes it the largest Rotary District in the country.\n\nNnadi who has just taken over as the Governor of Rotary International District 9125, said: \u201cFor us our star projects are about four. One is that we intend to work with the National Blood Bank to expand by blood bank system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is to ensure that the hospitals have blood available to them for accident victims. We have contact with the Director General of the National Blood Bank, we have had series of meetings and we developed a Memorandum of Understanding through which Rotary District 9125 will work with them, first of all, to make our members donate blood and then create awareness for more people to donate blood.\n\n\u201cSo the blood will be certified okay, stored and made available for hospitals for helping those in need so that we don\u2019t recurring cases of hospitals not having blood.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the issue of mental health is becoming a serious issue. There are do many causes for that even though I am not a medical doctor \u2013 those who take drugs, those who are depressed, dementia \u2013 and is becoming so much that sometimes we don\u2019t understand it.\n\n\u201cIf it is not treated early the people will now become fully mental and it becomes an issue for society and for families.\n\n\u201cWe are going to create awareness about that and we are going to collaborate with so many foreign institutions.\n\n\u201cWe already have two American institutions and one from Switzerland. In fact, the first team will be arriving here in September for us to work them to see how we can, one, conduct seminars and workshops and then see how treatment can be done through the hospitals and healthcare centers.\n\n\u201cFor number three, we are thinking about developing a 24-hour service hospital within Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe framework is being worked out and we are going to have the FCT involved in that. The hospital is going to run 24 hours in the sense that we are going to have our members who are involved in the medical field.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in NIPSS, our study was on universal healthcare delivery and we touched so many states, hospitals and healthcare centres. Some of them didn\u2019t have doctors and nurses.\n\n\u201cMany of them didn\u2019t even have auxiliary nurses to take care of patients. In some of them, people were sitting on the floor and we thought that wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\u201cSometimes, we build healthcare centres and handover to local authorities and they are not well managed.\n\n\u201cSo we said fine, why don\u2019t we build one as a test case with the support of the state or FCT, get it done and ensure 24 hour power supply \u2013 we are going to have inverters, solar snd the normal public power supply.\n\n\u201cTwo, we are collaborating with our partners outside of Nigeria to build and equip those hospitals and then we use our members in the medical field to help service those hospitals on a shift basis.\u201d\n\nOn the plan of the his administration to curb open defecation, Nnadi said: \u201cThe next one is water and sanitation which leads me to the issue of open defecation.\n\n\u201cWe have found out that in some of the schools that there is a real issue. The real issue is, you build schools and you build just one toilet to be used by both students and teachers \u2013 male and female \u2013 snd and that makes it susceptible for teachers to abuse some of these students.\n\n\u201cWe think that is wrong. We have done an experiment and we have built one or two here and there and we separated the toilets. We built for teachers separately, built for students separately, built for male and female separately and you find out that the issue of abuse in that place has stopped.\n\n\u201cWe intend to encourage all our clubs to make sure that these are done so that females are not abused and that they also have self esteem.\u201d",

He had his master\u2019s programme at the London School of Economics and Political Sciences in 2005 under the UK government\u2019s Chevening Scholarship Programme.\n\nHe has served in legal firms as well as financial institutions as a solicitor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPam started his career in 1989 as a junior counsel at F. O. Fagbohungbe & Co., (Legal Practitioners) in Lagos and moved to Continental Merchant Bank Nigeria Plc, Lagos as a senior supervisor in 1991.\n\nIn 1995, he continued in the legal space and served as a senior counsel, special legal assistant, chief legal officer, and programmes coordinator at J Y Pam & Co., in Jos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had his first presence internationally at the ICC as an analyst and investigator/trial coordinator in 2012. He also served in the integrity and anti-corruption department (IACD), African Development Bank, Tunis/Abidjan, and as chief investigations officer, office of internal oversight services (OIOS), United Nations, Juba and also as the resident investigator, UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) in 2016 with concurrent accreditation to the United Nations Interim Security Force in Abyei (UNISFA).\n\nPAM\u2019S VISION FOR ICC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPam said he would apply his wealth of expertise, commitment and knowledge to transform the ICC system and tender maximum impact.\n\n\u201cIt will be my priority to adequately resource and motivate the staff of the ICC to execute their tasks and to ensure that the work environment is both physically and psychologically conducive to the fulfilment of the mission of ICC personnel. The value of a conducive workplace in the attainment of the noble mission of the Court cannot be exaggerated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am aware that this is currently an important issue in consequence of the report of the Independent Expert Review Panel appointed by the Assembly of States Parties as part of the overall Court-wide review of the ICC. As Registrar, I would as a matter of priority familiarise myself with the status of implementation of the recommendations of the IER Panel report, starting with the creation of a coordination mechanism to define implementation modalities common to the three Organs of the Court. I will engage in discussions with the Presidency and the OTP to work towards the modalities for implementation of the report and identify areas of immediate concern to achieve the resolution of any impediments to reform.\n\n\u201cIn my experience leading accountability functions in UN field missions, at the African Development Bank, and the Green Climate Fund, I have helped to create value-based work cultures that respond to the aspirations of working personnel, and meet the basic standards set for the international civil service and by the administrative tribunals.\n\n\u201cBy executing my primary function in providing integrity oversight at the Green Climate Fund, I enabled the formation of administrative responses to address workplace issues. Some of the features of the reforms that were instituted by the executive director of the Fund include open and transparent consultation processes that defined the values of the institution and created an improved Employee Value Proposition; strengthened internal redress mechanisms of the Fund to create effective alternative, non-conflictual redress options for staff conflicts (including a strengthened Ombudsman function and an office mediator); and enhanced capacity for managers and supervisors to improve their management practices in addressing staff conflicts.\n\n\u201cI would be looking to implement a similar approach at the ICC.\u201d\n\nPam added that he would ensure strict adherence to financial rules, noting that the financial administration of the ICC is a \u201cmatter of the utmost importance\u201d which impacts the effective administration of the court.\n\nHe said this would build trust with state parties and enhance the reputation of the institution amongst all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cI will ensure a highly efficient process for determining needs and resource requirements and then conducting needs-based budget planning, giving due consideration to the efficient use of budgeted resources and the need to ensure value-for-money. Budgeting and financial planning will be conducted in a fully consultative and transparent manner,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI will also ensure strict adherence to financial rules and regulations, with a zero-tolerance for breaches. Strict observance of procurement rules is critical for avoiding waste and fraud. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that corporations lose 5 percent of their revenues annually to fraud. I will therefore enforce 100 percent compliance with all financial regulations, including procurement processes.\n\n\u201cAs a means of preventing the breach of financial, procurement and other regulations, I will employ a two-pronged approach of both training and awareness-raising (to overcome lack of awareness and excuses) and also design a preventative mechanism using a data-driven approach to identify risks of fraud and breaches.\u201d\n\nLIFE AND FAMILY\n\nPam is a household name in Berom, Jos, Plateau state.

No one told him that his quest for an apartment would be rife with blues.\n\n\u201cI experienced tribal discrimination [for the] first time in my life in Lagos when the landlady, a Yoruba woman, told me she can\u2019t rent her house to me because I am Igbo,\u201d said Amadi.\n\nAmadi, who said the landlady was in her 60s, noted that \u201cfor some reason, he thought Lagos would have gone beyond the era of tribalism\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was shocked to witness and experience it for himself that such a thing still happens in Lagos,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have heard people talk about tribalism and all that but to me, I didn\u2019t even want to believe it exists, given that I have friends from every tribe and I haven\u2019t been discriminated against before, but this was strange and coming from Lagos state, the centre of excellence.\u201d\n\nThe demand for affordable housing has increased in the last few years, which is in response to several factors, notably urbanisation and population growth.\n\nRural-urban migration into economic and industrial hubs like Lagos and Abuja has had significant effects on resource allocation, such as housing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile only 27 percent of Nigerians resided in urban areas in the 1980s and 35 percent in the 1990s, according to Statista, in 2020, 51.96 percent of Nigeria\u2019s total population lived in urban areas and cities. That figure is more than half the population of the country.\n\nThe consequential housing deficit has resulted in overcrowding, high cost of rent \u2014 and it also fuels discrimination. Prospective tenants are judged based on tribe, religion, sex, state of origin, type of occupation and religious denomination, among others.\n\nDISCRIMINATION ACROSS ALL TRIBES\n\nFor Tolu Philips, a 30 years old banker, every tribe resident in Lagos is a recipient of one form of discrimination or the other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe banker said despite being a Yoruba man from Ogun state, he was denied an apartment by a Yoruba landlord.\n\n\u201cHad it been I am Igbo, Calabar or Hausa, I can even try to understand the tribal bias and discrimination, but for my fellow Yoruba man refusing to rent an apartment to me because of his previous experiences with other Yoruba men is ridiculous,\u201d said Philips angrily.\n\nHe had been living with his parents in Lagos for several years, but he recently felt it was time to get his place and become fully independent. But given the difficulty he has had to face, returning to his parents\u2019 home is weighing heavily on him.\n\nFestus Okoye has spent nearly a decade helping people secure apartments in Lagos. During that time, he has met landlords and landladies of various tribes who are particular about the nature of persons and tribes they are willing to let live in their apartments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know Lagos is a megacity, and because of that, it gives room to meet different kinds of people and with different good and bad experiences,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost of these house owners make those decisions based on direct or indirect experiences they have had with tenants, so that\u2019s why they had to put measures in place to avoid them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I ACCEPT ONLY THE TRIBE I CAN TRUST\u2019\n\nIn recent years, landlords have been known to commission due diligence reports and background checks on prospective tenants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlawale Ajayi, a retired teacher and Lagos landlord, said this course of action is for cautionary purposes, citing a slew of \u201cterrible\u201d experiences.\n\n\u201cThis is not the only apartment I have in Lagos. I have four more houses in Lagos; one in Surulere, two around Yaba and another in Ikorodu,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\n\u201cSome tenants don\u2019t know how to take care of other people\u2019s properties. My house in Ikorodu is running smoothly because I decided to have only Yoruba and Calabar people. They took the house and clean it as if it belongs to them.\n\n\u201cThe one in Surulere where I have two Edo families, I usually go there to solve cases most time as they are usually the troublesome ones in the compound. To avoid much trouble, I try to accept only the tribe I can trust.\u201d\n\nSamuel Akinyemi believes that the longer one spends as a Lagos house owner, the more previously non-existent biases are formed.\n\nHe said landlords can\u2019t afford to ignore biases if they want their houses in good shape, adding that tribal discrimination is only \u201cone part of the story\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a landlord with over nine houses in Lagos, you must believe me when I say I have had various bitter-sweet experiences with my tenant in this Lagos,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you indicated an interest in my house, I go as far as checking your tribe and the kind of job you, the reason is to be sure you will be able to pay my rent. I have seen situations where some tenants only have initial cash payments for the house, and subsequent payment becomes an issue.\n\n\u201cThere are some jobs or professions I also don\u2019t accept in my house due to my experience with people. I didn\u2019t build houses for charity and nobody can tell me who I want to rent my house to.\u201d\n\nTHE SINGLE WOMAN STRUGGLE\n\nAn online survey conducted by the Guardian revealed that 83.3 percent of Nigerian women experienced housing discrimination as single adults. Single working-class women in Nigeria struggle to rent property, particularly in sought-after states such as Lagos, Abuja, Kano, and Oyo.\n\nVincent Babatunde, an agent around Ajah, said single women are usually advised to present their brothers, male friends, and colleagues to secure accommodation.\n\n\u201cI have experienced it like six to eight times in this job. It is also not always about women, I have also handled cases where landlords will say they don\u2019t want single men in their house,\u201d Babatunde said.\n\nThe reason for rejection came as a shock to Christabel Chona, a staff of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) who has lived in Lagos all her life. When she decided to get a place of her own, the landlady rejected her because she is not married.\n\n\u201cI remember seeing an apartment around Ajao Estate, it was nice and spacious and I liked it, then I approached the landlady with my agent to indicate my interest,\u201d Chona said.\n\n\u201cThe landlady and her husband asked if I am married and when I told them I am still single, they bluntly told me they don\u2019t need a single person in the apartment.\u201d\n\nSince moving to Lagos in 2018, Opeyemi Olakunle, a content creator/producer has been squatting with friends. After saving up enough to get his own place, the 27-year-old was denied an apartment because he revealed that he had no plan to get married in the next three years.\n\n\u201cTwo landlords told me that single people are usually not responsible hence why they cannot afford to give their apartment to them. It was painful and frustrating because I had already paid my agent fee for the house-hunting process,\u201d said Olakunle who eventually secured an apartment in the Surulere area of Lagos.\n\nBut for Bisi Olajide, the reverse was the case as a landlord refused to give her an apartment because she is married.\n\n\u201cIt was like a dream, to be honest. My landlord told me she won\u2019t rent her house to me because I am married and she doesn\u2019t want married people in the compound because of \u2018kids and their noise\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nHUNTING WITH AGENTS\n\nAccording to the Pison Housing Group\u2019s 2019 report, the housing stock in Lagos is estimated to be 1.5 million units, with an estimated population of over 13 million at the time. Finding decent, affordable apartments is therefore becoming increasingly tougher in the state.\n\nIt took months for Lanre Akeredolu, a 29-year-old fashion designer and model, to secure an apartment in Victoria Island. He wanted the location because of the proximity to his place of work.\n\nAkeredolu said he kept doling out cash to different agents before he could secure a decent apartment of his liking. According to him, the issue of profiling by house owners and his agents willfully ignoring his preference made his search longer than necessary.\n\n\u201cSome apartments my agent took me to, the house owner obviously profiled me, given the way I dress as a fashion designer. One literally told me to my face that he just don\u2019t want another Bobrisky in his house. And that was disrespectful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI also think the agents know what they are doing by wasting my time and money. They kept collecting money from me and the houses I was taken to are just not fit for a human being to live in.\u201d\n\nJennifer Okon, a young graduate who recently concluded her NYSC, described her house hunt as \u201cone hell of a journey\u201d.\n\n\u201cLooking back to four months ago when I actively started house hunting, if I [calculate] the agent fees I have paid, it is enough to start a small business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThese agents will make you pay between N5,000 to N7,000 as a fee before they can search for an apartment for you. Even with the specification given to them, they usually end up taking you to low standard houses just to fulfil all righteousness of looking for an apartment for you.\u201d\n\nHUGE MARKET, NON-FUNCTIONING POLICIES\n\nJohn Maduforo, head of marketing and communications, CW Real Estate, said the lack of adequate regulations in the real estate sector encourages the landlords to take \u201cadvantage of the high demand for accommodation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many angles to this problem, the first being that real estate activities in the country are not regulated, so there are no working policies or guidelines surrounding what to charge when it comes to renting accommodation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAlso, the issue of discrimination goes deep into our societal beliefs. A typical example is a fact that our society still thinks it is irresponsible for a lady to live alone except with her parents, or spouse.\n\n\u201cPeople still think a man has to be behind her. As a result, we see unenlightened landlords turning potential tenants down just because of their gender and marital status.\u201d\n\nMaduforo added that problem, although existing nationwide, is prominent in Lagos due to the population surge, and the high demand for \u201caffordable accommodation\u201d which is not properly met.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against Khumbudzo Ntshavheni\u2019s decision to switch off analogue broadcast systems by June 30, 2022, declaring it unconstitutional. Ntshavheni \u2013 who serves as the country\u2019s current Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies \u2013 wants South Africa to migrate to digital broadcast systems.\n\nThis follows an appeal by e.tv and two other applicants, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and SOS Support Public Broadcasting, who sought to overturn a judgment and order of the High Court of South Africa that had ruled in favour of the minister and government earlier this year.\n\nIn 2006, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), of which South Africa is a member, resolved that all member states in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East should migrate from analogue broadcasting systems to digital broadcasting systems by the year 2015.\n\nCurrently, in South Africa, traditional analogue broadcast systems are occupying the frequency bands between 700 MHz and 800 MHz which could be used for mobile data. Digital migration would free up those bands, making the provision of mobile data services cheaper.\n\nTo comply with the ITU resolution, in September 2008, the then minister of communications and digital technologies in South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, published a Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy (BDM Policy) which stated that the analogue switch-off would be on November 1, 2011, 4 years earlier than the ITU\u2019s proposed deadline.\n\nIn February 2021, South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the phased switch-off of analogue transmitters would be completed by the end of March 2022.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the minister made a final call for those qualifying for state-sponsored set-top boxes (STBs) to register, with the deadline for registration set for October 31, 2021. STBs would enable households to continue having access to television channels on their analogue television sets after the analogue switch-off.\n\nAfter this announcement, e.tv brought an application to the High Court against minister Ntshavheni, seeking to prevent the minister from disconnecting millions of people who had not yet migrated to digital transmission.\n\nIn the court order, the applicants wanted the minister to, among other requests, consult all affected parties before determining the analogue switch-off date as well as provide a report on the steps taken to ensure access to STBs within 1 month of the date of the court order.\n\nIn its judgement on March 28, the court had accepted that out of over 14 million television sets in South Africa, 10.5 million were compliant with digital transmission and 3.75 million were analogue.\n\nThe High Court held that 3 months would be sufficient to allow the minister to complete the outstanding installation of STBs in households with analogue television sets.\n\nIn the final ruling, the High Court dismissed the application from e.tv, MMA and SOS but extended the analogue switch-off date to June 30, 2022.\n\nFollowing the ruling by the High Court, e.tv, MMA and SOS appealed the matter against the minister in the Constitutional Court arguing that the Minister had a duty to consult the public, including the applicants, before imposing the STB registration cut-off date and determining the analogue switch-off date.\n\nIn a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court ruled that the power to determine the analogue switch-off date and the registration deadline for STBs is located within the minister\u2019s original constitutional policymaking function. The court thereafter had to determine whether the minister exercised this power rationally and lawfully.\n\nIn that respect, the Constitutional Court held that it was not only irrational but also unlawful for the minister to set a switch-off date without adequate notice to the analogue broadcast providers and the public.\n\nAs to the remedy, the Court held that the decisions of the minister, as well as the order of the High Court, had to be set aside.\n\nThe judgement will further delay South Africa\u2019s migration into digital broadcasting, meaning that services like mobile data which could do with the freed-up space on the frequency spectrum as a result of digital migration will continue to be expensive, further hurting citizens\u2019 pockets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "95% of youths say Nigeria heading in wrong direction",
          "text": "A new survey of more than four thousand five hundred young people in Africa including Nigeria provides yet another damning verdict of how the continent\u2019s most populous nation is heading in the wrong direction despite its leader Muhammadu Buhari saying the country is in a better place today than he met it in 2015.\n\nIn the survey of youths in fifteen African countries and in which the youths were asked if they thought their country was headed in the wrong direction, Nigeria comes at the very bottom with a whooping 95% of the youths aged 18-24 saying Nigeria has lost it way in the wilderness. Compare that with only 41% of youths in Ghana and 58% in Uganda who say their country was headed in the wrong direction.\n\nRwanda comes out top with only 40% of its youths saying their country was heading in the wrong direction.\n\nThe statistics from the African Youth Survey 2022, carried out in 15 countries by the South African Ichikowitz Family Foundation, back up the pessimism expressed in BBC interviews by the BBC.\n\nA telling result from the survey shows that young Nigerians have the most negative opinion in the whole continent about the direction their country is headed, with 95% saying things are going badly. Of all those surveyed, only 28% felt positively about the trajectory of Nigeria.\n\nThe youths in Nigeria and other countries point to bad leadership, insecurity and tough economic conditions including rising levels of unemployment as reasons for losing hope in the country and for wanting to get out.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian insecurity is so appalling,\u201d says 18-year-old Ayoade Oni from Lagos. This is one of the main reasons he wants to leave Nigeria.\n\nLast year he was nearly kidnapped in \u201cbroad daylight\u201d. He was on his way home from the phone repair shop when a gang approached him, demanding he hand over his belongings.\n\nHe resisted and was \u201cwalking very fast\u201d to try and get away. He thought he had found refuge when he stumbled on a nearby shop with people inside who tried to lure him in, telling him he was safe with them.\n\nBut it was a trap.\n\nSuddenly, a bus driver pulled up and warned him the people were \u201ckidnappers\u201d, instructing him to get inside the vehicle. \u201cThat saved me that day,\u201d he recalls.\n\nNigeria is currently facing a kidnapping for ransom crisis, with perpetrators collecting millions of dollars over the years, according to a Lagos-based think-tank.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go out at night, my parents won\u2019t even allow me,\u201d Mr Oni said. They have set him a curfew to be home by 18.30 each night.A \u201chigh unemployment rate, poor health sector, low standard of living [and] little to no job opportunities\u201d, are the other reasons Mr Oni cites for wanting to leave the country.\n\nAs for eventually getting a job after he graduates with a degree in Computer Science, he is not optimistic. Most graduates are left with no option but to compete for the \u201cfew employment positions available, with most people being employed by connections or corruption\u201d, he said.\n\nIf he left Nigeria, and relocated to Canada where he has his heart set on, he would have no intention of moving back to Nigeria. Most of his friends feel the same: \u201c90% if not all of them\u201d want to leave Nigeria, he says.\n\nThe world needs to wake up and invest in Africa, so that young Africans do not feel they have to move abroad to achieve their dreams at the expense of their home countries, according to the man behind the survey, Ivor Ichikowitz.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bigger than a brain drain,\u201d Mr Ichikowitz told the BBC Newsday programme. \u201cThis group of people, 18 to 24 year olds in Africa, are saying: \u2018We are going to improve our lives, even if it means having to leave and go somewhere else.'\u201d\n\nHe said the fact so many young Africans wanted to move abroad could cause a migration crisis, describing it as \u201calarming\u201d.\n\nIn the previous edition of the African Youth Survey conducted before the pandemic, most of the young people interviewed wanted to stay in their home nation and build a life for themselves there, Mr Ichikowitz said.\n\nA lot of the young people his foundation spoke to wanted to move to South Africa, Europe or the US. But although South Africa was seen as \u201cthe holy grail\u201d for many in other African countries, those in South Africa begged to differ, and wanted to move to the US or Europe, he said.\n\nRead also: Innovative solutions to youth unemployment in Nigeria\n\nIt is in the interests of the whole world to keep young Africans, who estimates say will make up 42% of the world\u2019s young people by 2030, \u201cconstructively engaged in Africa\u201d, Mr Ichikowitz said.\n\nThat is exactly what some young people in Ghana who the BBC spoke to plan on doing.\n\nGhanaians feel the second-most positive on the continent about the future of their country after Rwanda, with 56% saying they are pleased.\n\n\u201cI can make it in Ghana because even though there are not strong institutions, and our systems seem to be weak \u2013 the lack of these could also mean that a smart social climber can break those barriers,\u201d says 24-year-old Julius Kwame Anthony, the former head of the National Union of Ghana Students. \u201cRelocating abroad may look rosy but nothing is really promised out there,\u201d he explained.\n\nSimilar sentiments were echoed by 33-year-old businessman in Ghana, Ernest Larmie: \u201cThis is home, if I\u2019m able to solve the problems here, when the next generation comes, they can also benefit ,\u201d he says, questioning the logic behind moving abroad, just to help another country develop at the expense of your own.",

          "title": "Nigeria risks economic sanctions as US lawmakers push its designation as religiously intolerant",
          "text": "Five members of the United States Senate have written to the United States Secretary of State Anthony Blinken urging him to restore Nigeria\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern for religious intolerance following the recent spate of killings of Christians in the country, a move that could translate to new economic sanctions.\n\nThe Senators: Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio, Mike Braun, James Inhofe and Tom Cotton, said the recent high-profile acts of violence underscore the intense religious persecution that is regularly experienced by Nigerian Christians which has worsened in recent years\n\nCountry of Particular Concern (CPC) is a designation by the United States Secretary of State (under authority delegated by the President) of a nation guilty of particularly severe violations of religious freedom under the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) of 1998 and its amendment of 1999 (Public Law 106-55).\n\nRead also: Tim Farron: A victim of the intolerant secularism\n\nThe term \u201cparticularly severe violations of religious freedom\u201d means systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom, including violations related to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; prolonged detention without charges; abduction and other flagrant denials of the right to life, liberty, or the security of persons.\n\nNations so designated are subject to further actions, including economic sanctions, by the United States. Economic sanctions can range from travel bans and export restrictions to trade embargos and asset seizures.\n\nThe U.S. believes it is their responsibility to provide information regarding the status of religious freedom worldwide so that the international community can identify and implement solutions to address challenges to religious freedom\n\nIn a letter dated June 29, 2022, signed by the five US lawmakers and addressed to the Secretary of State, they reminded Blinken that \u201clast year, you inexplicably removed Nigeria\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC).\u201d\n\nWhile noting the lack of demonstrable improvement in the country\u2019s religious freedom conditions, the Senators stated: \u201cThe situation in Nigeria has grown worse. We previously urged you to immediately reverse your misguided decision, and we write today to renew our call.\u201d\n\nSome of the instances cited to support the notion of religious intolerance in Nigeria, include the massacre of churchgoers on Pentecost Sunday in Ondo State and the stoning of a Christian college student, Deborah Yakubu.\n\n\u201cSadly, such violence has become all too familiar for Christians in Africa\u2019s most populous country\u2026On Pentecost Sunday, gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria\u2019s Ondo State, reportedly killing at least 50 churchgoers.\n\n\u201cLast month, a violent mob brutally stoned to death Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu, a student at Shehu Shagari College of Education in Northwest Nigeria. According to reports, some Islamist students were enraged by a \u2018blasphemous\u2019 message Deborah had posted in a WhatsApp group, in which she said that \u2018Jesus Christ is the greatest. He helped me pass my exams.\u2019 Merely expressing one\u2019s Christian faith has apparently become tantamount to a death sentence in many parts of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe senators said one report documented more than 4, 650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021, adding, \u201cAccordingly, Nigeria earns the dubious honour-for the second consecutive year of being the deadliest country on earth for Christians.\u201d\n\nUrging swift action \u201con this important matter,\u201d the lawmakers told Blinken: \u201cThe State Department released its 2021 report on International Religious Freedom on June 2, which starts the 90-day timeline for the department to make its religious freedom designations.\n\n\u201cGiven the abysmal state of religious freedom in Nigeria, it is incumbent upon you to reverse last year\u2019s decision and re-designate the country as a CPC. The moment demands that you do so without delay.\n\n\u201cDespite public statements from you and other State Department officials condemning the recent bloodshed in Nigeria, the fact remains that the Department still does not officially regard Nigeria as a severe violator of religious freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we previously wrote to you, we were met with a response which failed to answer our questions about why the State Department views Nigeria as not having engaged in or tolerated \u2018systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom\u2019 or even severe violations of religious freedom,\u201d they said.\n\nIn December 2020, the U.S. Department of State designated Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan as Countries of Particular Concern.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s unending \u2018war\u2019\n\nNigeria\u2019s inclusion for the first time ever was due to systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom. Violent attacks by Boko Haram and ethno-religious conflict have become more frequent, and are exacerbated by the judiciary system with blasphemy laws.\n\nNigeria was removed from the list in 2021.",

          "title": "Oil prices are rising, Nigeria can\u2019t get it together",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s oil output has fallen the lowest in over a decade at a time some analysts are forecasting a $200 per barrel oil in the face of surging demand on account of Russian aggression and underinvestment due to climate concerns.\n\nAlready, Nigeria is shedding its position as Africa\u2019s top oil producer, multinational oil companies are fleeing onshore fields, final investment decisions on oil projects which started over a decade ago have stalled, sabotage of oil infrastructure have worsened and fuel subsidy payments are eroding government revenue as never before.\n\nThe Nigerian government response has complicated matters. Under Buhari\u2019s administration, the subpar quality of policy making and execution, inability to read the energy landscape, an obsession with litigating the past in phantom corruption fights, and a lack of pragmatic, business-oriented approach to resolving sticky situations have denied Nigeria benefits from rising prices today and build for tomorrow.\n\nIn 2016, crude oil prices crashed below $30 per barrel on account of a global recession. In Nigeria, sabotage from Niger Delta militants roiled the sector and other countries were implementing smart policies like Egypt who began a phased removal of fuel and electricity subsidies, the Nigerian government hemmed and hawed and failed to remove subsidies or deal with foreign exchange challenges.\n\nIn the face of rising oil prices, last year, in just the first six months of the year, subsidies have gulped about N2 Trillion. Data from the NNPC shows that the state oil company continues to be handicapped in meeting its remittance obligations on account of subsidy obligations.\n\nSabotage\n\nIn 2021, Nigeria lost on average about 200,000 barrels per day of oil output and a report published by Analysts at Wood Mackenzie in April, detailed how two of the country\u2019s most prolific oil infrastructure became prime targets for criminals.\n\nThe report revealed that Shell\u2019s Bonny and the Brass oil pipeline system owned by the upstream Joint Venture (JV) between Eni, NPDC and Oando, were facing systemic crude oil theft as attacks shifted from the west to the east.\n\n\u201cThe scale and sophistication of crude thefts suggests an organised operation on an industrial scale,\u201d said analysts at Wood Mackenzie.\n\nThe report stated that theft and vandalism hit Shell\u2019s Bonny pipeline system the hardest leading to the declaration of force majeure at the Bonny terminal in March 2022 due to a drop in crude output.\n\nThe Bonny oil pipeline system, the largest pipeline network in the Niger Delta and transports oil, water, and associated gas from the eastern and central delta to the Bonny oil and gas terminal. Its terminal, situated on Bonny Island, 48 kilometres southeast of Port Harcourt, is the biggest in Africa with a capacity to process and export 1.25 million barrels per day (b/d) but operators like Heirs Holdings report losing over 70 percent of the crude oil passing through the pipeline.\n\nSabotage of crude oil pipelines is a key reason driving the multinationals away from the Niger Delta which translates to huge revenue loss to Nigeria, the government is keen to stall the exit of multinationals and are placing obstacles on their paths.\n\nThe state oil firm says that many of the oil and gas assets divested since 2012, were not properly decommissioned and will increase scrutiny over new deals. On ExxonMobil\u2019s plan to sell its 40 percent stake in its Nigerian onshore assets, the NNPC said that it should have the right of first refusal over any sale as a joint venture partner.\n\nHowever, analysis of the NNPC joint Operating Agreement with oil companies by analysts at Wood Mackenzie found that since this is share sale rather than an asset sale, NNPC lacks pre-emption rights.\n\n\u201cBecause this is a corporate acquisition, NNPC has no rights to pre-empt a deal under the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA), which governs the JV. This means that ministerial consent would be the only hurdle remaining,\u201d the note said.\n\nThe deal has stalled anyway because the President who doubles as minister of Petroleum Resources has withheld ministerial assent required for the deal to proceed.\n\nNow Shell is facing another challenge completing its divestments. It was set to receive two final offers for its onshore oil and gas fields in Nigeria by Heirs Oil and Gas Ltd. and ND Western Ltd vying for Shell\u2019s 30 percent stake in the joint venture, which operates assets in the Niger Delta and nearby offshore areas.\n\nShell\u2019s stake was valued at $2.3 billion by energy consultant Wood Mackenzie Ltd. last year, assuming a long-term oil price of $50 per barrel. However, with Brent trading at around $121, the stake is likely worth much more.\n\nShell announced its intention last year to sell the stake, saying its long-term energy transition strategy was incompatible with Nigerian operations prone to spills and theft. Ben van Beurden, Chief Executive Officer, Shell Plc, told shareholders in May that a significant increase in sabotage in recent years had resulted in a state of near-lawlessness that the company couldn\u2019t control.\n\nHowever, legal disputes about an oil spill in Port Harcourt have stalled the deal. On June 16, Nigeria\u2019s supreme court had asked Shell to comply with a high court ruling which barred the oil major from any asset sale in Nigeria until a decision is reached on the dispute over a 2019 oil spill is resolved between the company and a community in the oil-rich Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cShell welcomes the Nigerian Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear the appeal of the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) in this case,\u201d the London-based company said in a statement sent to BusinessDay on Thursday.\n\nRead also: Global recession fears dragging oil prices down as Nigeria remains bystander\n\nStalled projects\n\nDue to Nigeria\u2019s inability to quickly reform the fiscal and regulatory framework of its oil and gas sector, several projects have stalled with multinational oil companies pushing to future dates final investments decisions.\n\nIn Nigeria, several oil and gas projects including the 120,000bpd Zabazaba-Etan project; 140,000bpd Bosi project; 110,000bpd Uge project and 100,000bpd Nsiko deepwater project; 1billion barrel Owowo field development await final investment decisions.\n\nRather than devise pragmatic solutions to get these projects off the ground, the Nigerian government is chasing shadows. This is seen in the time and resources devoted to fighting the Malabu oil deal and suing Morgan Chase for damages. The government is spending a fortune paying lawyers to litigate the past while the future is blowing right past it in a stunning display of lack of vision competence.\n\nRussia\u2019s war with Ukraine has provided prepared nations with an opportunity to make a pile of money based on supply gaps in Europe but gas-rich Nigeria with over 209 trillion cubic feet of gas cannot find enough for its citizens to cook their meals.\n\nAnalysts say Nigeria needs to begin full implementation of its petroleum industry law, engage professionals to run the sector and execute smarter policies like full deregulation of the downstream sector to have a fighting chance of reaping the benefits of its vast resources before the world completely moves away from oil.",
          "summary": "In 2016, crude oil prices crashed below $30 per barrel on account of a global recession.\nIn the face of rising oil prices, last year, in just the first six months of the year, subsidies have gulped about N2 Trillion.\nThe Bonny oil pipeline system, the largest pipeline network in the Niger Delta and transports oil, water, and associated gas from the eastern and central delta to the Bonny oil and gas terminal.\nThe state oil firm says that many of the oil and gas assets divested since 2012, were not properly decommissioned and will increase scrutiny over new deals.\nThis is seen in the time and resources devoted to fighting the Malabu oil deal and suing Morgan Chase for damages.",

He did not go to France as speculated. This is to debunk the propaganda of the APC through Igbokwe. This is fake news orchestrated by the sinking ruling party which is on its way out, \u201d he said in a phone chat today.\n\nAsked what is their mission to Istanbul, he said; \u201cWhat is your business with our mission?

(Mrs) Aramide Adeyoye said the bridge is expected to be delivered in June 2023.\n\nShe said the bridge apart from providing infrastructure and transport solutions to millions of Lagos residents, will also bring to bear innovation, adding that when completed, the bridge would have a positive impact on the health of residents who will have the opportunity to exercise on it, just like the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge\n\nAdeyoye, said the project concept designed by the Ministry of Works and Infrastructures in conjunction with the Ministry of Transportation, will not only provide an infrastructure solution, but also a transport solution that ensures value and relief for the motoring public.\n\nAlso speaking, Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederick Oladeinde, said the Opebi-Ojota Link Bridge is a demonstration of the Sanwo-Olu administration\u2019s plan to regenerate Lagos by providing residents with infrastructure that would be complemented by the recently inter-modal transportation system, befitting of a mega city like Lagos, while also easing gridlock across the metropolis.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at all the projects that we are doing, they are projects that will either connect communities or projects that will make our public transport better. So the focus of this project (Ojota-Opebi Link Bridge) is on public transport. We are building infrastructure so that we people can move efficiently and decently from one point to the other.",

From now on, anybody who dares blaspheme Jesus Christ, they will taste the fire of the Almighty God.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on attacks on churches, the cleric who is popularly known as Daddy G.O, said:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say much, because I know whatever I say, some people may want to twist it. But I\u2019ve searched the Bible from cover to cover and there is nowhere in the Bible where God said a child of God cannot defend himself.\n\n\u201cIf you find the place, let me know. He said, if they slap you on the right cheek, turn the left. If they now slap the left, what did he say? When God is silent, do you know the meaning of that, it simply means, over to you.\n\n\u201cEvery enemy of the church, as long as my Father is still on the throne, as long as Jesus lives, as long as His name is the consuming fire, if they don\u2019t repent, the fire of God will consume them.

          "text": "Six governors of the Peoples Democratic Party [PDP] are believed to have resolved to work against the 2023 Presidential campaign of the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar.\n\nAccording to a report by Daily Sun, the PDP governors, predominantly from the South are now openly against Atiku\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nThe source listed some of the governors as Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Samuel Ortom of Benue State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Ishaku Darius of Taraba and Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, as governors unwilling to support Atiku\u2019s bid.\n\nThe source said when Wike lost the primary election to Atiku, party leaders agreed that it would be best to pick him as the running mate to Atiku.\n\nHe revealed the aforementioned governors met with Atiku and other leaders to pick Wike as a popular choice, but were ignored by Ayu and Atiku, who are believed to be micro-managed by some powerful Northern leaders.\n\nHe said though they may not defect to the APC, they\u2019re likely to sabotage the chances of the PDP from within.\n\n\u201cThe governors can\u2019t and won\u2019t defect. They understand that clearly. If they defect now, their candidates can\u2019t win elections. Some of them are gunning for a second term. But they\u2019ll sabotage Atiku the same way PDP governors sabotaged President Goodluck Johnathan in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf you recall, many governors of the PDP, especially from the North, worked for the emergence of Buhari. They didn\u2019t leave the PDP, but they sabotaged it from within. That\u2019s what may play out in the case of Atiku.\n\n\u201cThere is a general consensus from Southern leaders that power should return to the region. And many PDP governors are close friends of the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. They will work for him. If that happens, hold Atiku and Ayu responsible,\u201d the angry source further revealed.\n\nCurrently, Wike and Ikpeazu are in Turkey on their annual vacation.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

Part of the money paid to the vendor, precisely a sum of N322 million transferred by Suiming Electrical Ltd on behalf of Nwaoboshi and Golden Touch Construction Project Ltd , was alleged to be part of proceeds of fraud.\n\nBut in his judgment, Justice Aneke held that the prosecution failed to call vital witnesses and tender concrete evidence to prove the elements of the offences for which it charged the defendants.\n\nJustice Aneke said the evidence of PW2 \u201cproved that the third defendant obtained a loan of N1.2 billion from Zenith Bank for purchase of additional equipment and as provision of working capital.\n\n\u201cIt also proved that the loan of N1.2 billion together with interest of N24 million was properly granted to the third. Nothing else was proved by the complainant or prosecutor in this case,\u201d the judge said.\n\nHe claimed a fatal blow was dealt the case of the prosecution by its failure to call officials of Sterling Bank \u201cto testify and probably tender exhibits F and F10\u201d.\n\nConsequently, he discharged and acquitted the defendants.\n\nHowever ruling on the EFCC\u2019s appeal on Friday, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in dismissing the charges against the respondents. It said the prosecution had proved the ingredients of the offence and consequently found the defendants guilty as charged.",

          "text": "President Joe Biden predicted on Friday that some U.S. states will try to arrest women for crossing state lines to get abortions after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to the procedures nationwide.\n\nThirteen Republican-led states banned or severely restricted the procedure under so-called \u201ctrigger laws\u201d after the court struck down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling last week. Women in those states seeking an abortion may have to travel to states where it remains legal.\n\nConvening a virtual meeting on abortion rights with Democratic state governors on Friday, Biden said he thinks \u201cpeople are gonna be shocked when the first state \u2026 tries to arrest a woman for crossing a state line to get health services.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think people believe that\u2019s gonna happen. But it\u2019s gonna happen, and it\u2019s gonna telegraph to the whole country that this is a gigantic deal that goes beyond; I mean, it affects all your basic rights\u201d.\n\nBiden said the federal government will act to protect women who need to cross state lines to get an abortion and ensure their access to medication in states where it\u2019s banned.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, told the meeting her state \u201cwill not cooperate\u201d on any attempts to track down women who have had abortions to punish them. \u201cWe will not extradite,\u201d she said.\n\nAbortion rights groups have filed legislation in multiple states seeking to preserve the ability of women to terminate pregnancies.\n\nJudges in Florida, Louisiana, Texas and Utah have since issued decisions preventing those states from enforcing new restrictive abortion laws, while Ohio\u2019s top court on Friday declined to block the Republican-led state from enforcing an abortion ban. read more\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul told the group that \u201cjust a handful of states\u201d are going to have to take care of health of women across the country.\n\n\u201cThere is such stress out there,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cIt is a matter of life and death for American women,\u201d she added.\n\nBiden also told the group there were not enough votes in the Senate to scrap a supermajority rule known as the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade\u2019s protections into law.\n\nHe had proposed that senators remove the filibuster but the suggestion was shot down by aides to key Democratic lawmakers. read more\n\n\u201c(The) filibuster should not stand in the way of us being able to (codify Roe),\u201d Biden said.",

          "text": "New York state passed a law on Friday banning guns from many public places, including Times Square, and requiring gun-license applicants to prove their shooting proficiency and submit their social media accounts for review by government officials.\n\nThe law, passed in an emergency legislative session, was forced by a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last week that struck down New York\u2019s restrictive gun-license laws. The court\u2019s conservative majority ruled for the first time that the U.S. Constitution grants an individual the right to carry weapons in public for self-defense.\n\nNew York\u2019s Democratic leaders have decried the ruling and the court, saying there will be more gun violence if there are more people carrying guns.\n\nThey conceded they must loosen the state\u2019s century-old permit scheme to comply with the ruling, but sought to keep as many restrictions as they could in the name of public safety. Some will likely be targets for further legal challenges.\n\nThe court ruled that New York\u2019s former license regime, which dates from 1911, gave too much discretion to officials to deny a permit.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who ordered the extraordinary session in the legislature, said the state\u2019s gun-licensing regulations had resulted in New York having the fifth-lowest rate of gun deaths of the 50 U.S. states.\n\n\u201cOur state will continue to keep New Yorkers safe from harm, even despite this setback from the Supreme Court,\u201d she told a news conference in the state capital, Albany, while lawmakers were debating the bill. \u201cThey may think they can change our lives with the stroke of a pen, but we have pens, too.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling allowed that people could be banned from carrying weapons in certain \u201csensitive places\u201d but warned lawmakers against applying the label too broadly.\n\nThe court also made it easier for pro-gun groups to have a regulation overturned. It ruled that a weapons regulation was likely unconstitutional if it was not similar to the sort of regulations around in the 18th century, when the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment was ratified, letting states maintain militias and defining a right to \u201ckeep and bear Arms.\u201d\n\nThe law passed on Friday makes it a felony crime to carry a gun into a new list of sensitive places, including: government buildings, medical facilities, places of worship, libraries, playgrounds, parks, zoos, schools, colleges, summer camps, addiction-support centers, homeless shelters, nursing homes, public transit including the New York City subway, places where alcohol or marijuana is consumed, museums, theaters, stadiums and other venues, polling places and Times Square.\n\nThe law passed on Friday makes it a felony crime to carry a gun into a new list of sensitive places, including: government buildings, medical facilities, places of worship, libraries, playgrounds, parks, zoos, schools, colleges, summer camps, addiction-support centers, homeless shelters, nursing homes, public transit including the New York City subway, places where alcohol or marijuana is consumed, museums, theaters, stadiums and other venues, polling places and Times Square.\n\nLaw enforcement officials and registered security guards are among those exempt from the sensitive-place restrictions.\n\nRepublican lawmakers voted against the law, set to take effect on Sept. 1, complaining that it makes the right to carry weapons lesser than other constitutional rights, such as freedom of speech and of religion.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s going to be easier to get a concealed-carry\u201d license, said Mike Lawler, a Republican member of the Assembly, during the debate. \u201cBut you\u2019re not going to be able to carry it anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe National Rifle Association, the powerful gun-owners\u2019 rights group whose local affiliate was the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case, called New York\u2019s law a \u201cflagrant violation\u201d of the ruling by creating more barriers to New Yorkers\u2019 self-defense rights, indicating it may soon face legal challenges.\n\n\u201cGov. Hochul and her anti-Second Amendment allies in Albany have defied the United States Supreme Court with an intentionally malicious rewriting of New York\u2019s concealed carry law,\u201d Darin Hoens, the New York NRA state director, said in a statement.\n\nThe court ruled in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen that New York licensing officials had too much subjective discretion over who could enjoy what it said was a constitutional right. Applicants were denied a concealed-carry permit if they could not convince an official they had \u201cproper cause,\u201d or some kind of special reason, for carrying a handgun for self-defense. read more\n\nReluctantly and not without protest, Hochul agreed the state must remove the \u201cproper cause\u201d requirements, though the law still requires licensing officers find the applicant is of \u201cgood moral character.\u201d read more\n\nThe new licensing rules require applicants to meet with the licensing officer, usually a judge or a police official, for an in-person interview, and provide the contact details of some immediate family members and any adults they live with.\n\nThe law makes it a felony to carry a gun into private business premises unless the business affirmatively gives notice that concealed weapons are welcome.",

          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday described the killing of 30 soldiers, seven mobile policemen and two civilians in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State last Wednesday by terrorists as a direct assault on Nigeria, vowing that the attackers would not go unpunished.\n\nThe security agents were ambushed by the terrorists on their way to a mining site in Shiroro, in response to a distress call. Several Chinese and Nigerian nationals were also abducted at the site.\n\nPresident Buhari also said his government would do everything possible to ensure the return of those abducted.\n\nBuhari in a statement by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, titled, \u201cPresident Buhari: Attack on Shiroro is an attack on Nigeria herself. It will not go unpunished,\u201d declared that wherever the perpetrators of the dastardly act may be, the long hands of the law would catch up with them.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd to the sadists, I say this: we are coming. No matter what rock you crawl under, what hole you sink into, what lie you hide behind, we are coming and we will find you. Shiroro will see justice. Nigeria will know peace.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari paid tributes to the gallant men of the security forces who lost their lives in the process of defending the attack.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe honour our security forces, and particularly those brave souls who have given their lives fighting against the evil that is terrorism. They constitute the best that Nigeria has to offer and we remember each of them.\n\n\u201cSadly, Nigeria\u2019s fight against terrorism continues. It is a battle that is taking its toll on all of us. But we shall not relent, nor shall we surrender.\n\n\u201cWe say it again that we have reduced Boko Haram to a shell of its former self. But terrorists are parasites. They thrive when the world is suffering.\n\n\u201cThis atrocity only serves to further strengthen us against them. Nigeria is united in obliterating these demons. Each day we grow closer to that goal. When they lash out during times of global suffering it is the act of a cornered animal, an act of desperation.\n\n\u201cAs always, their goal is the same: to sow fear and division amongst us. We will not let them.\n\n\u201cInstead let us pray for the families and loved ones of those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against evil, and let us pray for the safe and speedy return of those abducted. We will do everything possible to ensure their return.\u201d\n\nArmy Confirms Attack\n\nArmy spokesperson, Onyema Nwachuckwu, confirmed the attack in Shiroro in a statement last Thursday.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn Wednesday 29 of June 2022, troops of the Nigerian Army deployed in Shiroro general area responded to a distress call about bandits\u2019 attack on people operating in a mining site. Enroute the location, the troops ran into an ambush tagged by the criminal elements. Sadly, a number of personnel paid the supreme price in the fierce firefight that ensued.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the location has been reinforced and troops are on the trail of the criminals with some already neutralised. The GOC 1 Division has moved to the location to take charge of the follow up operations.\n\n\u201cThe NA notes that some clips of the incident have surfaced online and wish to encourage well-meaning Nigerians to exercise some restraint in posting images of such occurrence, mindful that our brothers and sisters who may have lost their breadwinners deserve to be properly notified and not to get such information via the media. We mention this, mindful of the inalienable rights of citizens to use the social media which is respected.\u201d\n\nArmy Chief Vows to Apprehend Terrorists\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya, yesterday, vowed to bring to justice terrorists behind the attack on his men in Shiroro, Niger State.\n\nThe army chief spoke while addressing newsmen at Mogadishu Cantonment Juma\u2019at Mosque prayer in commemoration of the Nigerian Army Day Celebration, (NADCEL) 2022 and the 159 years of its existence.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are not deterred by any challenge from all those criminals. As we speak, we are on their trail and we will and I say we will get those criminals in Niger and other areas throughout the country.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating 159 years of the existence of the Nigerian Army. It is time to reflect on our performance and look back with pride to appreciate the contributions and sacrifices of the officers and the men of the Nigerian Army over the years as a key instrument of national unity and security of the country.\u201d\n\nNIGER EAST SENATOR LAMENTS\n\nThe Senator representing Niger East, Sani Musa, has lamented the killing of the security agents and residents of the Shiroro Local Government Area of the state last Wednesday.\n\nMusa noted with concern that the incessant killing of his people had turned them to refugees in their own land.\n\nHe further lamented that his people were now languishing in anguish and hunger as the activities of the terrorist had prevented them from going to farms.\n\nHe therefore called on the federal government to urgently intervene in order to save the lives of innocent children and their mothers now displaced and living in camps.\n\nMusa said: \u201cThis latest incident has further put families and loved ones of our security personnel in trauma and untold hardship which they do not deserve.\n\n\u201cIt has also further depleted the nation\u2019s security personnel which unfortunately has not met the required manpower needed to secure the lives and property of people in the state and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cThis coldblooded murder of innocent Nigerians is totally condemnable and should be condemned by all peace-loving members of our society.\n\n\u201cIt is very sad that now that the farming season has commenced many farmers in my constituency have not been able to go to their farms as a result of the activities of bandits and terrorists.\n\n\u201cMany of my people, especially those in Shiroro, Munya and Rafi local government areas are now refugees in Internally Displaced People\u2019s Camps or hibernating with relatives in Minna and other safe environments.\u201d\n\nFG TASKED TO TAKE BATTLE TO TERRORISTS\n\nReactions have continued to trail the gruesome murder of security men and some civilians at the Ajata Aboki mining site in the Erena ward of Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State last Wednesday.\n\nThis is even as the death toll in the massacre has reportedly increased with no fewer than five more corpses recovered from the forest Thursday evening and were deposited at the morgue of the IBB specialist hospital in Minna.\n\nThe corpses were brought in a black Toyota Hilux pick up van which also conveyed some armed soldiers dressed in black and a man dressed in mufti who sat in front of one of the pickup vans.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that though security men moved into Shiroro Local Government Area on Thursday in not less than 10 trucks, they were not able to neutralise the terrorists who were said to have escaped into the Birnin Gwari forest after the incident.\n\nThe terrorists, according to findings, sacked the mining site and could have made away with valuable items including raw gold and cash in addition to the four Chinese and yet unknown number of locals abducted.\n\nThe attack, according to a source, was masterminded by the Dogo Gide terrorists group hibernating in the Birnin- Gwari and Zamfara forests.\n\nOne of the Concerned Shiroro Youths, the body saddled with monitoring the security situation in the local government area, Comrade Yussuf Kokki urged the government to take the battle to the terrorists instead of waiting to counter them after any attack, adding that the strategy of counter attack being adopted would not solve the security challenges facing the state.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nweze and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja, Laleye Dipo in Minna",

          "title": "US Senators Demand Relisting of Nigeria on Religious Freedom Concern List for Violence Against Christians",
          "text": "Five United State Senators \u2013 Josh Hawley, Marco Rubio, Mike Braun, James M. Inhofe and Tom Cotton \u2013 have jointly sent a letter to the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken urging him to immediately redesignate Nigeria as a \u201cCountry of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) under the US International Religious Freedom Act.\n\nThey alleged that recent acts of violence targeting Nigerian Christians have underscored the deteriorating state of religious freedom in the country.\n\nIn their letter, copied to Honourable Rashad Hussain, Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, United States Department of State, the lawmakers stated, \u201cAs you are well aware, horrific acts of deadly violence have been committed against Nigerian Christians in recent weeks, including the massacre of churchgoers on Pentecost Sunday and the stoning of a Christian college student. Sadly, such violence has become all too familiar for Christians in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\n\u201cLast year, however, you inexplicably removed Nigeria\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) despite no demonstrable improvement in the country\u2019s religious freedom conditions. On the contrary, the situation in Nigeria has grown worse. We previously urged you to immediately reverse your misguided decision, and we write today to renew our call.\n\n\u201cRecent high-profile acts of violence underscore the intense religious persecution that is regularly experienced by Nigerian Christians. On Pentecost Sunday, gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria\u2019s Ondo state, reportedly killing at least 50 churchgoers. Last month, a violent mob brutally stoned to death Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu, a student at Shehu Shagari College of Education in northwest Nigeria. According to reports, some Islamist students were enraged by a \u201cblasphemous\u201d message Deborah had posted in a WhatsApp group, in which she said that \u2018Jesus Christ is the greatest. He helped me pass my exams.\u2019 Merely expressing one\u2019s Christian faith has apparently become tantamount to a death sentence in many parts of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThey stated that religious violence and intolerance directed toward Nigerian Christians had worsened in recent years and that one report documented more than 4,650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021.\n\nThe lawmakers continued: Accordingly, Nigeria earns the dubious honour\u2014for the second consecutive year\u2014of being the deadliest country on earth for Christians.\n\n\u201cWe wrote last year that not only has the government of Nigeria failed to take meaningful steps to mitigate such violence, but Nigerian authorities restrict and crack down on religious minorities and detain individuals indefinitely on blasphemy-related charges. We remain concerned that the Nigerian government is failing to protect the religious freedom and basic safety of its Christian citizens.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, as this year\u2019s annual reports from the bipartisan U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and from your own Department make clear, Nigerian government authorities directly participate in the persecution of Christians, Muslims, and even non-theists, most notoriously through arrests and convictions under blasphemy laws. Make no mistake: continued enforcement of state-sanctioned blasphemy laws enables the type of deadly violence that killed Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu and so many others.\n\n\u201cWhen we previously wrote you, we were met with a response which failed to answer our questions about why the State Department views Nigeria as not having engaged in or tolerated \u2018systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom\u2019 or even \u2018severe violations of religious freedom.\u2019 This is unacceptable, especially because you are required by federal law to consider the recommendation of USCIRF\u2014which, since 2009, has been to designate Nigeria as a CPC. In fact, USCIRF reiterated in its 2022 Annual Report that it was \u201cappalled\u201d at the removal of Nigeria\u2019s CPC designation.\n\n\u201cDespite public statements from you and other State Department officials condemning the recent bloodshed in Nigeria, the fact remains that the Department still does not officially regard Nigeria as a severe violator of religious freedom.\n\n\u201cThe State Department released its 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom on June 2, which starts the 90-day timeline for the Department to make its religious freedom designations. Given the abysmal state of religious freedom in Nigeria, it is incumbent upon you to reverse last year\u2019s decision and redesignate the country as a CPC. The moment demands that you do so without delay.\u201d",
          "summary": "They alleged that recent acts of violence targeting Nigerian Christians have underscored the deteriorating state of religious freedom in the country.\n\u201cLast year, however, you inexplicably removed Nigeria\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) despite no demonstrable improvement in the country\u2019s religious freedom conditions.\n\u201cRecent high-profile acts of violence underscore the intense religious persecution that is regularly experienced by Nigerian Christians.\nWe remain concerned that the Nigerian government is failing to protect the religious freedom and basic safety of its Christian citizens.\n\u201cThe State Department released its 2021 Report on International Religious Freedom on June 2, which starts the 90-day timeline for the Department to make its religious freedom designations.",
