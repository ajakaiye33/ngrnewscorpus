          "text": "Widow of engineer lynched by Lagos Okada mob narrates last conversation with husband\n\nSome of the seized okada.\n\nBy Esther Onyegbula\n\nWhen the widow of 37-year-old Sunday-David Umoh, sound engineer, spoke to her husband in the afternoon of that fateful Thursday, never in her wildest imagination did it occur to her that it was the last time she would hear his voice as he was lynched and burnt by irate motorcycle operators at Admiralty Way in Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nUmoh, a member of Legacy 360 band, was lynched and his body set ablaze at Beer Bar, Admiralty Way Lekki where he had gone to play with his band.\n\nThe victim reportedly met his death while attempting to mediate between his colleague identified as Phillip and a commercial motorcyclist over one hundred naira transport fare dispute which snowballed into a mob attack and he was killed while two others are still lying critically ill in hospital.\n\nRecounting his last conversation with her husband, 36-year-old Grace Bolu Umoh, who was yet to believe that her husband was dead when Sunday Vanguard visited her at the family residence in Lagos, said. \u201cThe last discussion I had with him was on the Uber booking he ordered on my behalf.\n\n\u201cHe mixed up the booking. He put the designation as pick up point and pick up point as the destination while booking the cab that would take me to Ajao Estate where I had a programme to attend.\n\n\u201cWhile at the programme I missed his call. So, I called him back to know why he called and he apologised for mixing up the booking details.\n\n\u201cHe had left home on Tuesday. Normally he would leave home on Tuesdays because he worked as sound engineer at Church of God Mission International on the Island during the day and in the evening, if they had a show, he played for a band called Legacy 360 band.\n\n\u201cThat band plays on Thursdays and Fridays. That fateful Thursday they went to play at Beer Bar.\n\n\u201cMost times when they arrived at their destination, he would send me his location which he did on that day he was killed.\n\n\u201cI was expecting him to call that night but he didn\u2019t. I kept calling him but his number wasn\u2019t going through, so I felt maybe his battery was flat and he will call me the following day after the show.\n\n\u201cBut he didn\u2019t call. So I kept calling the next day and there was no response before I received the phone call on Friday, May 13 at about 3 pm.\n\n\u201cI was told that my husband was dead.\n\nI had to rush down to my dad\u2019s church.\n\n\u201cI was in shock. I didn\u2019t understand what they were saying, so I gave the phone to my father.\n\n\u201cIt was like I wasn\u2019t hearing what they were saying properly. I abandoned my one year and four months old baby with the Uber driver that was supposed to bring us back home.\n\n\u201cI am shattered, it was later I took my baby from the Uber driver. Up till now, it seems like I am dreaming.\n\n\u201cOur kids always had video calls with him.\n\n\u201cOne is five years old; the other is 16 months old. Since we lost my husband, our 16 months old baby has been shouting \u2018da da\u2019 (that\u2019s what he called his daddy). At night he always cries\u201d.\n\nNightmare\n\nThe mother of two narrated further: \u201cI didn\u2019t have any premonition that my husband will be murdered.\n\nBut the day before they killed him, Wednesday, I had a dream that I followed someone to a gathering where I was asked to share my testimony to encourage others.\n\n\u201cThe person who invited me told me to share my testimony of how I waited for long before I had children because I actually waited for four years.\n\n\u201cI had miscarriages before I had my first child and I waited for another four years before I had my second baby.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018no, I am coming here for the first time, you don\u2019t know who you would be encouraging here\u2019, so I decided to share my testimony to encourage people.\n\n\u201cBut as I began to share my testimony, a dog emerged from nowhere and began to chase me in the dream in the presence of everyone there.\n\n\u201cI ran to a separate building till someone saved me.\n\n\u201cWhen I thought the dog had left the vicinity, I went back to the gathering and saw the dog again; this time I stood and faced the dog which stood on two legs,.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018you can\u2019t stop my testimony\u2019 before I woke up.\n\n\u201cI prayed about it. I called my husband and told him about it we prayed about it.\u201d\n\nDescribing her late husband, the widow who works at Ijede LCDA as a Senior Technical Officer in the Mechanical, Infrastructure Department said, \u201cWe have been married for nine years. We celebrated our ninth wedding anniversary on April 6 this year.\n\n\u201cHe was loving and caring and went all out for people, not just his family.\n\n\u201cHe was gifted with his hands, there was no handiwork he couldn\u2019t do with his hands, he would repair cars, and you will think he was a mechanic. He would fix electrical faults. He would fix the stage in the church where I worship. He worked with Pastor Paul Adefarasin during the Experience programmes of 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\n\u201cI will miss the care. I will miss him dearly. I was in a loan mess last year and the creditor was saying different things about me but my husband stood with me.\n\n\u201cHe started paying the loan gradually, that is why he took two jobs. He paid for my PGD programme; he had plans for me to do my master\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHe was also building up his sound workshop. My husband and I were planning for his mother\u2019s 70th birthday later in the year\u201d. Bolu pleaded with the police to get justice for her husband.\n\n\u201cFor the sake of my little children, my husband deserves justice. Justice should be served, I want security for my children, I am just a civil servant,\u201d she said.",

          "title": "APC Convention: Amaechi\u2019s robust engagement with delegates",
          "text": "By Michael Jegede\n\nSince the immediate past Transportation Minister, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, formally joined the 2023 presidential race on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), he has, with inexhaustible agility, been traversing the country to canvass for votes of party delegates and consult with stakeholders.\n\nThe convention of APC is slated to hold from May 29 to 30 in Abuja where delegates from the 36 states will assemble to choose a candidate from the over 20 aspirants seeking for the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nAmaechi, who many strongly believe has the capacity to offer good governance to Nigerians, considering the extremely impressive exploits he made in the different positions of authority he has occupied at all strata of government, appears to be gaining ground in his engagement with delegates and stakeholders, as can be seen from his consultation visits so far.\n\nBetter placed as the bridge between the young and old generations, the 56-years-old ex-Rivers governor has, within the last two to three weeks, showed great vim, energy and strength as he moved with high speed from Delta to Rivers, Cross River, Edo, Bayelsa, having earlier covered the entire states in the South-West and South-East. His train moved progressively to Kaduna last Sunday from where it headed to Adamawa, Nasarawa, Kano, Jigawa, Bauchi, FCT, Niger, Benue and Plateau between Monday and Thursday.\n\nThe acceptability of the Ikwerre-born consummate grassroots politician, a pragmatic and visionary leader, highly respected for his courage, doggedness and strength of character, could be seen from the level of support he is getting from the delegates.\n\nFor instance, in Taraba State, convinced that Nigerians will be the ultimate beneficiary of Amaechi\u2019s stewardship, the APC delegates there vowed to give him at least 90 percent of their votes on the day of the convention.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the delegates, the APC Chairman in the state, Ibrahim Tukur El-Sudi, said: \u201cOur delegates know how to separate the chaff from the grain. Sir, we are assuring you that 90 percent of our votes will go to you. Our Emir has already spoken, therefore you should be guaranteed of 90 percent delegate votes.\u201d\n\nIn Kaduna, the delegates were touched after listening to the testimony of their governor, Nasir El-Rufai, about the character and person of the former Transportation Minister and immediately endorsed him as their preferred choice.\n\nFrom the narration of their governor, they feel Amaechi truly deserves the APC presidential ticket.\n\nWhile in Adamawa State where he equally got the assurances of party delegates, the Lamido of Adamawa, Alhaji Muhammadu Barkindo Mustapha, gave Amaechi his blessing and prayed for his emergence as Nigeria\u2019s President in 2023. The monarch believed that with what he did in his eight years as Rivers helmsman, Nigerians will enjoy the true dividends of democratic governance under his leadership as president.\n\nThe Chairman, Bayelsa State Council of Traditional Rulers, King Bubaraye Agada the 10th, was highly elated to receive Amaechi in Yenagoa during his visit to the state to interface with delegates.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are delighted to have you, you are an aspirant who has come to do the needful.\n\n\u201cYou are our son, I have never seen a resume or profile of your type being two-time Speaker, two-time Governor and two-time Minister; we must give you the needed support.\u201d\n\nGovernor Muhammad Badaru of Jigawa State, likewise an APC presidential aspirant, tacitly stepped down for Amaechi when he visited the state to engage the delegates.\n\nAccording to Badaru, \u201cOne thing I respect about my big brother and friend (Amaechi) is that what you see is what you get. He doesn\u2019t lie; he doesn\u2019t pretend. He says it straight, and that\u2019s the quality of leaders this country needs.\n\n\u201cSo Jigawa delegates, when you think of me, think of Amaechi because we are the children of President Buhari, so on that day, it\u2019s either I run or he runs, but for sure, I cannot run against him.\u201d\n\nIn Plateau, the delegates in one accord with their governor, Simon Lalong, unanimously adopted Amaechi, as their sole candidate, while revealing that he was the first APC presidential aspirant to visit the state ahead of the convention.\n\nThe story is the same from state to state. Majority of the delegates are at home with Amaechi and determined to gladly give him their votes at the forthcoming APC convention. They are of the notion that the vast experience he has garnered in governance, having been privileged to have consistently remained in the corridors of power since 1999, will stand him in good stead to perform as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Like many other well-meaning Nigerians, the delegates see Amaechi as the most qualified, competent and suitable candidate for the Presidency among those aspiring to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nAmaechi, the lion of Ubima was elected into the River State House of Assembly in 1999 and served as the Speaker for eight years during which he was equally the Chairman of Conference of Speakers. He became Rivers governor in 2007 and held sway for eight years with an exceptional record of achievements in the areas of security, education, agriculture, housing, healthcare, road construction, social welfare and sports.\n\nIn 2015, after leading APC, the then opposition party, to a glorious triumph, as the Director General (DG) of the presidential campaign council, and pushing out the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) out of power at the centre, Buhari appointed him into his cabinet and gave him the portfolio of the Minister of Transportation. He held the ministerial position for seven years before he recently resigned to focus on his presidential aspiration.\n\nAs Rivers governor, Amaechi put in place measures that helped to effectively tackle the issue of insecurity which was one of the major challenges he inherited when he assumed office in 2007. Working vigorously round the clock with a zero tolerance policy against kidnapping, militancy and other forms of criminality, by 2008, he successfully brought to normalcy the hitherto dreadfully chaotic security situation which had completely crippled the economy of the state.\n\nHe is about the only presidential aspirant that has had to govern a state where there was heightened insecurity and frontally dealth with it. Many Nigerians have reasoned that a man who had once faced the challenge of surmounting the menace of insecurity as a state chief executive would have the requisite knowledge to find lasting solution to the problem at the federal level as a president.\n\nAmaechi\u2019s giant stride in the improvement of education earned River State local and international recognitions. For instance, under his watch, Rivers won a prize of N400 Million as a reward for emerging the overall best state in terms of the proper utilization of FGN/UBE Intervention Funds in 2011. Port Harcourt entered into the history book as the second African city and first sub-Saharan African city to be named and honoured as UNESCO World Book Capital in 2014.\n\nThe man who made job creation his number one priority, was the only governor in his time to employ about 13,200 teachers at one go. Determined to change the face of education in Rivers, he built over 350 modern primary schools in the various communities of the state and 24 world class secondary schools across the 23 Local Government Areas in the state. He sponsored over 3500 citizens of Rivers State on foreign scholarships and offered free education from Primary to Secondary School level. The free education policy provided an opportunity for the underprivileged Nigerians in the state to be educated.\n\nNo sector of the economy in the state is devoid of Amaechi\u2019s indelible footprint of achievements. In the health sector, he constructed over 160 modern primary health centres, a world-class Rivers State Dental and Maxillofacial Hospital (RSDMH) and Prof. Kelsey Harrison Hospital. Reports have it that he employed over 7000 health workers in Rivers State in addition to about 600 medical doctors.\n\nUnder Amaechi as governor, Rivers became the hub of agricultural development in Nigeria with the various innovative projects and programmes he initiated. In realization of the fact that there is a direct connection between the state of infrastructure and economic advancement, he embarked on massive construction of roads and bridges. Reputed to have built more roads than all his predecessors in the history of River State, the Dan Amanar Daura, spent over N104 billion on federal roads out of which N78 billion was refunded in 2020 by the Buhari administration as influenced by same Amaechi in the interest of Rivers people.\n\nAs Minister of Transportation for seven years, Amaechi worked tirelessly to revolutionize the transport sector. All the agencies that were under his watch received greater boost in their operations as a result of the remarkable transformational projects he embarked upon. The previously moribund railway system was resuscitated with the completion of the Abuja \u2013Kaduna, Itape-Warri and Lagos-Ibadan rail lines. As part of his continuity plans, Amaechi has vowed to ensure the completion of the $1.9 billion Kano-Maradi standard gauge railway and the $11 billion Lagos-Calabar rail project if elected President.\n\nAlso, under Amaechi as Transport Minister, the Lekki Deep Seaport, first of its kind in Nigeria and West Africa was taken to almost 90% completion and the Deep Blue Project, the first integrated maritime security strategy designed to stop regional piracy was launched. The Lekki Deep Seaport is expected to create over 170,000 jobs and serve as a huge revenue stream for the government while the Deep Blue Project will help to protect Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nThe philosophy of Amaechi\u2019s campaign has been based on his track records. This is why he has encouraged his friends and supporters to always showcase his achievements as a public servant, rather than engaging in needless rhetoric and attacks on his opponents.\n\n* Jegede, a journalist, lives in Abuja",
          "summary": "For instance, in Taraba State, convinced that Nigerians will be the ultimate beneficiary of Amaechi\u2019s stewardship, the APC delegates there vowed to give him at least 90 percent of their votes on the day of the convention.\nSpeaking on behalf of the delegates, the APC Chairman in the state, Ibrahim Tukur El-Sudi, said: \u201cOur delegates know how to separate the chaff from the grain.\nFrom the narration of their governor, they feel Amaechi truly deserves the APC presidential ticket.\nMajority of the delegates are at home with Amaechi and determined to gladly give him their votes at the forthcoming APC convention.\nReports have it that he employed over 7000 health workers in Rivers State in addition to about 600 medical doctors.",

          "text": "Leaders of the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Ogun West Senatorial District have denied they were planning to foist Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola aka Yayi as the senatorial candidate on the APC for the 2023 National Assembly election.\n\nThe party leaders also denied the accusation that they had been \u201cbought\u201d by Adeola to curry their support ahead of the party primaries, declaring that some those behind the allegations are opposed to the second term ambition of Governor Dapo Abiodun.\n\nA group, Committee of Concerned Ogun West Patriots under the umbrella of Ogun West Elders, Leaders and Stakeholders in the APC, in a communique, had accused the party leaders of working to tilt the senatorial primary in favour of Senator Adeola.\n\nThe group also claimed the party in Ogun West was embroiled in controversy and acrimony, demanding that Senator Adeola be excluded from taking part in the primary on the presumption that he is a \u201cstranger and foreigner.\u201d\n\nBut countering the allegations and those behind it while addressing a meeting of APC leaders and members of the Governor\u2019s Elders Advisory Council at the weekend, the former Chairman of the Ogun State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Muftau Ajibola, said that all the claims by the group led by Senator Iyabo Anisulowo and Mrs Mary Ogunjobi, were baseless and woefully failed attempt to discredit the genuine APC leaders in Ogun West.\n\nAjibola added apart from the fact that the communique issued by the group was not signed, further findings revealed that leaders of the APC mentioned in the said communique, including Senators Ayo Otegbola, Kola Bajomo, Gbolahan Dada and others, were fraudulently inserted into the document without their knowledge or permission.\n\nHe declared the real APC leaders and elders in Ogun West would not stand by and allow any qualified aspirant who can add value to the senatorial race to be excluded on the basis of personal animosity and hatred.\n\n\u201cWe make bold to say that Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola is one of our members in Ilaro Ward 1 of Yewa South local government.\n\n\u201cAs far as Yewa and Ogun West is concerned, he is not a foreigner or stranger. Besides, even an Ibo man or Hausa man who satisfies the provision of the constitution of Nigeria is qualified to run as a senatorial aspirant or candidate in Ogun West talk less of somebody who is a proven native of the land.\n\n\u201cAs leaders and elders of the APC in Ogun West, we will not stand by and allow any qualified aspirant who can add value to the race to be excluded on the basis of personal animosity and hatred.\n\n\u201cRather, we will support a transparent process that will throw up the best Ogun West senatorial flag bearer for our party who can win comfortably in the general election.\n\n\u201cThe claim of illegality around the aspiration of Senator Adeola by the group is alien to the constitution of the APC and that of Nigeria,\u201d the former SUBEB boss stated.\n\nAjibola flayed the members of the group for referring to themselves as the \u201cgenuine elders, leaders and stakeholders\u201d of APC in Ogun West\u201d, wondering \u201chow can a meeting where not a single elected official of the party participated claim to be genuine or speaking for the party\u201d?\n\n\u201cThe Ogun West APC has its elected executives with its recognised elders most of whom are members of the Governor\u2019s Elders Advisory Council. Those who sat down on Wednesday 18th to issue the said communique do not belong to this category. Some of them are not even members of the APC. They should therefore be regarded as mere interlopers looking for underserved recognition.\n\n\u201cWe wish to observe that some of those being celebrated in the communique issued by the committee are people opposed to the aspiration of Governor Dapo Abiodun to run for a second term.

          "text": "Nobel laureate Prof Wole Soyinka has called for the sack of the Imam of the Abuja National Mosque, Professor Ibrahim Maqari, for justifying the killing of Deborah Samuel by Islamic fanatics\n\nSoyinka accused the Islamic cleric of inciting his followers to take laws into their hands in the name of religion\n\nHe spoke in Abuja during the one-year remembrance of the late former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, organised by his Foundation established by his widow, Mrs Fati Attahiru.\n\nThe renowned author lamented the rising cases of lynching of people all in the name of religion, calling for the end of such act in the country.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIn the name of all while I\u2019ve given that all for all, I demand that Professor Ibrahim Maqari shall be removed from office. It is no longer sufficient for all to declaim that Islam is this and that assure the Sharia is Dawson does\n\n\u201d The Prophet Muhammad said this or that good example, admit this or that humanistic pronouncement? We\u2019ve gone beyond theocratic rhetoric that merely pays lip service to civilize conduct that all artistic denunciations be backed by affirmative action. We have already, continue to pay too high price for the culture of appeasement and impunity.\n\n\u201d Let it end now in the name of all those who have served this nation and given their lives for this nation. But the new generation should also be programmed to aspire to brutish existence below the lowest common denominator of what constitutes human.\n\n\u201cProfessor Maqari however, insists, with a handful of others including vocal serving policemen quite recently, there is no remorse involved in the torture and lynching of a young student on this earth, which we all share to anyone who cares to listen.\n\n\u201cMaqari has implicitly directed his followers to take the law into their own hands in the name of religion, and innovation, besides beset on all sides by wars, of ultra nationalism, or religious fanaticism. That is the message of a supposedly holy man to youth, to us His message to a nation embroiled in his madness of multiple incidences.\n\n\u201dWe have already continued to pay too high price for the culture of appeasement and impunity. Let it end now in the name of all those who have served this nation and given their lives for this nation.\n\n\u201dBut the new generation should also be programmed to aspire to brutish existence below the lowest common denominator of what constitutes human. Surely, that is where any self respecting nation to draw is defining unbridgeable line\u201d,\n\nAisha El-Rufai, wife of Kaduna State Governor, said Islam condemned the killings in the name of Allah.\n\nShe dismissed a report that those killing people all in the name of \u2018blasphemy\u2019 were doing so because of Islam.\n\nShe said, \u201dPermit me to say that these people are people we should talk about just like another person who robs and kills the other person, just like a pervert Muslim who rapes a three-month-old baby just like a crazy christian who rapes a six years old girl.\n\n\u201dThese people are not doing this with the backing of any religion. Whatever reason they might give their choice is to use religion, they are not for Prophet Mohammed.\n\n\u201dIslam does not preach what they do and the prophet if alive would not have allowed such a madness done to anyone.

          "text": "The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress on Saturday met with some state governors where the party is having a crisis ahead of the 2023 general elections. It was gathered that the meeting was part of moves to stop the crisis in some of its controlled states from leading to defection. The governors who the chairman met with between Friday and Saturday morning couldn\u2019t be confirmed as of the time of filing this report.\n\nThe Special Assistant to the APC National Chairman, Prof Abdullahi Yau, disclosed this at a webinar organised by APC Ward to Ward Ambassadors Diaspora Network on Saturday. The webinar had \u201cDemocracy in Nigeria: Mobilising Global Support for progress and continuity\u201d as its theme.\n\nDuring the webinar, Yau said the national chairman was trying to reconcile aggrieved members who want to leave the party for one reason or the other. He said: \u201cWe are in the period where we are preparing to hold our primaries in all the states both for governorship, national as well as state assembly and both for the presidential primary which is scheduled for Friday.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, we have a lot of crises in the party. We have a lot of states where some people want to leave the party and this is what he (Adamu) is doing. We are trying as much as possible to see that our aggrieved members \u2013 a lot of people for instance in Kano, Kebbi, Benue, and other states where we have huge members and these are people with strong supporters. They are trying to leave the party for some reasons and the chairman on a daily basis is trying to reconcile these aggrieved members.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons why this morning (Saturday) he was mandated to meet with some governors. We didn\u2019t sleep the whole night till this morning. He is meeting with some governors, aggrieved members and other stakeholders in the APC. What he is doing is for the party and I believe it is for the success of this party. Speaking on the presidential primary election, he assured that all the aspirants would be given the freedom to exercise their right as a Nigerian to contest, adding that everybody will be satisfied with whoever that will emerge from the primaries.\n\nHe also assured that no aspirant will leave the party at the end of the primaries as the party has put in place a committee to address the grievances of aggrieved members. Yau said: \u201cI want to assure you that after the primaries none of the contestants or aspirants will leave the party. You can see that unlike the other parties where you see aspirants exchanging words, in our party, all the aspirants are calm, everybody is going left and right, trying to win votes for themselves.\n\n\u201cI assure you this is the most interesting party, the number of people that are contesting and they are going to give everybody the freedom to exercise your right as a Nigerian to contest and at the end of the exercise, just like what happened in the national convention, you will see that everybody will be satisfied with whoever that will emerge from the primaries.\n\n\u201cUnless you have a process that is not well coordinated, a process that is marred by malpractices that is when will be aggrieved and will want to leave the party but if you are given the opportunity to exercise your right and you go to the primaries and you think there is fairness in what we do in the primaries and you lose I don\u2019t think you will have any reason to leave the party.\u201d\n\nNational Coordinator, APC Ward to Ward Ambassadors, Abuja Nigeria, Dr Myke Ozurumba, said the group will continue to mobilise Nigerians both home and abroad to ensure the party retains power in 2023.",

          "text": "By Chioma Okezie-Okeh\n\nThe Acting Comptroller-General of Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS), Isah Jere Idris, has explained that one of the major reasons for the delay in the processing of passports applications is as a result of the integration of data between NIS and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), which also, in turn, integrate with the BVN data of applicants.\n\nThe Acting CGI who stated this during a virtual media interaction on Saturday explained that the single data integration policy of the government is aimed at enhancing the nation\u2019s security architecture to protect the identity of Nigerians.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\n\u201cApart from this, because passports confer on holders the integrity of a nation, the integrity of the process of processing and producing such documents should also not be compromised. So, we must verify the addresses of the applicants and there is a company that already does that for us. We must hear from them before we proceed for production,\u201d he stated.\n\nTo further minimize the delay, he explained that in the next four weeks NIS will deploy a new system that will enable applicants to validate their national identity numbers before they can proceed to make payment for Passports online and book appointments for capturing. \u201cMost delays are usually caused by the NIN validation problems and what we want to do now will allow individual applicants to, first of all, verify and validate their NIN and only upload validated NIN before they can pay for passports. By doing that, we would have successfully tackled the issue of a delay from other partners which we don\u2019t have control over,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also frowned at the increasing number of Nigerians seeking to override the newly introduced appointment system for passport issuance, describing it as an abuse of the system.\n\nBreaking!!! Earn up to N2 - N3 million monthly GUARANTEED (all paid in US Dollars). No training or refereal required. Do business with top USA companies like Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, IBM, Netflix, Zoom, etc. Learn more .\n\n\u201cThe appointment system was introduced to reduce physical interface with personnel, overcrowding and arbitrariness, which have all consistently combined to promote corruption and abuse.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cRather than wait for the appointment date for capturing, many Nigerians are seeking to jump the process by turning in myriads of requests for a waiver for all conceivable reasons. There are days that we receive about 1000 such requests on a daily basis. Nigerian passport applicants should stop offering money to immigration officers to expedite the process of acquiring passports. It takes a three-week duration for passport renewal and a six-week duration for new applications. If anyone asks for extra money, please complain to us through our various channels including Twitter. Such an officer will be dealt with,\u201d he stated.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nHe also advised applicants to take advantage of the passport tracking system and now trace the status of their passports from the comfort of their homes. He said: \u201cWhat applicants just need to do is to log on to www.trackimmigration.gov.ng and upload their details. This system is already in place and Nigerians should take advantage of using it,\u201d\n\nHe also noted that NIS is also speaking with the authorities to grant approval so that anyone seeking expedited action for passport issuance can pay more. He said: \u201cCurrently we consider exceptions for medical and admission reasons and override their appointments for applicants in such categories. But there are other Nigerians who are willing to bypass the process and want us to dedicate more time to their applications. We are seeking approval for such individuals to pay more and get their passports more quickly. We need more logistics to do that and if they can pay for it, why not?\u201d\n\nOn the scarcity of passport booklet, the Acting CGI blamed that difficulty in accessing forex as one of the major factors. \u201cBooklets are currently being shared both locally and to the embassies of Nigeria globally so that the Nigerians in the diaspora can also be attended to. Access to forex has been difficult for the company handling the passport production project, the process has been cumbersome and discouraging. I want to appeal to Nigerians not to wait till their passport validity has expired before they apply for renewal.\u201d\n\nThe Acting CGI said more passport offices are being opened across the country with one already in place in Sagamu, Ogun State, and others being planned for Ilesa in Osun State, Oyo town in Oyo State, and Zaria in Kaduna State, among others.",

Something is really fishy in his statement.\n\n\u201cWe are really surprised how Emma Powerful became so concerned about Pastor Kumuyi\u2019s security.

This advice must be taken seriously and not ignored because if anything untoward happens to anyone in the said crusade we will hold him responsible.\n\n\u201cThey should, however, understand that IPOB will not fold its hands and watch our people deliberately put in harms way to be slaughtered because of crusade, when they know that politicians will employ their local thugs to slaughter people and tag it that IPOB was responsible for such attack.\n\n\u201cThe Christian Association of Nigeria should rather appreciate the genuine advice from IPOB and ESN members for giving Pastor Kumuyi a security intel because we are here on the ground in Biafra land.\n\n\u201cIs CAN saying that insecurity cannot only be curbed with prayers? Security intel and strategy are what is required in a situation as this, which is what we are applying now by advising Kumuyi and his Deeper Life Ministry. The CAN must understand that IPOB has Judeo-Christians also as family members and it\u2019s our responsibility to protect it from political thugs and criminal elements.\n\n\u201cIPOB does not have any issues with Kumuyi or other pastors or men and women of God for that matter, what we are talking about is the security of Biafrans.\n\n\u201cCAN should know that all politicians in Nigeria territory have criminal thugs they use to pursue a particular political interest and these people are not minding the repercussions or outcome, therefore, we still advise Kumuyi and Deeper Life Ministry to think twice and stop this crusade.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n*Nigeria and others to benefit from AfDB\u2019s $1.5bn Africa\u2019s food facility\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday debunked reports that it planned to replace the conventional Naira notes in circulation with digital currency, otherwise known as the eNaira, in due course.\n\n\n\nThis is as the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group\u2019s Board has approved a $ 1.5 billion facility to support African countries deal with the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war impacting food prices and availability.\n\n\n\nCBN\u2019s Director of Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, said the misleading statement purportedly made at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement on eNaira adoption in Asaba, Delta, was misconstrued and therefore, urged the public to completely disregard it.\n\n\n\nNwanisobi further explained that the digital version of the Naira is meant to complement the existing currency notes and therefore, would circulate simultaneously with the conventional Naira notes as means of exchange and store of value.\n\n\n\nHe said the adoption of the digital legal tender, aside from its safety and speedy features, would also ensure greater access to financial services by the underbanked and unbanked populace thereby enhancing financial inclusion.\n\n\n\nHe urged the public and business owners to embrace digital currency as it offers more possibilities.\n\nThe eNaira was formally launched into circulation by President Muhammadu Buhari in October last year.\n\nThe apex bank\u2019s governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele had recently expressed optimism that the bank would achieve the 85 per cent financial inclusion target which is currently at about 70 per cent.\n\n\n\nAddressing a delegation of Executive Directors from the Bank of Uganda, who was on an experience sharing tour of the CBN\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project, Emefiele said the apex bank remained committed to accelerating the rate at which those who were financially excluded could come into the formal banking sector.\n\nHe also expressed satisfaction that the eNaira had recorded some level of success judging by the rate of integration and security features.\n\n\n\nThe central bank governor said the CBDC would enhance the relationship between mobile banking and e-business and speed up the rate of financial inclusion.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that the interest that the eNaira continued to attract from other countries and multinational bodies, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, underscored the level and quality of work the CBN had put into the project.\n\n\n\nEmefiele said Nigeria is currently a case study to other climes, being the first country in Africa to launch its CBDC, adding that the country was treading cautiously to ensure it sustains the successes recorded so far.\n\nHe also told the visiting team that the country had deepened its payment system infrastructure, which is ranked among the best in the world.\n\n\n\nEmefiele had said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases, and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017.\n\n\n\nHe said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\n\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to clearly establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and our fast-growing payments platforms.\n\nNigeria, Others to Benefit from AfDB\u2019s $1.5bn Africa\u2019s Food Facility\n\nMeanwhile, the AfDB Group\u2019s Board has approved a $ 1.5 billion facility to support African countries deal with the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war impacting food prices and availability\n\nAfDB\u2019s Chief Agriculture Policy Economist and Coordinator of Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme at AfDB, Mr. Philip Boahen, said this at Tamale, Ghana, yesterday.\n\n\n\nBoahen said the facility is expected to reach over 20 million African farmers to deal with the food shortfall.\n\nThe bank, on its website, also said that with the disruption of food supplies arising from the war, Africa now faces a shortage of at least 30 million metric tonnes of food.\n\nAfDB said that food like wheat, maize, and soybeans imported from both countries was majorly affected by the war.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Bank, the $1.5 billion, an African Emergency Food Production Facility, is an unprecedented comprehensive initiative to support smallholder farmers in filling the food shortfall.\n\n\n\nThe AfDB said it would provide fertilizer to smallholder farmers across Africa over the next four farming seasons, indicating it will use its convening influence with major fertilizer manufacturers, loan guarantees, and other financial instruments to provide the fertilizers.\n\n\u201cAfrican farmers urgently need high-quality seeds and inputs before the planting season begins in May to immediately boost food supplies.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe facility will provide 20 million African smallholder farmers with certified seeds.\n\n\u201cIt will increase access to agricultural fertilizers and enable them to rapidly-produce 38 million tonnes of food.\n\n\u201cThis would be a $12 billion increase in food production in just two years,\u201d the AfDB said.\n\n\n\nThe Bank said the facility would lead to the production of 11 million tonnes of wheat; 18 million tonnes of maize; 6 million tonnes of rice; and 2.5 million tonnes of soybeans.\n\n\n\n\u201dIt will also support market growth and post-harvest management, and create a platform to advocate for critical policy reforms to solve the structural issues that impede farmers from receiving modern inputs.\u201d\n\nAfreximbank, APPO Sign MoU on Energy Transition Bank\n\nMeanwhile, the African Petroleum Producers\u2019 Organisation (APPO) and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish an African Energy Transition Bank.\n\nThis is contained in a statement signed by Afreximbank\u2019s Media Contact, Mr. Amadou Sall, at the weekend.\n\nSall said the establishment of the energy bank was in support of an African-led energy transition strategy.\n\n\n\nHe said the new institution would accelerate Africa\u2019s economic development while ensuring the progress was compatible with and

in African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want.\n\n\n\nHe said that the bank would address an urgent and existential need on the continent.\n\n\u201cAfrica stands to experience profound effects from climate change, while the considerable poverty across the continent further disincentivises a focus on environmental care and sustainability for many populations.\n\n\u201cMoreover, Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry faces growing pressures as international investment in hydrocarbons diminishes.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile Africa\u2019s transition towards alternative energy sources presents great opportunities for the continent, this transition must be carefully managed to minimise the short-term adverse impacts of the transition while maximising its longer-term benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nSall said the new bank\u2019s responsibilities would include the management and encouragement of such a productive transition.\n\n\n\nHe said that APPO member states would be signatories to the Energy Transition Bank\u2019s constitutional documents which would be structured in the form of a multilateral treaty, and invest equity into the new vehicle.\n\nSall said that Afreximbank would co-invest and advise on the establishment and implementation process.\n\nThe statement quoted Prof. Benedict Oramah, President of Afreximbank, as saying \u201cwe are delighted to be

the imperatives of mitigating climate change and the urgency of averting social upheavals as a result of increasingly difficult economic and financial conditions in Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor us at Afreximbank, supporting the emergence of the African Energy Transition Bank will enable a more efficient and predictable capital allocation between fossil fuels and renewables.\u201d\n\nOramah is

          "text": "\u2022New law, if signed, may only benefit 2027, off-season electoral processes for APC, PDP as other parties forge ahead\n\n\u2022 PDP begins primaries today\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has sent the new Electoral Act Amendment Bill to the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for legal advice, THISDAY has learnt.\n\n\n\nThe president\u2019s decision not to be in a hurry to sign the bill, it was learnt, was to avoid a repeat of the mistake made by members of the National Assembly, who in their effort to punish political appointees, forgot to include themselves as delegates.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s investigation revealed that the new law, if signed, would only benefit the 2027 general election and off-season elections for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nA Presidency source, who confirmed this development last night, further disclosed that the president would await legal advice before signing the bill as recently amended by the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nHowever, the PDP yesterday confirmed that the super delegates or statutory delegates would not vote at the state Houses of Assembly and House of Representatives\u2019 primaries of the party scheduled to take place today (Sunday) as they were not elected as delegates.\n\n\n\nFollowing the failure of the National Assembly to recognise themselves, the president, vice president, governors and other elected government officials as statutory delegates in the Electoral Act 2022, the Senate and the House of Representatives had penultimate week passed the amendment to the Act to recognise statutory delegates as voters during primaries, congresses and conventions of all the political parties.\n\n\n\nThe new Section 84(8) introduced in the Act recognises only democratically elected delegates.\n\nIt states: \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall clearly outline in its constitution and rules the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress or meeting.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari, who returned from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) yesterday, had come under intense pressure to sign the fresh amendment bill to the Electoral Act 2022, to ensure that himself, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, members of the National Assembly, governors, their deputies and other statutory delegates of political parties can vote in the parties\u2019 primaries.\n\n\n\nOthers who will be able to vote if Buhari signs the amended Act include the parties\u2019 National Working Committee (NWC) members, state party chairmen, secretaries, local government chairmen, deputies, councillors, and party chairmen in the 774 local government areas.\n\n\n\nBut the Presidency source told THISDAY that Buhari was not in a hurry to sign the bill to avoid the repeat of the previous mistake made by the National Assembly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the president receives every bill, he seeks the advice of all relevant agencies. In this case, he has sent the bill to the AGF and INEC for advice. So, he is not in a hurry to sign it. That was how the National Assembly was in a hurry and so busy punishing political appointees that they forgot to include themselves as delegates. Whenever he signs it, it takes effect for subsequent elections,\u201d the source explained.\n\n\n\nThe source wondered why the signing of the bill should become a major issue when the political parties have other options to conduct their primaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey have three options \u2013 direct, indirect and consensus. In the case of indirect primary, they have already provided for the use of elected delegates and there is nothing wrong with that. In PDP, they have elected three ad hoc delegates \u2013 one national delegate and two others. In APC, there are five delegates. Other political parties have their own provisions. So, the political parties already have delegates that will vote in their primaries,\u201d the source added.\n\n\n\nWith the president\u2019s hesitant to sign the amendment, it means only national delegates elected at the local government congresses will determine presidential flagbearers of the party.\n\n\n\nThe ad hoc delegates were elected in line with the provisions of Section 84 (8) of the Amended Electoral Act 2022.\n\nSection 82(3) of the Electoral Act, 2022 makes it mandatory that the primaries must be conducted democratically.\n\n\n\nBy Article 4.5 of the INEC\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Political Party Primaries, a political party that adopts the indirect primary mode shall make available to the commission, not later than seven days to the date of the primary, the list of persons that will form the delegates that are eligible to vote for the nomination of the party\u2019s candidates to contest every eligible position.\n\n\n\nAccording to the guidelines, the list of delegates shall be accompanied by the list of aspirants and the list of the party\u2019s electoral panel conducting the primary.\n\n\n\nWith the commencement of primaries this week, it is already late for the amended Act to be used for the election of parties\u2019 candidates for the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nAPC\u2019s presidential primary holds on May 29 and 30, while the PDP presidential primary is slated for May 28 and 29.\n\nPDP has already confirmed that the super delegates or statutory delegates will not vote at today\u2019s primaries of the party as they were not elected for the 2022 primary elections.\n\n\n\nThe main opposition party confirmed this in a statement issued yesterday titled: \u201cUse of elected delegates for the primaries and national convention,\u201d by its National Organising Secretary, Mr. Umar Bature.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, 2022, delegates to vote at the indirect primaries and National Convention of political parties to elect candidates for elections shall be those democratically elected for that purpose only.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsequently, those qualified and eligible to vote as delegates in the forthcoming primaries and National Convention of our great party, the PDP are the three ad hoc delegates per ward, elected at the ward congresses, and one national delegate per local government, elected at the Local Government Area Congresses.\n\n\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the NWC wishes to inform our party members that the state Houses of Assembly primaries to elect our state Houses of Assembly candidates, earlier scheduled for Saturday, May 21, 2022, will now hold on Sunday, May 22, 2022, from 8:00 am to 12 noon; while the House of Representatives primaries to elect our House of Representatives candidates will also hold on Sunday, May 22, 2022, from 2:00 pm.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll aspirants, critical stakeholders, leaders, and teeming members of our party should please take note,\u201d Bature explained.\n\n\n\nBy implications, only 326,081 delegates elected in 28 states and FCT during the three-man delegate elections will vote across 36 states to elect governorship, and members of House of Representatives candidates will vote as from today.\n\n\n\nThere are 8,813 wards in Nigeria multiplied by 28 states where the governorship elections will take place.\n\nSimilarly, only 810 delegates elected in the 774 local government areas and area councils of the FCT in the one-man delegate election will decide the PDP presidential flag bearer.\n\n\n\nThis has led to calls to shift the primaries to enable President Buhari to sign into law the amendment to section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\n\nFor instance, speaking at the Round table conference of the Abuja School of Politics and Social Thoughts, Professor Sam Amadi, who was the former Chairman of the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Prof. Udenta Udenta and Kelechi Azubuike accused the members of the National Assembly of cutting their face to spite the nose.\n\n\n\nThe trio of Sam Amadi, Udenta Udenta, and Kelechi Azubuike said that by the old Section 84 (8) waiting to be signed into law, the federal makers cannot even vote at the congresses and presidential primaries because they were not specifically elected for that purpose.\n\nTo salvage the situation, they appealed to INEC to extend the datelines for the political parties to elect their flag bearers.\n\n\n\nThey also appealed to INEC to alternately issue a guideline as a regulator to guide the political parties on the issue of section 84 (8).\n\n\n\nHowever, Civil Society Groups on electoral matters yesterday rejected the demand for an extension of the timetable and schedule of elections so far released by the INEC as requested by the 18 political parties, stating that to do so would pose danger to the electoral processes.\n\nSeveral CSOs, in a statement, commended INEC for rejecting the IPAC request for extension.\n\n\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Political Intrigues Between Two Corrupt Nigerian Public Figures Led To Detention, Grilling Of Former NDDC MD Over N47billion Fraud",
          "text": "The arrest of the former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Nsima Ekere, has been linked to the political scheming by former Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nMr. Ekere was on his way to Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, in Nigeria's South-South region, when he received an invitation to report to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday.\n\nThe former NDDC boss was said to have promptly changed his travel plans and boarded a flight from Abuja where he resides to Lagos to honour the invitation of the anti-graft agency.\n\nOn arrival at the commission, he was confronted with accusations of corruptly enriching himself while serving as MD of the NDDC between November 2016 and January 2019 and was promptly detained.\n\nA statement issued by EFCC and posted on its website said Mr. Ekere was being held for alleged diversion of funds to the tune of N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nHowever, the EFCC released the former Managing Director of the NDDC, Ekere on Sunday.\n\nA source in the EFCC told SaharaReporters on Sunday that \"Ekere has been released on bail\".\n\nSee Also Corruption Alleged N47bn Fraud: Nigerian Anti-graft Agency, EFCC Releases Ex-Managing Director Of Niger Delta Development Commission, Nsima Ekere\n\nBut the details of the bail conditions were not known as of the time of filing this report.\n\nEkere was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly diverting N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nWhile details of the alleged fund's diversion by the former NDDC are still unknown, the timing of the arrest and the dramatic nature of it point to the high-level political power play in his home state of Akwa Ibom.\n\nIn Abuja and across Akwa Ibom, the word has been out that President Muhammadu Buhari was considering Mr. Ekere as the replacement to Mr. Akpabio at the Niger Delta Ministry.\n\nBut findings reveal that Mr. Akpabio is pushing for Etekamba Umoren, his chief of staff at the Niger Delta Ministry and a former Secretary to the Government of Akwa Ibom State during his tenure as governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nMany believe that Mr. Ekere\u2019s arrest and detention are meant to dent his nomination for the ministerial job and pave the way for the emergence of Mr. Umoren, who is a stooge of Mr. Akpabio.\n\nThe argument hinged on the fact that Mr. Akpabio has been serially indicted for corruption not only in the NDDC but also when he was the governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nSince 2020, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom has been embroiled in factional crises with Akpabio leading one faction and other leaders like Senator John Akpan Udoedeghe, Umana Okon Umana, Don Etiebiet and Mr. Ekere hauled together to wrest control of the party from the former Niger Delta Affairs minister.\n\nWhile Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction succeeded in using the court and his closeness to the centre of power to grab the chairmanship of the party, it has been tough uniting the members and getting them ready for the election.\n\nMr. Ekere, who was APC\u2019s governorship candidate at the last election, by the party convention, should be the leader of the party in the state.\n\nBut Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction has contested this position, insisting that the minister, as the highest-ranking political officer from the state, is the natural leader.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Ekere is said to have been making overtures to unite the party, share positions and integrate all factions into the mainstream, a position Mr. Akpabio, and his men are said to be stoutly objected to.\n\nMr. Ekere\u2019s other sin is his support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is a frontline presidential aspirant in the ruling party and a major obstacle to Mr. Akpabio\u2019s ambition to become Nigeria\u2019s president on the platform of the APC.\n\nIt is also learnt that Mr. Osinbajo first considered Mr. Akpabio as his presidential campaign coordinator in Akwa Ibom but switched to Mr. Ekere when the former Niger Delta minister declared to run for President.\n\nThe Vice President is said to have settled for Mr. Ekere because of his political reach and outlook.\n\nHistory Of Frosty Relationship Between Akpabio And Ekere\n\nMany insist that Mr. Akpabio has had a long frosty relationship with Mr. Ekere.\n\nThe duo contested the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) governorship primary in 2006 to succeed former Governor Victor Attah.\n\nHowever, the primary did not produce a clear winner and Mr. Akpabio negotiated victory which meant he had to name Mr. Ekere as his running mate.\n\nA few weeks later, Mr. Ekere was dropped based on a negotiated term by the PDP to allow Mr. Attah to nominate the deputy governorship candidate in the person of Patrick Ekpotu.\n\nMr. Ekpotu served for one term and Mr. Ekere was picked to run with Mr. Akpabio in 2011, a ploy many said was to retire the man from politics.\n\nJust as he was being sworn in, a plan was hatched to impeach Mr. Ekere a few months into the office so he would not be able to contest for any elective position.\n\nMr. Ekere escaped that fate by resigning a day before the house of assembly was to start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nEven with his resignation, the lawmakers were still bent on going ahead with his impeachment process.\n\nMr. Ekere moved to the APC in 2015 after he was frustrated out of the governorship race.\n\nHe and many APC leaders at the time had resisted Mr. Akpabio\u2019s moves to decamp to the party when he negotiated to join the party after the EFCC arrested and filed corruption charges against him.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom APC leaders were also said to have argued that the corruption baggage on Mr. Akpabio\u2019s neck, while he was governor, would work against the party at the election.\n\nAkpabio joined APC in 2018, contested and lost the senatorial election but got rewarded with an appointment as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\nMany people see him more as the Minister of NDDC which has had five chief executives since 2019.\n\nAkpabio's Corruption Cases\n\nMeanwhile, Akpabio was also detained in April 2021 after he attempted to bribe the Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa, SaharaReporters had reported.\n\nAccording to sources, Akpabio was trying to bribe the EFCC Chairman because of the tons of corruption allegations against him, dating back to the time he was governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nIt was learnt that the meeting between Akpabio and Bawa was arranged by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who had recently been embroiled in a N5 million bribery controversy himself.\n\nAkpabio was said to have taken the $350,000 in cash personally to Bawa before he was detained.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that it took a call from the Aso Villa to the EFCC Chairman to get Akpabio and his aides released.\n\nA top source in the EFCC had said, \"He arrived at the EFCC office with five others and headed to meet the newly appointed Chairman, Bawa.\n\n\"The Attorney General of the Federation who was recently arranged the meeting for the minister.

He was arrested and detained, along with his aides, all six of them.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Political Intrigues Between Two Corrupt Nigerian Public Figures Led To Detention, Grilling Of Former NDDC MD Over N47billion Fraud",
          "text": "The arrest of the former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Nsima Ekere, has been linked to the political scheming by former Minister of the Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nMr. Ekere was on his way to Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, in Nigeria's South-South region, when he received an invitation to report to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday.\n\nThe former NDDC boss was said to have promptly changed his travel plans and boarded a flight from Abuja where he resides to Lagos to honour the invitation of the anti-graft agency.\n\nOn arrival at the commission, he was confronted with accusations of corruptly enriching himself while serving as MD of the NDDC between November 2016 and January 2019 and was promptly detained.\n\nA statement issued by EFCC and posted on its website said Mr. Ekere was being held for alleged diversion of funds to the tune of N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nHowever, the EFCC released the former Managing Director of the NDDC, Ekere on Sunday.\n\nA source in the EFCC told SaharaReporters on Sunday that \"Ekere has been released on bail\".\n\nSee Also Corruption Alleged N47bn Fraud: Nigerian Anti-graft Agency, EFCC Releases Ex-Managing Director Of Niger Delta Development Commission, Nsima Ekere\n\nBut the details of the bail conditions were not known as of the time of filing this report.\n\nEkere was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly diverting N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.\n\nWhile details of the alleged fund's diversion by the former NDDC are still unknown, the timing of the arrest and the dramatic nature of it point to the high-level political power play in his home state of Akwa Ibom.\n\nIn Abuja and across Akwa Ibom, the word has been out that President Muhammadu Buhari was considering Mr. Ekere as the replacement to Mr. Akpabio at the Niger Delta Ministry.\n\nBut findings reveal that Mr. Akpabio is pushing for Etekamba Umoren, his chief of staff at the Niger Delta Ministry and a former Secretary to the Government of Akwa Ibom State during his tenure as governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nMany believe that Mr. Ekere\u2019s arrest and detention are meant to dent his nomination for the ministerial job and pave the way for the emergence of Mr. Umoren, who is a stooge of Mr. Akpabio.\n\nThe argument hinged on the fact that Mr. Akpabio has been serially indicted for corruption not only in the NDDC but also when he was the governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nSince 2020, the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom has been embroiled in factional crises with Akpabio leading one faction and other leaders like Senator John Akpan Udoedeghe, Umana Okon Umana, Don Etiebiet and Mr. Ekere hauled together to wrest control of the party from the former Niger Delta Affairs minister.\n\nWhile Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction succeeded in using the court and his closeness to the centre of power to grab the chairmanship of the party, it has been tough uniting the members and getting them ready for the election.\n\nMr. Ekere, who was APC\u2019s governorship candidate at the last election, by the party convention, should be the leader of the party in the state.\n\nBut Mr. Akpabio\u2019s faction has contested this position, insisting that the minister, as the highest-ranking political officer from the state, is the natural leader.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Ekere is said to have been making overtures to unite the party, share positions and integrate all factions into the mainstream, a position Mr. Akpabio, and his men are said to be stoutly objected to.\n\nMr. Ekere\u2019s other sin is his support for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is a frontline presidential aspirant in the ruling party and a major obstacle to Mr. Akpabio\u2019s ambition to become Nigeria\u2019s president on the platform of the APC.\n\nIt is also learnt that Mr. Osinbajo first considered Mr. Akpabio as his presidential campaign coordinator in Akwa Ibom but switched to Mr. Ekere when the former Niger Delta minister declared to run for President.\n\nThe Vice President is said to have settled for Mr. Ekere because of his political reach and outlook.\n\nHistory Of Frosty Relationship Between Akpabio And Ekere\n\nMany insist that Mr. Akpabio has had a long frosty relationship with Mr. Ekere.\n\nThe duo contested the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) governorship primary in 2006 to succeed former Governor Victor Attah.\n\nHowever, the primary did not produce a clear winner and Mr. Akpabio negotiated victory which meant he had to name Mr. Ekere as his running mate.\n\nA few weeks later, Mr. Ekere was dropped based on a negotiated term by the PDP to allow Mr. Attah to nominate the deputy governorship candidate in the person of Patrick Ekpotu.\n\nMr. Ekpotu served for one term and Mr. Ekere was picked to run with Mr. Akpabio in 2011, a ploy many said was to retire the man from politics.\n\nJust as he was being sworn in, a plan was hatched to impeach Mr. Ekere a few months into the office so he would not be able to contest for any elective position.\n\nMr. Ekere escaped that fate by resigning a day before the house of assembly was to start impeachment proceedings against him.\n\nEven with his resignation, the lawmakers were still bent on going ahead with his impeachment process.\n\nMr. Ekere moved to the APC in 2015 after he was frustrated out of the governorship race.\n\nHe and many APC leaders at the time had resisted Mr. Akpabio\u2019s moves to decamp to the party when he negotiated to join the party after the EFCC arrested and filed corruption charges against him.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom APC leaders were also said to have argued that the corruption baggage on Mr. Akpabio\u2019s neck, while he was governor, would work against the party at the election.\n\nAkpabio joined APC in 2018, contested and lost the senatorial election but got rewarded with an appointment as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\nMany people see him more as the Minister of NDDC which has had five chief executives since 2019.\n\nAkpabio's Corruption Cases\n\nMeanwhile, Akpabio was also detained in April 2021 after he attempted to bribe the Chairman of the anti-graft agency, Abdulrasheed Bawa, SaharaReporters had reported.\n\nAccording to sources, Akpabio was trying to bribe the EFCC Chairman because of the tons of corruption allegations against him, dating back to the time he was governor of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nIt was learnt that the meeting between Akpabio and Bawa was arranged by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who had recently been embroiled in a N5 million bribery controversy himself.\n\nAkpabio was said to have taken the $350,000 in cash personally to Bawa before he was detained.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that it took a call from the Aso Villa to the EFCC Chairman to get Akpabio and his aides released.\n\nA top source in the EFCC had said, \"He arrived at the EFCC office with five others and headed to meet the newly appointed Chairman, Bawa.\n\n\"The Attorney General of the Federation who was recently arranged the meeting for the minister. You remember his bribery issue with Malami himself involving $5 million.\n\n\"He was ushered in at 1 pm to see the EFCC chairman while carrying the money personally. He was arrested and detained, along with his aides, all six of them. It was a call from the Villa that got him released after two hours.\"\n\nAccording to reports, Akpabio had also bribed Malami and others with $5 million to get Effiong Akwa appointed as the sole administrator for the Niger Delta Development Commission, an allegation both of them denied.\n\nThere had also been allegations of N40 billion fraud perpetrated in the NDDC which was under the supervision of Akpabio's ministry, explaining the pressure on Akpabio to clear the weight of corruption allegations hanging on his neck.\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives had in 2020 resolved to probe the alleged N40 billion financial recklessness of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the NDDC in the previous three months.\n\nBut Akpabio, whose ministry supervised the agency, swiftly released a statement entitled \u201cRe: National Assembly probes alleged N40bn corruption in NDDC\u201d, saying under the supervision of the Niger Delta Affairs ministry, no corruption had been recorded in the NDDC\n\nAlso, there had been allegations of over N86 billion contract scam involving Akpabio and the former Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, which the EFCC had been looking into.\n\nNoting the pressure on Akpabio, another source had said, \"Don't forget he has tons of corruption cases with the EFCC right from when he was a governor.

          "title": "Abia PDP guber hopefuls reject delegates' list, say congresses were not held",
          "text": "The governorship hopefuls and chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia have asked the national working committee (NWC) to take immediate action to prevent an \u201cimpending implosion\u201d of the party in the state.\n\nIn a statement dated May 20, 2022, the governorship hopefuls and chieftains in Abia said no ward congresses were conducted in the state; hence the delegates\u2019 list to be used for primaries in the state is a \u201cnullity\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy now, most citizens and residents of Abia State and indeed Nigeria have become aware of the impending implosion and destruction of PDP in Abia State,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThe NWC of PDP scheduled Congresses for election of 3-Man Ward Adhoc Delegates in most States of Nigeria for the 30th day of April 2022. The Congresses could not hold that day because the NWC was restrained by a Court Order from holding it. Subsequently, it was alleged that the Court Order had been vacated and on that basis, the National Chairman and Secretary of PDP jointly signed a letter to INEC rescheduling the Congresses for Wednesday the 4th day of May 2022. On that day the Congress did not hold as well and this is not in dispute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat is in dispute is that whereas, the majority of faithful party members in Abia State were waiting for the National Chairman and Secretary of PDP to reschedule the Congresses and inform INEC accordingly, an individual and his acolytes simply wrote a list of Adhoc Delegates across the 184 wards of Abia State which they are pushing the NWC to accept as the authentic list of Adhoc Delegates in Abia State.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that this individual will singularly determine all 24 individuals who will emerge as candidates for the 24 State Constituencies of Abia State because having 100% control of the Adhoc Delegates already gives him over 40% of the votes for each of the Congresses before the events even hold. Similarly, this individual and his acolytes will determine all eight candidates of the Party for the House of Representatives, all three Candidates for the Senate and of course who becomes Governor of Abia State in 2023. Abia State will be in the pocket of one individual if this is allowed to happen. Nothing like this has ever occurred in Abia State before.\n\n\u201cThese unconscionable cabal falsely claim that Congresses held in Abia State when every truthful person in Abia State generally and PDP members, in particular, know that no Congresses held anywhere in Abia State.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governorship hopefuls alleged that Alwell Okere, PDP chairman in the state, was made to \u201cconcoct a letter\u201d dated May 4, 2022, when the initial congresses were fixed and addressed it to the resident electoral commissioner (REC) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state conveying the list of the committee members to conduct a congress on May 6.\n\nAccording to the party chieftains, the notice was received by the REC on May 5, adding that \u201cnotices take effect on the date they are received. Thus the REC (not INEC) received a day\u2019s notice of the sham congress going by the records of the cabal\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll of these are to no effect. The Law is very clear: Only the National Chairman and National Secretary of a Political Party can communicate with INEC at their National Headquarters in respect of Congresses, Primaries and Conventions. Neither the State Chairman of a Party nor the REC of INEC have any role in the matter and so the said Congresses of the 6th day of May 2022 are dead on arrival and pig-headedly insisting on using the phantom list of delegates will only deal a death-blow to the PDP,\u201d the governorship hopefuls said.\n\nThe party chieftains said \u201cthe only thing they know about Congresses of PDP in Abia State is the Notification of 30th April 2022 scheduling Congresses for 4th May 2022 when it did not hold. Therefore, as of 13th May 2022, INEC did not take into account or recognize whatever its REC in Abia State purported to have participated in on 6th May 2022.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have also just heard this evening that a Court order of an Abia State High Court was obtained with a view to allowing the said sham Delegates\u2019 list of 6th May 2022 to be used by the NWC in conducting the Primaries. It is unfortunate that those to whom the fortunes of PDP were entrusted are running from Pillar to post to no effect. Without bothering to engage in interpretation of what the order says or does not say, we wish to point out that a State High Court has no jurisdiction in these matters and such orders are exercise in futility.\u201d\n\nThey warned that if nothing is done to address the situation, it will lead to the destruction of the party in the state.\n\nSignatories to the statement who are governorship hopefuls include Enyinnaya Abaribe, minority leader of the senate; Ude Chukwu, deputy governor; Emma Nwaka, Chima Anyaso, Ncheta Omerekpe, Samson Orji, and Enyinnaya Nwafor.\n\nParty chieftains who also signed the statement are Onyema Ugochukwu, Adolphus Wabara, Uzoma Abonta, Eme Okoro, Charles Ogbonna and David Iro.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya.

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

Also, the CEO says they have sold to mass market Africans through a highly innovative Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) cold chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Rehmann, the RTM cold chain uses predictive data to push fish to thousands of marketers every day across Kenya with less than 1% spoilage.\n\nCurrently, Victory Farms has more than 54 retail locations where over 15,000 market women go to buy fish, and according to Rehmann, they use no electricity or ice.\n\nThis funding will enable the company to expand into Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.\n\nNetflix for kids and people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix has launched \u201cMystery Box\u201d, a new feature that helps kids discover new movies and TV shows.\n\nWhy? Netflix wants children to try new movies. According to Netflix, children frequently rewatch their favourite shows, making it difficult to persuade them to try something new.\n\nAlso, the company says Mystery Box will provide kids with a personalised experience that will assist them in discovering their next favourite series or movies, and reconnect them with a familiar character.\n\nThis is now available on the company\u2019s connected TV platforms globally.\n\nNetflix is also expanding its accessibility features globally and launching a new collection featuring stories about people with disabilities in honour of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which was observed yesterday, May 19, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the company is expanding its subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) and audio descriptions (AD) offerings in additional languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\nWhy? Heather Dowdy, Netflix\u2019s Director of Accessibility, stated that they are adding more subtitles because more subscribers are watching disability-inclusive content globally.\n\nMoreover, remember that Netflix reported a 200,000-subscriber loss globally in the first quarter of 2022. Perhaps, this could be a strategy for Netflix to retain and gain more subscribers.\n\nTikTok to credit creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never used TikTok, but I\u2019m considering signing up.

Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\nJust this month, the company introduced two new features \u2014 Pulse and Branded Mission \u2014 for content creators to earn money on the app.\n\nDespite its popularity, TikTok has been criticised for amplifying trends without crediting the original creators. TikTok launched a new feature to that effect two days ago, May 18, 2022.\n\nThis feature, a button, allows creators to credit all types of inspiration for their content, like dances, jokes, and viral sounds. By tapping on \u201ccredit\u201d in the video\u2019s caption, TikTok viewers can discover the original creators behind the content.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nReport: The impact of Y Combinator in Africa over the years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

This means you can skip some boring parts of YouTube videos. And no, you haven\u2019t missed out because the feature was introduced yesterday, May 18, 2022.\n\nThe company said it added a graph that people can use to quickly locate and watch parts played the most by other users. Per YouTube, \u201cif the graph is high, that part of the video has been replayed frequently.\u201d\n\nYouTube is also introducing another feature, Single Loop, which allows users to loop a video indefinitely. Moreover, in full-screen mode, a new panel will appear to display video information like the video description, video chapters, and comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, YouTube is expanding support for video chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles. It\u2019s a feature that enables users to skip ahead to a specific video section or easily rewatch that section.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAutochek\u2019s new acquisition\n\nTikTok\u2019s Branded Mission\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\nJumia\u2019s earnings for Q1 2022\n\nAutochek acquires Morocco\u2019s KIFAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek, a digital automotive commerce company, has acquired Morocco\u2019s KIFAL Auto.\n\nThis follows Autochek purchasing Cheki\u2019s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria and collaborating with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast last year.\n\nConsequently, Autochek is now available in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast). It\u2019s also present in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). And thanks to the acquisition of KIFAL Auto, it now has a presence in North Africa, specifically Morocco.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, KIFAL claims it\u2019s one of the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets for used and new cars.\n\nKIFAL Auto, like Autochek, connects car buyers and sellers and, through partnerships, provides financing and insurance.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Maane and the KIFAL Auto team joins Autochek to lead the company\u2019s North African expansion efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Autochek, it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and partnerships with over 70 financing partners, including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Bank.\n\nFor more information on this acquisition, listen to today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast here.\n\nTikTok to roll out a new ad product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has announced the launch of \u201cBranded Mission,\u201d a new advertising product.\n\nWith this product, creators will be able to connect with brands and potentially earn rewards for their videos using this product.\n\nAdvertisers can use the new ad product for crowdsourcing content from creators and turning top-performing videos into ads. Also, they can launch branded campaigns and encourage creators to participate in them.\n\nThey\u2019ll create a brief and distribute it to the creator community to encourage them to participate in Branded Missions. TikTok creators can then choose which Branded Missions to join.\n\nIn summary, Branded Mission allows emerging and aspiring creators to respond to ad casting calls directly on TikTok.\n\nSo, who is eligible to participate? Branded Missions are open to all creators who are 18 years old and above and have at least 1,000 followers.\n\nPer TikTok, eligible creators whose videos are chosen by brands will \u201cbenefit from a cash payment and increased traffic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company believes that this product will allow the TikTok community to have a creative hand in brand campaign ads.\n\nBranded Mission is currently in beta testing and is available to brands in over a dozen markets. Plus, it will be available in more markets later this year.\n\nSimilar, but kinda different: Recall that earlier this month, TikTok introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that allows brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nWell, the company emphasises that it is constantly looking for innovative ways to support creators and assist brands in reaching users on its platforms with relevant content.\n\nBesides, the product is currently available in 12 countries, with plans to expand into additional markets by the end of the year.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in two days!

The startup is focused on simple tools for merchants to manage their customers, record stocks, receive payments, make payments, and access cash advances against their future cash flow.\n\nBamba aims to be one of the innovators in addressing the lack of digital solutions for record-keeping and payments, which creates a barrier that prevents these businesses from scaling due to insufficient access to credit facilities.\n\nConsequently, it plans to use the funds to expand its engineering team and user base in 12 sub-Saharan African countries where mobile money is prevalent.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumia, the pan-African e-commerce company, announced its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.\n\nOn today\u2019s podcast, Chimgozirim refers to Jumia as \u201c\u2026the guy who never fulfils his potential.\u201d What?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d That was brutal, if you ask me. What do you think?\n\nAnyway, when you compare this report to the first quarter of 2021, you\u2019ll see how Jumia\u2019s results demonstrated consistent growth.\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking me how. Well, I\u2019ve got you. The report shows that Jumia experienced significant growth in orders, gross merchandise value (GMV), and revenue.\n\nIn other words, orders increased by 40% year on year, from 6.6 million to 9.3 million. GMV increased by 27% year on year, from $198.9 million to $252.7 million. And Jumia\u2019s revenue reached $47.6 million, up 44 percent from $33 million in Q1 2021.\n\nHowever, these figures fell far short of where the eCommerce giant ended 2021, with the last quarter recording GMV sales of $330 million, revenue of $62 million, and orders of 11.3 million.\n\nDespite \u201ccontinued global supply chain volatility for these categories,\u201d food delivery grew 86% year over year, while phones and electronics grew 19%.\n\nOther negatives include its Q1 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) loss, at $53 million, up 70% year on year.\n\nIf you want to know why Chimgozirim said what he said, don\u2019t forget to listen to the podcast.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSEC\u2019s rules: Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxation is not a subject that Nigerians want to talk about, but the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is about to make it unavoidable. Using the National Identification Number (NIN), the organisation wants to track financial transactions in the country to tax Nigerians effectively. Your NIN will be required for any transaction you engage in, including paying school fees or purchasing a car.\n\nThis was how we kicked off proceedings on the Techpoint Africa podcast today. While this development could increase government revenues, Oluwanifemi wondered how good this could be in light of revelations that cast doubt on the safety of data collected by Nigerian government agencies.\n\nNext was a look at Jumia\u2019s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1 2021, the company witnessed impressive growth with revenue growing to $47.6 million, orders growing to 9.3 million, and gross merchandise value hitting $252.7 million.\n\nWith the company announcing that it had acquired a payment service solution provider license (PSSP), we explored the possibility of the company growing its fintech footprints. We also touched briefly on its healthtech ambitions and its chances of survival.\n\nWe rounded up the day\u2019s discussion with news of Autochek\u2019s acquisition of the Moroccan cars marketplace KIFAL Autos and the viability of the BNPL model for cars. Emmanuel shared a Technext report that revealed that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales. With many Nigerians earning below 200,000, it\u2019s not clear how profitable these companies could be in the long run.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, please follow the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

          "title": "APC, PDP primaries: Other parties set to reap from likely defections",
          "text": "Considering the too many aspirants across the two major political parties; the All Progressive Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), and the feelers that certain politicians were already complaining of alleged form of injustice within their parties, some observers say that the primaries of the two major parties may ruffle some feathers, leading to defections.\n\nMoreover, some of those who paid N100 million to get the nomination forms for the APC and N40 million for the PDP, who may have reasons to feel betrayed are likely to take drastic measures to vent their frustration.\n\nSome of them are expected to seek soft landing in other parties. There is also the impression in some quarters that some of the opposition parties are only relevant as placeholders for politicians who hope to use their platforms once they lose out in the ruling APC and the main opposition PDP.\n\nSome believe that these parties are owned and managed by political contractors who are only after what they would get from candidates who may have lost out in the two major parties and want to use their platform to contest elections.\n\nA vivid example is the recent case of the movement of the ex-governor of Ekiti State, Segun Oni, to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) after he lost at the PDP governorship primary in the state.\n\nAnother example is the recent defection of former governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, with his loyalists from the PDP to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\n\nThere are also rumours that several leading politicians in the two major parties have concluded arrangements with smaller opposition parties to pick their ticket if they lose out in the primaries.\n\nLanre Oshungboye, a chieftain of the Accord Party in Lagos State, said the defection of politicians to lesser opposition parties has always been because of imposition of candidate on them by party leaders, wondering why a popular aspirant would stay back and watch his political ambition truncated when he had popular support.\n\nAccording to him ,\u201dDefinitely, we all know for a fact that politics is a game of numbers; when a candidate is convinced and believes he has the number to challenge the establishment, why stay back where they will impose a preferred candidate on you?\n\n\u201cIn politics, there is no permanent friend or foe, but permanent interest. If your interest is no longer protected in a political party, nothing stops you from actualising it on another platform.\u201d\n\nChijioke Umelahi, a former Abia State lawmaker, who is aspiring for a seat at the Arochukwu/Ohaofia Federal Constituency, lamented that because of the about 150 percent increase in the nomination fee for the House of Representatives in the PDP, many have defected to APGA, which is equally a formidable force in the Eastern part of the country.\n\n\u201cI cannot dare the APC form because it is out of reach and my constituency favours PDP. Many of us are waiting for the primaries, if we fail, there is enough room in APGA,\u201d the aspirant said.\n\nThe former lawmaker and lawyer also hinted that a top PDP presidential aspirant has an understanding with APGA, to run under the party if the primaries did not favour him.\n\nIn the same vein, Onyemdi Ikpeama, a senior lecturer at Abia State University Uturu, and former student union activist, expressed the view that implosion was looming, not just in the two major parties, but also in other parties that will be sacrificing loyalty of their staunch members for selfish interests of moneybags who will pay to get their presidential tickets.\n\n\u201cI see implosion because our politicians are very selfish and ready to do anything or pay any amount to remain in the corridors of power. So, if Atiku loses out in PDP, he has plan B. We all know Tinubu\u2019s plan B. So, implosion is sure and it will enrich lesser known parties,\u201d Ikpeama said.\n\nPundits also say that considering the calibre and influence of Rabi\u2019u Musa Kwankwaso and Ibrahim Shekarau in some parts of the north, their activities in the NNPP could attract defectors from APC and PDP, who the primaries did not favour.\n\nAlso, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is rumoured to be Bola Ahmed Tinubu\u2019s plan B to secure a presidential ticket, will become the new APC in the South West if Tinubu loses at the APC primaries and decides to run under SDP.\n\nWith the look of things, observers say that the NNPP, SDP and APGA are the parties that are going to reap the most from the implosion in APC and PDP after the primaries this May.\n\nSpeaking to BusinessDay, Rufai Ahmed Alkali, a professor and national chairman of the NNPP, explained why the party may have become a beautiful bride.\n\n\u201cThe NNPP is the only party in Nigeria that has offered the youths less than 35 years of age fifty percent discount for the purchase of nomination forms. This has led to an influx of youths to the party and the party is equal to the task as it has put in place all measures to avoid rancour during the election,\u201d Alkali said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is not in doubt that Nigerians are tired and are therefore looking for a better option. Happily, with the caliber people joining our party such as Senator Shekarau, the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party is today that new option that Nigerians have been yearning and waiting for. And we promise Nigerians that we shall do everything possible to ensure that every Nigerian is carried along. This party is all about correcting past and current mistakes done by the APC and PDP and with your support, we shall achieve a better Nigeria and very soon it shall be the number one force in the country.\u201d\n\nFredrice Uyigue, Edo South senatorial vice chairman of the NNPP, said the party has a formidable structure and it is equipped to compete favourably with the other two parties.\n\nUyigue opined that the NNPP is a better solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems, adding that the party would project a presidential candidate who is qualified to deliver the dividends of democracy that the people have been yearning for since 1999.\n\n\u201cIt is only the best that can give us hope of deliverance and prosperity in our society. We cannot keep pushing up mediocre or be nepotistic in the choices of people to lead us. Both parties who have been in power are one and the same, and they keep criss-crossing.\n\n\u201cDisaffection is bound to happen among members of those parties, and many will come to our party. We will welcome them, but we will also demand some quality and assurances that they will not bring their bad practices from their old party to ours.\n\n\u201cWe set a different agenda from the beginning, which is different from the other parties. NNPP has repositioned itself to respond to the inadequacies of the other parties,\u201d Uyigue said.\n\nMarvis Osagie, a Benin resident, told BusinessDay that, \u201cMost of these top aspirants have seen the signs already that they may be disqualified and, as such, will grab the opportunity if given the chance to defect to another party so as to fulfill their political ambitions.\n\n\u201cIn the past few days, we have seen some developments among some parties, and it is glaring that a merger is possible so they can field a stronger candidate who will become a third force to the likes of the APC and the PDP,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: 2023: Political atmosphere hots up as PDP, APC elect presidential candidates consecutively\n\nThe limitation\n\nBut, this will not be a smooth ride as observers say the aggrieved defectors and their party may be challenged with the onerous task of dislodging the existing structure of the APC and that of the PDP within a short time frame.\n\nSome pundits say that the \u201csmaller\u201d opposition parties would continue to find it difficult to win election, because most of them have no grassroots presence and are often not prepared for major elections.\n\n\u201cWell, maybe you are referring to SDP and NNPP as the parties that would reap from any implosion in the leading parties, but this might not really have adverse effect on the chances of the APC and PDP in retaining their position as the leading political parties in the 2023 race.\n\n\u201cThe smaller parties don\u2019t have structure; do you know the secretariat of any of them in Lagos? They only come and set up a place when the election is approaching, that is why, even if the big politicians defect to contest there, they may not win.\n\n\u201cYes, APC may likely implode but any faction or group that moves to another party may not really make any headway in the long run on,\u201d Kunle Okunade, political analyst, said.\n\nOkunade added that he does not expect any significant implosion in the two major parties, especially the PDP ahead of the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cFor now, it is obvious that the expected implosion may not occur in PDP based on what is going on in the party, which looks like the leaders would settle for an agreed terms.\n\n\u201cWe may not experience the effect of the 2014 implosion in PDP, in this coming election because those that would be affected would be minority in the party.",
          "summary": "Another example is the recent defection of former governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, with his loyalists from the PDP to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).\nThere are also rumours that several leading politicians in the two major parties have concluded arrangements with smaller opposition parties to pick their ticket if they lose out in the primaries.\n\u201cI cannot dare the APC form because it is out of reach and my constituency favours PDP.\nWith the look of things, observers say that the NNPP, SDP and APGA are the parties that are going to reap the most from the implosion in APC and PDP after the primaries this May.\nOkunade added that he does not expect any significant implosion in the two major parties, especially the PDP ahead of the 2023 election.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) has proposed a six-point agenda to nudge Nigeria\u2019s prospective political actors towards actualising the immediate yearnings of Nigerians and effecting sustainable economic change.\n\nThe NESG\u2019s Economic Dialogue, which was held in Abuja,to set agenda for politicians jostling for public offices ahead of the 2023 general election, was attended by high-profile political leaders, private and public sector stakeholders, civil society and academia.\n\nThe six-point agenda urged the government to rethink what socio-economic development outcomes mean for an average Nigerian, rethink the role of market and the private sector and deepen sectoral reforms to support broad-based growth and competitiveness.\n\nThe agenda also urged the nation\u2019s leadership to facilitate integrated national and sub-national approach to economic inclusion and development, pragmatic and actionable social sector reforms and develop workable and inclusive national security strategy in all dimensions.\n\nIn his keynote speech, Asue Ighodalo, chairman, NESG, said that the process by which parties select their candidates during the primaries and the characteristics and capacity of persons chosen were crucial to the Nigerian dream.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government has a pivotal role in addressing, with utmost urgency, six critical challenges causing economic dysfunction. These challenges are non-inclusive economic growth, macroeconomic stability, infrastructure deficit, human capital deficit and skills gap, national insecurity and weak economic competitiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nIghodalo further said: \u201cWe, the citizens, need to pay attention to the quality of our political system, processes, institutions and economic reforms. Our collective responsibility is to deliver a first-world country with happy and safe citizens. This is a call to national service. We must all be more involved, more selfless and tolerant, acting in the national interest.\u201d\n\nOsita Ogbu, director, Institute for Development Studies, University of Nigeria Nsukka, said enough emphasis was not placed on inequality, adding that inequality undermines the trust, solidarity, and mutuality on which good citizenship is based.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOnce you have a non-inclusive growth economy, it\u2019s a recipe for what we are already observing in this country. Poverty is pervasive; inequality is pervasive. It is not just a simple matter: there are few rich people and many poor people. It\u2019s a matter of citizenship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of how can you expect people who do not have a stake in the country to regard themselves as citizens of this country? When people ask what we do to fix the economy, I always say fix the politics first. If you fix the politics, that\u2019s a major step towards fixing the economy because major economic decisions are made by politicians.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NESG, the government needs partnership with the private sector to effect positive socio-economic outcomes. This demands a free-market orientation to support growth and inclusion, ensure appropriate pricing, and unlock private capital for economic development.\n\nMeanwhile, external imbalances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic and the on-going Russia-Ukraine war provide compelling reasons for countries to look inwards and support domestic value-chain development.\n\nThe NESG emphasised that this is applicable to the Nigerian situation. The government needs to prioritise value-added exports for commodities \u2013 particularly agricultural products and oil to address cross-sectoral value chain constraints and drive economic growth.\n\nReinforcing the urgency of adopting this strategy, Ari Aisen, Resident Representative, International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Nigeria, said the global economy has been hit by the second shock of the Russia-Ukraine war, stressing that it puts the economy in a difficult situation.\n\n\u201cAllowing food production to satisfy the citizenry takes precedence over other priorities. Food security is a big objective, and attention must be paid to this sector so it can provide enough food to keep Nigerians from suffering from the shock disproportionately,\u201d Aisen said.\n\nOlisa Agbakoba, Senior Partner, Olisa Agbakoba Legal, said when bad leadership ceases to have an effect, then the effect of bad leadership would cease, wondering why from 1960 till date, the country\u2019s successive leaders had failed.\n\nCurrently, most states in the federation experience internally generated revenue constraints and, as a result, live off the monthly subventions from the federation account.\n\nThis, the NESG argued, demands an integrated national and sub-national approach to foster economic cooperation between subnational governments, boost intra-regional wealth transfer, and check socio-economic polarisation and inter/intraregional divides. It cited the rice milling partnership between the governments of Lagos and Kebbi as one example of such successful projects that should be encouraged in Nigeria.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) ranks Nigeria\u2019s healthcare system 178th out of 192 countries. Medical tourism and brain drain among health practitioners have also taken a huge toll on the sector, even as Nigeria also accounts for 20percent of the global out-of-school children.\n\nThe NESG said a functioning and efficient social sector is critical to developing a resilient economy, and therefore advocated for pragmatic and actionable social sector reforms, particularly in education and health.\n\nHussaini Abdu, Country Director, CARE International Nigeria, said the country was experiencing a huge social development crisis, adding that the crisis in the university reflects the larger crisis in the education sector.\n\nRead also: Editors resolve to \u2018screen\u2019 political aspirants ahead 2023\n\n\u201cThe level of investment in healthcare is extremely poor. Seventy-seven percent of health service delivery in this country is out of pocket. This is how health service is being financed in this country, and it does not work anywhere. It means our health insurance system is not working. It only captures a few civil servants, and the poor are not getting good services.\u201d Abdu said.\n\nTosin Faniro-Dada, managing director/CEO, Endeavour Nigeria, emphasised the importance of the digital economy and providing support for Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to scale with adequate infrastructure, power supply and skills development.\n\nSamson Itodo, executive director, YIAGA Africa, who was also a panellist at the dialogue, said the conception of public leadership needs to be reviewed, revisited and redesigned in Nigeria, adding that we need a new political mobilisation strategy to sensitise Nigerians on why it is crucial to elect good leaders.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf you have a political process that is highly commercialised, plays with a deficit of ideas competition, and is exclusionary of the vast majority of people, what you have at the end of the day is a ruling and political class disconnected from reality.\n\n\u201cThe conception of public leadership needs to be reviewed, revisited and redesigned. We need a new political mobilisation strategy to sensitise Nigerians on why it is crucial to elect good leaders. We need to amplify the need for us to register and cast our votes. Voters in 2023 need to be informed voters who understand the issues.\u201d",

Please help us express our profound gratitude to him. We will continue to appreciate his kind gesture.\u201d\n\nHailing the army officers\u2019 wives for the support and encouragement they continue to give to officers, ensuring peace and security in the country, the governor said, \u201cWe know the role of the Nigerian Army Officers\u2019 Wives play in the lives of our services men, and also, when we run into a crisis, we call on the army and we know the professionalism at which they respond to our call.\n\n\u201cFor us as a government, our priority is our people. It\u2019s our people first because it\u2019s people that create everything first; it\u2019s people that create money, as well as technology, among others. So, without education and healthcare, at the basis, to strengthen your population, nothing else is going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThat is why we have prioritized education in Edo and we are spending as much as we can afford on those two issues that affect the people. In the case of education, our focus is on the foundation, because once you have a sound foundation, that child can build on that foundation subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe children in our public schools can compete with their colleagues anywhere in the world. Certainly, we want to extend this to your barracks if you allow us. The Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) is acclaimed as one of the most transparent educational projects on the continent.\n\nEarlier, Mrs. Salamatu Yahaya, said that they were in Edo to launch a skill acquisition empowerment programme and inaugurate a daycare facility, both in Ekehuan cantonment, Benin City.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Federation of International Basketball Association (FIBA) has warned that Nigeria faces sanctions following its decision to withdraw from international competitions for two years.\n\nFIBA stated this in a letter addressed to factional Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBF) president, Musa Ahmadu-Kida signed by Jaime Lamboy, Head of Legal, FIBA and dated May 18, 2022.\n\nRecall that last week, sports minister, Sunday Dare, through the Permanent Secretary of the sports ministry, Ismaila Abubakar, stated that President Muhammadu Buhari had given approval, with immediate effect, to withdraw Nigeria from all international basketball competitions for two years, following lingering leadership rift in the NBBF.\n\nThe minister added that the withdrawal would help the country revamp the sport from the grassroots, as well as put an end to the basketball crises.\n\nThe decision, however, was opposed by Nigeria\u2019s female basketball team, D\u2019Tigress which insisted on going for the upcoming women\u2019s basketball world cup.\n\nFIBA, in the statement, warned that Nigeria was at the risk of being sanctioned, saying the withdrawal was in breach of Article 9.7 of FIBA\u2019s General Statutes, which states, \u201cNational member federations shall manage their affairs independently and with no influence from third parties.\u201d\n\nArticle 10.2 of the FIBA Statutes added that on the initiative of the Secretary-General, FIBA Central Board may suspend a national member federation for the breach of Article 9.7.\n\nIf the sanction is approved, it means Nigeria will miss out on the 2024 Olympic Games, as well as the 2025 World Championships for the male and female teams.\n\nSimilarly, Nigeria will also be unable to compete at the next two Afrobasket Championships (male and female).\n\nReacting to a letter earlier written to them by the Ahmadu-Kida-led NBBF board, FIBA stated, \u201cIn such letter, you pre-emptively informed FIBA of the apparent decision by the Nigerian Government (Federal Ministry of Youth & Sports Development) intending to have Nigeria take a break from all international engagements for two years and enabling an Interim Management Committee to run the affairs of the basketball in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs you already are aware, Nigeria is due to participate in the following FIBA competitions in the upcoming months: FIBA 2023 Basketball World Cup Qualifiers (FBWC23 Qualifiers) FIBA 2022 Women\u2019s Basketball World Cup (FWBWC22)\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, any withdrawal of Nigeria from the abovementioned competitions will trigger potential disciplinary sanctions as per the FIBA Internal Regulations. Furthermore, if the absence of Nigeria from international competitions for the next two years materialises, the consequences may spread out well past such a two-year period.\n\n\u201cFor example, please note that the withdrawal from the FBWC23 Qualifiers is also a withdrawal from the Paris 2024 Olympic qualification process. Similarly, depending on third-party results, the same situation could apply with respect to FIBA AfroBasket 2025.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cAccordingly, we request from the NBBF to immediately inform FIBA whether its participation in the abovementioned competitions is or not ratified.\n\n\u201cWe take the opportunity to remind the NBBF of its obligations to manage its affairs with no influence from third parties, as per Article 9.6 of FIBA General Statutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI send you and your Federation\u2019s staff my Best Wishes for health and safety.\u201d",

          "text": "The general overseer of Christian Central Chapel International (CCCI) a.k.a Faith Mansion World Headquarters, Calabar, Bishop (Dr) Emmah Gospel Isong, revealed yesterday, that he had single handedly put smiles on the faces of 55 widows who he said have been on his payroll for ten years and even running.\n\nBishop Emmah Isong who is the national publicity secretary of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and was also appointed in 2021 by the governor Ben Ayade\u2019s administration to superintend over the disturbing activities of extortionists who take delight in exploiting innocent traders granted tax relieve, made the revelation while reacting to insinuations by tax collectors that he can be influenced.\n\nThe clergyman who said he was too blessed by God to stoop that low said , \u2018 I want to categorically tell those who are dreaming of dragging me into the mud of petty corruption that these tax collectors (extortionists) who are bent on denting my integrity became angry with Isong for not letting them have their way. The truth is that I am a child of God and I practice what I preach. I am too decent to dent my image and I will never collect and always discourage extortion or racket as they put it.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe renowned clergyman poured out his mind while delivering a speech at the Cross River State Anti-tax agency 2nd Anniversary. He emphatically added that ,\u2019No one can make me compromise a critical assignment assigned to me by the state governor.\n\n\u201cI am not so cheap to be bought over. I have 55 Widows on my pay roll in the last ten years. I am not a hungry man to be easily bribed. Nobody can give me money to destroy my integrity.\n\n\u201cI am a member , Board of Trustee of America Anti-crime Commission Agency.\n\nI am not so cheap to be bought with peanuts. My integrity means a lot to me.\u201d Isong maintained.\n\nThe anti tax agency DG stressed that plans were in advance stage to ensure that those caught engaging in extortion or collecting money forcefully from petti-traders on the guise of taxation even when the state governor had granted tax relief to petti-traders and very low income earners, would be sent to farms to work and generate food the state food bank.\n\nHe stated that the agency is prepared to collaborate effectively with the state Internal Revenue Service IRS and other relevant agencies to ensure the implementation of the agency\u2019s philosophy.",

          "text": "\n\n\u2026says \u2018award is a challenge to impact more on humanity\u2019\n\nIn recognition of his achievements and outstanding performance in office, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun, on Friday night, received yet another award, as he was crowned the Vanguard Newspapers\u2019 Governor of The Year 2021 for Good Governance.\n\nHe received the award at a colourful event tagged \u2018Vanguard Personality of the Year 2021 Award\u2019 which held at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos.\n\nRecall that Oyetola had in the recent past won the Business Day Best Governor of the Year award, Blueprint Newspaper Governor of the Year, DAAR Communications Outstanding Leader in Governance, Nigerian NewsDirect 2021 Best Governor of the Year and Man of the Year award, among others.\n\nThe governor described his latest award as a challenge to impact more on humanity just as he dedicated it to the people of Osun for giving him the opportunity to prove that governance can be done better with utmost fear of God and for the sake of humanity.\n\nAccording to the management of the Vanguard Newspapers, the choice of Governor Oyetola for the Good Governance award was basically on empirical facts and indisputable statistics on the geometric transformation that Osun and her people had witnessed under his watch since assumption of office.\n\nIt explained that the philosophy of the award is to recognise and celebrate excellence, national pride and service to humanity.\n\n\u201cSince assumption of office you have delivered the dividends of democracy without loans. It is on record that you have prudently managed available resources while your Administration has kept faith with the people and maintained fidelity with your electoral promises.\n\n\u201cWe also noted the crisis in the education sector and how brilliantly the Governor has resolved it. One other thing we have seen is the character of Mr. Governor: no crisis, no rancour. In fact, we have seen the highest level of decorum in governance.\n\n\u201cGenerally, this nomination for the award of Governor of the Year for Good Governance is actually an encouragement award on how the Governor has raised the pedestal of governance for the people of Osun and beyond,\u201d the award organisers added.\n\nSpeaking shortly after receiving the award, Governor Oyetola thanked the management of the Vanguard Newspaper for recognising the modest achievements his administration had made to transform Osun. He dedicated the award to the people of the State for giving him the opportunity to serve them.\n\nOyetola said: \u201cI am highly elated to accept this award of Governor of the Year for Good Governance by one of the nation\u2019s frontline and integrity-savvy newspapers. This a reward for hardwork and I accept it wholeheartedly.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, good governance in itself answers to unblemished demonstrable service to the people and its factors for service are economic buoyancy, transparent and inclusive governance, equitable service delivery and political will; and all are seemingly mutually inclusive.\n\n\u201cHowever, achieving good governance and winning nomination in a depressed economy in a country where some of the competitors are way richer than us, makes our story somewhat different.\n\n\u201cWe came in when no one gave us a chance. We inherited a financially challenged State and one that could not pay its bills. We were however resolved to make a difference. And the difference we have so far made through prudent management of resources, including plugging waste and cutting costs.\n\n\u201cThrough creative and innovative alternative project funding, we have built and rehabilitated roads that had been abandoned for three decades or more.\n\n\u201cOur service distribution is anchored on quality and equitable service delivery. From infrastructure to health and education, security to welfare, projects and service have been equitably distributed to all the wards in the nine Federal Constituencies and three Senatorial Districts of the State.\n\n\u201cIn these three and a half years that we have been in the saddle, we have proved as a government that good governance and service delivery is possible in a depressed economy; that we can execute projects without borrowing; that we can look inward to pay salaries.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over three and a half years in government building a solid foundation for a sustainable economy. The remaining years shall be spent to build bricks that will deliver a strong and prosperous Osun and a happy and productive people. This is our mission in government. This is the least we owe our people.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, dedicate this award to our people wherever they are, for giving us the opportunity to prove that governance can be done better with utmost fear of God and for the sake of humanity.\n\n\u201cTo the staff and management of Vanguard Newspapers, we thank you for recognising our modest achievements as we continue to keep our eyes on the ball. We appreciate you for giving us this award to encourage us to do more\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of the occasion and former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Obong Victor Attah, lauded the leadership of the newspaper for promoting excellence, hard-work, competence, integrity and character through it daily reportorial and yearly award of excellence.\n\nAttah also charged Oyetola and other awardees to continue to be the source of inspiration and perfect examples for those behind.\n\nOther award recipients are: Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun; Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki; Nasarawa State Governor, Alhaji Abdullahi Sule; Gombe State Governor, Muhammed Inuwa Yahaya, foremost Legal Luminary, Aare Afe Babalola among others.\n\nGovernor Oyetola was accompanied to the event by his wife, Mrs. Kafayat, his children, Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye, Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, Chief of Staff, Dr. Charles Akinola, Finance Commissioner, Bola Oyebamiji, Information Commissioner, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, former member of House of Representatives, Hon.

          "title": "Border Demarcation, A Big Challenge In The Curbing Of Petrol Smuggling \u2013 Customs",
          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "Centre-left leader Anthony Albanese claimed victory in Australia\u2019s general election Saturday, as voters angered by climate inaction pulled the plug on a decade of conservative rule.\n\n\u201cThe Australian people have voted for change,\u201d said the 59-year-old Labor leader, promising a less pugilistic form of leadership and a raft of reforms to make the country fairer and greener.\n\nWith almost two-thirds of the votes counted, Albanese was set to lead the largest party in parliament, but had yet to secure an outright majority.\n\nThe election was a stinging rebuke for Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who admitted it was a \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201chumbling\u201d night for his conservative coalition.\n\nHis Liberals lost seats to Labor across the country, but they suffered the most painful defeat at the hands of climate-focused independent candidates in a string of once ultra-safe conservative urban seats.\n\nThe so-called \u201cteals\u201d \u2014 mostly women \u2014 ran on pro-environment, anti-corruption and pro-gender equality tickets.\n\n\u201cWhat we have achieved here is extraordinary,\u201d said Zoe Daniels, an independent who claimed victory in a once safe Liberal seat in Melbourne.\n\nThe teals tapped into deep seated anger in wealthy suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne at Morrison\u2019s unbridled support for the coal industry, despite three years of climate-worsened bushfires, drought and floods that upended life for millions.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg was in danger of becoming their biggest scalp \u2014 all but conceding as his seat in Melbourne was projected to fall to teal independent Monique Ryan.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Fires and floods\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cPeople are saying the climate crisis is something they want action on,\u201d said an elated Australian Greens leader Adam Bandt.\n\n\u201cWe have just had three years of drought, and then fires and now floods and then floods again. And people can see it, that this is happening and it\u2019s unfolding.\u201d\n\nAlbanese has vowed to end Australia\u2019s \u201cclimate wars\u201d, adopt more ambitious emissions targets, introduce a federal corruption watchdog and extend to indigenous people a constitutional right to be heard on national policy-making.\n\nHe vowed to transform the country a renewable energy \u201csuperpower\u201d.\n\nBut he has refused calls to phase out coal use, or to block the opening of new coal mines.\n\nHe may now have to cut deals with independents demanding deeper commitments that would risk the ire of the pro-coal and mining union factions of his party.\n\nAlbanese said he was \u201chumbled\u201d by victory.\n\nOfficial projections indicated Labor had won 72 of the 76 seats it needs for a majority. With many votes still to be counted, it could yet secure a majority on its own.\n\n\u201cIt says a lot about our great country that that a son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing\u2026 can stand before you tonight as prime minister,\u201d Albanese said.\n\n\u201cMy mother dreamt of a better life for me. And I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars,\u201d Albanese said, before trying to calm some of his more exuberant fans.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get here tonight,\u201d said Joan O\u2019Donnell, a Labor member for 21 years, embracing her fellow branch members.\n\n\u201cThe right wing has had power for too long.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Fair dinkum\u2019 \u2013\n\nEarlier Saturday, Albanese asked voters to give his centre-left party a \u201ccrack\u201d at running the country, and urged people to spurn a \u201cdivisive\u201d prime minister.\n\nAustralians \u201cwant someone who is fair dinkum, someone who will \u2018fess up if they make a mistake,\u201d said the Labor leader.\n\nAlbanese often notes he would be the first Australian with a non-Anglo or Celtic surname to be prime minister.\n\nVoting in Australia is compulsory, enforced with a Aus$20 (US$14) fine but also rewarded at many booths that fired up barbecues to offer people a \u201cdemocracy sausage\u201d.\n\nThe election decides who controls the House of Representatives, the Senate and who lives in the prime minister\u2019s \u201cLodge\u201d.",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to \u201cwidely publish the reports on the accounts and balance sheet of every political party submitted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to the National Assembly since 2015.\u201d\n\nSERAP urged him to \u201curgently examine the books and records of financial transactions of political parties, and to make public the outcome of any such examination.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urged him to \u201cprovide details of the guidelines, and steps that INEC is taking to prevent vote buying in the forthcoming elections in Ekiti and Osun states and 2023 general elections, and to prosecute vote buyers and other electoral offenders.\u201d\n\nRecently, the All Progressives Congress (APC) collected N100 million for its presidential form while the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) collected N40 million for its presidential form for the 2023 election. Some leading political parties and politicians also spend between N250 to N14,000 to buy votes.https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197678&action=edit#\n\nIn the letter dated 21 May, 2022 and signed by SERAP https://www.tvcnews.tv/purplegold/post.php?post=197678&action=edit#deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cNigerians have the right to know about the accounts and financial transactions of their political parties, especially the major parties with a strong possibility to assume government in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201ctransparency and accountability of political parties is important to achieve greater transparency in public life, curb the influence of money in politics, promote a level playing field, and remove the risks to the independence of political actors and would-be public office holders.\u201d\n\nSERAP also said, \u201cIt is both immoral and illegal to pay citizens to vote for a particular political party or candidate. Unpunished cases of vote buying and related electoral offences would continue to undermine good governance, the rule of law, moral values, as well as hinder citizens\u2019 participation in elections.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cWhen a political candidate decides to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidate will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote buying and related electoral offences encourage poor governance and weaken citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their elected officials accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to urgently take measures and to collaborate with appropriate anti-corruption agencies to ensure the effective prosecution of any outstanding cases of vote buying and related electoral offences allegedly committed in the context of the 2019 general elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of transparency and accountability in political finance is seriously undermining the legitimacy and credibility of the democratic and electoral processes, and invariably contributing to denying the citizens the right to effective participation in their own government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure of political parties to comply with transparency and accountability frameworks would undermine citizens\u2019 trust in their political parties and lack of trust will inevitably destroy confidence in the system and decrease citizens\u2019 interest and participation in the democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cElections are only one part of the democratic process, and a fair and effective electoral system must be founded in an adequate democratic infrastructure and responsibility of political leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, several political parties have for many years failed to submit their annual financial statements to INEC. Many political parties have failed to submit election expenses reports, and to disclose material contributions received from individuals and corporate bodies to the Commission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also been apparently unable or unwilling to monitor, examine and publish these financial statements.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, some leading political parties, politicians and other political actors reportedly paid between N250 to N14,000 to buy votes. For many years, allegations of vote buying (the payment of cash or gifts in exchange for voting) and related electoral offences have characterised elections and party primaries in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that despite several provisions of the Electoral Act (as amended), anti-corruption laws, and the country\u2019s international anti-corruption obligations, suspected perpetrators of vote buying and related electoral offences frequently escape justice for their crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, INEC has consistently failed to exercise its powers and to provide the leadership that would promote collaboration with appropriate anti-corruption agencies to facilitate and ensure thorough, transparent and effective investigation of cases, and the arrest and prosecution of suspected perpetrators.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 86(1) of the Electoral Act 2022 requires every political party to submit to INEC a detailed annual statement of assets and liabilities and analysis of its sources of funds and other assets and statement of its expenditure. Failure to comply is an offence under Section 86(2), which is punishable by imprisonment for a term of six months or a fine of N1,000,000 or both.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder Section 86(3)(4) INEC has the power to examine the records and audited accounts kept by any political party, and to publish the report on such examinations and audit in two national newspapers and Commission\u2019s website within 30 days of receipt of the results.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 226 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022 also requires INEC to prepare and submit a report every year to the National Assembly on the accounts and balance sheet of every political party. Under Section 225(5), INEC has the power to give directions to political parties regarding their books or records of financial transactions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution and international standards guarantee and protect the right of all qualified citizens to vote, in state as well as in general elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right to vote freely for the political party and candidate of one\u2019s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe effective exercise of the right of qualified Nigerians to have a voice in the election of those who make and enforce the laws under which, as good citizens, they live can contribute to the enjoyment of other human rights, including to corruption-free public services, freedom of expression and digital and data rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic confidence in voting systems serves as an indispensable feature of a full and healthy democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPersistent failure to arrest and prosecute suspected perpetrators of vote buying and related electoral offences may ultimately undermine public confidence, the integrity of the country\u2019s elections, and lead to wide-spread disaffection with the electoral process.\u201d",

          "text": "Several houses and shops were razed and many people, including a pastor, were critically injured when some Muslim youths in Katangan Wargi, headquarters of Warji Local Government Area (LGA) of Bauchi State went on a rampage on Friday evening in protest against an alleged blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad (SAW) by a Christian lady.\n\nNormalcy has, however, returned to the area as Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, warned that he would not spare anyone bent on disrupting the peace of the state.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThis is coming as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Saturday said that it would go ahead with its planned nationwide protests against the recent killing of Miss Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto over alleged blasphemy by some Islamic extremists.\n\nCAN has also expressed worry over the allegation of blasphemy in Bauchi State and urged the security agencies to act fast to address abuse of the Constitution before it leads to a serious conflict that cannot be handled.\n\nNobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, has also called for the sacking of the Imam, National Mosque, Abuja, Professor Ibrahim Maqari, over his comment on the murder of Deborah.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the lady identified as Rhoda Jatau, a 40-year- old member of staff of the Medical Department of Warji LGA, allegedly posted a video of someone who renounced Islam on a WhatsApp group.\n\nThe message, it was learnt, did not go down well with her co-workers who are predominantly Muslims.\n\nHowever, the girl was whisked away to safety by fellow Christians, who got wind of the impending danger.\n\nBut the irate Muslim youths went on the rampage and started destroying properties belonging to Christians when the planned attempt to lynch the girl failed after Jumma prayers on Friday.\n\n\u201cWe were at home Friday evening when we heard shouts from Muslim youths in their hundreds wanting to attack the ECWA church but Christian youths and others resisted and repelled them but after they had already set the shops attached to the church on fire,\u201d a member of the ECWA church, who pleaded anonymity, said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn the process, one of the pastors of the ECWA Church was seriously injured. As I am speaking to you, efforts are on to save his life as he lost much blood due to the injuries inflicted on him.\u201d\n\nConfirming the incident, the state police command said six houses and seven shops were on Friday evening set ablaze by irate youths while many people were also injured.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Umar Mamman Sanda, has also ordered a thorough investigation into the crisis.\n\nA statement issued Saturday by the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Ahmed Mohammed Wakil said the violence was a result of a blasphemous message posted on social media by one Rhoda Jatau, a 40-year-old staff of the Medical Department of Warji LGA.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cOn May 20, 2022, at about 1745hours, some irate youths set six houses and seven shops ablaze, while some score of persons were injured as a result of a blasphemous message posted on a social media by one Rhoda Jatau (female), 40 years old staff of the Medical Department Warji Local Government\u201d.\n\nThe PPRO stated that the police have since deployed all Tactical Teams, Mobile Police Force, and Rapid Response Squad (RRS) whose joint efforts brought the situation under control, adding that the area is calm for now, while visibility patrols are ongoing to keep the peace.\n\nHe said that the state police commissioner appealed to the public to be calm and go about their lawful business without any fear of intimidation as normalcy has been restored in the affected area.\n\n\u201cWhile assuring the general public that the police is on top of the situation and will continue to update the public as to the level of investigation from time to time\u201d\n\n\u201cThe command would like to use this medium to reiterate the need for parents and guardians to maintain strict vigilance over the activities of their wards, particularly youths.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police also urges religious leaders, community leaders, and elders generally to always speak to youths to desist from anything that could temper with the security of their areas,\u201d the statement added.\n\nReacting to unrest in the state, Governor Bala Mohammed yesterday said he would not spare anyone bent on disrupting the peace of the state.\n\nThe governor stated when he visited residents of the Warji community to commiserate with victims over the incident.\n\nSpeaking at the palace of District Head of Warji, Mohammed expressed worry over the spate of insecurity in some parts of the country, saying that it was time for people to allow peace at all costs as the consequences of insecurity were devastating.\n\n\u201cReligion is very close to peoples\u2019 hearts. It is very uncivilised to joke about each others\u2019 religions. We know that there are Christians and Muslims in Warji. Those of us who are 60 years old never heard of a crisis in Warji before this time.\n\n\u201cI must commend religious leaders, traditional leaders, and security personnel for putting up a combined effort that leads to quenching of the violence.\n\n\u201cI will not spare anyone found making attempts to cause trouble. My administration has a special regard for peace and religious tolerance and I will not fold up my arms to allow unpatriotic people to cause trouble in any part of the state,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to the incident, the Chairman of CAN in Kaduna State, Rev. Joseph John Hayab, has expressed worry over the allegation of blasphemy in Bauchi.\n\nHe urged the security agencies to act fast to address abuse of the constitution before it leads to a more serious conflict that cannot be handled.\n\nHe said in a statement yesterday, that allegations of blasphemy have now become the new excuse by fundamentalists in Northern Nigeria to kill the remnant that bandits and terrorists have not yet killed.\n\n\u201cWe know and have evidence of how some of these allegations of blasphemy are false and just for blackmail or settling scores with perceived enemies or well-mannered young girls who have refused sexual advances by the opposite sex from another religion.\n\n\u201cWe are also aware of how fanatics have in the past raised lies in the name of blasphemy.\n\n\u201cCAN wonder if the recent sermons we are getting from some Islamic clerics on what the Holy Quran says about what should be done if anyone is accused of blasphemy is unpopular amongst followers?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenge now is for government authorities and security agencies to act fast to address this abuse of our constitution before it leads to a more serious conflict that cannot be handled.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria Christians most especially those of Northern extraction have for ages exhibited tolerance despite many provocations and lack of reciprocation of our love and friendship but these new tactics for killing our people from any and every accusation of blasphemy are unacceptable to CAN and all Christian faithful. We will not accept this brutal way of murder and inhuman treatment of our followers to continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment and security agencies should come out to enforce the law on every murderer hiding under religion.\n\nIn a related development, the national body of CAN has said that it would go ahead with its May 22 planned nationwide protests against the recent killing of Miss Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto over alleged blasphemy by some Islamic extremists.\n\nThe Special Assistant on Media and Communications to the CAN President, Pastor Adebayo Ayodeji, disclosed this to THISDAY on Saturday against the background of the threat by a Muslim group to protest on the same day.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are going ahead with our protests and we have said that our members should hold their protest within the premises of the CAN Secretariat and not on the streets.\n\n\u201cWe are to gather in the CAN Secretariat nationwide and not on the streets,\u201d Ayodeji said.\n\nHe added that CAN has directed that where there is no CAN Secretariat in a state, Christians should choose one of the churches that can accommodate them for the protests.\n\nIn a related development, Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, has called for the sacking of the Imam, National Mosque, Abuja, Professor Ibrahim Maqari, over his comment on the murder of Deborah.\n\nSoyinka accused the Islamic cleric of directing his followers to take the law into their own hands in the name of religion.\n\nHe spoke in Abuja yesterday during the one-year remembrance of the late former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, and the launch of Attahiru\u2019s biography written by author, Niran Adedokun.\n\nMeanwhile, Nobel laureate, Soyinka, has lamented lynching in the name of religion, adding that the \u201capostate of the creed of humanity, Professor Maqari, must be removed from office.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is no longer sufficient for all to declaim that Islam is this and that, that the Sharia is thus and thus, that Prophet Mohammed set this or that example and made this or that humanistic pronouncement.\n\n\u201cWe have gone beyond theocratic rhetoric that merely pays lip service to civilised norms. Let all pietistic denunciations be backed by affirmative action.\u201d\n\nThe playwright noted that the Islamic cleric had done nothing but encourage his followers to kill anyone that blasphemes Prophet Muhammad.\n\nSoyinka added, \u201cProfessor Maqari, however, insists, with a handful of others, including vocal serving policemen quite recently, that there is no remorse involved in the torture and lynching of a young student on this earth.\n\n\u201cMaqari has implicitly directed his followers to take the law into their own hands in the name of religion, and innovation. That is the message of a supposedly holy man to a nation embroiled in his madness of multiple incidences.\u201d\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi",

          "title": "No Plan to Withdraw Naira Notes from Circulation, Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank Clarifies",
          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Saturday debunked reports that it planned to replace the conventional Naira notes in circulation with digital currency, otherwise known as the eNaira, in due course.\n\nThis is as the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group\u2019s Board has approved a $ 1.5 billion facility to support African countries deal with the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war impacting food prices and availability.\n\nCBN\u2019s Director of Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, said the misleading statement purportedly made at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement on eNaira adoption in Asaba, Delta, was misconstrued and therefore, urged the public to completely disregard it.\n\nNwanisobi further explained that the digital version of the Naira is meant to complement the existing currency notes and therefore, would circulate simultaneously with the conventional Naira notes as means of exchange and store of value.\n\nHe said the adoption of the digital legal tender, aside from its safety and speedy features, would also ensure greater access to financial services by the underbanked and unbanked populace thereby enhancing financial inclusion.\n\nHe urged the public and business owners to embrace digital currency as it offers more possibilities.\n\nThe eNaira was formally launched into circulation by President Muhammadu Buhari in October last year.\n\nThe apex bank\u2019s governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele had recently expressed optimism that the bank would achieve the 85 per cent financial inclusion target which is currently at about 70 per cent.\n\nAddressing a delegation of Executive Directors from the Bank of Uganda, who was on an experience sharing tour of the CBN\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project, Emefiele said the apex bank remained committed to accelerating the rate at which those who were financially excluded could come into the formal banking sector.\n\nHe also expressed satisfaction that the eNaira had recorded some level of success judging by the rate of integration and security features.\n\nThe central bank governor said the CBDC would enhance the relationship between mobile banking and e-business and speed up the rate of financial inclusion.\n\nHe pointed out that the interest that the eNaira continued to attract from other countries and multinational bodies, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, underscored the level and quality of work the CBN had put into the project.\n\nEmefiele said Nigeria is currently a case study to other climes, being the first country in Africa to launch its CBDC, adding that the country was treading cautiously to ensure it sustains the successes recorded so far.\n\nHe also told the visiting team that the country had deepened its payment system infrastructure, which is ranked among the best in the world.\n\nEmefiele had said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases, and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017.\n\nHe said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to clearly establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and our fast-growing payments platforms.\n\nNigeria, Others to Benefit from AfDB\u2019s $1.5bn Africa\u2019s Food Facility\n\nMeanwhile, the AfDB Group\u2019s Board has approved a $ 1.5 billion facility to support African countries deal with the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war impacting food prices and availability\n\nAfDB\u2019s Chief Agriculture Policy Economist and Coordinator of Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme at AfDB, Mr. Philip Boahen, said this at Tamale, Ghana, yesterday.\n\nBoahen said the facility is expected to reach over 20 million African farmers to deal with the food shortfall.\n\nThe bank, on its website, also said that with the disruption of food supplies arising from the war, Africa now faces a shortage of at least 30 million metric tonnes of food.\n\nAfDB said that food like wheat, maize, and soybeans imported from both countries was majorly affected by the war.\n\nAccording to the Bank, the $1.5 billion, an African Emergency Food Production Facility, is an unprecedented comprehensive initiative to support smallholder farmers in filling the food shortfall.\n\nThe AfDB said it would provide fertilizer to smallholder farmers across Africa over the next four farming seasons, indicating it will use its convening influence with major fertilizer manufacturers, loan guarantees, and other financial instruments to provide the fertilizers.\n\n\u201cAfrican farmers urgently need high-quality seeds and inputs before the planting season begins in May to immediately boost food supplies.\n\n\u201cThe facility will provide 20 million African smallholder farmers with certified seeds.\n\n\u201cIt will increase access to agricultural fertilizers and enable them to rapidly-produce 38 million tonnes of food.\n\n\u201cThis would be a $12 billion increase in food production in just two years,\u201d the AfDB said.\n\nThe Bank said the facility would lead to the production of 11 million tonnes of wheat; 18 million tonnes of maize; 6 million tonnes of rice; and 2.5 million tonnes of soybeans.\n\n\u201dIt will also support market growth and post-harvest management, and create a platform to advocate for critical policy reforms to solve the structural issues that impede farmers from receiving modern inputs.\u201d\n\nAfreximbank, APPO Sign MoU on Energy Transition Bank\n\nMeanwhile, the African Petroleum Producers\u2019 Organisation (APPO) and African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to establish an African Energy Transition Bank.\n\nThis is contained in a statement signed by Afreximbank\u2019s Media Contact, Mr. Amadou Sall, at the weekend.\n\nSall said the establishment of the energy bank was in support of an African-led energy transition strategy.\n\nHe said the new institution would accelerate Africa\u2019s economic development while ensuring the progress was compatible with and complementary to, the Sustainable Development Goals,\n\nSall said that the new bank would also ensure compatibility with the continent\u2019s long-term social and environmental objectives as set out in African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want.\n\nHe said that the bank would address an urgent and existential need on the continent.\n\n\u201cAfrica stands to experience profound effects from climate change, while the considerable poverty across the continent further disincentivises a focus on environmental care and sustainability for many populations.\n\n\u201cMoreover, Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry faces growing pressures as international investment in hydrocarbons diminishes.\n\n\u201cWhile Africa\u2019s transition towards alternative energy sources presents great opportunities for the continent, this transition must be carefully managed to minimise the short-term adverse impacts of the transition while maximising its longer-term benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nSall said the new bank\u2019s responsibilities would include the management and encouragement of such a productive transition.\n\nHe said that APPO member states would be signatories to the Energy Transition Bank\u2019s constitutional documents which would be structured in the form of a multilateral treaty, and invest equity into the new vehicle.\n\nSall said that Afreximbank would co-invest and advise on the establishment and implementation process.\n\nThe statement quoted Prof. Benedict Oramah, President of Afreximbank, as saying \u201cwe are delighted to be collaborating with APPO towards the establishment of the proposed African Energy Transition Bank\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are challenging times when we must strive to strike the right balance between the imperatives of mitigating climate change and the urgency of averting social upheavals as a result of increasingly difficult economic and financial conditions in Africa.\n\n\u201cFor us at Afreximbank, supporting the emergence of the African Energy Transition Bank will enable a more efficient and predictable capital allocation between fossil fuels and renewables.\u201d\n\nOramah is quoted to have said that establishing the bank would also free human and other resources at Afreximbank that would make it possible to support its member countries more effectively in the transition to cleaner fuels.",
