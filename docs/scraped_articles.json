          "text": "By Babajide Komolafe\n\nTHE Federal Government\u2019s deficit spending in 2021 rose by 39 per cent, year-on-year, YoY, to N5.5 trillion in August.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, disclosed this in its August Economic report, which showed that the FG recorded declines in both revenue and expenditure during the month.\n\nThe report shows that revenue rose 15 per cent, YoY to N2.83 trillion from N2.46 trillion in the corresponding period of 2021 (8mths-2020). But expenditure rose slightly faster by 16 per cent, YoY, to N7.11 trillion from N6.23 trillion in the corresponding period of 2020 (8mths-2020).\n\nREAD ALSO:Dowen College: Justice must be served in Sylvester\u2019s case \u2014 Reps\n\nThis resulted in a N5.5 trillion deficit during the period representing a 39 per cent, YoY, increase when compared with N3.97 trillion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nHowever, the CBN August Economic report showed that FG\u2019s monthly deficit spending fell by 25.2 per cent, month-on-month, MoM, to N405.28 billion from N541.85 billion in July.\n\nExplaining the figures, CBN stated: \u201cThe significant drop in aggregate expenditure, due to a fall in overhead cost and capital expenditure, outweighed the impact of low revenue outcome on the fiscal balance in August.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the provisional overall fiscal balance of the FGN, at N405.28 billion, contracted by 25.2 per cent, compared with N541.85 billion in July.\n\n\u201cAlthough the lower deficit increases the latitude for the maneuvering of fiscal policy, it projects, in part, losses in economic activities.\n\n\u201cFGN\u2019s retained revenue in August 2021 fell by 10.4 per cent to N376.33 billion, relative to N420.2 billion in July 2021 due to a 52.2 per cent dip in the FGN independent revenue, The Federal Government recorded reductions in receipt in all its revenue components.\n\n\u201cThe overriding decline in its independent revenue sources indicates lower remittances from ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) and government business interests. However, FGN statutory receipt from the Federation Account rose by 6.2 per cent to N299.00 billion, following the improvement in federation allocation.\n\n\u201cProvisional aggregate expenditure of the FGN, at N781.61 billion, fell by 18.8 per cent due to a reduction in overhead cost and disproportionately low capital expenditure. Although recurrent expenditure shrunk by 18.3 per cent swayed by a 48.9 per cent decline in overhead cost, it maintained its dominance in total spending, at N683.46 billion. Recurrent expenditure accounted for 87.4 per cent of total spending in August, while capital expenditure and transfers constituted 7.3 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively. The low allocation to capital expenditure was attributed to the lag in capital releases in the period.\u201d",

          "text": "Not less than 11 million Nigerians will be pushed into the poverty rank in 2022 as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Minister of Finance Budget and National Planning Mrs Zainab Ahmed said yesterday.\n\nShe spoke at the day two of the National COVID-19 Summit in Abuja.\n\nRepresented by the Director General of Budget Office, Ben Akabueze, at the event themed \u201cPushing Through the Last Mile to End the Pandemic and Build Back Better\u201d, the Minister explained that the pandemic had worsened the recession, which has pushed an additional 6.6 million Nigerians into poverty in 2020.\n\nAccording to her, before the pandemic, about two million Nigerians were expected to fall into poverty by 2020, as population growth outpaced economic growth. However, the pandemic jerked up the number, bringing the total newly poor to 8.6 million in the same year.\n\n\u201cThis implies an increase in the total number of poor in Nigeria from about 90 million in 2020 to about 109 million in 2022,\u201d she said.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nShe listed having a vulnerable employment; receiving fewer remittances and being close to the poverty line as being responsible for the increase in poverty.\n\nShe explained that as a result of the pandemic, Nigeria\u2019s total trade, driven by the slumps in exports, contracted by N3:731.49 billion (10.32%) from N36,152.11 billion in 2019 to N32,420.71 billion in 2020. Export declined by N6,669.55 billion (43,75%) to N12,522.67 billion while imports galloped by N2,2938.15 billion (17.32%) to N19,898.03 billion in 2020. This resulted in a significant trade deficit of N7,375.34 billion in the review period from a surplus of N2,232.36 billion in the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nShe said the country\u2019s outstanding debt rose by N5.51 trillion or 20.12% to N32.92 trillion as at December 2020 from N27.40 trillion in December 2019. Partly from new external borrowings comprising $3.4 billion budget support facility from the IMF, and the IDA of $1.2 billion, among others largely induced by COVID.\n\nShe said domestic debt stock also increased by N1.83 trillion to N20.21 trillion.

The price she said quickly rebounded to over $51 per barrel as at the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted negatively on global economic activities affecting both developed and developing countries alike.\n\n\u201cThe impact was disproportionately higher for developing countries particularly for those with poor health systems and those with higher cross border activities.\n\n\u201cEconomies with lower fiscal buffers and/or higher fiscal distress we\u2019re also less capable of intervening and therefore also more heavily affected,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has rejected the United Kingdom\u2019s travel ban on Nigerians as well as placing the country on a Red List.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s restrictions on Nigerians came into effect, yesterday after the Omicron variant of COVID-19 was discovered, first in South Africa and later, Nigeria. On Sunday, the British High Commissioner in Nigeria, communicated UK\u2019s decision to include Nigeria on the list, after nine African countries had been placed on the Red List. Britain also suspended visa services to Nigerians; with \u201cvery limited exceptions to travel and entry requirements for critical workers , medical and compassionate cases.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nA waiver was, however, made for citizens who travel from Nigeria but would have to pay \u00a32,285 for a 10-day quarantine.\n\nBut the Federal Government has reiterated that Britain\u2019s decision was discriminatory, punitive, unfair and not based on science and has demanded a review.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope the British government will immediately review the decision to put Nigeria on its red list and rescind it immediately. Nigeria has handled the COVID-19 pandemic with utmost responsibility and based on science, and has rightly earned global accolades for its efforts. Nigeria does not belong on any country\u2019s red lis,\u201d Minister of Information, National Orientation and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said at a press conference in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nAsked why President Muhammadu Buhari did not defer South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s visit to Nigeria, after the Omicron variant was detected in the country, he replied: \u201cAs we speak today, nobody has died from the omicron variant. South Africa had the fortune of having an excellent research centre, which was discovered to have been carried into South Africa, from Botswana, by foreigners\u2026 The Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 considered the visit and decided that, as long as the proper protocol was observed, there was no need to suspend the president\u2019s visit.\u201d\n\nMohammed also disclosed that the PSC would soon take a decision if the UK refuses to review its travel ban and Red list.\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s reaction cannot be based on anything but discrimination and prejudice. The truth of the matter is that if the pandemic is not killing as they think it should kill, it\u2019s not a matter of under-reporting. I don\u2019t think these prejudicial predictions of deaths in Africa is based on science.\u201d\n\nThe appropriate response to Britain would be taken by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19. Where is the origin of this variant? It\u2019s definitely not Africa, it\u2019s definitely not Nigeria. Countries in Europe where the same variant has been discovered, they have not been included on the travel ban. Even if 21 cases were discovered, does that qualify us for a travel ban? The ban is unfair, unjust and discriminatory.\n\n\u201c\u2026However, as the spokesman for the Federal Government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by the British government to put Nigeria on the red list just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science.\n\n\u201cHow do you slam this kind of discriminatory action on a country of 200 million people, just because of less than two dozen cases? Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned. The two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travellers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive.\n\n\u201cLet me seize this opportunity to highlight the fact that travel ban, the type that has been slammed on some African countries, is a knee-jerk reaction that can only be detrimental to our quest to most conclusively tackle this pandemic.\n\n\u201c Instead of these reflex responses that are driven by fear, rather than science, why can\u2019t the world take a serious look at the issue of access to vaccines, and ensure that it is based on the principles grounded in the right of every human to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political belief, economic or any other social condition. \u201c\n\n\u2022Decision taken to protect public health in the UK\n\nHowever, the UK has said the decision cannot be changed.\n\nHead of Communications, British High Commission, Abuja, Dean Hurlock, said the decision was a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe know that this decision will have a significant impact on people in both our countries, particularly at this time of year.\n\n\u201cThis decision is a precautionary measure to protect public health in the UK, whilst we try to understand this new variant.These are temporary measures that have been introduced to prevent further Omicron cases from entering the UK, and will be examined at a review point on 20 December.\n\n\u201cWe continue to work very closely with the Nigerian authorities in tackling the pandemic and commend their ongoing work,\u201d Hurlock added.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\n\u201cMany developed countries have used the advantage of their enormous resources or relationship to sign agreements with manufacturers to supply their countries with vaccines ahead of making them available for use by other countries. Even before the clinical trials were completed, millions of doses of the most promising vaccines have been bought by Britain, US, Japan and the EU. Some of these countries bought doses five times the size of their population, while others, mostly in Africa, have little or no access to vaccines. This is the real issue to address, instead of choosing the easy path of travel bans, which the UN Secretary General called Travel Apartheid.

He explained that the system would equally ensure speedy dispensation of trials in line with section 36(4) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), which provides that every person shall be entitled to fair hearing within a reasonable time.\n\n\u201cIt would also eliminate the issue of difficulties in conveying the inmates to court and would further ensure the safety and security of the inmates and law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cThis initiative will, in no small measure, help boost the economy by ensuring that funds meant for the movement of the inmates would be channeled to other essential areas of needs in the Correctional Centres, and assist the country to meet up with global best practice in terms of the administration of the criminal justice.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Ruaf Aregbesola, who hailed the AGF for the creative initiative, said the project will cut the cost of transportation, the time lost in transit and the often grave risks involved in moving suspects around will be cut altogether.\n\nEarlier, the Controller General Correctional, Halilu Nababa, expressed confidence that the project will enhance speedy access to justice and reposition the correctional service in line with standard global practice.\n\nHe said the target of the project, which is a pilot scheme to be replicated in other facilities nationwide, is to significantly address the perennial challenge of overcrowding in most of our urban facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidential Committee on Correctional Reforms and Decongestion, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Justice, yesterday, effected the release of 15 inmates with minor offences with an option of fine, at the Kuje Correctional Centre, Abuja.\n\nAlready, their fines were paid by the committee and their releases effected.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

This makes the acquisition a pivotal entry point for Equinix into the continent.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, the company has enabled connectivity for the business community of Nigeria and now has digital infrastructure assets including three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. Upon closing, these facilities will add more than 64,000 gross square feet of space to Platform Equinix, with 570,000 square feet of land for future expansions. MainOne owns and operates a subsea network from Nigeria to Portugal, as well as 1,200 kilometers of reliable terrestrial fiber network across southern Nigeria. These are all improving connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries and the major business communities in Nigeria. When completed, this acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa, giving organizations based inside and outside of Africa access to one of the world\u2019s fastest growing markets.\n\nSpeaking about the planned acquisition,\n\nPresident and CEO, Equinix, Charles Meyers, said: \u201cThe acquisition of MainOne will represent a critical point of entry for Platform Equinix into the expansive and rapidly growing African market. MainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa. Growth of data consumption in Africa is amongst the fastest in the world, and our customers are looking for a trusted partner to pursue the opportunities presented by broad mobile adoption and greater connectivity across the region. MainOne\u2019s infrastructure, customer relationships, partner ecosystem and operating capability will extend the reach of Platform Equinix and bolster opportunities for customers in Africa and throughout the world.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the transaction, the management team, including CEO of MainOne, Funke Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles. Opeke holds a master\u2019s in engineering from Columbia University and was named one of the World\u2019s Top 50 Women in Tech by Forbes in 2018 for her efforts in sparking internet adoption. She was also recently named one of the Top 10 Women to Watch in the Data Center Industry by Data Centre Magazine.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says FG borrows to pay salaries\n\nI will make my position known on presidency after consultations\n\nBy Nseobong Okon-Ekong\n\nContrary to widely held opinion that the North does not want restructuring of the federation, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, who is the Vice Chairman of Nigerian Governors Forum and Chairman of governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that Nigeria\u2019s advancement as a nation depends on \u201crestructuring and devolution of powers,\u201d while arguing that the Federal Government must \u201cshed weight and devolve more powers to the sub-nationals.\u201d\n\nAddressing a team of journalists in Sokoto on the recent tour of the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission to get inputs from states for an impending review of the revenue allocation formula, Tambuwal asserted that no state in the federation was happy with its allocation from the federation account.\n\n\u201d No state is happy with where it is. Not even Lagos or Rivers; so, if Lagos and Rivers are not happy with where they are, how do you want Sokoto and others to feel? We are all looking for money and resources. Not even the Federal Government is happy with where it is. They (Federal Government) has the lion share but they are looking for resources. Go and ask them; they borrow money to pay salaries,\u201d he said.\n\nContinuing his justification for restructuring of the country, Tambuwal said, \u201cIt is not about Sokoto but what people have been talking about the need for restructuring and devolution of powers in the country. We must review and restructure away all those things from the centre. I said it at the PDP Retreat. It is first our pathway to stability, growth and development. The Federal Government must shed weight and devolve more powers to sub-nationals where the people are in the states and local governments. That would give less attraction to the centre. Let the Federal Government be dealing with issues of immigration and other normal issues that a federal system should be concerned about.\u201d\n\nAnswering a question on whether he will go against the resolution of Southern Governors Forum to have a President from the South in 2023, Tambuwal said he found it difficult to talk about zoning. \u201cWhen you talk about what my brother governors from the South said, they are entitled to their opinion. When the Northern governors met in Kaduna, they said their own. But it is now for the political parties to sit down, look at the issues and plan how to win elections. The bottom-line for any political party is how to win elections. When you are talking about democracy and elections, you must think about demography; where are you going to get the votes?\u201d\n\nStating that he will make his position on contesting the presidency known in a few weeks, the Sokoto State Governor said, \u201cYou know that in 2018, I participated in the PDP primaries that held in Port Harcourt and I thank God that I came second. Several people are talking to me to give it a trial. At this moment, what I can tell you is that very soon, I am going to commence my consultations and whatever is the feedback I get and with prayers, I will let my position be known.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022FG fumes, insists ban discriminatory, unfair\n\n\u2022UN Condemns Britain, others for \u2018travel apartheid,\u2019 says ban targeted at poor countries\n\n\u2022Country\u2019s High Commissioner to United Kingdom kicks against restriction, calls for global collaboration\n\n\u2022NARD: New variant not as deadly to warrant flight restrictions\n\n\u2022CACOVID harps on mass vaccination to prevent virus spread\n\n\u2022Biden\u2019s medical Adviser urges Nigerians to take booster jabs\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo, Olawale Ajimotokan, Emmanuel Addeh\n\nin Abuja; Chinedu Eze and\n\nDike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nAs global outrage continues to trail recent travel ban placed on Nigeria and some other African countries by the United Kingdom (UK), a development which has been described as racist and discriminatory, Nigeria\u2019s federal government yesterday officially condemned the decision of the UK to put the country on its red list and place a ban on foreign travels following its detection of Omicron variant.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who addressed journalists in Abuja, described the decision of the UK government targeting Nigerian travellers as discriminatory, unfair, punitive, indefensible and unjust.\n\nThe Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, also joined to strongly condemn what he termed \u201ctravel apartheid\u201d being meted on some developing countries, mostly in Africa as part of their strategy to curtail the spread of Omicron variant.\n\nThis is just as Nigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to the UK, Sarafa Tunji Isola, who was on a media round in UK yesterday, aligned with the position of the Guterres in describing the action by the UK government as \u201ctravel apartheid.\u201d\n\nIsola said what was expected on the matter was a global approach to halt the spread of the disease and not selective punishment.\n\nSpeaking further, the minister also questioned the decision of the UK government, saying it was not driven by science.\n\nThe UK has now joined other countries, including Canada, which have taken a similar action against Nigeria over Omicron.\n\n\u201cHow do you slam this kind of discriminatory action on a country of 200 million people, just because of less than two dozen cases? Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned.\n\n\u201cThe two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travellers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive,\u201d Mohammed fumed.\n\nHe also raised eyebrows against the UK government action, insisting Omicron did not originate in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLet me say straight away that it\u2019s up to the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) to respond to this action by the British government and others, and I have no doubt that the Committee will respond appropriately.\n\n\u201cHowever, as the spokesman for the federal government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by the British government to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the British took a decision that was prompted by reflex responses instead of science and taking a serious look at the issue of access to vaccines, \u201cas well as ensure that it is based on the principles grounded in the right of every human to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political belief, economic or any other social condition.\u201d\n\nThe minister noted that such knee-jack reaction of placing a travel ban on Nigeria would be detrimental to the country\u2019s quest to conclusively tackle the pandemic.\n\nThe minister added: \u201cMany developed countries have used the advantage of their enormous resources or relationship to sign agreements with manufacturers to supply their countries with vaccines ahead of making them available for use by other countries.\n\n\u201cEven before the clinical trials were completed, millions of doses of the most promising vaccines have been bought by Britain, US, Japan and the EU. Some of these countries bought doses five times the size of their population, while others, mostly in Africa, have little or no access to vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis is the real issue to address, instead of choosing the easy path of travel bans, which the UN Secretary General called \u2018Travel Apartheid.\u2019 Let the world know that no one is safe until everyone is safe\u201d\n\nHe stressed that in the wake of the discovery of Omicron, the PSC, unlike the UK adopted science-driven actions, rather than those based on emotions and other extraneous reasons.\n\nAccording to him, PSC reviewed its International Travel Protocol, which took effect on Sunday, December 5, 2021, aimed at further reducing the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19, especially the variants of concern.\n\nUnder the revised protocol, passengers arriving in Nigeria are expected to provide evidence of and comply with rules including COVID-19 PCR test to be done within 48 hours before departure, post-arrival Day 2 COVID-19 PCR test, self-isolation for seven days (for unvaccinated and partially-vaccinated individuals) and day 7 post-arrival exit PCR test (for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals) among others.\n\n\u201cIf any country is not satisfied with them, why not simply subject Nigerians arriving in their country to their own PCR tests and proven conditions, like quarantine, instead of banning them out rightly?\u201d he wondered.\n\nMuhammed expressed hope that the British government would review the decision to ban Nigeria and rescind its decision immediately, saying Nigeria should not be on the red list as it had handled the COVID-19 pandemic with utmost responsibility and based on science, and has rightly earned global accolades for its efforts.\n\nUN Secretary General Rejects \u2018Travel Apartheid\u2019\n\nSpeaking in an interview, Guterres insisted that targeting the most vulnerable nations with travel ban for revealing the existence of the virus that was already present in Europe was unacceptable in a world that has the instruments to ensure safe travel.\n\nGuterres said travel apartheid must be condemned, saying it was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe have the instruments to have safe travels, let us use those instruments to avoid this kind of\u2026 allow me to say, travel apartheid, which I think is unacceptable. What is unacceptable is to have one part of the world that is one of the most vulnerable parts of the world economy condemned to a lockout when they were the ones that revealed the existence of a new variant that, by the way already existed in other parts of the world, including in Europe as we know.\n\n\u201cSo this is a very strong appeal that I launch, an appeal to commonsense that with a virus that is truly borderless travel restrictions that isolate anyone or country or region are not only deeply unfair and punitive they are ineffective.\u201d\n\nIn a move that many have described as rushed, ill-advised and lacking scientific basis added Nigeria to its red list, which contains 11 mostly Southern African countries becomes effective from today.\n\nIn addition, on Monday, the UK government, took further measures against Nigeria as the British High Commission announced that it would pause \u201cmaking decisions\u201d on visitor visa applications from all red list countries, including Nigeria.\n\nLatest figures from the UK government on its website revealed that 21 cases of omicron reported in England were linked to travel from Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s High Commissioner to UK kicks against Restriction\n\nOn his part, Isola, in an interview with BBC, described the travel ban as an apartheid in the sense that, \u201cwe are not dealing with an endemic. We are dealing with a pandemic. Whenever we have a challenge there must be collaboration.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigeria\u2019s Minister of Health did come out with a statement yesterday saying between November 22nd and 28th, 67 passengers that tested positive were discovered in Nigeria and many of them happened to be travellers from the UK. But that would not be a basis for Nigeria taking such action against UK.\n\n\u201cThe message is very clear. If there was a mistake, it takes courage of leadership to admit it was an error and not a sign of weakness.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the cases of omicron discovered in Nigeria were from in-bound travelers.\n\nAccording to him, a lot of persons would be greatly affected by the action of the UK government, saying, \u201ca lot of people have gone home \u2013 doctors, nurses \u2013 who are working in the UK and providing health services to NHIS and you can imagine the effect, even on Britain. In addition, we are talking of the anger of 200 million people. This decision is going to hamper our relationship with UK, which is why I am not happy about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs at today, this variant is classified as a mild one and there has not been any hospitalisation nor death, scientist still working on it. This is quite different from the Delta variant and decision must be based on scientific and empirical evidence.\n\n\u201cWe must have the facts that the variant we are talking about is dangerous. And that is why we need collaboration all over the world to ascertain the nature of the variant,\u201d he added.\n\nThe UK, at the weekend, had updated its so called Red List, indicating countries prohibited from entering the UK in view of the new COVID-19 variant called \u201comicron\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking with Arise News Channel yesterday, Ishola revealed that Nigeria would this week begin high level discussions with UK, in its efforts to seek a quick and amicable resolution to the restriction of Nigerians from visiting the country.\n\nHe said this week, Nigeria would begin talks with the British government, but quickly added that he was not willing to pre-empt what the country would do if its request to be delisted from the list was ignored.\n\nHe opined that under normal circumstances, the world should have saluted the efforts of the South African Medical Association for alerting everyone to the Omicron variant and rally round to solve the problem rather than the discriminatory action.\n\nThe high commissioner maintained South Africa had confirmed that the variant does not involve any hospitalisation or death, stressing that the issue of slamming bans on account of a \u201cmild variant\u201d was not the right thing to do.\n\nWhile stating that the coronavirus did not originate from Africa, he noted that the leaders of the continent were doing everything to ensure that the vaccines come to Africa but that what comes to Africa has been very limited.\n\nAccording to the envoy, Nigeria has handled the COVID-19 pandemic excellently and should be commended , reason the travel restrictions this time is causing an outrage.\n\nWhile insisting that the UK\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t backed by scientific evidence, he said: \u201cSo, this is not acceptable. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making it very clear. There is no scientific evidence as of today that shows that this variant is deadlier.\u201d\n\nHe narrated that Nigerians were already reacting to the travel ban in their different ways, recalling that on a on a Virgin Atlantic flight from Lagos earlier in the day, only 24 people were on board which was a form of subtle protest because an average Nigerian does not believe that the country deserves the shabby treatment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure many of them will not subject themselves to such (conditions). The travel ban came Saturday night. Today is the first working day and I can assure you that before the end of the week, we will engage with the host authorities,\u201d he assured.\n\nHe mentioned that with a relationship that dates back more than a century, both countries be deepening their ties rather than taking actions that will taint the relationship.\n\n\u201cThe ties between Nigeria and Britain date back to more than one century. This relationship is not where it should be. And we\u2019re just making efforts to deepen the relationship before this ban came up.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to think that there won\u2019t be a reconsideration of the decision. We\u2019ll have to dialogue at the end of the day to have a compromise on this issue,\u201d the envoy added.\n\nStating that the matter has its economic and political dimensions, he expressed that hope that the British government will reverse the decision as it does not make much sense to ban a country with three cases where\u2019s those with tens of cases were not listed.\n\nStakeholders, Travellers Condemn UK\u2019s Decision to Put Nigeria on Red list\n\nIn a related development, aviation industry stakeholders and air travellers have condemned the decision of UK to put Nigeria on its redlist.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday, the Chief Operating Officer of Dana Air, Mr. Obi Mbanuzuo, described the decision of UK as a knee-jerk reaction, saying the UK was aware that the omicron was already in Europe even before South Africa announced it to the world, but failed to take action.\n\n\u201cThis is a knee jerk reaction which will be soon reversed once they realise that Omicron is already deeply embedded in UK. They can\u2019t keep omicron put by banning Nigerians. What of the Netherlands where we now know had omicron even before the South Africans announced it?\u201d Mbanuzuo said.\n\nAlso, the Managing Director of Flight and Logistics Solutions Limited, Mr. Amos Akpan, said the UK government\u2019s decision was not backed by scientific data.\n\n\u201cThe data in public domain shows higher number of infected persons found in UK, while the official data says only three cases found in Nigeria. The Omicron variant existed in Spain and a few European countries before a South African scientist pronounced its existence.\n\n\u201cThe strict restrictions on Nigerians and other Africans are scientifically unjustified. Therefore, we are left to view it as a kneejerk political reaction. If they stop Nigerians from entry into UK, will they also stop Spanish, Germans, Italians, and Indonesians, who have higher number of infections of the Omicron variant?\n\n\u201cPlaying politics with medical science to this extent smacks of apartheid and racism and will not stop further mutation and spread of the virus. The season for this kneejerk reaction is bad for air travel and tourism business for UK, and for Nigeria. British Airways, Virgin Atlantic Airways will feel the impact,\u201d Akpan added.\n\nIn his contribution, the President of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA), Mrs. Susan Akporiaye condemned the decision of the UK to put Nigeria in the red list and said it was totally uncalled for.\n\nShe disclosed that a lot of Nigerians and students in the UK who wanted to come to Nigeria have since cancelled their travel plans, regretting that the action taken by the UK could discourage vaccination.\n\n\u201cThe decision taken by the UK by putting Nigeria on the red list is affecting our business. Many people have cancelled their flights. You know, the UK is second home to many Nigerians. A lot of people are cancelling their travel plans because they know if they come to Nigeria they will be made to pay over 2000 pounds and they said they would only review this by December 20, 2021.\n\n\u201cThey will review it but it is totally uncalled for. That action will discourage vaccination. After all, Delta variant of COVID-19 appeared in the UK in February this year but there was no overreaction like this. This is making people not to go for the vaccine. It is unlike the US, which is saying that it is only fully vaccinated people that can come,\u201d she said.\n\nTravel expert and the organiser of Akwaaba African Travel Market, Ikechi Ukoh told THISDAY that it was disappointing that the UK could put Nigeria on the red list as the two countries have very close relationship and there is nothing Nigeria has done that the UK was not involved.\n\nSpeaking in similar vein, industry consultant and the CEO of Belujane Konsult, Chris Aligbe said that as a country, the UK took the decision to protect its citizens, even though he pointed out that such a decision was hasty.\n\nHowever, the Regional Airport Manager, South West in charge of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Terminal, Lagos, Mrs. Victoria Shin-Aba, told THISDAY that the UK carriers, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic operated their flights from Lagos on Monday but the only difference was that BA had shifted its flights from night to morning.\n\nShe said that there was no indication yet that other international carriers have received any directive from their host countries, adding that airlines like Lufthansa, Air France and others operated their normal flights from Lagos.\n\nThe Secretary General of Aviation Round Table, a think-tank group in the industry, Group Captain John Ojikutu (retd), told THISDAY that considering the long, good relations Nigeria has with the UK, putting Nigeria on red list was condemnable.\n\nHe said that diplomatic relations was guided by the principle of reciprocity, noting that Nigeria could ban UK nationals but not British Carriers, as UK did not ban Nigerian carriers, but Nigerian citizens.\n\nOjikutu added: \u201cWhat economic sense would it make for BA to be coming to Nigeria under its COVID-19 rules when 90 per cent of its inbound and outbound passengers are Nigerians?\u201d\n\nNARD: Omicron Not as Deadly to Warrant Flight Restrictions\n\nHowever, the National Association Resident Doctors (NARD) has said studies were yet to be concluded on the virulent nature of the Omicron variant, saying based on what is known currently, the virus strain was yet to claim many lives to warrant rush to impose travel ban.\n\nNARD also urged the federal government to take proper measures to protect Nigerians and check further spread of Omicron variant as well as any other infectious diseases.\n\nSpeaking in a telephone interview with THISDAY, the President of NARD, Dr. Dare Godiya Ishaya said there was no need for panic.\n\nWhen asked if the Omicron variant was not a serious health threat to humanity, Ishaya said: \u201cWell, from a scientific point of view, it\u2019s difficult to say because this variant of COVID-19 is only being studied and we don\u2019t know for sure, how virulent it is. However, with what is known, the variant hasn\u2019t claimed any lives yet, it may be a milder form than the existing variants hence these bans may be a storm in a teacup.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, countries have the responsibility of protecting their people and if the UK authorities feel this ban will help their people, we can\u2019t question that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s left for us also to take measures that will protect Nigerians from COVID-19 and other diseases.\u201d\n\nCACOVID Urges Nigerians to Get Vaccinated\n\nThe Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) also appealed to Nigerians not to let their guard down in the fight against the virulent virus.\n\nCACOVID which is a coalition of private sector operators, mostly financial institutions and the Central Bank of Nigeria, urged Nigerians to ensure they make themselves available to take the vaccines and also adhere to all COVID-19 protocols.\n\n\u201cThe organisation also appealed to those who are yet to take their second dose of the vaccine to do so in order to be fully immunised against the virus.\n\n\u201cCACOVID continues to support the NCDC in its cause to eradicate COVID-19 in all spheres of the country through the dissemination of helpful communication materials that\u2019ll sensitise Nigerians against the virus as well as provision of equipment crucial to the fight. Support the cause, do your part, get vaccinated today,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the group, just when it seemed like a semblance of normalcy was returning to the world after a grueling battle with COVID-19, yet another variant of the virus simply known as Omicron reared its head.\n\n\u201cThe variant which was first identified by scientists in South Africa on November 24, 2021, has been labelled a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d (VOC) by the World Health Organisation. While further epidemiological studies are currently underway to better understand the virus, current findings have revealed that Omicron has several mutations that may greatly impact its spread and the severity of illness it causes.\n\n\u201cThe strain has been detected in at least 20 countries, including Belgium, Hong Kong, Israel, Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom and very recently,\n\n\u201cNigeria as reported by the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC). In its report, the organisation elaborated that the cases were recent arrivals in the country with a history of travel to South Africa in the past week. It stated that follow up to ensure isolation, linkage to clinical care, contact tracing and other relevant response activities have commenced.\n\n\u201cSince the news of the outbreak, many countries, Nigeria inclusive, have reacted swiftly by placing a raft of travel restrictions and protocols. For all inbound travellers to Nigeria, it is mandatory to present a negative COVID-19 test result done not more than 48 hours before departure,\u201d it added.\n\nBiden\u2019s Medical Adviser Urges Nigerians to Take Booster Jabs\n\nThis is just as yesterday, the Chief Medical Adviser to United States President, Dr. Anthony Facci, who in a virtual presentation addressed stakeholders at the National COVID-19 Summit held at the National Intelligence Agency, Abuja, canvassed for the use of booster doses in Nigeria to provide extra layer of protection against COVID-19.\n\nContinuing, Facci, who is the Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US, said statistics showed that 95 -96 per cent of vaccinated people, who received boosters got better than those not boosted.\n\nHe called on the US to partner with Nigeria to ensure that more people are vaccinated as much as possible.\n\nFacci, who said it was a great honour to address the National COVID-19 Summit, decried the low number of persons who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in Nigeria compared with that of the US.\n\nAccording to him while the percentage of fully and partially vaccinated persons in the US was 69 per cent, the percentage of fully and partially vaccinated persons in Nigeria was still as low as 2.9 per cent.\n\nThe US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard also underlined the strength of the partnership between the United States and Nigeria in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nWhile urging Nigerians to take COVID-19 vaccines, she said the US government has contributed more than $130 million towards fighting the pandemic in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking at the summit, the Chairman Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, Mr. Boss Mustapha said the pandemic had become the most significant public health emergency in the world with the WHO estimates putting the number of fatalities at about five million.\n\nHe put the number medical personnel trained on infection, prevention and control at 40,000, while the total number of samples tested to date was 3,580,510 of which 214,662 persons were confirmed cases.\n\nMustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation said 2,980 deaths attributed to COVID-19 were recorded in Nigeria.\n\nHe said Nigeria had experienced the third wave while a fourth wave was unfolding with the Omicron variant.\n\nHe said with the best of efforts, the country, had so far been able to access 12 million doses of vaccines going into the third phase of the vaccines roll out while more is expected to be available by the end of February 2022.\n\nCurrently, according to him, 3,775,500, or 3.4 per cent of target population was fully vaccinated with second dose while 7,080,878, or 6.3 per cent of targeted eligible population had been partially vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the omicron variant of concern highlights how fragile and vulnerable we are globally. It is therefore important that we maintain pressure on the COVID-19 virus until we deny it the opportunity to continue to circulate and mutate.\n\n\u201cOur overall focus will be to scale up vaccination of our population to reach targets set by the WHO. Nigeria needs to continue to implement public health and social measures in place combined with effective vaccination now that we are getting the vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, lamented that with the emergence of Omicron, Nigeria, like some other countries have become targets of restrictive measures.\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan has lashed the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire; the Minister of State for Health, Dr. Olorunimbe Mamora, and the Permanent Secretary, Mahmuda Mamman, for not attending the summit.\n\nLawan, who declared open the summit, said the two ministers and the Permanent Secretary ought to be physically present at the summit to garner all the sources that will come out of the event.\n\nHe said their presence was vital as the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, was an interventionist outfit.\n\nEven though Ehanire was briefly sighted at the summit, Lawan insisted another senior official should have replaced him to demonstrate the seriousness of the event.\n\n\u201cBefore I begin my remarks, is the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Health here? Well, I asked that question because the two ministers of health are not here. The Minister of Health, the Minister of State and the permanent secretary are not here. I believe this is not good.\n\nBecause everything we do here, the federal Ministry of Health is supposed to be here to garner all the resources that will come out of this. The PSC is simply an interventionist outfit. And as politicians and political leaders, we are supposed to be very serious and committed about the health of our people,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nHe assured that whatever is needed to fight COVID-19 will be provided in the 2022 budget that will be passed by the Senate.\n\nThe Senate President called for a continuous multisectoral approach that integrates multiple work plan and collaboration to establish a sustainable bio security framework for the country, noting that recent experience has also shown that outbreak of diseases affects not only the health sector but also the social \u2013 economic sector of the nation.\n\nAlso, a professor of virology, Oyewale Tomori, in a paper titled: \u201cGlobal Health Security Threat: Repositioning to End the Pandemic and Build Back Better,\u201d cited corruption, lack of patriotism, self-interest and shameless as the main destroyer of the country.\n\n\u201cOver the last 60 years, these diseases, all affecting our culture, have become the combined endemic demolisher of the foundation of our individual health security which has shaken the foundation of our national health security and in turn determined our irrelevance as a nation in contributing meaningfully to global health security.\n\n\u201cToday, we lie to each other. The government lies to us, and we reciprocate with bigger lies, telling the government it is doing well, when we know it is not. We clap with the loudest ovation for a non- performing leader. We acclaim in pretended joyous ecstasy, those we should not, even when we know they are not telling the truth. We pray that our king lives forever, and he says amen, when we both know we shall all die,\u201d Tomori added.\n\nThe virologist also said he was disappointed to learn that there was Omicron in Nigeria from outside, based on the report issued by Canadian authorities.\n\nHe said: \u201cI woke up today to hear the Canada no longer recognises my genuine vaccination card. And Britain has clamped a travel ban on us. A few days ago, I had to know there was Omicron in Nigeria from outside.\n\n\u201cThe same Canada was telling me that Nigerians who travelled out with negative COVID lab result were Omicronised, before my own CDC finally tells me that we had the variant, detected in samples collected from people recently travelled from South Africa\u2026.were they people on the entourage of President Ramaphosa. They did not tell.\n\n\u201cWe painfully call the reactions of the UK and Canada, racism, inequity. But I say we are paying for condoning our errors of commission and overlooking our errors of omission,\u201d he argued.\n\nRegarding the production of vaccines locally, the one-time President of Nigeria Academy of Sciences (NAS) said the current generation of Nigerians are much smarter than the older generation, adding that if given the enabling opportunity and environment Nigeria will be donating vaccines to poor countries.\n\n\u201cThe first epidemic we must address is the one affecting our culture. We must have a nation where national interest buries self-interest. Otherwise, this summit will become a mirage and a vapour, it will be burnt to ashes by the fire of evil that plagues us. Unless we build back better on our culture, the outcome of the summit will descend into the valley of the disregarded and disremembered, and become another expensive exercise in futility,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Omoigui-Okauru harps on need to reduce physical cash transactions\n\n\u2022FG\u2019s governance app 90% ready, says Agba\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, yesterday said the agency would henceforth ensure that all government revenues are included in the accounting for taxes generated and amounts invested by taxpayers in road infrastructure as a result of Executive Order 007 and tax waivers granted pioneer companies.\n\nHe also said import and exercise duties waived through the operations of the Nigeria Customs Service and all other revenues generated by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) on behalf of the federal, state and local governments in the country would also be taken into consideration.\n\nNami, said the measures, when implemented would align the country with global best practice in reporting public finance and reflect a more transparent and accurate picture of the country\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio which is currently at six per cent.\n\nThis was just as a former FIRS Executive Chairman, Mrs. Ifueko Omoigui-Okauru, lamented that physical cash constituted the bulk of transactions in the country, calling on the government to further deepen electronic transactions for the sake of transparency in fiscal operations.\n\nAlso, Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba, said the current administration accords great premium on citizens\u2019 participation in governance, tracking service delivery and development in their communities.\n\nTo this end, Agba pointed out that in order to ensure transparency and accountability in the delivery of government\u2019s capital projects countrywide, the budget and national planning arm of the ministry was working on a Web App \u2013called the Eye Mark, to assist citizens to report on government\u2019s projects and programmes earmarked for their communities using their mobile phones and in real time.\n\nThey all spoke at the opening of the national symposium on, \u201cTaxation and Challenges of External Shocks: Lessons and Policy Options for Nigeria,\u201d as well as formal launch of the FIRS Contact Center in Abuja.\n\nThe FIRS boss explained that for the country to achieve meaningful and sustainable growth in tax revenue, and minimise dependence on oil revenue, there was the need for continuous reform of the country\u2019s operations and processes and human capital development, adoption of technology as well as the tax laws.\n\nNami also said Nigeria\u2019s low tax-to-GDP ratio constituted one of the recurring issues in national discourse, adding that though the country needed to continually and conscientiously put measures in place to improve such concern, it also required to comprehensively bring all the national and sub-national revenue sources into consideration to properly and appropriately determine the correct and meaningful tax-to-GDP ratio for the country. He pointed out that the current basis for tax to GDP computation, which mostly focuses on the taxes administered at the federal level and leaving out other sources of revenue being generated by the federal, states and local governments and their MDAs, does not truly reflect its correct standing.\n\nHe said reforms remained crucial to the current Board and Management of FIRS, adding that the, \u201cachievements we have recorded in improving and sustaining the revenue growth since 2020 to date irrespective of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic can be attributed to these reform initiatives.\u201d\n\nHe stressed the need to strengthen collaboration among the tiers of government to enhance the certainty of the tax system and engender taxpayer confidence and compliance, stressing that the service would continue to provide leadership to the states through the Joint Tax Board (JTB) to re-position tax administration in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking further, the FIRS boss said as a key stakeholder in the symposium, the agency would consider the ideas and strategies recommended at and incorporate them in its corporate plan from 2022 and beyond.\n\nAccording to him, the essence of the symposium cannot be over-emphasised given the challenges being experienced globally due to the pandemic, expressing concern that the mutations and vaccine resistant variants being discovered every often in some countries, further indicated there is no respite yet as social and economic variables are still unpredictable.\n\nHe said the thematic areas for the symposium were carefully chosen to evaluate the reform options in tax administration and the lessons tax administrators could learn from other success stories as well as review the challenges of the informal sector which constitutes about 70 per cent of businesses in the country.\n\nThe symposium, organised in collaboration with the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto (UDUS), also sought to assess the reform options available to bring the SMEs into the tax net.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnother area of consideration will be policy options to get the private sector involved in the critical infrastructure development in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the launch of the contact centre demonstrated the FIRS commitment to not only hold talks on policy options in enhancing tax administration but also putting in place structures to actualise one of its key policy thrusts, which is to build a customer-centric FIRS through effective and efficient taxpayer service.\n\nHe explained that the centre was designed to help in bridging the communication gap between the taxpayers and the service and provide real-time platform for response to issues and resolution of challenges and concerns that may be raised by the resident and non-resident taxpayers without physically visiting our offices.\n\nAgba, at the symposium, said the current administration accords great premium on citizens\u2019 participation in governance, tracking service delivery and development in their communities.\n\nHe said in order to ensure transparency and accountability in the delivery of government\u2019s capital projects countrywide, the budget and national planning arm of the ministry was working on a Web App \u2013called the Eye Mark, to assist citizens to report on government\u2019s projects and programmes earmarked for their communities using their mobile phones and in real time.\n\nHe said the application would soon be launched as it is about 90 per cent developed, stating that the government required the active participation in the process of tying budget provisions to projects and getting time value of money earmarked for capital projects as governance remained a collective responsibility by all citizens.\n\nAgba, said the ministry would continue to support the FIRS and provide the enabling environment and policy direction to strengthen its operations.\n\nThe minister said taxation remained the surest and most sustainable source of government revenue and a potent tool for economic growth adding that that the federal government had continued to review its tax policy to bring it in line with current realities.\n\nHe said the fiscal initiatives in the annual Finance Act, prioritize non-oil sectors such as primary agriculture production, shipping and air transport, as well as financial and insurance services and grants tax breaks for MSMEs as well as enshrines fiscal discipline in Government Owned Enterprises (GOE) by limiting their cost- to-revenue ratio to a maximum of 50 per cent.\n\nAgba, further pointed out that due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of oil prices in the international market, the government had continually placed a premium on the growth of the non-oil sector in the diversification of revenue sources.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am glad to note that the FIRS non-oil tax collections for 2020 and the collections so far for 2021 is higher than the tax from oil. This can be attributed to the various reform programmes and digitization projects being undertaken by the Service to improve its operations. More is needed considering that we need to harness all sources in closing the budget deficit and reducing government borrowing.\u201d\n\nThe minister, therefore, urged the FIRS to be consistent and focused in ensuring that current reforms are sustained.\n\nOmoigui-Okauru, who was the guest speaker at the symposium, said cutting down on physical cash transaction would help track financial transactions for the purposes for effective taxation in the country.\n\nShe further stressed the need for the country to strengthen its fiscal buffers by building a resilient economy to withstand and overcome external vulnerabilities.\n\nShe said as long as public health challenges persist, external shocks had become inevitable, and called for adequate preparations on the part of government to contain it whenever it occurs.\n\nOmoigui-Okauru, stressed the need to diversify the revenue base and build a resilient system, pointing out that the states could not afford to continue to depend on federal allocations for survival, stressing that dialogue was required in addressing the question over who collects tax revenues.\n\nAmong other things, she noted that the increasing insecurity and manpower gaps had limited tax yields in recent times adding that the development of a robust economy should be accorded every sense of urgency it requires.\n\nThe former FIRS boss, also called for integrated tax system and real stakeholder engagement as well as home-grown solutions to enhancing domestic non-oil revenue collections.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria better off together\n\nSylvester Idowu in Warri\n\nA former Minister of Information and Culture, Professor Jerry Gana, has described the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to implement the 2014 National Conference report \u201cas a terrible mistake\u201d.\n\nGana, who said the non-implementation of the confab report was largely responsible for some of the growing agitations and disunity across the country, however, said Nigerians were better off together as a people and country.\n\nGana, who spoke on Sunday in Uvwiamuge, Agbarho, Delta State, during the thanksgiving service to conclude activities marking the 90th anniversary of the Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) Worldwide, said there would hardly be peace in the absence of justice and fairness in any society.\n\nThe elder statesman, however, maintained that, he did not share sentiments of persons, who were clamouring for the balkanisation of the country, saying he believed strongly in a united Nigeria, where justice and fairness were served to everyone irrespective of political or religious inclinations.\n\n\u201cWe, in the middlebelt of Nigeria, are great lovers of peace, justice and fairness. The last administration convened a national conference in 2014 and we agreed on some certain fundamentals to ensure justice and fairness. Unfortunately, when this government came in, they made a terrible mistake. They never touched that report and that is the problem.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are now saying we should start that conversation. We should talk to one another and assure one another of justice and fairness, because without equity, there can\u2019t be peace. Without equity, we cannot be together. Let me appeal to the federal government to promote peace, equity and justice. Let me also appeal to those people, who are agitating that there\u2019s tremendous power in being united. Let\u2019s not fight to scatter and divide Nigeria. We are better being together,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe congratulated the Urhobo Nation on the 90th anniversary of UPU, stressing that Urhobo people had played prominent roles in stabilising and promoting the unity of Nigeria.\n\nThe former minister, had at an earlier engagement, said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would be swept out of office in 2023, because it had committed a lot of injustices against humanity, adding that Nigerians were fed up with their leaders.\n\nGana said this at the weekend in Effurun, near Warri, Delta State, while delivering a lecture titled: \u201cRaising 21st Century Leaders for Nigeria\u201d at Youth Arise Conference 2021.\n\nThe Youth Arise Nigeria Conference with large turnout in attendance from within and Outside Delta was put together by Advocates of Paradigm Shift in Governance.\n\nThey included Deacon Chris Iyowaye, Hon. Gibson Akporehe, Phillip Adu-Odogwu, Cogent Owhe and Lady E Ejiro Umukoro with the goal of raising the civic and political consciousness of youths in how they engage governance, get their PVC as a civic duty while volunteering and investing their time in being useful citizens rather than be purchaseable electorate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He is not a criminal while doing his profession, it is not a crime especially in a democratic system of governance. No one should intimidate a journalist by applying excessive power or any other means,\u201d an activist, Comrade Yahaya M. Abdullahi wrote.\n\n\u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph, and the signs of horror are still in the air, according to Henry Anatole Grunwald.\n\n\u201cWalter Lippmann said, there can be no higher law in journalism than, to tell the truth, and to shame the devil.\n\n\u201cTan Hongkai also opined that; I think journalism anywhere should be based on social justice and impartiality, making contributions to society as well as taking responsibility in society. Whether you are capitalist or socialist or Marxist, journalists should have the same professional integrity.\n\n\u201cNo Matter your status you can't silence a journalist. #freeelzaharadeenumar.\u201d\n\nKatsina State has a history of Illegally arresting and intimidating journalists.\n\nFor instance, the police on September 19, 2016, Illegally arrested Jamil Mabai \u2014 the publisher of Cliqq Magazine and a columnist with Katsina Reporters.\n\nMabai had on September 6 taken to social media to criticise the state governor, Aminu Masari, for Distributing 3,000 coffins to mosques civil servants were being owed salaries.\n\nMabai was granted bail after 22 days of illegal detention.\n\nAlso in July 2017, another journalist in the state, Danjuma Katsina, was Illegally arrested and detained for allegedly making \u201cinjurious comments\u201d about a newly elected member of the House of Representatives from the state, Mansur Mashi.\n\nKatsina had posted a comment on Facebook in which he analysed the outcome of the Mashi/Dutsi bye-election earlier conducted, questioning why Mashi was allowed to contest in the election despite having a court case regarding alleged corruption.",

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Earnipay is improving financial well-being for salaried employees",
          "text": "In Nigeria, wages for formal-sector employees are paid monthly; in the informal sector, however, this is paid daily. Now, when salaried employees go broke between paydays, they have three options: borrow, take a loan, or request a salary advance. But loans, most times, come with exploitative interest rates and salary advance schemes could plunge an employee deeper into debt.\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution, founded by Nonso Onwuzulike, allows employees flexible access to their accrued salaries on any day of the month.\n\nRevising the payday cycle\n\nIn 2019, Onwuzulike started a recycling company in Accra, Ghana, to reduce plastic waste and enable plastic recycling in the capital city. While running the business, he hired waste collectors and placed them on a monthly payment schedule. However, these employees\u2014all of them coming from informal-sector backgrounds\u2014were unhappy about this. They were used to being paid after a job was completed, or at the end of the workday. The monthly payment cycle left them cash-strapped and unable to match their daily expenses to their income. Consequently, once salaries were paid at the end of the month, many of the workers quit the company in search of other employment.\n\nEager to stem the high attrition rate among the waste collection staff, the company switched from a monthly payment schedule to a flexible one, allowing the workers to be paid more frequently\u2014weekly or bi-weekly. The change increased their productivity and fewer workers jumped ship.\n\nIt was a light-bulb moment for Onwuzulike. He went on to survey 100 formal employees within his network to find out how often they ran out of cash before payday and what their employers did to alleviate their financial difficulties.\n\nOnwuzulike\u2019s original intention for Earnipay was to build a salary advance solution\u2014in keeping with similar solutions already in existence in Nigeria, some of them powered by traditional banks. But plans changed when the results of the 100-person survey showed that 90% of salaried employees would rather have flexible access to their accrued salaries.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t need payday loans or salary advances to fund their lives; they just wish to be paid more frequently,\u201d Onwuzulike said on a call with TechCabal.\n\nEarnipay is currently in beta, with Onwuzulike serving as CEO, Busayo Oyetunji COO, and Joshua Ajayi CTO. As Onwuzulike tells TechCabal, all three of them consider themselves co-builders of the product.\n\n\u201cWorks like an ATM\u201d\n\nEarnipay is unavailable to individual employees, so employers need to sign up and onboard their staff. The Earnipay app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month. Earnipay funds the withdrawal.\n\nFor example, if one dips into their salary on the ninth day of the month, it means they\u2019re entitled to half the amount they\u2019ve earned for working nine days. At the end of the month, their employer deducts from their salary the amount withdrawn, uses it to refund Earnipay for initially funding that withdrawal, then pays the employee the balance as their salary for the month.\n\nTransaction-fee tiers are attached to withdrawals. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 attracts a fee of \u20a6500, and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 attracts a \u20a61,000 fee.\n\n\u201cIt works just like an ATM,\u201d Oyetunji said.\n\nIntersecting the formal and informal workforce\n\nThe informal sector makes up about 80.8% of the workforce in urban Africa. In Nigeria where Earnipay operates out of, the sector makes up over 70% of the workforce.\n\nWhen Earnipay piloted three months ago, Onwuzulike envisaged that the solution would be useful only for low-income staff and informal employees, but the income profile of the app\u2019s users vary, Onwuzulike claims. \u201cOne of our customers earns a million naira a month,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, 17 companies have signed onto the app as active users and their employees have used Earnipay over 400 times.\n\nNo doubt, there are upsides to shorter payment cycles. For example, an employee can see their salary breakdown from day to day on the app, and unlike a loan or salary advance, which are borrowed funds, an Earnipay withdrawal is earned wages.\n\nStill, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up here as well. For instance, an earner who is unable to manage their personal finances may end up dipping into their salary before payday for the most frivolous reasons, and even after receiving their salary balance at month end, may still struggle to control their spending.\n\nResponding to these concerns, Oyetunji said, \u201cThe main issue here is, we\u2019re not financially educated. Whether you get your money at the end of the month or access it [daily] as you work, if you\u2019re not financially disciplined, Earnipay may not make a difference to your spending habits.\u201d\n\nScaling up\n\nAt the height of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Africa\u2019s formal and informal economies took hits. Six percent of formal workers were out of work in Malawi, and in Nigeria, that figure climbed to as high as 45%. Now, as Africa adjusts to the reset forced on the entire world by the pandemic, financial well-being across all employment sectors has become more important than ever. \u201cWe\u2019re in a financial health pandemic,\u201d Oyetunji said. \u201cQuality of life is reduced because people can\u2019t fund their everyday needs. How can our expenses be on-demand yet access to salaries earned isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\nThe Earnipay team began building the product in July, received pre-seed funding of an undisclosed amount in August, and took their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to market in September.\n\nCommenting on Earnipay\u2019s plans for 2022, Onwuzulike said, \u201cOur goal is to partner with employers to improve employee financial well-being. We provide tools for income earners to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life. In addition to flexible salary access, we provide financial education to advise employees on best practices to manage their finances, and other products to assist them daily.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After expanding into financial services last year at the back of a $10 million investment from International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Partech, TradeDepot, a Nigerian B2B eCommerce platform, has now raised $110 million in an equity and debt Series B funding round.\n\nThe fund will support the delivery of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) services to 5 million SME retailers and drive further expansion of its merchant platform across the continent.\n\nIFC returned and led the equity round, with participation from Novastar, Sahel Capital, CDC Group, Endeavor Catalyst and existing investors, Partech and MSA Capital. The debt funding was led by Arcadia Funds.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTradeDepot started as a consulting firm in 2005 before pivoting into a product-led startup in 2016 to aid seamless milk distribution across Nigeria. Now, the platform is connecting consumer goods brands in Africa directly to a target market of several million retail outlets across the continent, and also providing micro-loans to retailers to enable them to buy more products.\n\nAccording to The World Bank, SMEs represent about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide. In Africa, SME retailers generate $1 trillion in sales annually and contribute $2.6 trillion to the continent\u2019s nominal GDP. But these numbers are only a tiny representation of the sector\u2019s true potential and can\u2019t solve the problem of fragmented distribution networks and lack of access to financing.\n\nVia its ShopTopUp platform, TradeDepot is solving these two major problems, distributing needed goods to retailers and providing them with credit that allows them to stock their inventories and then pay as they sell the goods which have a repayment value of about 5% per month.\n\nTradeDepot has grown from over 40,000 merchants on its platform last year to more than 100,000 merchants. And it says this new funding will further expedite the delivery of its two unique offerings across its operating markets\u201410 cities in Nigeria including Lagos and Abuja, Accra in Ghana, and Johannesburg in South Africa.\n\nSpeaking about the new funding, Onyekachi Izukanne, CEO and co-founder of TradeDepot, said, \u201cWe remain super focused on making digital commerce and financing both accessible and affordable to neighbourhood retailers across key cities in Africa. We are delighted to be joined by an elite group of new investors and have IFC\u2019s Wale Ayeni and Brian Odhambo of Novastar joining our Board of Directors, to support us on this journey to drive growth and prosperity across the continent.\u201d\n\nA retailer navigating the ShopTopUp app\n\nIn 2021 alone, IFC committed a record $31.5 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries, leveraging the power of technology to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity as economies grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe informal sector is a large and critical part of Africa\u2019s economy, accounting for around 80% of jobs in the region,\u201d said Makhtar Diop, IFC\u2019s Managing Director. \u201cWe are excited to work with TradeDepot to leverage technology to help small businesses across the continent, particularly the many retailers led by women, access the resources they need to grow and scale.\u201d\n\nThe digitisation of SMEs continues to make headlines in Africa this year as startups in the sector like Nigerian Alerzo, Omnibiz, and Sabi have both raised big institutional funding to capture more market share. Similarly, in Northern Africa, Egypt-based Capiter and Appetito, and Morocco-based Chari are also scaling for more market share across the continent.\n\nIt\u2019s a large market, though, and there are still millions of informal businesses that predominantly function offline. But, as for TradeDepot, it wants to capture more than 5 million SMEs as it continues to leverage and expand its BNPL offering in the 12 cities it\u2019s currently operating in.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nThe payment for the shares on PrimaryOffer is facilitated by Flutterwave.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For most of these people, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a lethal blow, making it harder to access healthcare, in addition to the stigma some already face.\n\nOur Reporter, Bolu Abiodun, xrayed tech tools that could be game-changers for persons living with disabilities in Africa for this year\u2019s celebration.\n\nYou can read here: 4 tech innovations that can make life easy for physically challenged Africans\n\nOr if you\u2019d prefer audio-visuals, you can click this link\n\nInterestingly, on Friday, December 3, the Kenyan Bankers Association launched \u2018Deaf eLimu Banking\u2019, a Kenyan sign language self-training tool developed in partnership with Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD Kenya) and software engineering firm, Deaf eLimu Plus.\n\nA timeline of recent 5G events in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s changed since September 27, 2021, and Techpoint Digest No.176? That depends on what you count as a change.\n\nWell, in that newsletter, we brought you news of Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami\u2019s prediction of a January 2022 launch of the 5G network in the country.\n\nFar behind other countries like South Africa \u2014 probably on shaky ground \u2014 and Kenya, where some citizens already enjoy the 5G network, one wonders if a January 2022 date is still feasible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the first 5G tests held by telecoms giant, MTN in 2019, we\u2019ve seen house debates on health issues, a Memorandum of Understanding involving the C-Band Spectrum, and an auction committee set up.\n\nWhat do we know currently? After the Nigeria Communications Commissions (NCC) released a Draft Information Memorandum on the Spectrum auction in October 2021, a final document was presented on November 10. A deadline for bid submissions was set for November 24, 2021.\n\nAccording to the NCC, due to an Air Traffic Controllers strike, on November 23 that disrupted flights operations in Lagos, the deadline was moved to November 29, 2021.\n\nSome traction: On December 1, 2021, the NCC announced bids from three companies, MTN Nigeria, Airtel Networks Ltd, and Mafab Communications Ltd \u2014 a recently incorporated telecoms company licenced by the Commission.\n\nThe auction is set to take place on December 13, 2021.\n\nI have several questions: Why are Nigeria\u2019s other major telcos \u2014 read Glo and 9mobile \u2014 not on the list of approved bids? Did they apply? Would this auction hold in time? Is a January 2022 date still feasible?\n\nWith MTN Nigeria\u2019s recent share sales, continuing profits recorded by telcos operating in Nigeria, and a 5G auction coming up, 2022 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the telecommunications space in the country. That proverbial fly on the wall? You can bet that\u2019s me.\n\nNigeria-based Flex Finance raises pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlex Finance team.

Ramp is a US-based unicorn that helps businesses spend less by digitising a company\u2019s expense policy, setting spending limits on cards, among other things. You can also issue a company card tied to your Ramp wallet that tracks all expenses digitally and quickly.\n\nWith an official launch in March 2021, Flex Finance currently operates an all-in-one spend management application equipped with a digital wallet to help African businesses efficiently perform trackable spending.\n\nThis pre-seed round saw participation from Gumroad CEO, Sahil Lavingia; LoftyInc Partners; Berrywood Capital; Paradox Capital; Julian Shapiro; among others.\n\nAccording to Yemi Olulana, Flex Finance CEO, \u201cThis funding received has so far helped to expand the company\u2019s manpower, scale operations and will help with the launch of our new product offerings like virtual cards.\u201d\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat else I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nFuture Africa is hiring a Finance Manager, Backend Developer and Frontend Developer.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving with disabilities means several things to different people. Faustina Urassa, Programme Officer at the Kilimanjaro Association of Spinal Cord Injury (KASI), Tanzania, sees it as an opportunity to help others who have lost their ability to walk.\n\nUrassa trains people who have suffered from spinal cord injury how to use wheelchairs. Using a wheelchair herself, she says, \u201cif you have the appropriate wheelchair that meets your needs and suits you, you\u2019ll forget about your disability.\u201d\n\nFor young South African, Gift Moloke, living with disabilities means a difficult schooling process. Moloke, who has down syndrome, was rejected by several schools his mother applied to.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), 80 million people live with disabilities in Africa. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) puts the number of people living with disabilities at 300 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the numbers might be inaccurate, the story of Urassa and young Moloke are not the only ones on the continent. While it is already difficult to live with these disabilities, society makes it even more difficult.\n\nThe UN also affirms that most Africans living with disabilities are excluded from school and work opportunities.\n\nIn 1992, the UN proclaimed December 3 as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in a bid to \u201cpromote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights, and well-being of persons living with disabilities.\u201d\n\nFrom people living with learning disabilities to stuttering and being deaf, we have explored what living is like for people with disabilities and the role of technology in making life easier.\n\nNotably, Techpoint Africa has, at different times, covered tech tools that can ease life and work for people living with specific forms of disabilities like stuttering, deafness, Dyslexia, and Dyscalculia, among other learning disabilities.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of the Disabled, we are looking at four tech innovations that could help people living with disabilities globally.\n\nTactile watches for the visually impaired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEone Switch with additional rings Source: Oracle Time\n\nHyungsoo Kim, CEO, Eone timepieces, created the Eone when he realised that all watches and clocks rely heavily on vision.\n\n\u201cCould there be a way to cater for the blind?\u201d he thought to himself. Kim and his team went to work and came up with the Eone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eone allows users to check the time simply by touching and looking at it. Think of it as a regular watch, but it has balls instead of an hour and minute hand. One on the surface indicates the minute, and another on the side that shows the hour.\n\nEone stands for Everyone. Kim believes that products and services should be inclusive, and while his invention works well for the blind, people with vision can use it.\n\nRecalling when a group of visually impaired persons was testing the Eone, Kim was asked if the watch was made specifically for the blind.\n\n\u201cI said yes and expected a positive response, but they said, \u2018that\u2019s not what we want; what we want is what everyone else also likes.\u2019\u201d\n\nReturning the sense of touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsthetic arm\n\nWhile prosthetic limbs are nothing like the natural, they can give amputees something close.\n\nDr Luke Osborne, a researcher at John Hopkins University, Baltimore, US, wants to get prosthetic limbs even close to being natural with his invention, E-dermis.\n\nThe invention could return the sense of touch to prosthetic users. The tech works with a phenomenon known as phantom limb syndrome.\n\nAccording to Osborne, it is a \u201csensation where you\u2019ve lost a limb or part of a limb, but you can still feel it. The region of the brain that represents the limb is still there and still working to some extent.\u201d\n\nOsborne wants to tap into this sensation and help people who have lost a limb feel things they\u2019ve not been able to for a while.\n\nEliminating stigma with fashionable prosthetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBionic arm Source: CNET\n\nWhile Osborne is looking to return the sense of touch to prosthetic limbs, a group of video game enthusiasts is working on making it life-like.\n\nA video game company and a company that develops bionic arms \u2014 DEUS Ex Universe and Open Bionics \u2014 came together to create prosthetics that are more than just medical devices.\n\nOpen Bionics Co-founder, Joel Gibbard says, \u201cwhat we are trying to do is change the prosthetics industry so we can offer affordable, functional, and beautiful prosthetic devices to amputees.\u201d\n\nLooking like something out of a video game, Andre Vu, Executive Brand Director of DEUS Ex Universe, says they wanted the device to be something people wore fashionably.\n\nOpen Bionics has made a semi-functional prototype of these fashionable bionic arms and hopes to perfect the useability.\n\nTranslating sign language into speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUni demo. Source: the Daily Mail\n\nUni, a device created by MotionSavvy, converts sign language into text or speech, making it possible for deaf people to communicate effectively.\n\nIn a demo by Alexandr Opalka, MotionSavvy CTO, the device read his hand and converted it into speech.\n\nUsing sensors with dual cameras, it detects the movement of joints in the hands and fingers and interprets them into speech.\n\nWhile assistive technology is great, most of them are pretty expensive and inaccessible to many people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to the UN, 200 million people globally need assistive tech for low vision and over 400 million require products that assist hearing.\n\nWhile the high price tag of these devices contributes to their inaccessibility, they are often not included in welfare schemes, making them even more expensive in high-income countries.\n\nMore attention needs to be paid to assistive tech but, more importantly, persons with disabilities.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "The Herconomy story: Instagram page to fintech raising $600k in 24 hours",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology? Did Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s story inspire you? Then, we\u2019d love to hear your story. Kindly reach out to me (emmanuel@techpoint.africa) or my colleague, Oluwanifemi (oluwanifemi@techpoint.africa).

          "text": "Equinix, a US-based global infrastructure company, is perfecting plans to acquire MainOne, one of the largest data centres in West Africa, for $320 million as it moves to become a dominant player in Africa.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to be completed in the first three months of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Funke Opeke, MainOne has a presence in three countries including Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. The acquisition marks the first step in Equinix\u2019s long-term strategy to become an African carrier neutral digital infrastructure company. Equinix is betting on Nigeria\u2019s growing population pushing demand for data centres and a spike in the number of operators.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives. CEO Funke Opeke and her team have built a powerful and dynamic infrastructure that will enable international customers access to the continent and African organizations access to the global Equinix platform. Customers can take full advantage of Equinix\u2019s leading global interconnection services to connect with customers and partners, participate in rich digital ecosystems and expand their business across Africa and around the world,\u201d Eugene Bergen, President, EMEA, Equinix, said.\n\nRead also: Nigeria gets AfDB\u2019s $600m to fund digital, creative enterprises next year- Osinbajo\n\nSince it was founded, MainOne has enabled connectivity for the business community of Nigeria and now has digital infrastructure assets including three operational data centres, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in the first quarter of 2022. The facilities generate approximately US$60 million annualized (Q2\u201921LQA) revenue with a purchase multiple of approximately 14x EBITDA.\n\nWhen the acquisition is completed, MainOne\u2019s facilities are expected to add more than 64,000 gross square feet of space to the Equinix platform with 570,000 square feet of land for future expansions.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centers across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data center and interconnection services for over 10,000 of global businesses, including more than 50 percent of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nMainOne owns and operates a subsea network from Nigeria to Portugal, as well as 1,200 kilometers of reliable terrestrial fiber network across southern Nigeria. These are all improving connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria. When completed, this acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa, giving organizations based inside and outside of Africa access to one of the world\u2019s fastest growing markets.\n\nCharles Meyers, President, and CEO, Equinix, says the MainOne deal represents a critical point of entry for Platform Equinix into the expansive and rapidly African market.\n\n\u201cGrowth of data consumption in Africa is amongst the fastest in the world, and our customers are looking for a trusted partner to pursue the opportunities presented by broad mobile adoption and greater connectivity across the region. MainOne\u2019s infrastructure, customer relationships, partner ecosystem and operating capability will extend the reach of Platform Equinix and bolster opportunities for customers in Africa and throughout the world,\u201d Meyers said.\n\nUnder the terms of the transaction, the management team, including CEO Funke Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles. Opeke holds a master\u2019s in engineering from Columbia University and was named one of the World\u2019s Top 50 Women in Tech by Forbes in 2018 for her efforts in sparking internet adoption. She was also recently named one of the Top 10 Women to Watch in the Data Center Industry by Data Centre Magazine.\n\nMainOne has nearly 500 employees and a management team. It also has an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers, including major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecommunications operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\n\u201cEquinix will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa. I thank our founding shareholders led by Mr. Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, AFC, PAIDF, FBN, Polaris and AfDB for investing in the MainOne vision to bridge the digital divide in Africa. With similar values and culture to what we have jointly built in twelve years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey. The MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition, and we look forward to building our next chapter together,\u201d said Funke Opeke, Founder and CEO, MainOne.",

          "text": "Senior Nigerian bankers say currency speculators are now beginning to bring out the foreign exchange they are hoarding to the market and selling, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, EIU.\n\nIt is seen as reversing the speculative pressure on the Naira since the Central Bank stopped the sale of foreign exchange to bureau de change operators in July but the market still has a long way to go to stabilize.\n\nIn its December 6 report, the EIU said, \u201cthe spread between the official NAFEX exchange rate and the black market widened sharply in the following months, even as foreign reserves increased through a US$3.3bn SDR allocation from the IMF in August and a US$4bn Eurobond sale in September.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cthe CBN now appears to be intervening more heavily, with a reserve drawdown of US$600m (1.5%) in the past month. A stabilising market is, according to the committee, causing speculators to sell foreign exchange that had allegedly been hoarded.\u201d\n\nRead Also: FX market opens with naira gaining 0.61% on dollar inflows\n\nThis is expected to give support to the naira although \u201cthere is still a parallel market premium of at least 30%, making illicit arbitrage an irresistible opportunity for some,\u201d the EIU report said.\n\nThe EIU said, \u201canother test to our assumption lies in how a planned end to fuel subsidies in early 2022 plays out.

However, with a new mega-refinery coming onstream in 2022, which has the potential to eliminate petrol imports, the CBN may in any case decide to hold out.\u201d\n\nEarly in July, Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank stopped selling hard currency to bureaus de change (BDC) operators. New BDC licences were also suspended. The CBN said it will instead sell foreign exchange only to commercial banks, transacted in the investors and exporters (I&E) window at the official exchange rate (the Nafex)\n\nThe CBN claims that BDCs had been engaged in rent-seeking behaviour, supplying large volumes to single clients (inviting arbitrage opportunities for resale on the parallel market), rather than distributing the foreign exchange sold to them by the CBN to retail customers in small transactions.\n\nThe order was meant to direct foreign-exchange transactions worth billions of US dollars a year to the official I&E window and marked further consolidation of the foreign-exchange market\u2014a process long advocated by the IMF",

          "text": "Two weeks to this year\u2019s Christmas and New Year celebrations, the cost of moving containers from Apapa and Tin-Can Island Ports in Lagos has remained stable, a rare case seen first in over eight years due to a decline in the volume of business at the ports, BusinessDay investigation has shown.\n\nThe Tin-Can and Apapa Ports are major economic gateway to Nigeria and account for about 80 percent of the country\u2019s total imports.\n\nAlso, the cost of moving a 40-foot container which used to be between N1, 500,000 and N1, 600,000 in 2020 has, this year, dropped by 76.7 percent and 75 percent in one year to N370, 000 and N400, 000. Similarly, transporting a 20-foot container which cost N800, 000 in 2020, has equally dropped by 56.3 percent N350, 000.\n\nCurrently, shippers pay between N370, 000 and N400, 000 to move a 40-foot container from Apapa to warehouses in Ikeja, Lagos, while a 20-foot container goes for N350, 000 depending on the weight, showing the cost of transportation has remained stable since the second half of the year when the cost dipped.\n\nFrom Tin-Can Port, shippers still pay between N350, 000 and N400, 000 to move one by 40-foot container to Ikeja, while one by 20-foot costs N350, 000.\n\nRead Also: Customs agents shut terminal at Tin-Can Port over cargo pilfering\n\nYuletide season normally comes with celebrations, including parties and other events, making it a peak season for businesses and companies. But with the prevailing decline in business activities at the ports, the rush that comes with the season is yet to be seen.\n\nJonathan Nicol, president of the Shippers Association of Lagos State, said shippers have reduced imports due to the high exchange rate of the naira to dollar, profit decline and payment of heavy taxes on imported goods.\n\nNicol, in a telephone conversation with BusinessDay, also referred to issues around global supply chain disruption that resulted in container shortage and an astronomical rise in the cost of freight.\n\n\u201cThe high exchange rate is a \u2018killer disease\u2019. Most businessmen source their foreign exchange from the black market because getting from Nigerian banks is like a camel passing through the eye of a needle. It is only companies that are regular with the banks that hardly get $100,000. If you bid for $2 million, you hardly get $200,000 for shipment, and to get $2 million would probably spread through the year for the importer to get that kind of money from the bank,\u201d Nicol explained.\n\nHe said shippers were still hoping for a further reduction in the cost of haulage especially if the government makes the roads to the ports motorable.\n\nAccording to him, the construction work is seriously giving shippers problems because goods that pass through the road are not protected due to the constant falling of laden containers caused by potholes and craters.\n\nHe wants the federal ministry of works to expedite action on the ongoing construction on the Westminster to Mile-2 axis of the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway, which is causing shippers to lose their goods in transit.\n\nTony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Links Investment Ltd, a clearing and forwarding firm in Lagos, said there was a significant reduction in haulage cost as moving a 40-foot container to Sango-Ota in Ogun State now costs about N600,000 as against N1,000,000 in 2020, while Tin-Can Port to Ladipo now costs N450,000.\n\n\u201cThere is a low volume of business at the ports due to high exchange rate, freight and escalating cases of COVID-19, all of which have limited the number of people traveling abroad for business. The reduction in the gridlock on port roads also helped in reducing the cost of freight,\u201d he added.\n\nEmma Nwabunwanne, a Lagos-based importer, said transportation has remained stable despite the yuletide due to the decline in the volume of business at the nation\u2019s seaport. He added that about 10 to 15 trucks now chase one container, which automatically means the price will drop.\n\n\u201cThe volume of import has dropped and some school of thought puts the reduction rate at 50 percent. Few containers that are coming into the country right now are for the major industries and food companies like Nestle, Dangote, Unilever, Nigerian Breweries, Guinness, and other blue-chip companies that import regularly and their imports are tied to industries,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the high cost of foreign exchange, he said industries need money to buy raw materials, and most companies that used to operate at 100 percent hardly measure up to 50 percent due to the lack of raw materials.",

It is our sincere wish to bequeath Enugu State Civil Service that is well-equipped and well-motivated for the job in hand.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to fully recover from the negative economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and have not rested on our oars in the battle for the containment of this contagion. Within the period under review, we have continued the following interventions:\n\n\u201cWith the receipt of the 1st batch of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines from the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), we flagged off COVID-19 vaccination in the state as one of the potent measures for curbing the pandemic. Vaccination is still ongoing even as we have further received a batch of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine and I urge all Enugu State residents to avail themselves this opportunity of getting fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing construction of Amenity facility in Enugu Ezike General hospital, the completed seven (7) Model Type III Primary Healthcare facilities in Nkanu East, Igbo-Etiti, Igbo-Eze South, Isi-Uzo, Udenu, Ezeagu and Uzo-Uwani LGAs when put into use will boost the delivery of healthcare services in the State.\n\n\u201cWithin the period under view, we attained significant milestones in the development of ESUT College of Medicine and Teaching Hospital, Igbo Eno.\n\n\u201cThe construction of Cottage Hospitals with Isolation Wards in Awgu, Orba, Enugu Ezike and Oji-River have been completed and these will enhance the delivery of secondary healthcare services within their environs.\n\n\u201cWe have successfully installed 100 (One Hundred) units of 200 litres Solar Refrigerators and Freezers at various Health Centres across the State\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are transposing our State Health Systems to provide primary healthcare through the Enugu State Agency for Universal Health Coverage.

          "text": "Oyo State Governor, \u2019Seyi Makinde, on Tuesday, said that his administration will continue to judiciously utilize the resources of the state for the good of its people.\n\nThe governor, who was speaking through the Head of Service, Alhaja Amidat Agboola, at the year 2021 Public Service Forum, with the topic: \u201cThe Millennial Public Service: Springboard from Poverty to Prosperity\u201d, held at the Theophilous Ogunlesi Hall, UCH, Ibadan, said that the welfare of the workers and pensioners are germane to his administration.\n\nA statement by the Chief Press to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, quoted Makinde as saying that the transformation of any society or system depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of its civil/public service.\n\nHe said: \u201cI feel highly delighted to be in your midst this morning on the occasion of the year 2021 Annual Public Service Forum. Let me join the Head of Service to welcome all Civil/Public servants to this year\u2019s event which should have held last year but for the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cAs the current head of the leadership structure in Oyo State and with the resources of the entire State in our care, we made a pledge to judiciously use these resources for the good and benefit of the entire citizenry. This we have always done and we shall continue to do. Since the inception of this administration, I can boldly say that the welfare of the workers has been germane to us and we have never desisted in exhibiting this.\n\n\u201cThe Public Service is one of the agents of development in any nation. The transformation of any society or system depends on the effectiveness and efficiency of its Civil/Public Service, particularly, the developing societies.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that despite economic situation of Nigeria, his government has been paying salaries and pensions on or before the 25th of every month, noting that regular payment of salaries, allowances and pensions have not stopped various projects embarked upon by his administration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cDespite the economic situation in the country, we have always paid salaries and pensions on or before the 25th of every month. Let me reiterate that payment of salaries to workers is not a privilege but a right, for every worker deserves to be paid after rendering services.\n\n\u201cI am glad to inform you that regular payment of salaries, allowance and pensions have not stopped various projects that we have embarked on.\n\n\u201cRecently, we inaugurated the construction of the Iseyin campus of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology with the release of a sum of Five Hundred Million (N500,000,000.00) as a take-off grant.\n\n\u201cWe have also approved the construction of 76.7kilometres Iseyin-Fapote-Ogbomoso road for a sum N43.1billion. This we believe will aid the movement of staff and students between the two campuses of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology.\n\n\u201cThis administration since inception has made education a priority as the sector has taken the highest share of the budget for the third consecutive year. This Sector was allocated the sum of N54.1b, amounting to 18.37 per cent of the year 2022 budget,\u201d Makinde said.\n\nHe explained that the allocation of 21 per cent of the year 2021 budget has yielded result, moving Oyo State from 26th position to 11th position in examinations conducted by the West African Examination Council (WAEC).\n\nHe added: \u201cCurrently there is an ongoing recruitment exercise for Officers to fill the vacant positions of Permanent Secretaries, Executive Secretaries and General Managers in the Civil/Public Service of Oyo State and we are strictly basing our selection on merit. This is one of the proofs that this administration is interested in merit and give honour to only those who deserve it \u201d\n\nEarlier, the Head of Service, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Civil Service Commission, Mr. David Olatunde, said that the Public Service Forum is organized to contribute to the development of institutional, human and technological capacities of public sector Institutions and Civil/Public Servants, to efficiently deliver public goods and services to the entire citizenry.\n\nShe explained that the best practice in the Civil/Public Service today is tending towards professionalism where all Officers are expected to improve themselves through acquisition of relevant additional academic and professional qualifications, as well as being abreast of and acquainting themselves with contemporary issues.\n\nShe appreciated Governor Makinde for his commitment towards improving the living standard of the workers and pensioners in Oyo State, urging the civil servants to reciprocate the gesture by putting in their best always.\n\nSimilarly, in her lecture, the retired Federal Permanent Secretary, Deaconess, Joan Ayo, who was the guest speaker, explained that no nation develops beyond the capacity of its public service.\n\nShe maintained that the core values of Public Service include: political neutrality. meritocracy, integrity, impartiality, patriotism, professionalism, discipline, accountability, transparency and anonymity, adding that by imbibing those values, the state\u2019s civil service would be able to lift the state from poverty to prosperity.",

          "title": "Abdulrazaq sets new record, signs 35 percent gender inclusion bill",
          "text": "Kwara on Tuesday set a new record in gender inclusion as Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq assented to an executive bill mandating the State to have at least 35% women appointees in the executive council and other classes of political appointments.\n\nThe law, cited as Political Offices (Gender Composition) Bill 2021, is arguably the first legislation of its kind in the country that places a ceiling below which the government cannot go in appointment of either gender for public offices.\n\nSpeaking in Ilorin at a state government-inspired conference with the theme: \u2018Cracking the glass ceiling: the story of Kwara women\u2019, the Governor said it is only fair that women be given a fair space in the decision- making process whose outcomes have far-reaching consequences for them and their families.\n\nThe event was attended by creme de la creme from Kwara and beyond such as: representative of the wife of the President Dr. Rukayat Gurin; Kwara First Lady Ambassador Mrs. Olufolake AbdulRazaq; Women Affairs Minister Dame Pauline Tallen; Ekiti First Lady Mrs. Bisi Fayemi and several governors\u2019 wives; Senators from the three senatorial districts of Kwara and House of Representatives members from the state; the Ilorin born business tycoon, Mrs. Bola Shagaya; former acting Governor of CBN Sarah Alade; National Missioner Ansar-u-deen Muslim Society of Nigeria, Dr. AbdulRahman Ahmad; Founder/CEO Sokoa Chair Centre and keynote speaker Mrs. Ibukun Awosika.\n\nThe event also saw the conferment of outstanding awards of excellence on Kwara women who have achieved huge feats in their respective field.\n\nThe awardees were: Mrs Sarah Jubril; financial guru and former Lagos Finance Commissioner Mrs Foluke Abdulrazaq; Mrs Sarah Alade; business woman Bola Shagaya; Senator Khairat Gwadabe; first female HOS in Kwara Zarah Omar; former Deputy Vice Chancellor of University of Ilorin Prof Sidikat Ijaya; media veteran Hajia Eyitayo Mairo Mustapha; and the Onila/Agindigbi women who built schools; among many others.\n\nThe Governor said the recognition and the step to mainstream women in public service were the least the administration could do for the hard working women as a way of inspiring the girl child.\n\n\u201cWomen are so critical to human civilisation. They are just as brilliant, innovative, and smart as men. They are the largest voting demographic in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYet, they are often absent or unfairly represented when policies and programmes that shape everything concerning them and their families are desIgned.\n\n\u201cThis needs a rethink. In Kwara, we have recently taken unprecedented steps to involve more women in the decision making process. We appointed 56.25 female cabinet members and about 50% female permanent secretaries. Many key government positions are headed by women. We do not have regrets making such decisions.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the gains we have made in Kwara in mainstreaming gender parity in appointments could easily be reversed by anyone. We have therefore decided to give a legal cover for gender parity in Kwara State, no matter what party is in power. I have therefore assented to the Kwara State Political Offices (Gender Composition) Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cA unique feature of this legislation is that no gender class shall henceforth have below 35% representation in the State Executive Council. This opens a new chapter for inclusive political system in Kwara State and Nigeria as a whole. It is our bold contribution to the Nigerian political culture.\n\n\u201cWe feel strongly that no segment of the society should be absent or underrepresented in the decision making process. This law could well encourage our major parties to officially mainstream gender parity in their activities.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that many heroic efforts of women have contributed to the growth of the State, saying the conference was organised to single them out for special commendations.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment to specially appreciate all of you Kwara women for the great things that you stand for,\u201d Abdulrazaq said.\n\n\u201cFrom farm to market place, community work, national service, and their sweats that go into building our homes, the Kwara woman is simply great.\n\n\u201cEarly this year, I read the inspiring story of some women in Onila and Agindigbi communities who pulled resources together to build schools. No commitment to community growth can be greater. I visited these women in appreciation of this sacrifice. We have also reimbursed their expenses, and completed the schools.\n\n\u201cThe Onila/Agindigbi phenomenon reflects the character of the Kwara woman.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s First Lady who was represented by the Senior Special Assistant on Administration and Women Affairs Dr. Rukayat Gurin called on all States to emulate AbdulRazaq in promoting the welfare of women for overall development of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYou are a true partner to women and you are doing well for advancing the course of women. We are all testimonies to the historic story of Kwara women under you,\u201d she said.\n\nShe commended Governor AbdulRazaq for giving opportunities to women to thrive.\n\nKwara\u2019s First Lady, Olufolake AbdulRazaq , explained that the event is to inspire the average Kwara woman to leverage on the women-friendly initiatives of the state government to chart progressive course for themselves and be active participants in the processes of governance for the development of their immediate communities and the nation.\n\nDame Paulen said the formation of AbdulRazaq\u2019s women-dominated cabinet is remarkably unique, adding the event further underlined the Governor\u2019s efforts at improving the lot of women in national development.\n\nShe lauded the Governor\u2019s wife for supporting his husband to cause a meaningful change in the history of the state.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt is most gratifying to join this event organised to celebrate the socio-cultural, economic and political contributions of women in Kwara State. It is on record that Kwara started cracking the glass ceiling in 2019 with the landmark appointments, where he appointed 9 women out of 16 commissioners into the state Executive Council.\u201d\n\nFounder/CEO Sokoa Chair Centre Mrs Ibukun Awosika congratulated the Governor for being exceptional and a pacesetter in allowing the girl child to be major part of the political and economic aspect of the state.\n\nShe said: \u201cKwara State is a good example of states that understand the value inherent in women. Kwara has shown that it has women who have gone through many fields and every corner of this state and Nigeria,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNothing is wrong with you being a girl or women. We need to appreciate and use every resource that we have to our advantage. We must educate every girl and empower women. I want to call on every young girl, as long as you have brain and you are educated, there is nothing you can\u2019t do because of your gender.\n\n\u201cWomen are compassionate and care more about community. We need women and men to work together collaboratively. Women are not seeking to replace men but to work together for the development of the society.\u201d\n\nDr. Abdulrahman Ahmad said the glass ceiling is a temporary barrier created by man, adding that God makes no rigid distinctions in what success that people can attain, no matter their gender.\n\nHe said Governor AbdulRazaq has made history in the country in trying to give more voice to women and every member of the society.\n\nVarious speakers took turns to commend the administration for its historic gender inclusion policy.",

          "text": "According to Ifeanyi Ejiofor, lead attorney for the beleaguered Indigenous People of Biafra leader, the Department of State Services has refused to execute court orders allowing Nnamdi Kanu maximum comfort in jail, including changing his clothes.\n\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, the lawyer claimed that the detention center has \u201cunrepentantly proceeded to treat the court\u2019s instructions with the greatest disdain.\u201d\n\nWe earlier reported that Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered on December 2, 2021 that the secessionist leader should not be discriminated against in the custody of the secret police.\n\nThe presiding judge had also ordered that Kanu be given maximum comfort possible in detention, be allowed a change of clothing, be allowed free practice of his Jewish faith including access to his Jewish religious materials, allowed to receive any visitor of his choice, and allowed to mingle freely with other inmates in DSS custody.\n\nJustice Nyako also adjourned the trial of Kanu till January 18, 2022, after granting a motion for an abridgement of time.\n\nBut Ejiofor said he visited Kanu in DSS custody on Monday, saying that despite the orders made by the court on December 2, 2021, the DSS flouted and ignored the court orders.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018Update On Today\u2019s Visit To Our Indefatigable Client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu At The Headquarters Of The Department Of State Services (DSS) Abuja\u2019.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cWe were informed by our client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu that none of the pronouncement made by the Court on the 2nd of December 2021 has been obeyed by the lawless DSS. They have unrepentantly continued to treat the Orders of the Court with greatest disdain.\n\n\u201cOur client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu further informed us that he had not eaten anything since Sunday, apparently being punished because we dared to complain to the court about the harsh condition under which he is being held in custody. But, very, unfortunately, this should be the height of their reckless affront to the orders of court.\n\n\u201cAt the time Her Lordship made these far-reaching orders in open court, I did not mince words in bringing to the attention of the court that the operatives of the DSS will flout these orders, pursuant to which the court specifically directed me to come back to her with these facts if her order is flouted by the detaining authority.\u201d\n\nHe said the legal team of the IPOB leader would be approaching the court immediately with the development, which he described as \u201ctotally unacceptable, grossly condemnable, and intolerable.\u201d\n\nEjiofor insisted that Kanu has not been convicted for committing any crime and he is still presumed innocent of every allegation against him.\n\n\u201cThe detaining authority (DSS) is an Agency clearly established by instrumentality of the laws and should operate within the confines of the same laws establishing them, and should not be seen as a lawless entity, which unfortunately is what they represent in practice,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he jumped bail in June 2018 before leaving for the United Kingdom, though he said that he fled because his life was no longer safe in Nigeria.\n\nAfter about three years abroad, the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), at a press briefing in Abuja on June 29, 2021, announced that the IPOB leader was re-arrested in a foreign country and extradited to Nigeria.\n\nHis lawyers had said the IPOB leader was re-arrested in Kenya and whisked to Nigeria.\n\nUpon his re-arrest and extradition in June 2021, he was re-arraigned before Justice Nyako for terrorism-related charges brought against him by the AGF office. Kanu has since been remanded in the DSS custody in Abuja and has since appeared in the same cloth he wore at the time of his arrest.\n\nMeanwhile, the AGF has said that it is premature to pardon Kanu, adding that the IPOB leader is still standing trial for terrorism-related charges.\n\nOn November 19, 2021, some respected Igbo elders, led by Minister of Aviation in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) in Aso Rock and requested the unconditional release of the detained secessionist leader.\n\nBuhari had told them he would not want to interfere in the running of the judiciary but said he would consider their demand though \u201ca heavy one.\u201d\n\nMalami had also on November 10, 2021, said a political solution cannot be ruled out to resolve the crisis surrounding separatist agitations in Nigeria but he recently made a U-turn and said the option is not on the table yet.",
          "summary": "According to Ifeanyi Ejiofor, lead attorney for the beleaguered Indigenous People of Biafra leader, the Department of State Services has refused to execute court orders allowing Nnamdi Kanu maximum comfort in jail, including changing his clothes.\nBut Ejiofor said he visited Kanu in DSS custody on Monday, saying that despite the orders made by the court on December 2, 2021, the DSS flouted and ignored the court orders.\nThe statement was titled, \u2018Update On Today\u2019s Visit To Our Indefatigable Client \u2013 Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu At The Headquarters Of The Department Of State Services (DSS) Abuja\u2019.\nHis lawyers had said the IPOB leader was re-arrested in Kenya and whisked to Nigeria.\nMeanwhile, the AGF has said that it is premature to pardon Kanu, adding that the IPOB leader is still standing trial for terrorism-related charges.",

          "title": "Non-oil export: When FirstBank hosted stakeholders on boosting local production",
          "text": "AMAKA IFEAKANDU captures stakeholders\u2019 views harvested during the non oil export webinar series 2021 hosted by First Bank of Nigeria Limited.\n\nRecently, First Bank of Nigeria Limited hosted stakeholders on non oil export webinar series 2021 and deliberated on opportunities around the country\u2019s expansion drive towards diversifying the nation\u2019s economy to reduce the reliance on oil as the mains revenue source of the country.\n\nAs a fact, the nation\u2019s dependency on oil for forex inflow affects government revenue, especially whenever there is a slight decline in the prices of crude oil at the international market. The situation puts both the federal and state budgets in jeopardy. This will in turn cause the salaries of public sector workers to be delayed and also lead to delay or non-payment of government contractors.\n\nPast Forex earnings\n\nBefore the discovery of crude oil, Nigeria depended on agriculture for her foreign exchange earnings as the sector contributed about 60 per cent of the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Products (GDP), 70 per cent to export and 95 per cent to food needs in the country.\n\nOil boom\n\nWith the oil boom of 1970s, the country neglected agriculture and depended solely on oil for forex inflows. Available data shows oil accounted for 88.75 per cent of the Nigerian trade in the first half of 2021, contributed 7.4 per cent to the GDP in third quarter of 2021, while non oil sectors such as agriculture, traded and ICT remained dominant, contributing 29.94 per cent, 14.93 per cent and 14.2 per cent respectively.\n\nEfforts to diversify economy\n\nThe federal government had in the past, introduced different agricultural schemes to support the nation\u2019s economic growth. They include Agricultural Credit Scheme Fund (ACGSF), Agricultural Credit Support Scheme (ACSS), Commercial Agric Credit Scheme (CAC), and Anchor Borrower Programme among others.\n\nThe Muhammad Buhari-led administration is also doing everything possible to diversify and grow a productive and competitive economy with the available resource.\n\nFirst Bank\u2019s intervention\n\nAnd in a swift intervention, FirstBank organised non oil export webinar series to facilitate sustainable exports as well as guide participants on ways of navigating the hurdles and challenges of exports in Nigeria.\n\nThe bank is also leveraging its vast experience in supporting trade businesses, especially in the SME and Corporate Business space to lend its expertise to drive discussions that will enable existing exporters, expand their export businesses and encourage new entrants into non-oil export industry.\n\nTo drive economic growth, the bank created an Export Desk to support the needs of exporters, including the designing of export products and solutions, to cater for pre and post export financing and services to foster quick processing of export collections, conversion and payments via automated platforms\n\nThe Non-Oil Webinar Series, says the FBN, was set up to create awareness for the endowment in each region of the country, open the exports opportunities prevalent in these areas in collaboration with seasoned export experts; drive grassroots conversations with existing and intending exporters to convert them to export opportunities.\n\nAlso, it is designed to help overcome export challenges inherent in these regions; engender awareness on the export potential for AFCFTA prevalent in the regions; and serve as a workshop to address concerns, challenges and solutions in the export business.\n\nAgriculture Support Scheme\n\nFurther to this, First Bank, through its Agriculture Support Scheme, has offered a range of products and services designed to help agricultural business yield better result. The bank featured agriculture solution in maize Aggregation scheme (MAS), Paddy Aggregation Scheme (PAS), Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme, Non oil Export stimulation facilities, conventional agricultural Term Loan and overdraft , Real Sector Support funds (RSSF) among others. The bank remains at Frontline in supporting agricultural sector to grow their business.\n\nStakeholders\u2019 views\n\nIn various submissions, stakeholders in the nation\u2019s trade and finance industry believe product packaging, documentation, certification as well as building supporting infrastructure will help enhance the non oil export in the country.\n\nThey also admit that export-led economies generally enjoy relative stability and sustainable growth.\n\nIn his presentation titled \u2018Building Sustainable Non-Oil Export In Nigeria: Harnessing Opportunity within the AFCFTA Treaty and Agro Commodities,\u2019\u201d founder/chief consultant of B. Adedipe Associates Limited, Dr Biodun Adedipe says global economy is projected to grow this year and next year, and anytime global economy is growing, international market will be on the growth direction.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the nation\u2019s economy is growing, he says it is expected to be at a faster rate.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe major challenge in the country today is because we are import dependent economy and the implications is that any time you import from another country, you are creating jobs for the country.\u201d\n\nAdedipe says Nigerian economy grew by 0.51 per cent , 5.01 per cent and 4.03 per cent respectively between first quarter and third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe also says the liquid external reserves stands at $41.59 billion as of November 29, 2021 with monthly import bill of $5.61 billion resulting to 7.42 months cover.\n\nThe financial expert reveals that oil accounted for 88.75 per cent of foreign trade in first half of 2021 but has only 7.4 per cent of the GDP in third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe explains that disconnect of sort is having weak linkage to the rest of the economy, adding that non oil sectors like agriculture, Trade and ICT which contribute 29.94 per cent, 14.93 per cent and 14.2 per cent remained dominant.\n\n\u201cThere is no sector you operate in the Nigerian economy that there is no space for you to thrive if you do the right things at the right place and right time for the right person as most things are now digital,\u201d Adedipe explains.\n\nHe stresses the need for Nigeria \u201cto change her orientation, to export led growth or import substitution, build supporting infrastructure, set aggressive target and implement rigorous measures,\u201d warning that \u201cif Nigeria doesn\u2019t Act fast, other countries will act on us.\u201d\n\nNEPC\n\nIn another presentation, Deputy Director Policy Department Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Akintinde Folorunsho says Nigeria has a lot of potential in horticulture sector in tomato value chain.\n\nFolorunsho, who represented Executive Director NEPC, Dr Ezra Yakusak, says \u201cas Nigeria imports at least 400,000 tonnes of tomato paste annually, there is a large opportunity for the manufacturer that can get it right both in Nigeria and Africa market.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is massive agricultural production of tomatoes in Kano and Benue during peak season but they get wasted due to post harvest loses,\u201d Folorusho declares.\n\nWhile harping on packaging as an essential to value chain addition, the NEPC boss says \u201cglobal value chains are becoming increasingly \u2018buyer-driven\u2019 and are determined by value chain specific quality attributes characterized by embedded complex quality information, global accepted standard and Codification, certification and procedures.\u201d\n\nHe tells the gathering that \u201cNEPC established steering committee to implement facility that will stimulate non export, safeguard jobs and protect business from the adverse effect of Covid-19.\u201d\n\nIn his intervention, Area Controller of Customs Apapa Port, Malanta I. Yusuf whose presentation centres on \u2018Export Procedure and AfCFTA,\u2019 describes documentation as a major requirement needed before one can be export goods out of the country.\n\nThe Customs chief accuses exporters for being responsible for the congestion experiencing in the Nigerian Port, stressing that \u201cmost of the exporters failed to complete documentation process early until their consignment arrived at the Port and by the time they finished processing their various papers to clear the goods the entire environment is fully congested.\u201d\n\nYusuf states that \u201conce exporters comply with the process of honest declaring of goods and documentation, the issue of congestion will be a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nThe comptroller also says export prohibition list was introduced by the federal government to encourage local market, provide employment and prevent shortage of goods in domestic market and to limit or restrict arms or dual use of items that may be used in proliferation.\n\nHighlighting the benefits of AfCFTA, Yusuf quotes from World Bank report which states that \u201cimplementation of the AFCFTA would lift 30 million Africans out of the extreme poverty and boost the income of nearly 66 million others who live on less than $5.50 a day, increase Africa\u2019s export by $560 billion mostly in manufacturing sector, boost wages for skilled and unskilled workers by 10.3 per cent for unskilled workers and 9.8 per cent skilled workers.\u201d\n\nThe Customs boss lists forex restrictions, corruption, local content, regional security, port congestion and administrative delay, Information and Telecommunication Technology, inadequate infrastructure, finance constraints, over regulation of the non oil export sector and inefficient implementation of export incentives and support programme as major challenges of exporters in the trade supply chain.\n\nRegional Chief Operating Officer Anglophone West Africa, Mr Eric Monchu Intong whose talk dwells on \u2018Afrexim Bank as a catalyst to AfCFTA treaty\u2019s Success\u201d says Afrexim Bank strategic plan between 2017 and 2021 centred in four pillars.\n\nThe pillars, according to him, include promotion and financing of intra Africa trade, industrialisation and support export manufacturing , expand and deepening trade finance offering , improving capacity of Africans in trade finance and financial soundness and performance.\n\nFBN boss\n\nAddressing the gathering, Managing Director FBN Adesola Adeduntan explains that one of the strategies of the bank is to promote export in the country.\n\nHe says though the bank runs its business, but also focuses on how to use its available resources to assist the government.\n\nWith scarcity of foreign exchange, Adeduntan believes pushing for export is the only way the country will diversify the economy by increasing the forex inflow.\n\nFrom views harvested at the end of the discourse, the MD says, the bank will be rightly guided in what \u201crole it will play to help our economy and Africa in general.\u201d",

          "text": "The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has advocated the drafting of members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) into the fight against drug abuse in the country.\n\nSpeaking Monday evening at the launch of the National Drugs Control Master Plan (NDCMP), 2021- 2025 by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), the Minister stated that the 320,000 strong Corp members that serve the nation annually are a ready army that can be deployed in the fight against drug abuse, charging the NDLEA and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) to look in that direction.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest problems we have seen in the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development is the menace of drug abuse amongst our Youth. In different urban centres from Lagos to Port-Harcourt to Kano, you just need to visit a few of the hidden rehab centres. You\u2019ll see young men between the ages of 18 and 34, who otherwise should be at the cutting edge of technology, providing solutions to our problems, developing apps for this country, completely almost running berserk\u201d, the Minister lamented.\n\n\u201cLike several other countries, Nigeria\u2019s future is imperiled unless it does something to halt the use of illicit drugs and its devastating effect on our younger population. Now, that is why the launch of this Masterplan today, and the work done by various development partners is of major significance for us here as a country, and also for me, as Minister of Youth and Sports Development\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe issues are diverse, we talk about use of illicit drugs, we talk about sub-standard drugs but our utmost concern is how we can take our Youth out of this hole, they\u2019ve found themselves. We need an army that will create awareness about the dangers, that will create education about alternatives, I look up here and I see the NYSC members. That is the single largest concentration of Youth in our country. Year in, Year out, 320,000 of them serve our country. It is pertinent to fashion out a template that would right from the first day they get into camp, and throughout their service year turn them into foot-soldiers, an army that will carry the message against illicit drugs use out there\u201d, Dare emphasised.\n\nOn the predilection of some Youth to illicit drug use, the Minister affirmed the need to interrogate reasons for the vice, listing factors such as low self-esteem, peer pressure, frustration, depression, unemployment and disappointment as causative agents. He added that with high number of jobless youth coupled with crippling poverty, slide to drugs use might be a way of seeking temporary reprieve.\n\n\u201cBecause government is mindful of these factors, that is why it is providing opportunities for Youth to thrive, that is why a slew of youth focused programmes have been put in place and will be upscaled to make sure that we accelerate the number of Youth that we can place on the path of entrepreneurship, that we can support their education, that we can give the relevant digital skills training that they need to compete in a 21st century World,\u201d Dare added.\n\nThe Minister expressed the commitment of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development to explore areas of partnership with the NDLEA to ensure the Masterplan has a far-reaching impact on reducing the menace of drug abuse amongst Youth across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "The Lagos State Government has raised alarm over the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state with its positivity rate at six per cent.\n\nGovernor Babajide who made the declaration in a statement on Tuesday said the state had begun to experience the beginnings of a fourth wave of the pandemic.\n\nThe current positivity rate, according to him, is against the positivity rate of 0.1 per cent recorded as of mid-November and analyses revealed that the fourth wave is a result of non-adherence to the laid down protocols.\n\nAs a way to tackle the rising cases, the governor appealed to residents to go to the various approved centres for the vaccine jabs to protect themselves from the virus.\n\nHe also asked them to support the government in its effort to manage the fourth wave of the pandemic, especially during the festive season.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu noted the review of Nigeria\u2019s travel protocol by the Presidential Steering Committee, saying the state government would ensure total enforcement.\n\nHe stressed the need for inbound passengers to take the post-arrival Day 2 test within 48 hours of arrival into the country, as well as an additional Day 7 PCR test for all partially or unvaccinated returning travellers.\n\n[READ ALSO] Travel Ban: Governors Fault Canada And UK, Ask WHO To Intervene\n\nThe governor warned that the government would soon commence the prosecution of those that refuse to submit themselves for the tests by blacklisting their passports for one year.\n\nAccording to him, this will be done in synergy with the Presidential Steering Committee while foreigners who flout the rules risk deportation.\n\nRead the full statement below:\n\nMR GOVERNOR\u2019S CORONAVIRUS PRESS STATEMENT\u2013 DECEMBER 07, 2021\n\nFellow Lagosians,\n\nFirstly, I would like to commiserate with all Lagos residents who lost their loved ones during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our hearts go out to you and the Incident Command System will continue to do everything that we can to mitigate the impact of this pandemic.\n\nSecondly, most of the continents of the world \u2013 including Africa \u2013 are now experiencing a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, Lagos State is not left out as we are also experiencing the beginnings of a fourth wave with the current positivity rate at 6%.\n\nThis is against the positivity rates of 0.1% as of the middle of November 2021. Based on our analysis, the fourth wave was brought by the non-adherence to the laid down protocols to mitigate this pandemic.\n\nI would want to use this opportunity to, once again, plead with everyone to get vaccinated and join hands with the Lagos State Government in managing this wave of the pandemic in this festive season by following the guidelines we have set, especially regarding the use of face masks, public gatherings and travelling in and out of Lagos State.\n\nEpidemiology Update\n\nAs of the 5th of December 2021, Lagos State had recorded a total of 78,564 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of this number, 71,977 have recovered in community and 612 are being managed actively in community.\n\nOver the course of managing the COVID-19 pandemic, about 6,066 patients have been admitted into our various COVID-19 care centres in Lagos: with 686 registered fatalities.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to, once again, urge all residents of Lagos State to take advantage of EKOTELEMED and our home-based care programme.\n\nPlease, reach out to EKOTELEMED on our toll-free number 08000EKOMED (08000356633) if you have any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or have tested positive for the virus.\n\nTravel Protocols\n\nBased on the review of the current guidelines on travel protocols, the Presidential Steering Committee has released new rules which must be followed by all passengers arriving in Nigeria. These include:\n\nA COVID-19 PCR test is to be done within 48hrs before departure.\n\nPost-arrival Day 2 COVID-19 PCR test\n\nAll partially and unvaccinated individuals to self-isolate for 7 days following arrival into the country and a Day 7 release PCR test.\n\nAll outbound passengers to demonstrate evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19\n\nNegative PCR test results within 48hrs from the time to boarding a flight out of Nigeria.\n\nIt is important to note that the review of the protocols was based on science, national experience and global developments. The Lagos State Government will do all within its power to enforce these new mandates and will prosecute anyone found wanting in compliance with them through our mobile courts.\n\nRegulation Of Day 2 And Day 7 Tests For Inbound Passengers For International Flights\n\nWhile it is a stringent requirement that all inbound passengers perform a Day 2 test within 48 hours of arrival into the country; and an additional Day 7 PCR test for all partially or unvaccinated inbound passengers, we cannot stress enough how important the strict adherence to these protocols are.\n\nThese tests are mandatory to assist the State monitor the inflow of positive passengers, which we have identified as a veritable source of our waves and community spread.\n\nBased on this, we will commence the prosecution of those that refuse to submit themselves for these mandatory tests by blacklisting their passports for 1 year.\n\nThis would be carried out in partnership with the Presidential Steering Committee. In addition, all foreigners that flout the rules would be subject to possible deportation\n\nTherefore, I implore all intending inbound passengers to perform their required tests at any of the private laboratories within the Lagos State Private Laboratory Consortium as and at when due.\n\nFake Covid Test Results And Vaccination Cards\n\nIt is also pertinent to mention at this point that we have received very disturbing information about intending outbound passengers procuring fake Covid test results and/or vaccination cards for travel purposes.\n\nThis is a very worrisome trend for us to note and we are currently working with the NCDC, DSS and the Police to investigate and bring to book the criminal gangs involved in this reprehensible activity.\n\nWe implore everyone to desist from patronizing these gangs, as anyone found with a fake COVID test result and/or vaccination card will also be liable to prosecution and very stiff penalties.\n\nOur State Mobile Courts will be used to prosecute all those involved in flouting the regulations; as well as those engaged in the fraudulent production of fake covid test results and vaccination certificates.\n\nTesting Protocols\n\nUp until today and into the future, the Lagos State Government is still offering free COVID-19 testing at all our public facilities for those that fit our case definition for COVID-19 infections. If anyone has any symptoms indicating a possible infection, please proceed to any of our public laboratories to get tested.\n\nWe are also still operating our 10 sample collection sites at the level of our LGAs and encourage residents to proceed to these centres to get their samples taken if they feel ill or have been exposed to anyone who has an infection.\n\nIt is also important to reiterate that our private laboratories are still available for those who want to test outside of the public health response.\n\nBooster Doses\n\nI am also very happy to announce that the Presidential Steering Committee, in partnership with the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency and the Federal Ministry of Health, has approved the administration of booster doses for anyone with the criteria below:\n\nAny persons 18 years and above;\n\nTime interval of 6 months or more after receiving the second dose of Astra Zeneca, Moderna or Pfizer Bio-N-Tech; or\n\nTime interval of 2 months or more after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.\n\nConsequently, all Lagos residents should proceed to any of our public health facilities to receive these vaccines for free and at any of our 30 private priority health facilities to access them for an administrative fee of N4,500 per dose.\n\nMitigating the Fourth Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nOur approach to mitigating the effects of the ongoing wave of the COVID-19 pandemic include the following:\n\nIncreasing the percentage of vaccinated residents of Lagos State from 1.6% to 30% within one year. I have specifically mandated the Lagos State Ministry of Health to administer 8 million doses to 4 million residents by the 25th of December 2021 under the Count Me In campaign.\n\nWe have deployed a robust strategy that involves the private sector to improve access to vaccines. We are launching 30 private priority sites for those who want to be vaccinated within a private health facility.\n\nWhile vaccination at public centres remains free, there is an administration fee (N4,500 per dose and N6,000 for two doses) at private centres. To register for the vaccination, please visit the registration portal at https://nphcda.vaccination.gov.ng/\n\nOver the next couple of days, the Lagos State Government will release policies to facilitate the uptake of vaccines to achieve desirable herd immunity.\n\nGuidelines for Social Events and Gatherings During the Festive Period\n\nAll Social Events must be duly registered to obtain Event Safety Clearance from the Lagos State Safety Commission website: www.lasgsafetyreg.com prior to holding; and the guidelines set out below must be strictly adhered to.\n\nWhere possible events should be held outdoors.\n\nOccupancy limit at any event must not exceed 60% of maximum design capacity of the event centre.\n\nEvery attendee of a social gathering MUST present their Vaccination Cards or digital bar code page showing at least first dose but preferably double dose full vaccination.\n\nIn unvaccinated people, a negative PCR within 72 hours will be an exemption.\n\nEverybody, irrespective of vaccination status, MUST be subject to Rapid Diagnostic test (Antigen) to be conducted AT THE EVENT VENUE OR within 24hrs prior to the event at designated laboratories. (Request for rapid tests at the venue requires an application through the Safety Commission).\n\nUnder 18 years of age are unvaccinated and the above applies.\n\nGuests and service providers with high temperature (above 37.5) are to be politely turned back and referred to paramedics or the emergency response team on the ground.\n\nAll guests and service providers at the event must wear a nose mask or face shield before entry.\n\nAll guests and service providers must endeavour to wash their hands before entering the venue or use hand sanitisers after which temperature checks should be carried out.\n\nHand sanitisers to be positioned at the entry point and at different spots within the venue.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nDespite the huge financial obligation and constraints associated with managing this pandemic, our administration will continue to do everything within its power to ensure the preservation of the lives and livelihood of residents of Lagos State.\n\nAs always, I would like to thank all members of our Emergency Operations Centre and our Incident Command System, in addition to all our health workers in the public and private sectors, without leaving out our colleagues in the federal institutions for their dedication and commitment in the management of this response.\n\nOnce again, I implore all residents of Lagos to comply with all guidelines and join hands with the government in the management of this pandemic.\n\nBabajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu\n\nGovernor of Lagos State\n\nDecember 7, 2021",

          "text": "Members of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) have condemned the travel ban imposed on the country by authorities in Canada and the United Kingdom over the report of confirmed cases of omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday by NGF Chairman and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, they described the action of both countries, as discriminatory and called for the intervention of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) wishes to draw the attention of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to the arbitrary stigmatisation that is caused by the recent banning of countries from visitation based on omicron spread,\u201d said Governor Fayemi. \u201cOnly three cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus were detected in Nigeria less than a week ago, precisely on December 1st, 2021.\n\n\u201cCanada and the United Kingdom have hastily included Nigeria among the Omicron present countries which must stay away from their shores, an action viewed by the NGF as precipitate, unfair and discriminatory.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: UK Adds Nigeria To Red List Over Omicron Fears\n\nAccording to the governors, omicron remains relatively unknown globally as it is not yet clear whether it is more transmissible from person to person, compared to other variants, including Delta.\n\nThey stressed that it was very discouraging to note that several countries have reported cases of omicron with tallies similar to or higher than Nigeria\u2019s, yet travellers there have not been banned from entering the UK and Canada.\n\nConfirmed omicron cases across some countries as of December 3, the NGF stated, included Nigeria (three), Australia (seven), Brazil (three), Germany (nine), Israel (four), Italy (nine), and Netherlands (16).\n\n\u201cThere is also no evidence that harsh, blanket travel bans will protect the countries that impose them,\u201d said the governors. \u201cIt is ironical that this ban comes at a time when the DG of the WHO, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has advised that \u2018rational proportional risk reduction measures\u2019 be taken by countries such as screening passengers prior to departure and/or upon arrival in a country or enforcing a quarantine period.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NGF, therefore, urges the WHO to intervene in this matter by setting uniform standards that are acceptable to all for banning countries across the globe. As we know, vaccine hesitancy is quite high and for many reasons, including disruptive announcements like this which could exacerbate distrust of the vaccine and heighten hesitancy.\n\n\u201cWorld leaders and stakeholders in the West need to remember that with the COVID-19 pandemic until everyone is free, no one is free. Variants will continue to appear and spread across the globe as long as global herd immunity has not been achieved.\n\n\u201cWe call on countries to be guided by science and fairness in setting the criteria for updating their red list. We encourage both public and private stakeholders to continue to support vaccination efforts and address hesitancy. We encourage Nigerians not to be discouraged and to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cAs a platform for the 36 democratically elected governors of the country, the NGF believes it reserves the right to speak for its people. Besides, the NGF was proactive and ahead in the Polio eradication program in Nigeria, in the country\u2019s response to the Ebola virus, and lately in the response against the coronavirus pandemic. Finally, health is one of the core mandate areas of the NGF and has remained an item on its meeting agenda in the past several months,\u201d the NGF added.",

The Delta variant remains the dominant variant and so far, we have not seen the replacement of this variant by the new Omicron variant as observed elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe Omicron variant is a source of global concern because of its increased risk of transmissibility and its potential to escape protective immune responses induced by natural infection and/or vaccination.\n\n\u201cTaken together, and if true, the Omicron variant can significantly change the current global COVID-19 epidemiology. There is currently no evidence of generalised or community transmission of this variant in Nigeria. However, the NCDC will continue coordinating and implementing genomic surveillance activities in-country to keep Nigerians reliably informed about existing variants, the Omicron and indeed other variants that may arise based on national data and emerging global evidence\u201d.\n\nIn line with Article 44 of the International Health Regulations 2005 (IHR) reporting framework, the Federal Government through the NCDC says it has also been notified by the UK Government of seven cases of travellers from Nigeria with the Omicron variant.\n\nConsequently, the NCDC said with the increasing number of Omicron cases in the UK, it is now prioritising the sequencing of COVID-19 positive samples in travellers with a history of travel to the UK.\n\n\u201cAll viruses naturally mutate over time, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 was first identified, several mutations have occurred with the emergence of new lineages.\n\n\u201cThis will continue to happen as long as the world does not act in concert to significantly reduce transmission through vaccination and adherence to effective public health measures such as mask use, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and ensuring good ventilation,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe NCDC and the Federal Ministry of Health, therefore, urged members of the public to continue to take personal and collective responsibility to ensure the safety of all Nigerians.\n\nIt also reiterated that compliance with the travel protocols provided by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (PSC-COVID-19) is mandatory for all international travellers arriving in Nigeria from any country.\n\nAccording to the agency, all incoming travellers should ensure their Day 2 and Day 7 tests are done as stipulated in Nigeria\u2019s travel advisory \u201cotherwise, there will be consequences for defaulters which may include publication of their details, suspension of their passports and ban on travel to Nigeria by the PSC-COVID-19\u201d.",

The last administration convened a national conference in 2014 and we agreed on some certain fundamentals to ensure justice and fairness. Unfortunately, when this government came in, they made a terrible mistake. They never touched that report and that is the problem.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are now saying we should start that conversation. We should talk to one another and assure one another of justice and fairness, because without equity, there can\u2019t be peace. Without equity, we cannot be together. Let me appeal to the federal government to promote peace, equity and justice. Let me also appeal to those people, who are agitating that there\u2019s tremendous power in being united. Let\u2019s not fight to scatter and divide Nigeria. We are better being together,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe congratulated the Urhobo Nation on the 90th anniversary of UPU, stressing that Urhobo people had played prominent roles in stabilising and promoting the unity of Nigeria.\n\nThe former minister, had at an earlier engagement, said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would be swept out of office in 2023, because it had committed a lot of injustices against humanity, adding that Nigerians were fed up with their leaders.\n\nGana said this at the weekend in Effurun, near Warri, Delta State, while delivering a lecture titled: \u201cRaising 21st Century Leaders for Nigeria\u201d at Youth Arise Conference 2021.\n\nThe Youth Arise Nigeria Conference with large turnout in attendance from within and Outside Delta was put together by Advocates of Paradigm Shift in Governance.\n\nThey included Deacon Chris Iyowaye, Hon. Gibson Akporehe, Phillip Adu-Odogwu, Cogent Owhe and Lady E Ejiro Umukoro with the goal of raising the civic and political consciousness of youths in how they engage governance, get their PVC as a civic duty while volunteering and investing their time in being useful citizens rather than be purchaseable electorate.\n\nSylvester Idowu in Warri",
