          "text": "Twitter has appealed a French court decision that ordered it to give activists full access to all of its relevant documents on efforts to fight hate speech, lawyers and a judicial source said on Saturday.\n\nIn July, a French court ordered Twitter to grant six French anti-discrimination groups full access to all documents relating to the company\u2019s efforts to combat hate speech since May 2020. The ruling applied to Twitter\u2019s global operation, not just France.\n\nTwitter has appealed the decision and a hearing has been set for December 9, 2021, a judicial source told AFP, confirming information released by the groups\u2019 lawyers.\n\nTwitter and its lawyers declined to comment.\n\nThe July order said that Twitter must hand over \u201call administrative, contractual, technical or commercial documents\u201d detailing the resources it has assigned to fight homophobic, racist and sexist discourse on the site, as well as the offence of \u201ccondoning crimes against humanity\u201d.\n\nIt also said Twitter must reveal how many moderators it employs in France to examine posts flagged as hateful, and data on the posts they process.\n\nThe July ruling gave the San Francisco-based company two months to comply. Twitter can ask for a suspension pending the appeal.\n\nThe six anti-discrimination groups had taken Twitter to court in France last year, accusing the US social media giant of \u201clong-term and persistent\u201d failures in blocking hateful comments from the site.\n\nThe groups campaign against homophobia, racism and anti-Semitism.\n\nTwitter\u2019s hateful conduct policy bans users from promoting violence or threatening or attacking people based on their race, religion, gender identity or disability, among other forms of discrimination.\n\nLike other social media giants it allows users to report posts they believe are hateful, and employs moderators to vet the content.\n\nBut anti-discrimination groups have long complained that holes in the policy allow hateful comments to stay online in many cases.\n\n(AFP)",

          "title": "Kanu, Igboho: Southern, M\u2019Belt groups slam Buhari",
          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje (Lagos) and Oluseye Ojo (Ibadan) AND noah ebije, Kaduna\n\nApex Igbo socio cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, the Middle Belt Forum and the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO yesterday described President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Independence Day address to Nigerians as full of empty claims.\n\nThey also tasked the president to put the contents of his 61st independence anniversary speech to practice.\n\nOhanaeze said that while Buhari\u2019s call for dialogue is commendable, such has been lacking in his administration. It said as a show of good faith, President Bihari should engage agitators across the country in a genuine dialogue. MBF said the problems in the country could be traced to absence of equity and justice, even as it described the speech as empty and full of false claims.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Alex Ogbonnia said President Buhari has two clear options before him: to let the country disintegrate and collapse under his watch or to work towards the unity of the country.\n\nAccording to him, wherever there is an agitation, it means something is wrong and the right thing to do will be to dialogue.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat attracted my attention most is that the President spoke of dialogue and the need for peaceful coexistence, I hope he will live up to his speech. I am of the conviction that the problem in Nigeria is caused by the inability of the President to play the father figure, as someone who has many children, he should not dispense extremely love to one and extreme hate to the other. If people are agitating, there is need to dialogue and find out why. So, we are pleading with the president to act out his speech by embarking on dialogue with various sections of this country because anytime you see agitation there is a cause for it and what is expected is that you find out the problem and sort it out. \u201cPresident Buhari has about 18 months to leave and he has two options, either to leave a legacy of a good man that listened to the cries and hues of the people and brought peace and unity, or a president that ignored the cries and yearnings of the people and allowed the country to collapse under his watch.\u201d\n\nPresident of MBF, Dr Bitrus Pogu said the Independence broadcast is a compendium of false claims.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow can someone we all know has failed come out and say his administration has performed more than the previous administrations? This is a false claim, this administration has failed and cannot lay claim to any performance.\u201d On the call for peaceful coexistence, Publicity Secretary of the MBF, Dr Do go Isuwa said: \u201cPeaceful coexistence will only be possible in Nigeria if there is equity and justice. We don\u2019t have that in Nigeria. All the agitations across Nigeria is because there is no equity and justice.\u201d\n\nIn its reaction, the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), under the leadership of Second Republic Senator, Prof Banji Akintoye, said President Muhammadu Buhari is chasing shadows in his allegation that members of the National Assembly have been sponsoring the Yoruba nation activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, over agitation for Yoruba nation. Akintoye, who spoke through the Communications Secretary of IOO, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, asked why President Buhari was silent on Boko Haram insurgency, banditry and killing of people in different parts of the country, and was particular about self-determination that has been declared legal and constitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nSaid he: \u201cWe appreciate him for saying that. But we are challenging him to name those that have been molesting, kidnapping, raping and killing our women, farmers, and travellers in terms of sponsoring of herdsmen\u2019s terrorism and Boko Haram insurgency in the South East, South West, North Central, Middle-Belt and Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pamper somebody who stole N1billion and be using guns to fire people that stole N5. We have not seen the offence Chief Sunday Igboho has committed. We are asking him to just tell us the offence that Chief Sunday Igboho has committed up till this time. I want to ask again, is there any court of competent jurisdiction in Nigeria where Sunday Igboho is standing trial?\n\n\u201cThe people that the Nigerian government arrested in Lagos during the Yoruba nation rally in July, were all granted bail. They charged them for disturbance of public peace. The last time the court sat, we did not see them. Up till now, the government ran away from Benin Republic court; they did not come up with any charge against Igboho, where he is standing trial in Cotonou. The one in Abuja, what has happened? Nothing. There is a High Court judgment that says self-determination is a right, and it is legal.\n\n\u201cSo, assuming Mr President is right, what offence has the senator that is sponsoring an agitation that has been declared legal and constitutional by the court of competent jurisdiction, what offence has that senator committed?\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari is just trying to entertain himself and his people. Why was he silent on insurgency in the Northern part of the country? He was silent on terrorism by Fulani herdsmen. He was silent on terrorism by Boko Haram. He was silent on people that have been kidnapping and killing people in the South and the Middle-Belt. He was silent on daily killings of people in Benue State and Southern Kaduna. He was only particular about people agitating in the Southern region. So, our position is that Buhari is chasing shadows. On everything he said, we are not bothered.\u201d\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) also asked President Buhari to name the sponsors of Igboho and Kanu without delay, adding that he should not take the country for a joke.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe told Saturday Sun: \u201cWhy is the government shy of exposing these sponsors? It makes the government itself look suspect. These strange pronouncements started since the Jonathan Presidency.\n\n\u201cThat one made the allegations that his cabinet members were part of Boko Haram. He never substantiated the accusation with names and we allowed him to get away with it.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow Buhari to get away with it. This country should not be taken for a joke. \u201cWhy not reveal their identity? When Governor Matawalle of Zamfara State threatened to expose the identity of sponsors of banditry in the state, our Chairman Audu Ogbeh said to him to name them & let the heavens fall,\u201d Yawe said.\n\nPan Yoruba socio cultural organisations, Afenifere also called on President Buhari to eschew nepotism, be more sincere and live up to his words that his administration will listen to the people. National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi said there are many instances in which Buhari-led government has shown that the people did not matter.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe greatest area in which the government has failed in recent times is in the area of security. Whatever infrastructure government put in place, it is only those who are alive and in good condition that can enjoy these things. But how can those who have been killed, kidnapped or maimed by terrorists enjoy those infrastructures the president is thrilled to say that his government is putting in place? It is heart-warming that the president promised to \u2018listen to all and protect democracy.\u2019 One sure way to do this is do away with impunity, nepotism, be more sincere in its tackling of security challenges in the country and above all, allow restructuring to take place so that peoples of Nigeria can sit down and decide on the modality for their continued staying together in a United Nigeria that is truly federal.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Ayo Adebanjo: Let\u2019s restructure or break Nigeria",
          "text": "It is the breakup of the country, that\u2019s all. I have said it severally, either you restructure the country to federalism, where everybody is an equal partner, or it will be \u2018to thy tents O Israel\u2019; whereby the country fragments and everyone goes his way to mind his or her business. Who will accept to be an underdog? And that is why Buhari has refused to do anything to change this constitution. I have been telling him, if you are honest, change this constitution, which was made without the consent of the people. You loaded everything against the South and you want it to continue. When you came in as military ruler, you made your laws and later, your people made a constitution and changed all the things that our founding fathers agreed to before independence. I have said, if that is difficult for you, let\u2019s sit and agree on how to move forward because we can\u2019t continue on the condition you imposed on us. It is the hypocrites pressmen and hypocrites Yoruba who pretend not to know what is happening.\n\nThe North knows what they are doing. All the times we have been saying, we don\u2019t want this constitution because it is oppressive and one sided. Is it not a strong statement for the president to come and disabuse our minds? But he is not bothered. I\u2019m a full advocate of restructuring, and I don\u2019t want secession. I want cooperation and the president hasn\u2019t invited those of us talking about restructuring to hear what we are talking about if he claims he doesn\u2019t understand what it means, but he wants to continuously force the constitution on us because all the paraphernalia of security is in his hands under the constitution. The Fulani controls the army, Navy, Air Force, police, DSS, Customs, Immigration because the constitution is in his hands. It will not work. If he likes, let him kill everybody in the South; it can\u2019t succeed. The president wants to disunite and dislocate Nigeria by still allowing this constitution that is contrary to the agreement reached by the founding fathers for everybody to live together. This time that the Northern governors were meeting, all their traditional rulers were there. This is how they are ganging up, and I refer you to what Ango Abdullahi said in 2014 before the election, \u2018that it is their turn and when we have it, we have it for keeps.\u2019 I have published it and he has not denied it. Buhari is only acting a script agreed to by the minority Fulani who are ruling the country and those of us who are opposing it, they say we want to secede. That is balderdash. I have said it and I\u2019m saying it again that Buhari is the number one enemy of Nigeria, for refusing to restructure the country, and he is the one encouraging the Nnamdi Kanus, the Sunday Igbohos. This position of \u2018no rotation\u2019 and \u2018there must be rotation,\u2019 will it not fragment the country? I\u2019m not blabbing. The Fulani are the same, whether in APC or in PDP. The game they are playing now is to divide others and tell you they are for you, but in the end they will vote another Northerner. Can you imagine PDP of all parties zoning the president to the North? They agreed on rotation principle for equity and fair play. Then, behind the scene, the APC will say okay, we are zoning to the South and they will vote for the Fulani candidate. So, the South will be watching? Yes, if they are stupid enough. I\u2019m say- ing it aloud and clear, they should resist it and say no. What is the ground of the PDP saying they are zoning the president to the North? They are not doing politics of principle, no ideology behind it, just self serving. Even the Igbo that I\u2019m defending are not helping matters. When the APC said they were going to support Tinubu, they were deceiving him. Now to cover their deceit, they said they were going to zone it to the South, and they are giving it to Tinubu, but the same party is encouraging Fayemi, encouraging Amosun and encouraging the vice president, and they are talking of bringing Goodluck Jonathan to go and repeat in order to divide the South. It is all lies. They have divided the South-East, assuring them also that they were going to be the president, especially those dragging their feet over restructuring. It is all lies. I told you people not to vote for Buhari in 2015 and you refused, where are we now? All I\u2019m saying is that if the North insists and succeeds in their plans for 2023, it will lead to everybody \u2018going back to his tent.\u2019 The British amalgamated us without consulting us, so we will go our separate ways without consulting anyone. They joined the East and the West because they couldn\u2019t maintain the North because of their poverty and we agreed at independence on certain grounds and conditions. But today, the North has deviated from that and that is why we are in trouble. The problem we are having now is the constitution drawn up by them and they allocated everything to themselves and they want the South to continue to follow them. I repeat, we either restructure the country or break the country. Even though the British didn\u2019t consult us before joining us, it is not their fault that the Fulani breached the terms of agreement of living together. We agreed at Lancaster House on the constitution before independence, which was handed over to us. It is the ability to dominate by a section of the ethnic groups because they control the military and security that is causing the problem. We don\u2019t have a problem with the British, though they are encouraging them and their collaborators in the South. Why do you think the North is afraid of rotation of power, restructuring and the collection of the value-added tax (VAT) by the states? Commodore Olawunmi has told the nation that Buhari wanted to Islamise Nigeria. Didn\u2019t you read it or listen or watch the video clip? Have they come out to refute it? I challenge Garba Shehu, Femi Adesina and Lai Mohammed to refute what the man said. They must have listened to it; nobody would say half of what the man said without them attacking or refuting. The United Arab Emirates named some Nigerians sponsoring Boko Haram, but the government doesn\u2019t want to make them public and prosecute them. What is your take on this? They sent the report to the president. Commodore Olawunmi said some of those they accused of are now governors, senators and in Aso Rock. What is the re- ply of the government? The man was on air saying it. Has the presidency replied? When it was reported that the DSS has arrested him, they said they didn\u2019t arrest him but were merely asking him questions. What has happened thereafter? They dare not arrest him because they knew he was speaking the truth. It is the press that re- fused to pick it up from there. Even media commentators refused to say anything thereafter because there is an Executive Order to close down any unfriendly media house. People don\u2019t want to talk because they don\u2019t want to die, but Ayo Adebanjo will want to talk and speak the truth because he wants to die and go to heaven. That is why I\u2019m saying what I\u2019m saying. Southern governors met and resolved to ban open grazing. However, in the states that have enacted anti grazing laws, cows are still seen grazing openly. What do you have to tell these governors? Still the same thing we are talking about. The presidency came out to counter the law through the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, and some Northern governors say they would see how it would be implemented. The state House of Assembly met and passed law, but the Attorney General has the effrontery to query it and to say it cannot be implemented be- cause the police that should implement the law are under the Federal Government. These people are afraid to talk. What advice would you give to these Southern governors? I don\u2019t have any advice for them. Let them play their game as they see it. I did not beg to be in Nigeria because I was not consulted to be in Nigeria. I was born an Ijebu man and a Yoruba man. My father was born before 1914 as a Yoruba man. So he was not a party to Nigeria. The British bound us together under conditions. The moment you renege on the conditions or agreement to stay together; what next? It is to separate, except our people are afraid to speak because they want to get freedom on a platter, including the Igbo, who are now praising Buhari. He went to Imo State and some people started hailing him that he has done well.",

          "title": "Incompetence, Impunity And Inordinate Ambition Brought Us Here By Sesugh Akume",
          "text": "Public institutions and officers exist to solve problems. Many times they don\u2019t and therefore we have a country going nowhere, but it becomes even worse when they rather create problems for us. Inability to do one\u2019s work or do it well is called \u2018incompetence\u2019. Such a person is incompetent. Presently, the institution, and individual leading this charge in Nigeria by their incompetence causing the country great pain is the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and its governor, Godwin Emefiele, both of whom have not only been grossly incompetent, but have created more problems for the country and its citizens, and have done so with impunity!\n\nIt isn\u2019t enough or okay to state this as an opinion, it becomes critical for an independent, disinterested, and just arbiter to interrogate the issues and grant a verdict, for the record, and to arrest the slide.\n\nTo be sure, the number 1 role (of 5 principal roles) of the CBN is to ensure monetary and price stability. It\u2019s the CBN governor\u2019s role to run the Bank effectively to achieve its mandate. This, Emefiele himself, emphasised in his inaugural address on 5 June 2014, when he first took office, that his personal vision and number 1 assignment as CBN governor was price control. This he reiterated in 2019 when his 5-year tenure was renewed. If, therefore, there has been growing inflation with skyrocketing prices, a weakened currency losing its international value, we need not look at Lord Lugard and the Amalgamation, the circumstances of the Independence in 1960, the global cost of crude oil, or any other external factors first, as the cause of our woes. A public institution and officer, whose job it is to prevent such has failed and/or is failing at their job, other factors notwithstanding. It\u2019s this simple!\n\nSesugh Akume\n\nHow we Got Here\n\nAs of the time Godwin Emefiele took office, the official naira/US dollar exchange rate was N155/$1, so he saidhimself in his inaugural speech, but as of Thursday 23 September, it closed at N413.63 at the Investor & Exporter forex (foreign exchange) window (a 166.86% increase). Inflation, he said, was at 7.9% (a 6-year low at the time) but grew under him to 18.17% as of last March, according to the CBN itself. Bad, inconsistent and contradictory policies; haphazard implementation, politics, incompetence, illegality, impunity brought us here. A few illustrations should suffice:\n\nOn 23 June 2015, the Bank under Emefiele banned 41(later expanded to 44) items from importation, meaning forex couldn\u2019t be accessed for these at the official rate. Those who required them were asked to access the dollar at the parallel (black) market. These aren\u2019t allluxury consumables or finished products. On this list are materials for needed for construction, manufacturing,and so on, which are not, and some cannot be sourced in Nigeria. By making it impossible to access forex at the official rate for these, it meant paying higher at the parallel market. Higher costs of accessing raw material translated into higher production costs translating intohigher cost of the products, and, therefore, an increase in price of goods.\n\nTwo months ago, on 27 July, the CBN turned around to frustrate the parallel market and those who rely on it byannouncing that it had stopped providing forex to the parallel market, and in fact, just recently during his disastrous press conference last week, Emefieleboasted that he didn\u2019t recognise the parallel market. How then does he expect manufacturers to access forexfor imported raw materials which are on the list of 44 items, for instance? With forex scarcity and increasing pressure on it, imagine what becomes of its price. It should, therefore, surprise no one that the black market rate of the US dollar recently hit N575/$1, as any observer would be able to assess what is likely to come in the days ahead. What becomes of products in the market should surprise no one either.\n\nOn this list of 44 banned items is milk. Nigeria produces the lowest quality and quantity of milk per cow in the world, a measly 2 litres/day of 19 million heads of cattle (not all of them are female, milk-producing, by the way). The global standard is 10-15 litres/day, with Kenya, for instance, having the capacity for up 70 litres/day.Clearly, what we produce isn\u2019t enough for the young andincreasing population. Banning importation to make up for what we can\u2019t produce now makes milk, needed for child nutrition, expensive and out of the reach of many, along with its consequences.\n\nAt its 126th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, the CBN decried the increasing debt the country was piling. Emefiele said, \u2018\u2026mounting public debt remains a headwind to economic growth. The huge concerns expressed in the last MPC meeting about the increase in the total public debt remain unabated.\u2019 Yet, this same individual has been illegally lending to the federal government trillions of naira every year, to the extent that the loans grew from N648 million in 2015 to N15.51 trillion as of the last count this year!\n\nA Culture of Anyhowness Where Professionalism is Required\n\nSection 1(3) of the Act says the Bank is independent, but it is in reality everything but that. The problem lies in the Act itself, and wrong precedent of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi\u2019s removal by then president, Goodluck Jonathan, an unprecedented violation anywhere, but Emefiele has taken his subservience to a ridiculous level. Hesupported Buhari\u2019s controversial closure of land borders in the south, a policy Buhari was to later eat humble pie and admit was ill advised. That was none of Emefiele\u2019sbusiness. Border closure or not is not his role or the Bank.\n\nWhen the State Security Services (SSS) physically went after bureau de change operators in an ostensible attempt to defend the naira, Emefiele supported it. Using brute force to protect any currency is strange, and noinvestor wants anything doing in such an environment. Following the #EndSARS protests, Emefiele had bank accounts of suspected protesters sealed by the courts of bogus, malicious charges. This was not his job and was none of his business. These are some ways he has reduced the Bank and the office of the CBN governor into a political tool of the regime, thereby eroding the independence of the Bank, contrary to section 1(3) of the CBN Act.\n\nThe shameful act of scapegoating a website and threatening its founder was just pathetic. Is it not embarrassing that a mere website was being made to seem more formidable than an entire central bank of a country in determining the strength of ots currency? Is Nigeria a banana republic? Well, the website no longer publishes forex rates but the naira is still sliding. It shows that Emefiele didn\u2019t know what he was saying and the responsibility for the crashing naira and whose failure it is, lies elsewhere, certainly not with the website.\n\nLending to the government above 5% of the previous year\u2019s revenues is expressly forbidden by the CBN Act(under Ways and Means) in section 38(2). Section 38(3) says the loans to the federal government must be paid by year end and no further loans are to be advanced until what was loaned is paid. Both provisions are routinely flouted, with dire consequences on the naira and the economy. In 2020, Emefiele and the Bank lent N2.8 trillion representing 62% of 2019 revenues, and plan to continue doing so. This has its grave consequences.\n\nIt\u2019s clear, the CBN and Emefiele\u2019s inconsistent and bad policies, incompetence and politics, as well as their law breaking, and how this cause the mess we are in. Any other factor is at best an addition, not the main cause(s).\n\nApproaching the Courts\n\nIt\u2019s to avoid this issue left to speculation and all manner of analyses and opinions expressed, without a uniform definite stand, that we approached the Federal High Court. Abuja, in Sesugh Akume v. Central Bank of Nigeria & Godwin Emefiele, marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1051/2021, with strong corroborating evidence on oath by my good friends Samson GaladimaSimon, and Tosin Adeoti, global economy watchers and well-regarded financial sector experts and analysts, inviting the court to kindly look at what is before it and determine these issues once and for all, so that they\u2019re no longer up for speculation or opinion depending on where/how one leans.\n\nWe want the court to determine whether the CBN and Emefiele have been grossly incompetent or not, and whether this has caused us the mess we are in or not; whether instead of solving our problems when public institutions or officers fail to do so but rather cause us problems, they can be held accountable or liable, or not? These may not be usual prayers in court, but worth it. It is our firm belief that we have been underutilisingthe courts, as the law has many more functions in fixing our society, than the traditional ones of interpreting the law alone, and must do otherwise henceforth.\n\nWe ask the court to determine whether Bank lending tofederal government beyond 5% of the prior year\u2019s revenues is a violation of section 38(2) of the CBN Act, or not and whether lending further when previous loans are unpaid is a violation and abuse, or not. It\u2019s not enough to talk about it, let the courts decide once and for all. The only order we ask is for the court to stop the CBN from further lending to the federal government until the N15 trillion naira owed it is fully refunded, and to never lend beyond 5% of the previous year\u2019s revenues.\n\nThe Governance Benefits of this Effort\n\nThe suit also seeks to raise some broader questions and challenge some of the numerous inconsistencies in the Act itself. For instance, section 52 says the CBN and its officers cannot be sued for their incompetence in doing or failing to do their jobs, but does this include when they break the law also? Section 11 states when officers shall cease to hold office for violating the Act (not the focus of this suit). How then can the court determine whether there is a violation or not when the very Act says they can\u2019t be sued in the first place? If any provisions of the Act are non-justiciable, as there are in the Constitution, and the Bank with its officers have immunity from prosecution, why then do we have thesections in the first place? What incentives or consequences are there in obeying or violating them?\n\nThe Act makes it possible for the CBN governor to determine who sits on the Bank\u2019s board, and the MPC both of which s/he is the chairman. What safeguards are there to prevent having only yes men/women on eitheror both? If the governor is wrong on an issue, the institution should be resilient enough to protect the system to avoid error. As it is now, Emefiele\u2019sincompetence, impunity and lawlessness is the Bank\u2019s. It shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nSection 1(3) says the Bank is independent, yet in several sections the Act places the finance minister above the CBN governor and makes him/her answerable to the minister (who is in charge of fiscal policy NOT monetary policy) on matters of monetary policy which the CBN is in charge. It also makes the CBN subject to the president and his/her whims and caprices even on matters s/he may have no competence. The president approves (or not) decisions of the CBN, thereby eroding the independence of the Bank, yet another strange, unprecedented practice in central banking the world over.\n\nThe suit hopes to have these addressed, and willy-nilly will, whichever direction the verdict of the court goes in the end. We believe that the Central Bank of Nigeria as an institution will ultimately be better served by the determination of this suit; and we would have taken another step in deepening the trust levels in the social contract between the citizens and public institutions created to serve us all. A date is yet to be fixed for the hearing.\n\nSesugh Akume, a public policy analyst, wrote from Abuja. He tweets @sesugh_akume, and is reached via [email protected]",
          "summary": "Bad, inconsistent and contradictory policies; haphazard implementation, politics, incompetence, illegality, impunity brought us here.\nWhen the State Security Services (SSS) physically went after bureau de change operators in an ostensible attempt to defend the naira, Emefiele supported it.\nFollowing the #EndSARS protests, Emefiele had bank accounts of suspected protesters sealed by the courts of bogus, malicious charges.\nIn 2020, Emefiele and the Bank lent N2.8 trillion representing 62% of 2019 revenues, and plan to continue doing so.\nSesugh Akume, a public policy analyst, wrote from Abuja.",

The first problem, of course, is assuming that we are an oil-rich country.\n\n\u201cAnd this has always been the big joke for me. I remembered in 2011 when we were talking about the fuel subsidy debate when President Jonathan rightfully wanted to remove the fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cI said to people we are producing two million barrels of crude oil for 160 million Nigerians, that is one barrel for 80 people. Saudi Arabia produces one barrel for three citizens. That is a rich country.\n\n\u201cYou are producing one barrel for 80 and your share of the revenue of that barrel, maybe half, so you are producing one barrel for 160 people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese people (referring to Nigerians) need education, they need healthcare, they need infrastructure, they need electricity, they need telecommunications, they need agriculture and you decide that what they need more than anything else is cheap fuel. That does not make sense.\u201d\n\nHe argued that successive administrations continue payment of fuel subsidies because some people in power are making billions of naira from the scheme.\n\nThe former CBN governor also alleged that most of the numbers from the country\u2019s importation of petrol are \u201cphantom\u201d, stressing that \u201ca lot of the petroleum subsidy that will say, it being paid is from phantom fuel that never came into this country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe only reason it makes sense is that there are a number of people who control the levers of power, who are making billions and billions of dollars out of this scam that is called fuel subsidy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOtherwise, there is no reason why government after the government will continue, when the argument is clear that the damage to the economy is clear.\n\n\u201cWe have this scheme called the subsidy, which is really a scam, and practically everything that comes in, goes right back out \u2014 to import petroleum products and pay subsidies on those products.

Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling. Our passion, commitment, and experiences will stand us in good stead as we embark on this journey. Welcome to LAN, the next chapter.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "The website of Nigeria\u2019s official digital currency, eNaira, went live on Monday, four days before its planned launch on October 1, as disclosed by Central Bank governor, Godwin Emefiele.\n\nDeveloped by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the apex bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria.\n\nA welcome note on the website describes the eNaira as a \u201cCentral Bank of Nigeria-issued digital currency that provides a unique form of money denominated in Naira.\u201d\n\nThe website is a central repository where users can find comprehensive information about the official digital currency, but it offers much more than just details of the eNaira. TechCabal reviewed the website and here are at least five other things Nigerians can do on the platform.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n1. Download the eNaira application\n\nThe eNaira app (termed \u201cSpeed\u201d) can be downloaded from either the Google PlayStore, Apple App Store, or by scanning a QR code on the website. The app is expected to be available for download from October 1, 2021, and will serve as the official wallet for smartphone users.\n\n2. Manage your wallet\n\neNaira users will be able to fund and manage funds in their wallets on the website once the digital currency is officially rolled out on October 1. According to information on the platform, the wallet offers a \u201cgreat way of making purchases with retailers on-site, transferring or sending money\u201d. The e-wallet can also be linked to bank accounts and used for pay-as-you-go services.\n\n3. Join the eNaira community\n\nThe community is a social hub where, according to a note on the website, eNaira users across the globe can connect with one another, share their experiences using the digital currency, offer as well as request help.\n\nThere are four community rooms, each designed to host conversations about eNaira regulations, merchants, wallet, and registrations. Nigerians who are interested in joining the community can sign up using their email addresses.\n\n4. Stay up to date with news on CBDCs\n\nThe news hub on the website curates content relating to the eNaira and other Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) across the world for users to stay updated with relevant developments on official digital currencies.\n\n\u201cCBDCs are being developed all over the world for differing national objectives. Being an eNaira user naturally transports you to the world of CBDCs and this space is your guide to that world,\u201d a note on the website reads.\n\n5. Read and share eNaira insights and experiences\n\nNigerians who choose to put their experiences with the eNaira in writing or want to share important insights can reach out to the authorities and have their feedback published on the Insights/Users Speak page of the website.\n\nThe eNaira website is loaded with very important information and instructions as well as answers to potential questions in the FAQ section. It\u2019s generally a good foundation to build on, ahead of the official launch of the digital currency on Friday.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "#TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, Nigerians have been promised the lifting of the four-month-long Twitter ban. After the last promise in August of \u2018a few days\u2019 given by the Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, President Muhammadu Buhari, in his Independence Day speech, today mentioned that the ban would be lifted conditionally based on the fulfilment of some obligations by the social media giant.\n\nRecall that in early June 2021, the Nigerian government indefinitely suspended Twitter after the platform removed a Tweet by the president for violating its rules. An infringement on citizens\u2019 right to free speech, this move has drawn reactions from human rights advocacy groups across the country.\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), for instance, filed an appeal at the ECOWAS court in Abuja asking the court to order the president to lift the ban. However, recent developments show that the case has been adjourned for final judgement on January 20, 2022.\n\nSo far, the government claims that the global tech company is only partially cooperating and hasn\u2019t fully met its demands. To that end, it is awaiting a response on three final requests made to the social media platform, which are registration, physical presence in Nigeria, and fair taxation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all these, Twitter hasn\u2019t given any official comment on the negotiations. In the meantime, the economic impact of the ban on the country keeps piling. As of August 2021, the country had lost over $360 million to the ban.\n\nIt goes without saying that citizens have found ways to circumvent the situation using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), an act the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, considers a crime and has threatened to prosecute defaulters.\n\nNot ignoring the contention that came with this move, it is essential to explore how possible it may be for Twitter to meet these requirements.\n\nAre these demands hard to meet?\n\nOn the surface, these demands are pretty simple. After all, it appears to be what the social media company would have agreed to before establishing an office in any country. Case in point, its entrance into Africa in April 2021 and the surprising choice of Ghana.\n\nBased on Twitter\u2019s comment, the decision was based on shared values \u2014 Ghana supports free speech, online freedom, and the open Internet.\n\nTrue to this, the country is one of the African countries without any case of Internet censorship or government-influenced social media censorship. Besides, Ghana currently ranks 30th on the World Press Freedom Index compared to Nigeria\u2019s 120th and Ethiopia\u2019s 101st.\n\nOn closer inspection, these aren\u2019t traits that the Nigerian government has exhibited in the past. There have been reported cases of the government slamming fines on media houses for using user-generated content (UGC) obtained from citizens\u2019 social media accounts in their reportage and tagging verified news reports from online media platforms as \u2018fake news.\u2019\n\nAlso, there is the issue of trust. And this can\u2019t be forced; it has to be earned. This Forbes article helps express the thoughts about opening an office overseas better. One of them is clearly understanding the law of the land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, it appears Twitter\u2019s delay in reaching a compromise with the Nigerian government might be more in consideration of the government\u2019s motive and possible implications on the citizens and other global tech companies.\n\nWith a physical office, any move the government isn\u2019t comfortable with may cause closure or worse.\n\nIn January 2019, the Nigerian military raided the Daily Trust office and detained some staff on the allegation that it published an article that divulged classified military information related to planned attacks against Boko Haram and thus undermined national security.\n\nStill, Gbenga Sesan, Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, told Techpoint Africa that the decision is up to Twitter to make. However, he believes such a move isn\u2019t warranted.\n\nShould you worry?\n\n\u201cThis is one of the government\u2019s ways of doubling down. The truth is, this is not just about Twitter; it is clearly an agenda to retain and expand control,\u201d Sesan commented when asked about what the motive behind the ban is.\n\nHe also opined that the move to categorise Over-the-Top (OTT) services as broadcasters and make them liable under the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) Act is uncalled for. This means that WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix would have to apply to the Corporation to request a licence to operate in the country.\n\nBut what is surprising, according to Sesan, is that the government didn\u2019t reveal the details of the licence. In his defence, these platforms are only intermediaries.\n\nApparently, this is not the first time this move has been made in Nigeria. The first two times \u2014 2017 and 2019 \u2014 it was the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC)\u2019s call. Major players kicked against it, although telecommunication operators supported the government in this instance.\n\nAs clearly stated in a previous article, taking these licences will set the modalities for the provision of these services in Nigeria and would allow NCC to exercise some control over OTT services which is not currently in place.\n\nIf it\u2019s any consolation\u2026\n\nAll over the world, the OTT services marketplace is still nascent. But that does not change the fact that there is a need for some regulation. While some nations already have regulatory oversight in place \u2014 the United Kingdom, Turkey, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, India, Saudi Arabia, and Kenya \u2014 others are seriously considering putting relevant laws in place. And interestingly, these platforms are often categorised as broadcasters.\n\nProtests against these types of regulatory regimes often happen when the government does not have clearly defined rules to guide them in enforcing the laws or when the government has displayed strongarm tactics in similar circumstances in the past.\n\nIt is important to note that there are either two motives for regulations, to increase government control and to enforce strict censorship or to create a level playing ground for both online and offline players. Sadly, this is common in African and Asian countries.\n\nFor instance, when Netflix launched in Kenya in 2018, it was banned for two weeks by the government, after which the on-demand video streaming platform was told to get a filming license. At the moment, the country already has a digital tax in place.\n\nCurrently, not only are global companies obliged to abide by laws and taxed by the countries they are registered in, but they might also be subject to foreign laws whether they are present physically or not.\n\nIn Sesan\u2019s opinion, although the Nigerian judiciary is not entirely independent, he trusts activist judges to do their work to give sound judgement on the current state of trampling on citizens\u2019 right to information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are purchased and sold online \u2014 usually using cryptocurrency \u2014 and are typically encoded with the same software as many cryptos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough they have been around since 2014, NFTs are gaining popularity as a popular way to buy and sell digital artwork.\n\nI know you\u2019re curious about NFTs, and our Reporter, Joy, has got you covered. She addressed three critical NFT questions that you might have.\n\nCheck them out here: 3 crucial questions about NFTs answered\n\nYou may also want to take a look at this: From designing album covers for Adekunle Gold and Blaqbonez, Anthony Azekwoh took a chance on NFTs and made a killing\n\nMIT to test 3D-printing for prosthetic limbs in Sierra Leone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Moininah Sengeh working on prostheses\n\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s (MIT) new bionics centre \u2014 K.

The population of people with amputated limbs in Sierra Leone grows each year, with less than 10% currently benefiting from functional prostheses, according to MIT.\n\nHow will this be done? According to a statement by MIT, researchers will field-test a system that uses a mobile clinic to 3D-print and deliver customised prosthetics to disabled people.\n\nThe project, which aims to provide patients in medically underserved communities with access to prostheses, is one of four priorities for the research centre, established with $24 million in funding from philanthropist, Lisa Yang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2Africa Cable to connect 3 billion people to a faster Internet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, September 28th, 2021, Facebook announced that its 2Africa Cable, one of the world\u2019s largest subsea projects, would connect three continents \u2014 Africa, Europe, and Asia \u2014 with the addition of nine landings labelled the \u201c2Africa Pearls,\u201d allowing more people to connect to faster Internet.\n\nAccording to Facebook, when they are completed, the extension will make 2Africa the world\u2019s longest subsea cable system. It will break the current record of 39,000 kilometres set by the SEA-ME-WE 3 line, which connects 33 countries in South East Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe.\n\nThe 2Africa Pearls branch now includes new terrestrial connections via Egypt, Bahrain, India, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nPer the social media giant, with the addition of the Pearls extension, the system aims to connect an additional 1.8 billion people, bringing the total to 3 billion people spread across 33 countries, accounting for 36% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook announced plans to build a $1 billion undersea Internet cable for faster Internet access in Africa.\n\nAnd in August 2021, 2Africa extended the cable\u2019s connectivity to Seychelles, Angola, the Comoro Islands, and a new landing in South-East Nigeria.\n\nFor context on Subsea Internet Cables in Africa, please, read: Subsea Internet cables and the race to connect Africa to the Internet\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nGoogle Maps is making it easier to see wildfires and tree coverage.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF NIGERIA\u2019S SIXTY FIRST INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY, FRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER, 2021.\n\nCitizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty first Independence Anniversary.\n\n2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n49. The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n50. We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n51. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n52. To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance ground water supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n62. The sea ports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies have been slower than expected.\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System as well as the conversion of the Lillypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n65. We hope our present efforts to ensure all Nigerians use a National Identification Number as well as our planned roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) network technology will ensure we stay in line with the global innovation curve as a Nation.\n\n66. As we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\n\n67. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n68. However, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n69. Rather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n70. To address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n71. Following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n72. The Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are:\n\na. National Security and Cohesion;\n\nb. Registration, Physical presence and Representation;\n\nc. Fair Taxation;\n\nd. Dispute Resolution; and\n\ne. Local Content.\n\n73. Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n74. As a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety.\n\n75. Nigeria\u2019s progressive diplomacy continues to manifest through growing numbers of highly placed Nigerians in positions of regional and global influences. Very recently, Nigeria won election for the position of Commissioner for the expanded Political, Peace and Security Affairs of the African Union.\n\n76. Our persistent calls for a reorganized and reformed ECOWAS, to make the organization citizens-sensitive, paid off with the acceptance by the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS to commence the agreed reforms in the organization ahead of the next elections of the organization\u2019s principal officers in December this year.\n\n77. At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n79. Considering the positive impact of our Social Investment Programs, I recently approved an increase in the number of N-Power program beneficiaries from 500,000 to 1,000,000.\n\n80. Out of this, 510,000 have started the programme while the competitive selection process for onboarding the outstanding 490,000 beneficiaries is in progress.\n\n81. The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the most poor and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n84. There is widespread discontent and disillusion about the efficiency and probity of our civil service.\n\n85. It is for this reason that we are refocusing the Nigerian Civil Service to provide World class service to run our country.\n\n86. The youths of this great country remain propellants for our today and provide guarantees that we would have a secure tomorrow.\n\n87. It is for this reason that I remain focused on expanding opportunities for their participation in politics and governance.\n\n88. Recent appointments of young people into positions of authority and their track record so far, gives me confidence that we need to bring more of them into governance and this I promise to do.\n\n89. More specifically, to encourage Girl-Child Education, female scholarship schemes, life skills and digital literacy skills to boost girl\u2019s enrolment, retention and completion of schooling, are all initiatives put in place to ensure gender balance in appropriately positioning our youths for positions of leadership.\n\n90. The commitment of this Administration to the well-being of people living with disabilities remains unwavering.\n\n91. Government recognises their contributions to development and I have, in this regard, directed that all relevant Government Agencies pay special attention to the peculiarities of different abilities in the implementation of policies and programmes.\n\n92. Rape and Gender Based Violence remains a sore point in our Nation as in many countries worldwide and this was worsened during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n93. We are currently engaging Heads of Courts to establish Specialised Courts for the speedy and seamless trial of Rape/Gender-Based offences especially to ensure that justice is done for child victims of sexual violence.\n\n94. On the other hand, work has advanced in the reformation, reintegration and reunification of Minors involved in one crime or the other.\n\n95. The reformation in our Correctional Services has manifested in an increase in modernised custodial centres and a transformation from strictly punitive to attitudinal changes so that criminals do not relapse into their previous lifestyle.\n\n96. As we begin to celebrate our sixty one years as a Nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the Federal Government. This country is a great collective where Government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play.\n\n97. In particular, security is a bottom to top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nHarcourt Port \u2013 Rivers State governor, Nyeson Ezenwo Wike says Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) elected governors are working in unison to ensure that the party wins the presidential election in 2023.\n\nHe stated that contrary to the expectation of those who do not wish the party well, all the PDP governors are working hard to ensure the party regains the realm of power in 2023.\n\nThe governor gave this assurance at a reception for chieftains of the All Progressives Congress, including its former spokesperson, Mr. Ogbonna Nwuke; all the 23 local government chairmen of African Action Congress (AAC) who dumped their parties to join the PDP at the Isaac Boro Park, Port Harcourt on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting hard and God willing, PDP will takeover Nigeria in 2023. It is not a question of wishful thinking. It is a question of being committed and we are going to do it. All the governors of (PDP) have agreed, we will do it. PDP will never be divided. All the people who are thinking that PDP will be divided, they have all failed. All those who were trying to sabotage Rivers state, they have all been knocked out.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explained that he was not surprised that Nwuke and others have decided to dump the APC. According to him, those who decamped have merely come to the realisation that cannot continue to be misguided and listen to illusive stories, particularly of the APC.\n\nHe said the people of Rivers state have seen that the PDP means well for them, hence, they have decided to put their fate in the hands of Almighty God first, and then the PDP.\n\nThe governor stated that PDP in the State has never been owned by an individual as is the case with the APC. He assured those who just decamped to the party and others who will join them in the future, that when decision to pick his successor will be made, they will not be excluded.\n\n\u201cEverybody must participate, and then we will take decision. It can be those who are coming now, you never can tell. Nobody can say because you came in yesterday, or because you came in today, you are not entitled. Everybody is entitled as far as PDP is concern.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike reiterated that Nigerians have since realised that APC led government has failed in all sectors. And he challenged the remnants of the APC to mention what Federal government has done for Rivers state in the last six years.\n\nThe governor expressed optimism that the sterling performance of his administration, particularly as it concerns infrastructural and human capacity development, has continued to endear the party to voters in the State.\n\n\u201cNo one project awarded by this administration will remain abandoned before we leave on the 29 May 2023. And then, another PDP government will come and take over from us. Let me assure you, God has already sealed it. Let nobody bother himself, PDP will take over Rivers State again because it is very obvious. Why will PDP take over? We will take over because we have made promises to you and we have fulfilled the promises.\u201d\n\nThe governor further charged all the PDP local government chairmen to ensure that those who just decamped to the party are not alienated.\n\nFormer Rivers State APC spokesperson, Ogbonna Nwuke, said in the last six years they have been in the wilderness.\n\n\u201cWe were promised change, but I will say we did not find change in Etche. All politics is local and I couldn\u2019t stand by, do the fighting and watch those who superintended over the affairs of the APC act in a manner that appeared callous. Accordingly, we have found our way out of wilderness. We have stumbled into light and we have found development partner and that development partner is the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the good road that you built. First, you gave us the Igwuruta-Chokocho dual carriage road. Then you gave us the Udofor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road. And the other day you returned and then you gave us the announcement of the Chokocho-Igbodo Road. Your Excellency, there is jubilation in Etche. I am jubilant myself.\n\n\u201cI am excited. And to tell you the candid truth, there could have been no better news. Today your Excellency, I have come back home . Honestly, there can be nothing better than home. Etche has 205 oil wells, Etche has over 80 percent of gas deposit south of River Niger and Your Excellency, you have already identified our need. the Etche need is access.\u201d\n\nA former member of the House of Representatives, Emma Deeyah, who also dumped the APC, said they were endeared to Governor Wike because of his bold and courageous leadership in the State.\n\nChairman of the PDP in Rivers State, Ambassador Desmond Akawor said all the former APC chieftains and AAC members that decamped to the PDP, were lured to join opposition by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi.\n\nHe remarked that having realised that the APC has nothing to offer the people of the State and Nigerians, they decided to dump the party and all that it represents to join the PDP.\n\nSome members of the APC that decamped to the PDP are former member of House of Representatives, Daemi Akpanah; former member of House of Assembly, Ibiso Nwuche; former Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly, Stephen Ezekwem; former Commissioner of Works, Levy Braide; former member of House of Assembly, Emmanuel Okata; former chairman, Rivers State Civil Service Commission, Ngo Martins-Yellowe; Goodlife Nmekini, former Special Adviser to Governor Chibuike Amaechi; Dr. Barinedum Nwibere, former Director General, Cole/Giadom campaign organisation among others.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBritish care home workers who are not prepared to get the COVID vaccine should \u201cget out and get another job,\u2019\u2019 Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Saturday.\n\nMr Javid brushed off appeals from providers to pause the legal requirement for staff in England to be fully vaccinated, amid warnings some homes will be unable to cope if workers are forced to leave.\n\nNadra Ahmed, chair of the National Care Association, has urged the government to put back the November 11, deadline for staff to have both jabs, saying it will have a knock-on effect on the National Health Service (NHS) if homes have to reduce resident numbers.\n\nBut in an uncompromising message to staff, Mr Javid said they should not be working in the sector if they were not prepared to be vaccinated.\n\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \u201cIf you want to work in a care home you are working with some of the most vulnerable people in our country and if you cannot be bothered to go and get vaccinated, then get out and go and get another job.\n\n\u201cIf you want to look after them, if you want to cook for them, if you want to feed them, if you want to put them to bed, then you should get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIf you are not going to get vaccinated then why are you working in care?\n\n\u201cIf you think about your elderly relatives you might have in care homes, and the idea that someone wants to look after them and they don\u2019t want to take a perfectly safe and effective vaccine that has been approved by our regulators, been used all over the world, because somehow they have got some objection to this vaccine, then really, honestly, they shouldn\u2019t be in our care homes.\n\n\u201cThey should go and get another job. I am very clear on that.\u2019\u2019\n\nMr Ahmed said care homes have already overcome significant resistance among staff to the vaccines.\n\nIn November 2020, shortly before the vaccine programme launched, she said just 40 per cent of staff had said they would get it.\n\nBut 86 per cent of staff were now fully vaccinated, she said.\n\nShe told Today: \u201cwe are not anti-vaccine. What we are saying is we needed a bit more time to get people where they needed to be.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe said that without a delay to the deadline, the consequences for care homes and for the wider health sector will be severe.\n\n\u201cThe situation is chronic now with staffing and that deadline will just add to it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe will have providers who are no longer able to staff their services safely and that can only mean they will have to be handing back contracts.\n\n\u201cThey will have to be looking at whether they can minimise the number of beds that they use to keep themselves open, which will have a direct effect on the NHS\u2019s ability to discharge people out of hospital and into care settings.\u2019\u2019(dpa/NAN)",

          "text": "Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited brought together a caste of leading industry experts to dimension the digital transformation of the financial services space with a keen focus on the Nigerian capital market at its inaugural NGX TechNovation Conference. The virtual event with the theme, Technology, Platforms and Markets held on Thursday, 30 September 2021 and featured critical discussions around technology, partnerships and innovation that can boost the advancement of the Nigerian economy.\n\nSpeaking during the conference, the Chief Executive Officer, NGX, Mr. Temi Popoola, CFA noted, \u201cThe conference is particularly important to us at NGX because we have stepped into an era that signals a new horizon of opportunities. NGX is a technology powerhouse that leverages smart business models to deliver vertical platforms across capital formation, investment, capacity building, market development and a plethora of other services within the capital markets ecosystem. We are committed to developing innovative solutions that drive, not just internal efficiency at the exchange but that support wider efforts by various stakeholders at ensuring a full digitalization of the Nigerian capital markets. We are extending our platform competencies in line with our strategic aspirations while leveraging best in class digital innovation to deliver value to our stakeholders and markets.\u201d\n\nIn giving his goodwill message at TechNovation, the Director General, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mr. Lamido Yuguda stated, \u201cI would like to begin by commending Mr. Temi Popola, CEO, NGX and his team for putting together and event like this which shows our resilience as a people and ability to face challenges. The theme of today\u2019s conference, Technology, Platforms and Markets indeed captures the mood in world today and the inevitable coming together of the three segments in view of the COVID-19 pandemic which has forced us all to stretch possibilities and adopt new ways of performing our functions. These recent shifts certainly pose a challenge and a huge opportunity to both financial sector regulators and conventional financial services providers like NGX. It is, therefore, important that we facilitate conversations like this to ensure we strike the right balance between innovation, integrity and protection of investors, without whom there will be no markets\u201d.\n\nThis was immediately followed by the keynote address delivered by Co-Founder and CEO, Flutterwave, Olugbenga Agboola, who noted, \u201cAs of today, we are in the information age where technology is leapfrogging every business model and infrastructure we can think about. This has of course facilitated growth that we see across the landscape in different terrains. A key driver in the proliferation of technology solutions in Nigeria has been mobile penetration and we expect to see continued growth in this regard. Against the backdrop of evolving solutions, African startups have raised over $1Billion in funding which is unprecedented for technology companies. The industry must however recognise that funders and regulators are the biggest stakeholders that must work together to drive digitalisaton across Africa and provide a platform for capital raising and global recognition for Nigerian companies at all stages.\u201d\n\nThe event also featured a presentation from President, Africa Fintech Network, Dr. Segun Aina who commented thus, \u201cI commend NGX Limited for putting this conference together, as it shows continued commitment to digital initiatives that can reposition and improve the Nigerian Capital Market and ensure its leadership position not only in Africa and across the world. I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of NGX to the Fintech Association of Nigeria of which it is an early member and continues to contribute and leverage on its membership and also support the growth of the Nigerian capital market.\u201d\n\nNGX TechNovation was a truly inspired event with two panel sessions that provided insights into a wide spectrum of topics. The first panel session themed, The Path to Exponential Growth \u2013 New Technology, Platforms, Emerging Markets, highlighted, the need for stakeholders to take a proactive and deliberate approach to building infrastructure that will support the growth of technology companies and the adoption of innovative solutions in operating businesses and creating value within the industry. The panel featured Founder & General Partner, Future Africa, Iyin Aboyeji; Partner, McKinsey & Company, Topsy Kola-Oyeneyin; Country Manager, Opay Nigeria,; Divisional Head, Listings Business, NGX, Mr. Olumide Bolumole; with Director, Frontier/SSA Banks & FinTech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital, Adesoji Solanke serving as moderator.\n\nThe second session of the day focused on the topic, Beyond Tech \u2013 Partnerships, Business Models, Innovation, Data and Regulation and highlighted the interconnectedness of stakeholders within the business ecosystem that requires extensive stakeholder engagement and forward thinking partnership and collaborations to harness the competitive advantage across the spectrum. Speakers on the panel were Executive Commissioner (Operations), Securities and Exchange Commission, Dayo Obisan; Founding Partner, Ventures Platform, Kola Aina; Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, F10, Andreas Itern; Senior Ambassador, Seedstars Nigeria, Alessia Balducci; Partner, Microtraction, Chidinma Iwueke; with Chief Customer Experience Officer, Interswitch Group, Oremeyi Akah as moderator.\n\nShowcasing NGX\u2019s technology investments over the years, NGX TechNovation featured a video production on the array of products and services NGX provides leveraging technology for the benefit of its various stakeholder groups. This video along with the full recording of the event is available for viewing on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/c/NGXGroup.",

          "title": "Fintech 5.0: Evaluating How First Bank Strengthens Collaboration",
          "text": "It was Sir Isaac Newton, in his letter to Robert Hooke in 1675, who wrote the now-famous quote: \u201cIf I have seen further (than others), it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d\n\nThe shoulders of giants Sir Newton referred to has to do with leverage provided by the discoveries and experiences of people who have gone before or walked that same path earlier, that pave the way for and enable other people and a new generation to take things to a totally new dimension.\n\nThe truth is, giants whose shoulders provide such leverage to the next generation can be found in various fields and various nations. In Nigeria, for example, such giants exist in various fields and they are known and recognised.\n\nTake the fintech (financial technology) space in Nigeria, where one bank is known to have stood as a giant with very broad shoulders, having capacities that have been built up and accumulated over 127 continuous years. Every year since 2016 (apart from 2017 when it was implementing ideas from 2016, including a Digital Innovation Lab), this well-recognised bank has provided a platform for the most robust engagement of the fintech industry in Nigeria. Tagged Fintech Summit, the annual engagement has continued to help in catalysing the fintech sector to ever-higher levels from year to year.\n\nHeld in Lagos the commercial capital of Nigeria and arguably the fintech capital of Africa, given Nigeria\u2019s status as the leading nation in the fintech space in Africa, the annual FirstBank Fintech Summit has attracted an average of a thousand participants, who are mostly fintech owners, workers and enthusiasts, yearly. Last year\u2019s Summit, Fintech Summit 4.0 with the theme\n\n\u201cHow Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence will Disrupt Fintech in Nigeria\u201d, however, drew an unprecedented number of participants \u2013 over 6,000 from across 52 different countries. It was the first virtual Summit due to the restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic and it featured as keynote speaker Silicon Valley-based innovator of international repute, Chinedu Echeruo, who founded HopStop that was later sold to Apple for US$1 billion. Imagine the inspiration, dreams and aspirations young people soak up while listening to speakers with such a profile.\n\nFar from being one-directional \u2013 with all the talk flowing from only the speaker to the audience \u2013 the yearly Summit is actually a platform for multidimensional engagement involving various stakeholders in the fintech industry \u2013 operators, regulators, investors, enthusiasts, fintech journalists and writers, bankers, et cetera.\n\nIt offers an unequalled opportunity for networking among fintech and other stakeholders, leading to opportunities for collaboration within the community. For small businesses and start-ups powered by FirstBank\u2019s support, the annual Summit has been a veritable platform for showcasing them. The platform has also served for the announcement of policy initiatives coupled with pronouncements that provide clarifications to policy. This is due to invitations extended to regulators and the important role they are assigned in conversations facilitated during the Summit.\n\nThe Summit that preceded last year\u2019s, i.e., the third edition of Fintech Summit 3.0 held in 2019, featured another heavyweight in Nigeria\u2019s fintech industry, Victor Asemota, founder of Swifta Systems & Services, as keynote speaker. The theme \u201cBanking + Tech = Solving Real Problems\u201d, included panel sessions featuring experts with over two hundred combined years of experience in both the financial and technological industries.\n\nThey applied their knowledge, expertise and experience to address challenges in the technologically-driven business world, structured in terms of Solving Business Problems; Solving Regulatory, Security and Legal Problems; and Solving Lifestyle Problems. At the end of the Summit, participants must have felt that the Summit delivered on the confidence the Chief Executive Officer of FirstBank, Adesola Adeduntan, had expressed when he remarked in his welcome address, \u201cI am optimistic that every organisation represented here will be empowered to provide services with greater speed and solve real societal problems to the advantage of the Nigerian populace through the insights that will be gained from this event.\u201c\n\nFintech Summit 3.0 had built on the success of the second edition, Fintech Summit 2.0 held in 2018, which had \u201cThe Future of Banking \u2013 The Role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data\u201d as a theme. Adia Sowho, the Managing Director of Mines in Nigeria, had, as the first keynote speaker, stressed the importance of collaboration between legacy banks and fintechs in the overall good of their shared financial services space. The Deputy Managing Director of FirstBank, Gbenga Shobo, had, in his welcome address, said that FirstBank was committed to finding the right balance in its approach in supporting the budding fintech industry. It is gratifying that the bank has since found that right balance and pushed ahead enthusiastically with the continual annual engagement that is its yearly Fintech Summit.\n\nFor those who like to bring up the argument that deposit money banks (DMBs) and fintech are rivals competing in the same space for the same customers and wonder why FirstBank, a leading deposit money bank, would itself be involved in efforts to catalyse the fintech industry, they need to wake up and smell the coffee. FirstBank is continuously evolving and staying on the cutting edge of technology in order to better serve its customers, who are themselves evolving and adapting to newer and more efficient and convenient technologies as they become available.\n\nAnd FirstBank is on a journey to a future where it is happy, in the spirit of the African tradition of Ubuntu, to take all fintech along with it. In the words of another famous quote, \u201cThe sky is too big for two [or many] big birds flying in it to collide.\u201d FirstBank believes there is ample room for all players \u2013 deposit money banks, fintech, et cetera \u2013 to fulfil their unique roles. Therefore, collaboration, not competition, is FirstBank\u2019s watchword. And FirstBank considers fintech partners in progress in its avowed commitment to driving financial inclusion.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s own evolution and the transition is causing some people to question its continuous classification by the Central Bank as a deposit money bank (with a preponderance of bricks-and-mortar banking operations) rather than a digital bank. And the reasons for their argument cannot be easily waved aside. In 2020, for example, over 85 per cent of the banking transactions that were required by customers of FirstBank were performed on the bank\u2019s self-service channels.\n\nThat means customers of the bank only needed the attention of the bank\u2019s staff or branches for just 15 per cent of all the banking transactions they required in 2020. There are now as many as over 16 million customers between FirstBank\u2019s digital channels of online banking (called FirstOnline), mobile banking (christened FirstMobile) and USSD banking (called *894# quick banking).\n\nBetween FirstOnline and FirstMobile, a growth of 21 per cent in the user base was experienced in 2020. Customers on both platforms conducted approximately 256 million transactions worth N15.7 trillion in the same year. FirstOnline, as of June 2021, had an impressive 597,466 customers on the service, a 17 per cent growth on the previous year and 578,292 transactions per month, averaging a value of N388 billion per month.\n\nFor FirstMobile, besides the impressive gain in numbers, it gained recognition as \u201cBest Mobile Banking App\u201d at the Global Finance Best Digital Bank Awards, for providing excellent self-service through its user-friendly app. FirstMobile had, as of June 2021, 4,596,203 users on the platform, which is a nine per cent growth on the previous year and an average of 27,730,830 transactions every month. While these numbers point to the giant statue of the bank, none of it excites FirstBank as much as Firstmonie, because of its invaluable role in driving financial inclusion at the grassroots level, one of FirstBank\u2019s overriding commitments.\n\nFirstmonie, the agent banking network of FirstBank, currently has over 130,000 agents across the country, making it the largest bank-led agent network anywhere in Africa. As the foremost financial inclusion service in the country, it has achieved over 750 million transactions worth N15 trillion (about US$30 billion) processed from inception to date.\n\nOver 295 million of those transactions with a total value of N6.65 trillion were processed in 2020 alone \u2013 the same year COVID-19 caused widespread disruptions across the globe. Firstmonie agency banking scheme has empowered agents across all Local Government Areas in the country, providing employment to thousands of people.\n\nFirstBank through the Firstmonie platform further supports the fintech industry via partnership collaborations with local and international fintechs. All these are geared towards expanding financial inclusion and providing a variety of services to customers of the bank with giant shoulders that customers and fintechs can stand on to see further.\n\nAs for Sir Isaac Newton, the giant of a scientist whose famous quote began this piece, if he could read us from the grave, he would feel very proud today to see that celebrated line from his 1675 letter being aptly used to represent the relationship that exists between the broad, energetic and dynamic shoulders of Nigeria\u2019s banking behemoth, FirstBank, and the rapidly emerging beautiful bride of Nigeria\u2019s economic sectors, the fintech industry. This relationship climaxes every year in the annual Fintech Summit and the forthcoming Fintech Summit 5.0 promises to take the relationship to a whole new dimension.\n\nBusinessDay",
          "summary": "Tagged Fintech Summit, the annual engagement has continued to help in catalysing the fintech sector to ever-higher levels from year to year.\nLast year\u2019s Summit, Fintech Summit 4.0 with the theme\u201cHow Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence will Disrupt Fintech in Nigeria\u201d, however, drew an unprecedented number of participants \u2013 over 6,000 from across 52 different countries.\nThe Summit that preceded last year\u2019s, i.e., the third edition of Fintech Summit 3.0 held in 2019, featured another heavyweight in Nigeria\u2019s fintech industry, Victor Asemota, founder of Swifta Systems & Services, as keynote speaker.\nFirstBank through the Firstmonie platform further supports the fintech industry via partnership collaborations with local and international fintechs.\nThis relationship climaxes every year in the annual Fintech Summit and the forthcoming Fintech Summit 5.0 promises to take the relationship to a whole new dimension.",

          "text": "Nigeria at 61, do we have anything to celebrate?\n\nYes we have come a long way. Nation building is not an easy thing especially when you have more than 250 ethnics groups where each one is looking for a place of governance. When you look back 60 years ago, I am sure quite a number of you were not born 60 years ago. My generation grew up under colonial rule and we saw how our colonial masters looted our treasury out of the country. The rail and road system they created were used to cart away what they could. But now Nigerians are in charge and like somebody says there is unity in diversity. Until bandits and boko haram came, Nigerians lived peacefully with each other and there was a lot of interaction among Nigerians. So I think it is something worth celebrating. I understand the frustration, we could have done better. But we have made progress both in terms of education, road infrastructure which at the moment is dilapidated and needs to be repaired. Nation building as we saw it in the last 60 years is a tremendous job confronting the government of the day. In term of when we were young the mortality rate for children was very high maybe during our time out of ten children, three would be lucky to survive but because of the construction of healthcare system and better environment, I can say out of 10 children, maybe seven survived and this has increased the population in the country and this is where we are today.\n\nWhat is your view on the security situation?\n\nIn the last couple of years, peace in Nigeria has been destabilised. First, with Boko Haram and later on banditry, kidnapping, asking for ransom, destroying government property and vandalising farms. Certainly, this is an issue of concern. But despite the shortcomings, especially the overstretching of the security forces, they are doing the best they can under the circumstances. We could do more by strengthening our security forces by increasing the number of people who are involved in security, recruiting more into the security forces and equipping them adequately so that they can face the challenges of providing the security of life and property in the country. Also, citizens should assist, as much as possible, the security agency by giving them information\u2019 where and how these miscreants are operating because they live among us. We know where they are so let us expose and give information to security forces to go after the bandits and all terrorists disturbing the country.\n\nWhere and when did we go wrong as a nation?\n\nI think this is a question for all of us to answer. I think in answering that question I will also join the question of whether the military contributed to destroying this country. It depends on where you are coming from. I, as a military retired personnel, will say the military did not destroy this country. The military fought to keep this country together. You can see, during the military regime, the infrastructures put in place. As much as possible they tried to give a direction of nationalism so that we all can look at Nigeria as our country. On where we got it wrong, it is a difficult question to answer. Before the discovery of oil, Agriculture was the main source of revenue of this country. Along the line, we discovered oil and forgot farming. After the military handed over to civilians, instead of them talking for Nigeria, when they speak they speak for themselves, their state, local government or village. You hardly see anybody talking for Nigeria. I think that we got it wrong there. We need to talk for the country for its unity. Of course to be able to do that there must be equity and justice so that everybody is carried along so that everybody knows he or she is a part and parcel of this country.\n\nWhen the military handed over power was this what you expected?\n\nNo, we expect a more united country where our leader\u2019s concern will be for the welfare of the people and the progress of the nation. We expected that there shouldn\u2019t be any bitterness in politics, because whether you are in opposition or in government, you are serving the people. In government, you legislate and give governance. In the opposition, you checkmate the government to ensure that they do the right thing and implement projects that will bring development for the country. Now, we find that due to one reason or another there is a lot of agitation from the state for one thing or the other.\n\nMy appeal to all is to keep peace and maintain peace because without peace we don\u2019t have a country. Secondly, I appeal to the government whether federal or state government to ensure there is peace equity and justice such that every citizen of the country will be given equal right to be part and parcel of the union.\n\nWhat do you think brought about the agitations for secession we are experiencing today?\n\nI think the perception of being excluded from the scheme of things. They have a feeling, one way or the other, that they are being excluded in the scheme of things, rightly or wrongly. On how to stop the secession session idea, I repeat there must be equity and justice and there must be an effort to carry everybody along in governance, in the developmental provision of infrastructures. Also, in appointing people into various offices, there must be equity and justice and there should be equal representation. I think if this is done we will kill this agitation.\n\nHave we celebrated our founding fathers as we ought to?\n\nI will throw back the ball to your court \u2013 media. The media contributed to the lack of celebration of our leaders and founding fathers because all we read or hear are stories of wars, you castigate everybody and put everybody in the same basket. For us to celebrate our heroes there must be fair reportage. A leader in any country is a human being and certainly as a human being they are not 100 percent perfect. Definitely there is an achievement. There is no leader who will come out purposely to be wicked or destroy the people he is leading. Yes everybody has a concern for the people under him. I am yet to really see where the media eulogized an individual. I am not saying you should not criticise, of course, it is your job to criticise and also give a possible solution on the way forward. But we are not doing justice to our founding fathers in the way we frustrate them. I can hear elderly people talk about the past leaders like Awolowo, Sardauna, Akintola and so on. Are we saying that after these leaders, Nigeria does not have leaders worth celebrating? I believe there are people who have done well for this country.\n\nHow can we bridge the widening gap among Nigerians today?\n\nThere is need to bring the understanding among our people and I want to believe the National Youth Corp Service is one organisation that can bridge the gaps among our people in that people from the South who have never been to the North and those from the North who have never been to the South, at the end of their academic learning, are posted to various places. Those from the North are brought to the South to see how they live and appreciate the problems of the people. For example, from the North you go to the South you find out about the riverine areas, where they have problems with water. When you come to the North, there is no water. So when we do this, Nigerians will understand each other. Also, I think there is a need to revive the organisation called MAMSER through which the government explains the situation to the people. I believe this should be in a town hall meeting where you discuss issues and educate people. Also we can do so through unity schools. I think we should have more such schools so that our youths and children can go there and interact with themselves. I think that is one way to go about it.\n\nWhat will you say about the debt profile of Nigeria?\n\nThe man who is wearing it knows where his shoes pinches him. But certainly the debt is cause for concern. Let\u2019s pray that whatever loan we get is utilised for the project that it is being assigned for.\n\nIt is not always easy for a military ruler to hand over to a civilian government. But, in a record time, you did that. Were you pressured to do so and were you satisfied you did?\n\nI am satisfied we did the right thing by handing over to the democratically elected government.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I was pressurized. On the contrary, the people were asking me to prolong my stay because the first time I said we were going to handover, nobody believed what we would. But when they realised that we meant business, the politicians were now asking us to prolong our stay so that they can now prepare for the democratisation process. So we were not pressurized.",

I believe there are people who have done well for this country.\n\nHow can we bridge the widening gap among Nigerians today?\n\nThere is need to bring the understanding among our people and I want to believe the National Youth Corp Service is one organisation that can bridge the gaps among our people in that people from the South who have never been to the North and those from the North who have never been to the South, at the end of their academic learning, are posted to various places. Those from the North are brought to the South to see how they live and appreciate the problems of the people. For example, from the North you go to the South you find out about the riverine areas, where they have problems with water. When you come to the North, there is no water. So when we do this, Nigerians will understand each other. Also, I think there is a need to revive the organisation called MAMSER through which the government explains the situation to the people. I believe this should be in a town hall meeting where you discuss issues and educate people. Also we can do so through unity schools. I think we should have more such schools so that our youths and children can go there and interact with themselves. I think that is one way to go about it.\n\nWhat will you say about the debt profile of Nigeria?\n\nThe man who is wearing it knows where his shoes pinches him. But certainly the debt is cause for concern. Let\u2019s pray that whatever loan we get is utilised for the project that it is being assigned for.\n\nIt is not always easy for a military ruler to hand over to a civilian government. But, in a record time, you did that. Were you pressured to do so and were you satisfied you did?\n\nI am satisfied we did the right thing by handing over to the democratically elected government.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I was pressurized. On the contrary, the people were asking me to prolong my stay because the first time I said we were going to handover, nobody believed what we would. But when they realised that we meant business, the politicians were now asking us to prolong our stay so that they can now prepare for the democratisation process. So we were not pressurized.",
          "summary": "Until bandits and boko haram came, Nigerians lived peacefully with each other and there was a lot of interaction among Nigerians.\nIn the last couple of years, peace in Nigeria has been destabilised.\nI think in answering that question I will also join the question of whether the military contributed to destroying this country.\nMy appeal to all is to keep peace and maintain peace because without peace we don\u2019t have a country.\nWhat do you think brought about the agitations for secession we are experiencing today?",

          "text": "Nigeria just turned 61, are the country\u2019s leaders living up to youth expectations?\n\nI don\u2019t think the country\u2019s leaders, especially the current leaders have lived or are living up to expectations because we seem to be in reverse motion for more than a decade now. The naira is now over N500 to the US Dollar. We have about N33 trillion debt and unemployment is said to be as high as an estimated 33 percent. Truth is that we need more than a featherweight person as the manager of our national economy and people are asking me whether we actually have a functional finance ministry today at all. This should not have been the case while we celebrate our 61st independence. I believe Nigerians deserve a better deal than the current one, which has been worsened by growing insecurity. However, hope is not lost and we have to sustain the courage to keep moving. But we need a total overhaul of leadership, with young people in charge. I think recycling old hands, especially in the last 10 years, has stunted our growth and now reduced our October 1st celebration to a mere case of reflection on our present worries. I pray God helps us out, and soon.\n\nAre you satisfied with youth representation in politics?\n\nI\u2019m satisfied to the extent that youths are increasing in various elective positions, senators, members of the House of Representatives and governors. I can say they seem to be the only ones giving the very best of leadership in today\u2019s Nigeria. I\u2019m proud that Nigerian youth\u2019s participation is encouraging, but I think they still need to redouble their efforts ahead of 2023 and even beyond. The future will be much better with youths in charge of our political or democratic space.\n\nWho should be responsible for bridging the political divisions in the country; elders or the youths?\n\nWell, both have a role to play. The elders should continue to play an advisory role but let the young ones work towards national unity and cohesion because at the end of the day, the future belongs to the youths as drivers of national growth. Challenges posed by divisive tendencies should be faced squarely.\n\nHow important is it to you that your region produces the next president?\n\nIt is important because in a democracy, the majority have their way and I have hope that we have the upper hand, democratically speaking. It is important because the North badly needs leaders with progressive outlook, focused and passionate about our development worries. We still have a lot of work to do to keep the North stronger especially in the area of economic viability, leadership mentoring and a lot more. If a Northerner wins again in 2023, this is what he or she should do. I don\u2019t mind.\n\nDo you see Nigeria remaining united in the next 60years?\n\nI do, but on the condition that justice will be promoted by those in power at every level of our national life. Secondly, there is the need for unconditional love for this country and this is a question of national orientation. Many Nigerians today seem to be less patriotic than they were 10 years ago. This is unfortunate and all hands must be on deck to fire the imagination of Nigerians on how much national unity guarantees national development and stability.",

I am very clear on that.\u2019\u2019\n\nAhmed said care homes have already overcome significant resistance among staff to the vaccines.\n\nIn Nov. 2020, shortly before the vaccine program launched, she said just 40 percent of staff had said they would get it.\n\nBut 86 percent of staff were now fully vaccinated, she said.\n\nShe told Today: \u201cwe are not anti-vaccine. What we are saying is we needed a bit more time to get people where they needed to be.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe said that without a delay to the deadline, the consequences for care homes and for the wider health sector will be severe.\n\n\u201cThe situation is chronic now with staffing and that deadline will just add to it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe will have providers who are no longer able to staff their services safely and that can only mean they will have to be handing back contracts.\n\n\u201cThey will have to be looking at whether they can minimize the number of beds that they use to keep themselves open, which will have a direct effect on the NHS\u2019s ability to discharge people out of hospital and into care settings.\u2019\u2019",

The name also had an alias of \u2018DA,\u2019 which likely stood for Aliko Dangote\u2019s initials.\n\nThe accusations were filed against Ms Spikes, who used Instagram to reveal the lawsuit and threaten Mr Dangote for making it public, implying that the tycoon could face additional humiliating information about him being published online as a result of the litigation.\n\nMr Dangote had already offered to pay her for her quiet, according to the woman, because the two had been in a relationship for nine years without a non-disclosure agreement to prevent her from publicly speaking about the affair.\n\nOn January 1, Ms Spikes used the Instagram name Allarounda1 to publish a video of herself and Mr Dangote on a couch aboard what looked to be a luxurious yacht, showing Mr Dangote half covered by an orange blanket while using his phone.",

          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has issued a warning about the threat that Islamic studies and the Arabic language face in the Southwest.\n\nThe teaching of the two disciplines in the Southwest has a variety of obstacles, according to MURIC, ranging from a lack of subject teachers to a syllabus fault.\n\nThose responsible for the Southwest\u2019s IRK teacher shortage, according to the organization, are trapping future generations.\n\nAs a result, MURIC\u2019s Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, has urged the region\u2019s governments to rise to the challenge as soon as feasible.\n\nIn a statement released on Saturday, Akintola made the call.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe teaching of Arabic language and Islamic Studies (IRK) is gradually disappearing in both primary and secondary schools in the South West. Most of these schools have no subject teachers for the two subjects and no effort is being made to recruit teachers for them. Most of these states only employ teachers of other subjects when they recruit any teacher at all.\n\n\u201cThe tab given to teachers in some of these states has notes on Bible Knowledge (BK) fully loaded whereas what is found under IRK is: \u2018This period is designated for IRS specialist to teach pupils\u2019. The IRK period is often wasted without the pupils learning anything about the subject due to lack of teachers, scheme, guide, or textbooks but BK or CRK content for teaching is readily available.\n\n\u201cWe urge the ministries of education in the Yoruba states, Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti to urgently address this gross imbalance. Religious education is important to inculcate the right values and the fear of Allah in the citizenry from childhood.\n\n\u201cHowever, the purpose may be defeated if attention is paid to only one religion at the expense of another. It should be noted that criminals do not discriminate between one faith or the other when they pick their victims. The current spate of insecurity which is affecting people of all faiths should be a lesson to all.\n\n\u201cWhoever thinks this is a problem for Muslims alone has missed the point. We are interwoven in all facets of life. Neither will teaching BK to Muslim children solve the problem because square pegs will never fit into round holes. A stitch in time saves nine.\n\n\u201cThose behind the artificial shortage of teachers of Arabic and IRK are simply setting a booby trap for future generations of people of all faiths in Yorubaland. The South West cannot afford to cut its nose to spite its face. We, therefore, advise the relevant authorities to investigate the imbalance in the availability of teachers of IRK, Arabic and BK as well as the lack of teaching aids for IRK while CRK is over-pampered.\u201d",

          "text": "Those campaigning for Nigeria\u2019s fragmentation, according to the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, should be dealt with harshly.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to deal with agitators like Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and Sunday Igboho was praised by Yerima Shettima, National President of the AYCF.\n\nBuhari made the threat during a speech commemorating Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day.\n\nThe President had promised to go after violent agitators such as Kanu and Igboho, who posed a threat to Nigeria\u2019s cooperative existence.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with DAILY POST, Shettima said individuals whose agitations jeopardize Nigerians\u2019 lives should be dealt with in accordance with Buhari\u2019s directive.\n\nHe described Kanu as a blind man who is leading IPOB into a death trap.\n\nShettima criticized IPOB\u2019s violent tactics, pointing out that the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, conducts its agitation peacefully and without endangering Nigerians\u2019 lives.\n\nAccording to Shettima: \u201cAll of us are victims of the society today in one way or the other, so if, something goes wrong, you don\u2019t have to behave abnormal. When you look at the situation on ground and think the only way out is to become violent at the expense of people\u2019s lives, then such agitation is not worth it.\n\n\u201cYes, certain things went wrong and we also, in Northern part of the country have suffered the same problem. In fact, we have even suffered more than where the agitation is coming from.\n\n\u201cCan the situation today in the Northwest or Northeast be compared to the realities in the Southwest and Southeast? The answer is no. For over two decades now, we have been suffering from one trouble to another. From poverty to marginalization to deprivation and so on. Even at that, we never deemed it necessary to take up arms against the state; so, no matter how you look at it, their approaches are wrong.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we have other groups agitating, like MASSOB? Do you see MASSOB endangering the lives of innocent citizens of the Southeast? The answer is no. Was it not from MASSOB IPOB broke out and is led by that blind man who puts the lives of people in danger? MASSOB goes about their demands which are very genuine by their thinking and feeling.\n\n\u201cMASSOB has said she really believes that the Southeast is being marginalized and if Nigeria can address some of this injustice meted on them, they are willing to come back and build the nation. However, the IPOB\u2019s approach by this their blind leader who is leading them to death zone is wrong, and two wrongs can not make a right.\n\n\u201cLooking at this situation, you can\u2019t solve problems with problems. We have faith in the country despite the shortcomings. We believe some days we will turn things around instead of balkanizing the country in the name of agitation. Most of those agitators are young elements who should come together and build a synergy within themselves that would fight against those oppressing them.\n\n\u201cAnybody found disobeying the law of the land should be dealt with decisively; nobody is above the law. If you balkanize the country, where will you go to? You can\u2019t be an American citizen, you will still remain a Nigerian. If you balkanize here, where will you run to? You are a refugee anywhere you run to.\n\n\u201cWe suffered during the war and we can\u2019t go back there again. If there is a way we can amend what happened in the past to ensure that the war never happened, we would have done that. It has happened and all we need now is to forgive ourselves and move forward. We can\u2019t continue to reflect on that and expect to make progress.\n\n\u201cEverybody suffered for that, so is that where they want us to return to now that there is arms proliferation? We can\u2019t survive a second war, so Nigerians must learn to stay together. We can agitate without endangering the life of anybody.\n\n\u201cThe statement coming from the president shows he is a leader and people should know that we are not in Banana Republic. I\u2019m not an advocate of the president, neither am I in the government but a victim of the society and I lead a group of people who are already victims.\u201d",

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) , on Thursday, denied the trending report that the air bombardment of the air component of Operations Hadin Kai on terrorist location killed 20 fishermen in Borno State.\n\nIt noted that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who made this denial in a statement also explained that the military bombed the location after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to media reports making rounds in social media alleging that; the \u201cAir Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday 26 September 2021, killed 20 Fishermen in air strikes at Kwatan Daban Masara general area in the fringes of the Lake Tchad. It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "title": "Nigeria@61: Young Nigerians Share Thoughts On Youth Participation In Politics, Leadership \u2013 Channels Television",
          "text": "\ufeff\n\nSix young Nigerians on Friday shared their thoughts on the participation of youths in politics and leadership in the country.\n\nThey include actress Kate Henshaw; political strategist Moremi Ojudu; anti-corruption activist, Hamzat Lawal; CEO, Sujimoto Properties, Sijibomi Ogundele; Sponsor, Not Too Young To Run Bill, Tony Nwulu; and Lawyer/PDP Member, Anthony Ehilebo.\n\nHere are excerpts from the thoughts they shared about youth participation in governance and politics in the country during a special session with Seun Okinbaloye, aired as part of Channels TV\u2019s Special Programme celebrating Nigeria at 61.\n\nWhere did we get it wrong?\n\nSijibomi Ogundele\n\nTo answer this question, we have to go back to, not even 1960, 1958. From 1958 to date, Nigeria has earned over $600bn dollars in oil revenue. Between 1999 and today, Nigeria has borrowed over $25bn, a capital injection of approximately N300tn.\n\nDo we look like N300tn has passed through us? Does our infrastructure, do our health care and many other things look like N300tn has passed through us? We must make those conscious decisions and address the issues of the past so that we can have a future tomorrow. If we refuse to do that, we will continue to suffer these dividends of incompetence, and I strongly believe that the cost of leadership must not be that difficult.\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nFor a lot of years, we have asked ourselves that question. Did we get it wrong with our leadership? Did we get it wrong with our followership? I think we got it wrong by just focusing on one area which is leadership.\n\nI think getting it wrong started from both parties (leaders and followers) not recognising the role they had to play in the future Nigeria they needed to see. And we\u2019ve forgotten that even at the very basic level of the country \u2013 ward level, unit level \u2013 there is leadership, there is followership and we need to identify these particular niches of our country and say we all need to take responsibilities both as leaders and followers, we all have a place where we got it wrong. Agreeing to that is the very first step to fixing whatever problems we have as a country today.\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nWe got it wrong when we stopped upholding the office of the citizen, which is the highest office in the land; where we took our eyes off the ball and we let things slide, where we stopped holding people accountable including ourselves, where we stopped voting people into office who truly cared about our human resources, our human capital, and the potential of this great country. That is where we got it wrong.\n\nHamzat Lawal\n\nWe got it wrong because people in power became selfish. We stopped investing in people and we thought that, without investment, Nigeria could move forward. Our biggest assets are people. We got it wrong because everyone has put themselves before Nigeria.\n\nMoremi Ojudu\n\nWe stopped investing in people. We always put ourselves first and, unfortunately, our leaders have taken that path of putting themselves before others.\n\nUnfortunately, that has really put us in a very bad light and our value system became a value system of greed and a situation where we just lack focus.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nWe need to also address inequality. I believe that if you could vote then you should also be voted for. It doesn\u2019t actually mean that at 18 you should go to the Senate or at 20 you should go to the Senate. But if you live in a community where at 20 you are the only one qualified to go to the Senate then, by all means, you should go to the Senate.\n\nI think it is a different thing from the leadership failures that we\u2019ve been having. It is not that we have a dearth of leaders, but several other people have refused to also join (politics) to see what they can do to correct those anomalies that we see in society.\n\nIs our politics \u201ctoo dirty\u201d for young people?\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nA lot of people have run away because of the term \u2018dirty politics\u2019 and that is so wrong because we need to get involved. We can\u2019t effect any change from the outside. Yes, it is dirty, but we need people to go in there are clean it up.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nPolitics is not dirty, it\u2019s our mindset.\n\nMoremi Ojudu\n\nWhen you say politics is dirty, it is a relative term. Highly relative. You have to be highly diplomatic.\n\nSijibomi Ogundele\n\nWe are picking people who have not even run a kiosk to sit in the seat of governance. There is a need today, for us to look into those elements that have some kind of internal division and convert those people into internal cohesion.\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nTo run even a primary for House of Assemblies will cost you nothing less than N15 million.\n\n\u2018Money Politics\u2019: Can young people thrive without money?\n\nHamzat Lawal\n\nNo, you can\u2019t. Even with the \u2018Not Too Young To Run\u2019 law.\n\nIt\u2019s not even just about not having money, it\u2019s about the fact that the Constitution itself does not guarantee equity and justice.\n\nYoung people are thriving in everything else except politics. We might debate this till tomorrow but money is important.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nWhat we\u2019ve been doing in Nigeria is giving power to people that haven\u2019t been tested, that have no precedents, that have nothing to prove that they have achieved this and that before they got into power.\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nThe system is skewed. Where is the person going to get the money from?\n\nYou need money and that\u2019s the honest truth because all the people that I went to, to consult, the first thing they asked me was, \u2018what\u2019s in your war chest?\u2019 I never understood what they meant by that.\n\nI\u2019m putting myself up to help, to serve and you\u2019re asking me what\u2019s in my war chest.\n\nI thought I needed weapons until I found out it was money. I would go to speak to different groups and the language is, \u2018you have not landed\u2019?\n\nAlternatives To \u2018Money Demands\u2019\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nWe can\u2019t continue saying money is a problem when we are in a new age and era. People have had very complex protests within the last year and have been able to fund these protests and raise money. As it is today, our generation is ready to back people who are ready to run.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people who are willing to sponsor but they have not seen willing people to invest that money in.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nI think the first thing you should ask yourself is, do you have social capital?\n\nIt is what you build within the society or the community that you intend to represent (that matters). Do they believe you? Have you been able to impact some lives, not necessarily financially? What are you known for and what is your social relevance? We\u2019ve seen politicians come out with a lot of money and still get rejected.\n\nWhat sort of leaders do we need in Nigeria?\n\nSijibomi Ogundele\n\nWithout identifying the problem we might not have the solution. The number one solution for this nation is leadership. In electing a leader, what are the things we are looking for? The first thing you must look at is competence. The second thing you must look at is integrity\u2026 After that you look at other things; what is your love for the nation? M.K.O defeated (Bashir) Tofa right in front of his house because of social capital.\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nI agree (with Ogundele). I will say character, capacity, competence and empathy. See, you must have a heart for people. It is not going to be about you anymore; it is about making your people better because in them looking better, you look better.\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nWe are at the stage in our country that we need fixers to come and fix things and these people are all over. In Anambra State, I had mentioned Chris Ngige and Peter Obi, when they started out. You go to Akwa Ibom, you see what the governor is doing there. He is fixing Akwa Ibom, from what I have seen that he is doing. Many other governors are doing well. Seyi Makinde is doing well. Fashola did a lot in Lagos. These are people with track records. Until we are able to tell ourselves, \u2018look, we can no longer seat in the cosy environment of our office and expect things to go well\u2019, (things won\u2019t improve). You complain that politicians are killing the economy and you have the know-how to correct the system, why don\u2019t you join (politics)?\n\nVoter turnout\n\nHamzat Lawal\n\nThe turning point could be when we have a 90% voter turnout in 2023. That could be the gamechanger both for old and young people. If we can get a 90% turnout then probably people can understand that power and legitimacy belong to the people.\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nPeople need to understand that the selection process for political parties starts at the ward elections. If you are not a member of a political party, how can you present yourself (as a candidate)?\n\nCan the young people step up?\n\nTony Nwulu\n\nOpportunity is not given. Power is not given, it is taken. You must have to leave the comfort of your bedroom to go and get involved (in politics). You must be intentional. You must be ready and tell yourself, \u2018I am ready to be a part of the change-makers in the society\u2019. Until we get to that point where it is very fashionable to have your voter\u2019s card and without your voter\u2019s card, I see you as a problem in society. If you don\u2019t have a voter\u2019s card, you are the reason why the hospitals are not well equipped, you are the reason why the roads are not fixed.\n\nHamzat Lawal\n\nYoung people are doing very well in every sector, except politics. We need to consolidate as young people ahead of 2023. The only thing power listens to is power. I think that as young people we need to come together. I said this before 2019 (general elections). I said it was late for us to have a young president. Now it is a bit late because we were supposed to start (the push) immediately after the 2019 elections, but we can negotiate power. That is where diplomacy comes in. Young people can come together and make our demands clear, then have conversations with these politicians. I am a civic leader but I spend most of my time engaging politicians to do advocacy.\n\nKate Henshaw\n\nOne thing we have to get in our minds is that it is not a sprint, it is a marathon and for Nigeria, it is indeed a marathon. We need to have our foot in the mud. So, 2023 for a young president? I don\u2019t see it. It is not impossible but I don\u2019t see it.\n\nAnthony Ehilebo\n\nCan we have young people step up? I definitely think that we do not just have young people. They are ready to step up. The best time to get into politics was yesterday. The next best time is today and the onus is on us; the future belongs to us. These guys kept telling us that we are the leaders of tomorrow. Even tomorrow they are still going to want to remain as leaders; that\u2019s fine if they are going to deliver a good country. This country has not been delivered to us in a state that we can own it; most of our contemporaries have left the country. We have nowhere else to go. We have no other country that we can run to. So, we are either going to fix this country or burn with it. This is why we are calling on everybody that is able. First of all, get your PVC, participate, look for a political party; it doesn\u2019t matter what they (people) say.\n\nMoremi Ojudu\n\nOur leaders are helpless without the young people. They need us and it\u2019s high time we get involved. You cannot effect a change from the outside, you have to effect the change from inside. Many of our leaders cannot even do anything without calling on a younger person.\n\nSijibomi Ogundele\n\nLeadership and positions have no boundaries and have no age and gender. I have learnt in the past that meritocracy is the only foundation that will lead any institution forward. We must start borrowing from the model of the likes of Lee Kuan Yew, the man that instituted meritocracy (in Singapore) and appoint leaders that know that the position they are in is not a chieftaincy. People that know that immediately you are not able to demonstrate competence, impunity will come and meet you at home and you must get judgement for every wrong decision you make.",

          "title": "California First US State to Require Covid Vaccines for Schoolchildren",
          "text": "California will become the first US state to require COVID-19 vaccinations for children to attend public and private schools in person in a mandate that could effect millions of students.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced that the coronavirus shot will be added to 10 other immunizations already required for school kids, including those for measles and mumps.\n\nExemptions would be granted for medical reasons or because of religious or personal beliefs but the exemption rules haven\u2019t been written yet pending public comment.\n\nAny student without an exemption who refuses to get the vaccine would be forced to do independent study at home.\n\n\u201cWe want to end this pandemic. We are all exhausted by it,\u201d Newsom said during a news conference at a San Francisco middle school after visiting with seventh graders.\n\n\u201cVaccines work. It\u2019s why California leads the country in preventing school closures and has the lowest case rates,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nThe mandate will be phased in as the U.S. government grants final vaccine approval for age groups. Currently, children 12 to 15 can only get the Pfizer vaccine under an emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vaccines for children 5 to 11 are still in the testing stage.\n\nUnder California\u2019s mandate, students in seventh to 12th grades would have to be vaccinated by the semester following full U.S. approval of the shots for their age group, probably meaning by next July. It will be even longer for children in kindergarten through sixth grades.\n\nThe mandate eventually will affect more than 6.7 million public and private school students in the nation\u2019s most populous state. California already has a mask requirement for schoolchildren.\n\nUntil now, Newsom had left the decision on student vaccine mandates to local school districts, leading to a variety of different orders. In Los Angeles, a vaccine mandate for eligible students is set to take effect in January.\n\nThe announcement drew swift reaction from parents, including some who said they should have the final choice of whether to vaccinate their children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m furious. On so many levels,\u201d said Jenny Monir, a Los Angeles mother of two who said she felt Newsom\u2019s mandate was made more for political than public health reasons. \u201cWe\u2019re just pawns in an elite game.\u201d\n\nJanet Meadows, whose children are in first grade and preschool, said she\u2019d consider homeschooling her children before vaccinating them. The 41-year-old from Kern County said she\u2019s worried about the health effects of the not-yet-approved shots for children.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we know enough about the vaccine to make our children get it,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of unknowns. We don\u2019t need to rush into this right now.\u201d\n\nOthers praised Newsom\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see that we\u2019re trying to get this health crisis under control,\u201d said Andrew Patterson, father of an elementary school student in San Francisco. \u201cAnd we have lots of other vaccine requirements. I don\u2019t see why this one would be any different.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has one of the highest vaccine rates in the country \u2014 84% of people 12 and older have gotten at least one shot, and 70% are fully vaccinated. But only 63.5% of children ages 12 to 17 have received a dose and the state has a vocal minority skeptical of both the vaccine and the government\u2019s assurances of its safety.\n\nNewsom has been one of the most aggressive governors on coronavirus restrictions, issuing the nation\u2019s first statewide stay-at-home order in March 2020 that was soon followed by 41 other states. More recently, Newsom required California\u2019s roughly 2.2 million health care workers and most state employees to get vaccinated to keep their jobs.\n\nThe governor was emboldened after easily defeating a recall effort last month fueled by anger over his handling of the pandemic. He says he interpreted his landslide victory as an endorsement of his vaccine policies.\n\nNewsom hasn\u2019t backed all vaccine mandates, however. He recently opposed a requirement for prison guards that a federal judge imposed. Critics used that example to say Newsom is driven more by politics than science, noting the labor union of corrections officers had donated to his campaign to defeat the recall.\n\n\u201cCalifornia kids made the mistake of not giving millions to his campaigns,\u201d Republican Assemblyman Kevin Kiley tweeted Friday. Kiley was among 46 candidates who ran to replace the governor during the recall election.\n\nNewsom\u2019s announcement comes as COVID-19 infections in most of California have dropped markedly. The statewide positivity rate for the last week was 2.8%, and the average number of daily cases was about 6,355, roughly half what it was when the latest surge peaked in mid-August. Hospitalizations have fallen by 40%.\n\nIn Los Angeles County \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest, with more than 10 million residents \u2014 just 1.7% of people tested for the virus have it, and daily infections are down by half in the last month, when most kids went back to school.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s largest teachers unions back the vaccination mandate, as does the California Association of School Boards.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Jocelyn Gecker and Haven Daley in San Francisco, Amy Taxin in Orange County and Terry Chea contributed.",

          "text": "Oil output of members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose in September to its highest since April 2020, as Nigeria\u2019s production also recovered from involuntary losses.\n\nThe group\u2019s top producers further eased supply curbs in September under a pact with its allies known as OPEC+, revealed a survey by Reuters.\n\nAccording to the survey, OPEC pumped 27.31 million barrels per day (bpd) last September, up 420,000 bpd from August\u2019s revised estimate.\n\nThe biggest rise in September was from Nigeria, where output rose by 170,000 bpd after Forcados force majeure and other problems in August were eased.\n\nThe Forcados terminal export outlet was under force majeure in August, limiting supply. Even so, Nigeria is pumping almost 100,000 bpd less than its OPEC target as under-investment restrains output.\n\nOPEC and allies, known as OPEC+, are easing output cuts made in April 2020 as demand recovers, although due to a lack of capacity in some members, OPEC+ is not delivering the full boost promised. This had helped support oil prices, which is trading above $80 a barrel, and close to a three-year high.\n\nThe OPEC+ agreement allows for a 400,000 bpd production increase in September from all members, of which 253,000 bpd is shared by the 10 OPEC members covered by the deal.\n\nWhile the 10 OPEC members raised output by more than last month\u2019s figures in September, they are still pumping less than expected under the latest deal, as OPEC compliance with pledged cuts was 114 per cent when compared with 115 per cent in August.\n\nOPEC+ meets on Monday to review its policy and is expected to re-confirm plans for the monthly increases.\n\nThe second-largest increase came from top exporter Saudi Arabia, which further raised supply as part of the September OPEC+ boost even as Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Algeria made smaller increases.\n\nOutput declined or did not increase in Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, the survey found, owing to a lack of production capacity to add more supply.\n\nIran, which had managed to raise exports since the fourth quarter despite U.S. sanctions, has posted slightly higher output this month, the survey found.\n\nThe country is exempted from OPEC supply curbs due to the sanctions; although a larger export recovery depends on progress in talks to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Those talks are currently stalled.\n\nAmong the other two producers exempted from curbs, Libyan and Venezuelan output also slightly increased, based on shipping data provided by external sources.\n\nNigeria\u2019s inability to meet its OPEC production quota has been a source of concern to the country which desperately needs every dollar it can possibly get, as the government continues to ration forex due to increasing scarcity.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "title": "Muhammadu Sanusi II: Nigeria Wasting Millions of Dollars through Subsidy Scam",
          "text": "The former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday identified corruption, poor leadership and wrong-headed policies as the bane of Nigeria, citing the regime of paying subsidy on petroleum products as part of the corrupt practice that may bring the country to its knees.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria also described as an assumption, the notion that Nigeria is an oil rich country.\n\nSanusi declared: \u201cThis has always been a big joke for me and we also talk about the fuel subsidy. President Jonathan tried to remove fuel subsidy and the people protested. You are producing two million barrels of oil for 180 million people and that\u2019s one barrel for 80 people. Saudi Arabia produces one barrel for three citizens.\n\n\u201cYou produce one barrel for 80 and your share of that revenue from that barrel is maybe half, so it translates to one barrel for 160 people. We need education, we need healthcare, infrastructure, telecommunication, agriculture and you decide that what they need more than anything else is cheap fuel and that doesn\u2019t make sense. We are throwing away millions of dollars in this scam called subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhen oil prices go up, other producers rejoice but not so for Nigeria. Our refineries are not working and we have this scheme called subsidy which is really a scam and practically everything that comes in goes practically out to import petroleum products and to pay subsidy on those products.\n\n\u201cWhen you deal with corruption, you also have to look at creating the opportunities for corruption. Corruption thrives when you create an opportunity for people to take advantage of things. When you talk about the oil industry, for example, if you eliminate fuel subsidy, you eliminate fraud worth billions and millions of dollars. If there is no subsidy, what is the incentive to come and forge bills of laden and bribe Customs and bribe people?\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t create an arbitrage opportunity in foreign exchange market, how do you create corruption there? So, I think we need to look at the structures and processes and make sure we eliminate the avenues and incentives for people to be corrupt.\u201d\n\nHe said the second highest form of corruption \u201cis appointing people who are incompetent to positions.\u201d\n\nSanusi said: \u201cSometimes, it is not even so much of corruption but people don\u2019t even know what they are supposed to do; people who do not know why they are there; people who do not have the sense that at the end of their efforts, they are still human beings.\n\n\u201cIf every public officer starts thinking about how his actions and decisions affect a human being and how he can contribute positively to affect that human being, he will begin to address issues. But, I think you should ask, does this person even understand what he is saying, whether you are a minister or a civil servant? I think if you are a minister, at the end of eight years, you should assess how you affected the people.\u201d\n\nNo to Zoning of the Presidency\n\nSanusi also said zoning the Presidency to a particular region may leave Nigeria \u201cwith two useless candidates\u201d in 2023.\n\nHe said he had always objected to discussions that take into account where a president should come from.\n\nThe former CBN governor said \u201cNigeria needs a president who can deliver, irrespective of where he is from.\u201d\n\nSanusi said: \u201cI have always objected to this idea that we should focus on where the president comes from. We have got southern governors saying we want the presidency and some northern governors saying that they want it in the north. Have you noticed that nobody has given the name of who they want?\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is to corner the presidency to one part of the country and the big masquerade will come out. And that is why at the end of the exercise, you end up as Nigeria\u2026 presented with two useless candidates. Those who want to be president should show their face either from the north or the south.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, we have before us very serious issues. You have a simple issue of electronic transmission of results which is designed to make the electoral process fairer and you have people saying that they do not want it, shamelessly announcing to the country that they want to rig. Why are we not talking about these issues?\n\n\u201cThe greatest weakness we have as a country is that we do not think. We are very smart when it comes to making money by doing our work but we do not apply critical intellect to\u2026 and these guys just take the entire country for a ride.\n\n\u201cGive me a president from any part of the country who can deliver and we should vote for him. He is not taking the presidency to his hometown.\u201d\n\nSanusi said civil society organisations and the national assembly \u201care not doing their jobs\u201d in terms of holding political society to account.\n\nEveryone wants office; everyone wants favours from the government. If we had a strong civil society holding political society to account, we would begin to improve and tackle issues,\u201d said the former CBN governor.\n\nNigeria Better Together Than Divided\n\nOn those agitating for the breakup of Nigeria, Sanusi said Nigeria \u201cis better together than divided,\u201d pointing out that countries that embraced dismemberment had found themselves in various conflicts and blamed the elites for using ethnicity and other factors to divide the country for their selfish gains.\n\nSanusi, who said he was a strong believer in a strong united Nigeria, believes that \u201conce the problem of leadership is addressed,\u201d most of the right decisions taken, and the system cleaned up of corruption, things would take a postive turn.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou hardly find a country that is homogenous and the same is with Nigeria,; that is why we are better together because if you try to divide the country, it will lead to further divisions and war like you have in Ethiopia and South Sudan.\u201d\n\nHe pointed at the North, West, East, Niger Delta and Middle Belt, which were all not homogenous and asked, \u201cHow many parts are you going to divide this country to ensure it is homogenous? The challenge is not in our diversity, the challenge is in the inability of the leadership to forge a nation.\n\n\u201cWe got out of a civil war and we are yet to start thinking like one country where people believe we are one. What happens is that from time to time we tend to have people in certain circles that see Nigeria as a place for extraction of rent and corruption.\n\n\u201cYou have different class factions of the elite who profit from creating a stage for themselves. If you have a northern president, how does that affect a poor northerner who is unemployed? If you have a southern president, how does it affect the common man in the south? It may benefit just a few from that zone\n\n\u201cI am a strong believer in Nigeria and I feel we are better off as one country than a divided country. 70 per cent of our problems are from wrong-headed policies.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Friday urged former President Goodluck Jonathan to remain in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and resist the temptation of joining the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAccording to Wike, who spoke in an interview on BBC News Pidgin, the PDP is a better political platform for the ex-President to run for the 2023 Presidency if he chooses to.\n\nWike warned Jonathan not to be enticed by moves by the APC to lure reputable members of the PDP, adding that the ruling party is offering nothing but destruction.\n\n\u201cIf I see the former President, I will tell him what I heard. I will tell him, \u2018Don\u2019t go anywhere because these people want to destroy your reputation. They don\u2019t like you; you should know.\n\n\u201cWhat APC is doing now is to bring reputable people from PDP, and when they bring them, they destroy them so that they won\u2019t have anywhere to go again. That\u2019s what the APC is doing.\n\n\u201cI respect the former President because he is a man of integrity but if I am to advise him, I will tell him, \u2018Sir, don\u2019t make that mistake. If you want to run for President, run under PDP. Nigerians cherish you more than this government. They have seen that all the things the (Buhari) government promised them are lies. So, please don\u2019t join the APC for the sake of your reputation.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe (Jonathan) has the right to decide whatever he wants to do but like I said before, if my former President runs for President in APC, I won\u2019t be able to vote for APC in the election because that would be anti-party but if he runs in PDP, I will work to ensure he wins the election,\u201d Wike said.\n\nJonathan lost his reelection in 2015 to Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThough out of Aso Rock, Jonathan has been working closely with the incumbent in his role as Special Envoy of the Economic Community of West African States.\n\nWith the 2023 elections fast approaching and the clamour for power shift to the South, Jonathan, who has the legal right to one more term as Nigeria\u2019s President as the constitution permits all eligible Nigerians to be in office for two terms of eight years, has been receiving entreaties from the APC.\n\nSome APC chieftains had visited him in recent times, raising the stakes in permutations for the 2023 general elections.\n\nOf late, with the wave of defections swinging in the direction of the ruling party, the National Secretary, APC Caretaker, and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, recently said Jonathan would be given an opportunity to contest the 2023 presidency on APC platform \u201cif he chose to join the ruling party.\u201d\n\nHowever, the former President is yet to respond to the entreaties.\n\nBennett Oghifo",
