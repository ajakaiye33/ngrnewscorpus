          "text": "BANDITS have again killed 41 farmers in Tofa and Samawa villages in Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State.\n\nAn indigene of the area, who gave his name as Malam Balarabe, informed The PUNCH that the bandits invaded the area when the farmers were planting their crops and others were clearing their farms.\n\n\u201cThey came suddenly and began to shoot at the farmers, killing many of them,\u201d Balarabe stressed.\n\nHe further explained that the bandits also blocked the road leading to the two villages where they also killed other farmers returning to their houses.\n\nBalarabe maintained that a total number of 41 farmers lost their lives, adding that the bandits did not take anything from the two villages.\n\n\u201cTheir mission was only to kill those who went to their farms,\u201d Balarabe added.\n\nThe spokesperson of the state Police Command, Mohammed Shehu, said, \u201cCombined Police Tactical operatives were not alerted until after they (bandits) might have finished their onslaught on Tofa community. We have yet to be ascertained the number of villagers that were killed.\n\n\u201cHowever, as the bandits left Tofa on their way to Samawa village for similar attack, the Police Tactical operatives stationed at Samawa village were quickly alerted where they mobilised and engaged the assailants in a serious gun battle that lasted for hours.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the encounter, unspecified number of bandits was fatally injured (killed), while others escaped with possible gunshot wounds. No loss of life from the community in Samawa, but regrettably, a police operative paid the supreme price during the gun battle with the bandits,\u201d Shehu said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Both the smallholder farmers and commercial farmers can access long-term loans from banks at a single interest rate.\n\nAlso, lenders, which previously saw agricultural credits as high risk, are now seeing the potential of how much a well-priced facility can add to their balance sheets and profitability.\n\nThe new thinking in agriculture credit and access to loans by farmers was made possible by several intervention programs instituted by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to lift the agricultural sector and support food sufficiency.\n\nThe Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Scheme, Agri-Business, Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS), the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGSF) among others are few examples of the CBN\u2019s footprints in the agricultural sector.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele said the apex bank has disbursed funds under its various agricultural interventions towards improving food supply in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), launched in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi state capital, in 2015 to ensure easy loan access to farmers.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, under the ABP, farm inputs are provided in cash and kind to smallholder farmers (SHF), thus guaranteeing input supply to agro-processors. During harvest, the farmer supplies produce to the agro-processors (anchors) who then pay the cash equivalent to the farmer. Rice, a major commodity under the ABP, is the third-most consumed staple food in Nigeria \u2014 after maize and cassava \u2014 and has become a food security crop due to its increased significance in the country.\n\nEmefiele explained further that over 3.1 million farmers have been financed for the cultivation of crops across twenty-one agricultural commodities captured under the ABP since inception.\n\n\u201cA total of 3,107,890 farmers had been financed for the cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares across 21 commodities through 23 Participating Financial Institutions in the 36 States of the Federation and FCT, from the inception of the programme till date,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nHe added that under the 2020 wet season CBN-Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) partnership, the bank also financed 221,450 farmers for the cultivation of 221,450 hectares in 32 States.\n\nEmefiele expressed hope that the incentive would improve the standard of living of farmers in Nigeria, motivate prompt loan repayment and ultimately enhance the sustainability of the programme. \u201cLoan repayment is the hallmark of every credit cycle and the sustainability of the programme is hinged on farmers\u2019 ability and willingness to repay their loans, and we are constantly engaging with them to enhance their trust in the system,\u201d he said.\n\nTaofik Ibrahim, a rice farmer, said the ABP has been of great support to his farm, as the yield per hectare has improved with one hectare yielding an average yield of 90 bags of rice paddy on optimally performing land. The minimum was about 75 bags.\n\nHe explained that with ABP, farmers are provided with six bags of fertiliser per hectare, a water pumping machine, and herbicide, then cash support.\n\nAccording to him, more people in Kebbi, including civil servants, have gone into farming because of the opportunity provided by the CBN through the ABP.\n\nHow intervention funds are disbursed\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCBN data showed the apex bank disbursed N107.60 billion to 548,109 farmers cultivating 703,619 hectares of land between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 to boost dry season output in support of agricultural value chain development.\n\nTotal disbursements as of end-February 2021 amounted to N1.487 trillion under the various agricultural programmes, of which N686.59 billion was disbursed under the Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS) and N601.75 billion under the Anchor Borrowers Programmes (ABP) to 3,038,649 farmers to support food supply and dampen inflationary pressures.\n\nThe CBN also authorised commercial banks to give up to N2 billion maximum loan to youths interested in going into agriculture.\n\nThe loan, which comes under the Accelerated Agriculture Development Scheme (AADS) at a five per cent interest rate per annum was created by the regulator in collaboration with state governments to engage 370,000 youths in agricultural production.\n\nAccording to the loan guidelines signed by CBN Director Development Finance Department, Yusuf Yila Philip, the maximum loan accessible under the scheme is N2 billion per obligor.\n\nPhilip said the country\u2019s population pyramid is bulging around the youth segment, with an estimated 75 per cent of the population which is below 35, saying a large segment of this population would have eked out a living if adequate opportunities were harnessed in agriculture given its potential of employing over 70 per cent of the workforce.\n\nAGSMEIS funding limit\n\nTo the success of the AGSMEIS scheme, the CBN has pegged non-interest banks\u2019 funding of agricultural programmes at a maximum N2 billion equity.\n\nThe investment is set at 40 per cent of the investee company\u2019s equity subject to a maximum of N2 billion and tenor of up to 10 years. It has an initial lock-up period of three years.\n\nThe new rule is contained in the guidelines for the Agri-Business, Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) for Non-Interest Financial Institutions (NIFIs) released by the apex bank.\n\nThe guidelines, signed by CBN Director, Financial Policy and Regulations Department, Kelvin Amigo, described AGSMEIS as an initiative of the Bankers\u2019 Committee supporting the government\u2019s policy measures and efforts for the promotion of agricultural businesses.\n\n\u201cThe AGSMEIS Non-Interest Fund will be domiciled in a dedicated account with the CBN while each Non-Interest Deposit Bank, full-fledged or window, shall set aside five per cent of its profit after tax (PAT) annually as a contribution to the fund\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlso, each Non-Interest Deposit Bank shall transfer its contribution to the CBN not later than 10 working days after the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the participating bank,\u201d the guideline said.\n\nThe eligible activities under the scheme include businesses across the agricultural value chain, covering production, inputs supply, storage, processing, logistics and marketing. Also captured in the scheme are (MSMEs) in the real sector including manufacturing, mining and petrochemicals; MSMEs in the service sector including information and communication technology (ICT) and the creative industry and other activities as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) may determine from time to time.\n\nA Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) shall be established to manage and monitor investments/projects under the scheme. The guidelines also said the application of the fund shall be categorised into three broad components: debt ( 50 per cent), equity (45 per cent) and developmental components (five per cent).\n\nThe debt component shall constitute 50 per cent of the fund which shall be disbursed to eligible businesses through Non-Interest Deposit Money Banks.\n\nAgric investments in states\n\nEmefiele has called on the 36 states of Nigeria to make their states more viable by investing more in agriculture, particularly crops in which they have a comparative advantage.\n\nHe dropped the challenge in Port-Harcourt, at the launch of the Rivers Cassava Processing Company Limited, which is designed to support improved production and processing of cassava into high-quality flour in Rivers State.\n\nHe disclosed that the CBN would no longer support the continued importation of items that can be produced in Nigeria, even as he pledged that the bank will collaborate with Rivers and other States in supporting the development of a viable agricultural and manufacturing sector across the country in line with the CBN mandate of promoting economic growth for the country.\n\nAccording to him, principal agencies of government at the federal and state level should continue to work hand in hand towards diversifying the Nigerian economy and creating an enabling environment for further investment by firms such as the Rivers Cassava Processing Company.\n\nEmefiele identified land development as a major constraint to the increase in agricultural activities in the Southern parts of the country due to its topography, noting that the CBN had partnered with several States Governments in the region under the Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (AADS).\n\nContinuing, he said about N7.436 billion had been accessed by four States in the South-South region to open up more land for cultivation, create access roads to agricultural lands, and provide infrastructure among other support services in the region. \u201cThese measures are helping to induce greater activity in the agricultural sector and are enabling the movement of goods from farm to factories, and to the markets,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile commending the Rivers State Government, working with Shell Petroleum Development Corporation, the Dutch Embassy Investment Nigeria Limited and their technical partners, in setting up the integrated facility, Emefiel said investments such as the cassava plant could help in driving economic growth, reducing unemployment and inducing other wealth-creating activities in the state.\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike invited the farmers and other interested individuals to key into the development programmes of the state, particularly in agriculture as the state is ready to divest its 80 per cent shareholdings to ensure proper management of the facility.\n\nMinister of Agric Muhammad Sabo Nanono promised to supply free cassava seedlings to farmers in the area\n\nIn Katsina, Emefiele had urged youths to embrace agriculture, declaring the bank\u2019s readiness to support youths that are willing to engage in agriculture. This is even as the Governor reiterated the Bank\u2019s opposition to the importation of maize into Nigeria.\n\nHe spoke during the unveiling of the first maize pyramid and flag-off of the 2021 Maize wet season farming under the CBN-Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN) Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme.\n\nKatsina State Governor Bello Masari said the state had suffered a setback in agriculture as over sixty thousand hectares of farmlands were uncultivated due to insurgency, which hindered farmers from gaining access to their means of livelihood.\n\nKebbi State Governor Atiku Abubakar Bagudu, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari, reassured the farmers, processors and other value chain participants, of the support of the government towards ensuring that they perform optimally.\n\nEmefiele expressed the belief that Nigerian youth could leverage their talents, along with technological tools to improve farm productivity and delivery of agricultural produce to markets.\n\nAccording to him, groups of youth with contiguous land for farming are eligible to seek the Bank\u2019s support through the CBN prime anchor arrangement.\n\n\u201cThe CBN will not only provide access to credit for these youths but will also provide guarantees that their products will be purchased by a prime anchor at agreed prices,\u201d the Governor assured.\n\nJustifying the bank\u2019s continued strategic intervention in the value chains of focal crops, he said the CBN was leading the revolution because the impact of our monetary policy measures would be limited if the monetary authority in collaboration with the fiscal authorities failed to address some of the structural constraints that limit productivity in key sectors of our economy such as agriculture.\n\nSpecifically, he said the bank\u2019s intervention was in line with its mandate and aims at ensuring price stability as well as improved availability of staple food items.",
          "summary": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is exercising its power to reflate the economy through funding support for key sectors especially the agricultural sector.\nBoth the smallholder farmers and commercial farmers can access long-term loans from banks at a single interest rate.\nThe CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele said the apex bank has disbursed funds under its various agricultural interventions towards improving food supply in Nigeria.\nHe said the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), launched in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi state capital, in 2015 to ensure easy loan access to farmers.\nAccording to him, groups of youth with contiguous land for farming are eligible to seek the Bank\u2019s support through the CBN prime anchor arrangement.",

          "text": "Ford has just reached a new milestone. According to a Bloomberg report, production of the Mustang Mach-E has surpassed the iconic Mustang pony car for the first time at the Blue Oval\u2019s Mexico plant.\n\nSo far this year, Ford has built 27,816 units of the Mustang Mach-E, compared to 26,089 units of the sixth-generation Mustang. It\u2019s a popular model in Europe, and in May was the best-selling vehicle in Norway. In the United States, however, the regular Mustang outsells the Mach-E by a ratio of three-to-one.\n\nFord Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley said the demand for \u201cMach-E has been much stronger than we expected, so we\u2019ve totally run out of stock. Mach-E is going global as we speak, but in the US, the wait is months\u201d.\n\nOne reason as to the Mach-E is produced at a higher rate is because of how Ford is prioritising resource allocation for its model line-up. As you know, the global semi-conductor shortage has forced several automakers to revisit their production strategy, with Ford funneling more chips to produce newer models such as the Mustang Mach-E and Bronco SUV.\n\n\u201cWe have purposely protected our launches \u2013 Bronco, Bronco Sport, Mach-E, F-150,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf we can switch a module over to one of those launch vehicles, we have. We\u2019re very protective of the launches because they are so important for our business,\u201d Farley said.\n\nFord\u2019s Flat Rock plant in Michigan produced zero petrol Mustangs last month because of the shortage.\n\nCompany sales analyst Erich Merkl said in an email: \u201cWe are really excited about the success that we are having with our launch of the all-new Mustang Mach-E, not just here in America, but globally too. To be fair, please keep in mind that Mustang and Flat Rock have been impacted by outside factors, which has been the semiconductor chip shortage.\u201d",

          "text": "Mercedes-Benz India has confirmed its next product launch will be its most luxurious sport utility vehicle (SUV).\n\nThe Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 will be launched tomorrow. Mercedes-Benz has already introduced the new-generation A-Class Limousine, updated E-Class and the GLA-Class this year. The Maybach GLS will be its fourth product launch out of the 15, scheduled to arrive in 2021.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Maybach GLS 600 although is based on the GLS-Class, yet elevates the luxury quotient further to opulent levels. If the GLS is the S-Class of SUVs, the Maybach GLS is the Maybach S-Class of SUVs.\n\nThe Maybach GLS 600 will feature a four-litre bi-turbo V8 engine paired with the EQ-Boost mild-hybrid system.\n\nThe engine comes mated to a 9-speed automatic transmission. The unit is tuned to develop 550hp, 730Nm of torque and is limited to a top speed of 250 km/h. Despite its two-and-a-half tonne weight, the Maybach GLS 600 can accelerate from 0-100 km/h in just 4.9 seconds.\n\nBut where the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 truly shines, is in the cabin. Although most of the design and features are shared with the standard GLS, it pushes the boundaries even further with more luxurious touches. It can be had with a five-seat configuration or a four-seat layout to provide a first-class luxurious experience with two reclinings, massaging and temperature controllable rear seats. The leather, cushioning on the seats and panels in the cabin, are softer and more elegantly done to offer sumptuous comfort to the occupants.\n\nOther features in the luxury SUV include a refrigerator with champagne glasses, panoramic sunroof, and the latest tech with the MBUX infotainment OS and Advanced Driver Aided Systems, among others.\n\nTo differentiate itself on the road, the exterior has also been restyled. The most striking of the touches is the inclusion of the Maybach signature front grille that replaces the one with Mercedes three-pointed star. The wheels are larger and come with bespoke multi-spoke alloys.\n\nThe SUV features a heavy dose of chrome on the exterior and the final touch is the special dual-tone exterior paint.\n\nThe Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 is aimed squarely at the Rolls-Royce Cullinan, Bentley Bentayga and the Range Rover Autobiography",

          "title": "IPOB order and the game option",
          "text": "Emeka OMEIHE\n\nThe outcome of the sit-at-home order by the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, in honor of souls lost during the Nigerian civil war is already in the public domain.\n\nOpinions are however, divided on factors responsible for the total shut-down of economic and social activities in zone that fateful Monday. Those who offered opinions on the high level of compliance with the order fingered the fear of being caught in a cross fire arising from possible confrontation between the IPOB group and security agencies. For this group, compliance was vicariously procured through the fear of the unknown.\n\nThere is the second school that sees the success of the order as evidence of the popularity of the cause which the IPOB group is currently propagating. This group views obedience to the order as the identification of the peoples of the southeast and other areas where it had some measure of compliance with the Biafra cause.\n\nThis would imply that the southeast people and such other areas share in the grievances that gave rise to the agitations either physically or spiritually. In this wise, we can talk of Biafra of the mind denoted by resentment to injustice, inequity and non-inclusiveness in the running of the affairs of this country. There is also the physical Biafra manifest in extant agitations by the IPOB that led to its proscription and association with alleged attacks on security agencies and governmental facilities in the southeast.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere is an additional dimension that seeks to account for the high level of compliance on a combination of the above two factors. And with this group, are many. They contend that compliance was in part, out of the fear of the unknown in a likely confrontation between security agencies and the IPOB and also a measure of the popularity of the agitation. It admits the reality that there exists a wide gamut of sympathy and support in the zone for the grievances that gave rise to self-determination agitations. Whether this sympathy translates to a total endorsement of the strategy of the IPOB promoters in redressing the perceived wrongs, is another kettle of fish.\n\nThe order and counter order by some governors in the zone persuading people to go about their normal activities with assurances for security protection also had their vicarious contribution. They heightened the fear of violence in the event the IPOB decides to enforce compliance. So, palpable fear reigned large and prevented those who would have ventured out to keep indoors.\n\nAggravated fear also arose from mounting allegations by the federal government and security agencies associating the IPOB with sundry killing and attacks on government facilities in the zone. IPOB is alleged to be the mastermind of the killing of security agents and burning of public facilities in the zone. Though the group has severally denied the accusation, the level of casualties in those attacks and the relative ease with which they were carried out without resistance from security agencies combined to create fear in the populace on the capacity of the security agencies to protect them in the event of an attack by the so-called unknown gunmen.\n\nSadly, those allegations portrayed the IPOB as a group with the capacity to enforce the order. Even those who would have obeyed government assurances of protection did not trust such promises. Not with what they were made to believe about the capacity of the IPOB for evil. Not with the clinical execution of some of the attacks attributed to them on security formation without serious resistance.\n\nThese brought with them complications that had all the trappings of a game situation. It involved choices, options and payoffs. Two options were at play \u2013 stay at home or venture out. Game theorists are interested in the rational choice open to the people in the circumstance. Which of the two options minimizes their losses in the event of the worst outcome?\n\nThe rational option is for the people to stay at home. By staying at home, they minimize the losses they could incur by venturing out in a fluid situation that could even consume lives. That is rational calculation. It may not necessarily translate to absolute obedience to the sit-at-home order. It may not translate to taking instructions from Nnamdi Kanu. That could also explain why state and federal government officials in those areas (except security agents) kept off the streets.\n\nEven when one of the governors threatened to confiscate shops and business places of those that comply with the order, he was quick to rescind that decision because of obvious contradictions. If he had not moved quickly to rescind that order for whatever it was worth, he would have embarrassed himself given the interplay of the variables under consideration.\n\nIn effect, the actions and utterances of the federal government, security agencies and some state governors were largely contributory to the high level of compliance to the sit-at-home order. That is without prejudice to the rights of the people to decide to honor their loved ones who died during that civil war. It is also by no means whittling down the deep-seated grievances that are behind the cause being championed by the IPOB. Is it not puzzling that one Nnamdi Kanu could sit in the comfort of his house outside the shores of the country to issue orders that are obeyed either by acts of omission or commission? That was not the first time such order secured high level compliance even beyond the southeast.\n\nI have gone this far to highlight the wider dynamics of the sit-at-home order in view of the obvious misinterpretation of its outcome. Statements from the leadership of this country since after that fateful Monday, gives the miserable impression that the government equates the outcome to a declaration of war from that part of the country.\n\nThat was the message when President Buhari said a day after the incident that: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand\u201d.\n\nThis has been interpreted as ethnic profiling and veiled declaration of war against the southeast zone. It made no exceptions. It views any and every person from that zone as partakers in the attacks by unidentified hoodlums and the violence that has enveloped a zone once reputed for its tranquility and peace. Not unexpectedly, the indecent haste to remind the people of the zone of their travails during that war has again raised suspicions on the nature and character of the security infractions that of recent enveloped the zone.\n\nSuspicions have before now, been raised regarding those behind the orgy of violence in the zone. Though the government had been quick to point accusing fingers on the IPOB, the nature of these attacks, their clinical execution in the face of the inability of the security agencies to put up some resistance had created doubts as to whether fifth columnists were not at work.\n\nBefore now also, there have been allegations that some of those infractions were being simulated to provide the basis for the federal government to attack the people of the zone. Sadly, events are beginning to bear out these suspicions especially given the ease with which some northern stalwarts are now routing for military action in the southeast.\n\nEven before the military action, the security situation in the zone has been quite tense. Reports of harassment, killings, intimidation, abduction, and profiling of youths for selective arrests and incarceration by security agents have been quite rife. Imo State has been worst for it. We are faced with ethnic profiling in a matter that can be handled by security agents through intelligence. Identify the masterminds of the attacks and bring the full weight of the law against them instead of the posturing that all peoples in the zone are partakers in lawlessness.\n\nThe mindset that only the military option or a declaration of war is the solution to agitations in the southeast is wrong. Engagement by way of addressing the grievances propelling the agitations may turn out a quick therapy. But is this option of any appeal to the leadership?",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nArchbishop of Abuja Catholic Archdiocese, Most Rev. Ignatius Kaigama, has predicted that there will be famine in Nigeria because of the rising insecurity across the country, particularly farmer/herders clashes which has prevented farmers from visiting their farms for planting or harvesting of produce.\n\nKaigama, in his homily delivered at Our Lady, Queen of Nigeria Pro-Cathedral Catholic Church, Abuja, yesterday, demanded urgent action from government to end rising insecurity across the country or risk unfriendly action from citizens.\n\nSaid Kaigama: \u201cIn a situation, today, when farmers are unable to go to farm due to fear of attacks and killings by bandits, kidnappers and terrorists, our food supply will be grossly limited. I hope the government will be proactive with palliatives for the inevitable hunger that will result from this. A hungry man is not only angry but is today, uncontrollably violent. I often see people rushing into the Church for Mass and some for private adoration of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n\u201cWhen I visit some rural areas, I see many lay people asking to have access to the Holy Mass regularly because they say that they receive strength, inner peace and assurance of God\u2019s healing and comfort from it. Our Gospel today is about this great gift of the body and blood of Jesus shared to His disciples.",

HRH Roman Deriabebe, HRH Samuel Sapele and HRH Amame Oru\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cOn behalf of the traditional rulers and leaders of thought, particularly of Ekeremor Local Government Area extraction in Bayelsa State, we wish to respectively refer you to the issue above and draw your attention to the restiveness of youths resulting from this clear alienation by the APC led Federal Government.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency Sir, we were highly elated by the newspaper publications naming one Elder Denyanbofa Dimaro, an illustrious son of Peretorugbene community in the Ekeremor LGA of Bayelsa State, as the Managing Director (MD) while Dr. Cairo Ojuogbo from Delta State as the chairman of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).

The invading security operatives had jumped the perimeter fence of the compound after cutting its security cable and shot in different directions. They had stormed the scene with about 15 hilux vans.\n\n\u201cIfeanyi Ejiofor, human rights lawyer, who is also the principal attorney to IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was unable to be tracked and abducted or instantly shot dead because he was hiding somewhere in his house.\n\n\u201cThe security operatives shot his personal assistant, one Samuel Uzo Okoro (Biggy) who was killed inside the compound. Unable to locate the lawyer, and having killed the personal assistant, the security operatives took his corpse into the boot of a car belonging to Ejiofor, and ordered his chief driver, fondly called Papa, to drive the car and follow them. The attackers also abducted Ejiofor\u2019s elder brother, Joel, and the lawyer\u2019s two domestic staff, Ugochukwu and Chikezie, and bundled them away.\u201d\n\nSeveral efforts made by our reporter to get across to Joel Ejiofor for his own side of the story was unsuccessful as at press time.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer, Anambra State Command, Ikechukwu Ikenga, denied having knowledge of the attack.\n\n\u201cThe headquarters is not yet aware of the said attack. We shall investigate, and get back to you, please,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Abuja Branch (Unity Bar), has condemned the attack on Ejiofor\u2019s house, describing it as barbaric. A statement by Bulus Atsen, chairman of the Abuja branch, read: \u201cIt is instructive and unfortunate to note that this assault and harassment by agents of the state on account of Mr. Ejiofor\u2019s legal representation of Nnamdi Kanu at the Federal High Court, Abuja Division, now seems to be the modus operandi of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe NBA, Abuja branch, condemns the reckless use of state powers to attack lawyers for discharging their functions pursuant to Section 36(6) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

We should do everything possible at our disposal to contribute our quota towards the peace and security of the country.\u201d\n\nThe former governor stressed that the agitation for rotation or zoning of the position of the presidency had been the greatest political quagmire for a very long time in the political growth or evolution in the country.\n\nBafarawa added: \u201cTo my knowledge, first as a Nigerian politician with considerable political and governmental experiences, I did not know when and how anybody in the country has arrived at zoning the position of the President to any zone, whether to the South or to North.\n\n\u201cI have no faintest idea that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) or even the ruling party, the All Progressive Congress (APC) has made any proclamation to the effect that the position of President is zoned to a particular section of the country.\u201d\n\nBafarawa noted that in recent times, such a sensitive issue along with other similar issues were either being canvassed or deliberately touted thereby causing a lot of political tension and widening the gap of our common unity of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt has always caused tension, bringing mistrust and threat of restructuring or secession or similar challenges signaling breakup of the country or mistrust among our major tribes and religions.\n\nBafarawa noted that politicians should be wary of making any comment bordering on the issue of zoning or rotation of the position of President to any part of the country.\n\n\u201cAt this crucial period of time when the country is enmeshed in various challenges, I use this opportunity to offer advice to our politicians as well as our numerous socio-political commentators spread across the country to delve less in politics and instead offer more constructive advice on how best the government could get the country out of this mess,\u201d he said.\n\nBafarawa stressed that offering solutions to solve the problems of insecurity and economic problems would douse the tensed atmosphere brought about by the present insecurity, and similar problems.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cI have the hope and confidence that by the time our politicians and social commentators talk less about rotational or zoning of Presidency to zones or regions thus concentrating on substantial issues affecting the country, there would be less tension and or hypes which further divide the country along regional, religious and tribal lines. \u201c\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022US, UK, EU, Canada, Ireland, Norway condemn ban\n\n\u2022FG: Microblogging site is synonymous with fake news, misinformation\n\n\u2022Telcos deactivate access to twitter handles in Nigeria\n\n\u2022AGF threatens to prosecute offenders\n\n\u2022Twitter promises Nigerians access to new platform, belatedly deletes Kanu\u2019s vile tweets\n\nTobi Soniyi, Deji Elumoye, Emma Okonji in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Olawale Ajimotokan, Alex Enumah, Michael Olugbode and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nOutraged by Nigeria\u2019s suspension of the microblogging and social media giant, Twitter, for deleting a recent tweet found offensive posted by President Muhammadu Buhari, the world yesterday condemned the decision by the federal government and concluded it was a violation of the rights and freedom of the Nigerian people to communication.\n\nSome of the diplomatic missions that expressed their displeasure against the Twitter ban included Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom,the United States of America and Norway.\n\nBut the federal government, yesterday, justified Twitter\u2019s suspension, saying the outfit had become synonymous with the spread of fake news and misinformation in the country.\n\nThis is as the Telecoms Operators (Telcos) have carried out the instruction of the industry regulator, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to suspend access to all Twitter handles in Nigeria, saying they acted in line with the instruction given to them, in the best interest and integrity of the country.\n\nTo that extent, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) has said the federal government would prosecute anyone, who violates the administrative ban on the use of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nCondemning the federal government\u2019s decision, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared as unconstitutional, illegal, null and completely of no moment a recent directive by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration to arrest and prosecute any Nigerian using Twitter.\n\nSimilarly, the Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN), in its reaction, condemned the suspension of Twitter in the country by the federal government and described it as \u201cwrong and an overreaction\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), on its part, urged the federal government to tread with caution and immediately reconsider the suspension of the operation of Twitter in Nigeria and instead, seek other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the company.\n\nSharing this view, the International Press Institute (IPI), while expressing concern over the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, described the action as detrimental to the free press in Nigeria,which it said uses twitter as a major platform.\n\nIn the same breath, the Oyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has counseled the federal government of Nigeria not to hamper the operations of thousands of businesses and services with its recent suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nOn the contrary, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has called on Nigerians to defend the country\u2019s sovereignty by supporting the federal government\u2019s Twitter suspension, saying it was in national interest.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter, yesterday promised to restore access on its new platform to all Nigerians as parts of the choices open to it in the current circumstances, even as it belatedly deleted some bile tweets by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nResponding to the backlash from the move against Twitter, the presidency though described Twitter\u2019s removal of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets as disappointing, it however, said the social media outfit\u2019s suspension has nothing to do with the removal of the President\u2019s tweet.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a release, attributed the suspension of Twitter to a lot of problems associated with the media platform including misinformation and fake news, which have had telling effect on Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe temporary suspension of Twitter is not just a response to the removal of the President\u2019s post. There has been a litany of problems with the social media platform in Nigeria, where misinformation and fake news spread through it have had real world violent consequences. All the while, the company has escaped accountability.\n\nNevertheless, the removal of President Buhari\u2019s tweet was disappointing. The censoring seemed based on a misunderstanding of the challenges Nigeria faces today.\n\nHe quoted the President as saying in his address at the United Nations General Assembly, UNGA in 2019 that, \u201cThe world was shocked and startled by the massacre in New Zealand by a lone gunman taking the lives of 50 worshippers.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, this and similar crimes, which have been fueled by social media networks risk seeping into the fabric of an emerging digital culture.\n\nHe emphasised that major tech companies must be alive to their responsibilities and that \u201cthey cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives\u201d.\n\nThis, according to him, could tear some countries apart.\n\nHe stressed that President Buhari has therefore been warning against social media\u2019s disruptive and divisive influences and the government\u2019s action is not a knee-jerk reaction to Twitter\u2019s preposterous deletion of his tweets, which should have been read in full.\n\nThe release stated: \u201cThe tweet was not a threat, but a statement of fact. A terrorist organisation (IPOB) poses a significant threat to the safety and security of Nigerian citizens. When the President said that they will be treated \u2018in a language they understand\u2019, he merely reiterated that their force shall be met with force. It is a basic principle of security services response world over.\n\n\u201cThis is not promotion of hate, but a pledge to uphold citizens\u2019 right to freedom from harm. The government cannot be expected to capitulate to terrorists. IPOB is proscribed under Nigerian law. Its members murder innocent Nigerians. They kill policemen and set government property on fire.\n\n\u201cNow, they have amassed a substantial stockpile of weapons and bombs across the country. Twitter does not seem to appreciate the national trauma of our country\u2019s civil war. This government shall not allow a recurrence of that tragedy.\u201d\n\nBut some diplomatic missions in the country have condemned the ban of twitter, insisting that free expression and access to information were the pillars of democracy.\n\nA statement jointly issued yesterday by the the diplomatic missions of Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Norway, conveyed their disappointment over Nigeria\u2019s announcement, suspending #Twitter and proposing registration requirements for other social media.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe strongly support the fundamental human right of free expression and access to information as a pillar of democracy in Nigeria as around the world and these rights apply online as well as offline.\n\n\u201cBanning systems of expression is not the answer. These measures inhibit access to information and commerce at precisely the moment, when Nigeria needs to foster inclusive dialogue and expression of opinions, as well as share vital information in this time of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe diplomatic missions, however, added that, \u201cThe path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less, communication to accompany the concerted efforts of Nigeria\u2019s citizens in fulsome dialogue toward unity, peace and prosperity. As Nigeria\u2019s partners, we stand ready to assist in achieving these goals.\u201d\n\nIn yet a separate reaction, the United States, in a statement by its Embassy in Nigeria said: \u201cNigeria\u2019s constitution provides for freedom of expression. The Government\u2019s recent #Twitterban undermines Nigerians\u2019 ability to exercise this fundamental freedom and sends a poor message to its citizens, investors and businesses.\u201d\n\nThe statement added: \u201cBanning social media and curbing every citizen\u2019s ability to seek, receive, and impart information undermines fundamental freedoms. As President Biden has stated, our need for individual expression, open public conversation, and accountability has never been greater.\n\n\u201cThe path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less communication, alongside concerted efforts toward unity, peace, and prosperity. #KeepitOn\u201d\n\nHowever, on the deactivation of access, the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), the umbrella body of all licensed telecoms operators in Nigeria, in a statement jointly signed by its chairman, Mr. Gbenga Adebayo and its Executive Secretary, Mr. Gbolahan Awonuga, yesterday, confirmed that NCC directed them to suspend access to Twitter.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cWe, the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator to suspend access to Twitter. ALTON has conducted a robust assessment of the request in accordance with internationally accepted principles.\n\n\u201cBased on national interest provisions in the Nigerian Communications \u2018Act 2003\u2019, and within the licence terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) the industry regulator. We will continue to engage all the relevant authorities and stakeholders and will act as may be further directed by the NCC. We remain committed to supporting the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and upholding the rights of citizens.\n\n\u201cAs an industry, we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly, and to enjoy privacy and security regarding their data and their use of digital communications.\u201d\n\nGiving the implications of the action of the federal government on Twitter, the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), in a statement released yesterday, said ATCON was working closely with relevant stakeholders to ensure there is a speedy resolution of the current suspension of Twitter activities in Nigeria.\n\nIn its official statement on the development, which has seen the telecoms regulator issue a directive to the service providers to deny access to the services of Twitter in Nigeria, the President of ATCON, Mr. Ikechukwu Nnamani stated that while the Association and its member companies understand the position of the federal government, the reasons for the directive, and have complied with the directive, it is pertinent that the issue is resolved soon in the interest of all.\n\nNnamani emphasised that the Over The Top (OTT) platforms of which Twitter is one, is an integral part of the digital economy that the federal government is promoting, adding, so when an unfortunate disagreement arises with respect to the user policies, it is good it is resolved in a timely manner.\n\nOther industry stakeholders, who frowned at the action of the federal government, warned against the implications, which they said may affect Nigeria most negatively.\n\nIndustry sources, however, said government seemed not to be concerned about the revenue and job losses that would come with the suspension order.\n\nAlthough they projected huge revenue losses to government and the telecoms operators in terms of revenue generation and payment of taxes, they however said revenue generation appeared not to be more important to government than protecting its authority.\n\nAGF Threatens to Prosecute Offenders\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), yesterday,said the federal government would prosecute anyone that violates the administrative ban on the use of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, Malami, in a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, said he had directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation to begin immediate prosecution of those, who violate the federal government order suspending Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, has directed the immediate prosecution of offenders of the federal government ban on Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMalami directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation at the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, to swing into action and commence in earnest the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government De-activation of operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMalami directed the DPPF to liaise with the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, National Communication Commission, NCC and other relevant government agencies to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders without any further delay.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the ban, a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, Senator Shehu Sani and others have continued to tweet.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t be my last tweet\u201d, Atiku said while criticising the ban.\n\nFormer Senator Sani while mocking the ban said: \u201cI\u2019m sure Baba will be asking about the \u2018meaning\u2019 of that VPN. Those of you from the North, if you want to tweet, take a train to Maradi in Niger Republic, tweet and return home. If you live in Lagos and want to tweet, just go to Cotonou, tweet and come back. Those of you from the South-south, who want to tweet, take a boat through your Creeks to Cameroun, tweet and come back.\u201d\n\nFani-Kayode, in a tweet on Saturday morning stated thus: \u201cThe suspension of Twitter by the FG has proved to the civilised world that they are weak, unstable, paranoid, insensitive, vindictive & delusional. It is a grave abuse of power & a perfidious, insidious & brazen attempt to deny the Nigerian people of their right to free speech.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction to the threat to prosecute offenders, a former Chairman of the Governing Council of the National Human Rights Commission, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu, wondered how the government would prosecute citizens for violating an administrative ban.\n\nHe asked: \u201cUnder what law please? The ban is an administrative directive. Lai Mohammed is not a legislature and cannot create a crime.\u201d\n\nMalami\u2019s Prosecution Order Is Illegal, Null and Void, Says PDP\n\nThe leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared as unconstitutional, illegal, null and completely of no moment a recent directive by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration to arrest and prosecute any Nigerian using Twitter.\n\nThe PDP asserted that the directive by the APC through the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, was not only downright ludicrous, but showed the frenzied desperation by the Buhari Presidency to muzzle, victimize, clamp down on innocent Nigerians and foist a totalitarian system on our country.\n\nThe PDP stated, in statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, stated that nothing in the extant laws, not even the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, constitutionally criminalised the use of Twitter by Nigerians or empowers the federal governments to arrest and prosecute any Nigerians for using Twitter.\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cFor Malami\u2019s information, section 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides that, \u2018a person shall not be convicted of a criminal offence unless that offence is defined and the penalty therefore is prescribed in a written law, and in this subsection, a written law refers to an Act of the National Assembly or a law of a state, any subsidiary legislation or instrument under the provisions of the law.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari and his APC are informed that there is no extant law that defined the use of Twitter as a criminal offence and there is no penalty prescribed in a written law for the use of Twitter by any Nigerians,\u201d the PDP explained.\n\nThe opposition stated that the APC-led federal government should also realise that the suspension of Twitter, in addition to its unconstitutionality, only suspended Twitter operations and not the use of Twitter by Nigerians.\n\nThe PDP, therefore, contended that the directive by the Attorney General to arrest and prosecute any Nigerians found using Twitter, does not have the backing of any law enacted by the National Assembly or any state legislative house, describing Malami\u2019s declaration as completely of no legal consequence.\n\n\u201cMalami\u2019s directive to arrest and prosecute Nigerians using Twitter is therefore an attempt to suspend the 1999 Constitution (as amended), a development which bears the imprints of the leaked memo in which Mr. President was reportedly advised to suspend the constitution and strip Nigerians of their rights and freedom\u201d, the main opposition party said.\n\nTwitter Suspension Is an Overreaction, Says NPAN\n\nThe Newspaper Proprietors\u2019 Association of Nigeria (NPAN) has condemned the suspension of the operation of microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in the country, describing it as \u201cwrong and an overreaction\u201d.\n\nNPAN, which took the position on Saturday in a statement by its President, Kabiru A. Yusuf, warned that the action by the federal government after Twitter deleted the tweets by President Muhammadu Buhari to the South-east insurrectionists, who have been vandalizing the symbols of state authority would not win Nigeria friends.\n\nIt, however, noted that the closure of public space would constitute a limit to public discourse and democratic advancement, further describing the ban as a futile exercise, because other platforms were more likely to suspect Nigeria\u2019s intentions towards democratic tenets and act adversarially towards the country.\n\n\u201cTwitter is a global platform for public communication that has expanded the frontiers of Free Speech and Press Freedom. It is a platform for business that has brought relief to Nigeria\u2019s youthful population, who have prospered by its operation. The NPAN believes Twitter as a business is not infallible and can be influenced through high level engagement, to be a more responsive, liberal platform of public good and not a cynical champion of suspicious causes.\n\n\u201cThere should be a compromise: Nigeria needs friends and not enemies at this critical juncture of her existence. She should not play into the hands of the enemies, who are relentless in seeking to destroy and ostracise her. Banning Twitter is regressive and should be rescinded in favour of dialogue.\u201d NPAN warned.\n\nThe newspaper proprietors also noted that it was the threat of maximum state reprisal by President Buhari that Twitter found objectionable, in line with its corporate policy, leading to sanction on the President through deletion of his tweets.\n\nIt noted that it was not the first time Twitter would sanction world leaders for infractions against its stated policy as it did so to former US President Donald Trump, to global acclaim, when the latter used the social media to spread hate and instigate insurrection by a mob, which stormed the Capitol.\n\nAlthough it faulted the federal government, the association also challenged Twitter to correct itself as its sincerity is questionable to the extent that it may have been hasty in sanctioning President Buhari while showing an uneven application of its rules against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu..\n\nAccording to NPAN, while Nigeria has retaliated with the cudgel against Twitter for alleged double standard in a hasty sanctioning of the President, the micro bloggers appeared to be pampering an unrestrained Kanu for using the same Twitter platform not just for serial hate speeches but for actually provoking and justifying violence in his separatist agitations.\n\nEditors Urge FG to Seek Legitimate Means\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has urged the federal government to tread with caution and immediately reconsider the suspension of the operation of Twitter in Nigeria by seeking other legitimate means of resolving its dispute with the company.\n\nIn a statement by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary) respectively, the NGE said the federal government\u2019s action has the unintended consequence of jeopardising the economic interests of many Nigerians, who rely on the social media platform for vital information to make informed business decisions daily.\n\nAdvising the federal government to desist from any action that would project the Nigerian government as a dictatorship, the Nigerian editors said the action was an infringement on Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution and violated the right of Nigerians to interact freely on this platform.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the suspension is a grave breach of Nigeria\u2019s international obligations under article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, and article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\n\u201cThe Guild sees the federal government\u2019s action as an overreaction to Twitter\u2019s decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet early this week. If the federal government finds Twitter\u2019s action against the President objectionable, Nigerians should not be made to suffer the collateral damage of denying them their right to freely discourse on Twitter\u201d, the Guild added.\n\nThe Guild noted that the federal government had in an initial reaction by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, condemned the deletion of President Buhari\u2019s view as an unacceptable tab on the president\u2019s right, saying that ought to have been a sufficient response.\n\n\u201cHowever, the ban at the weekend, of Twitter\u2019s operation in Nigeria, is an overkill that gives wind to the sail of critics, who daily accuse the Buhari administration of intolerance of opposing views.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the federal government has the responsibility to safeguard the unity, peace and stability of Nigeria and any person or group that threatens this must draw its ire. In expressing its anger, the federal government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinion by individual and corporate citizens,\u201d the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advised social media leaders, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those, who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of the social media platforms, the NGE explained that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying, Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\n\u201cThe Guild is aware of the democratising influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check dictatorship and promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u201cTwitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services\u201d, the Guild said, calling on the federal government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians, who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.\n\nThe International Press Institute (IPI), while expressing concern over the suspension of Twitter\u2019soperations in Nigeria, described the action as detrimental to the free press in Nigeria, which it said uses twitter as a major platform.\n\nIPI, in a statement by its President and Secretary, Kabir Yusuf and Raheem Adedoyin, however, notedthe concern of the government on the use of twitter and other social media platforms to promote hate speech and disinformation.\n\n\u201cWe urge twitter and other social media outfits to pay greater attention to the content they promote on their platforms, which violate their own rules. IPI implores the government to reverse the suspension of twitter operations in Nigeria and engage in meanigful dialogue with the social media outfit on issues of concern to the government,\u201d it stated.\n\nDon\u2019t Hamper Businesses and Services, Makinde Counsels FG\n\nOyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has counseled the federal government against hampering the operations of thousands of businesses and services with its recent suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nHe contended that the action by the Buhari administration was capable of affecting investors\u2019 confidence in the country.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Makinde called for due consideration from the government on the implications of its action, saying, \u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who has a strong presence on Twitter, said, it became imperative for him to make the statement as the country debated the ban.\n\nHe, however, warned that the decision, apart from having grave implications for the image of the country, could hamper thousands of businesses and services, which Nigerian youths promote and influence on the platform.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt has become imperative for me to release a statement regarding the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria by the federal government. As leaders, we should go beyond emotional reactions to issues and think about how our actions will affect the people we lead and our international ratings socially and economically.\n\n\u201cTwitter has become the platform for young people and indeed all Nigerians to exercise their fundamental right to express and publish an opinion. They use the platform to complain, argue and give feedback to government and its agencies who in turn, use these to improve policies. This is a fundamental point that should be kept in mind as we debate the necessity of this suspension.\n\n\u201cWe should also remember that Twitter has gone beyond a source of communication for many of our hardworking youths in Nigeria. It has become a source of livelihood for many, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious leanings. Nigerian youths and digital communications organisations earn a living from being able to use the platform to post communications on behalf of their clients.\n\n\u201cOthers who may not have physical stores also rely on Twitter to give visibility to their products and services. Furthermore, I believe the federal government should be actively interested in how certain policies and actions will affect investor confidence. I, therefore, use this medium to appeal to the federal government to reverse this suspension for the greater good of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a Challenge to Develop Own App, APC Tells Nigerians\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), last night, called on Nigerians to defend the country\u2019s sovereignty by supporting the federal government\u2019s Twitter suspension, saying apart from the fact that the decision was in national interest, it was a challenge to the Nigerian youths to develop another app.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement Saturday, said, \u201cAPC urges Nigerians talented in the development of social media/software applications to seize the opportunity of the suspension of Twitter operations in the country to develop homegrown applications that could rival existing social media platforms and meet the need of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cRussia has VKontakte (VK), China has Weibo, among several homegrown social media platforms. The APC believes that the country has the potentials and talents that can develop alternative and competitive applications to existing platforms in the world. Twitter\u2019s suspension will undoubtedly serve as a positive trigger to unleash the creative potentials of Nigerians in the global digital space.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe claimed it was a challenge to the vibrant youths with such talents, adding that they would get support in the exercise from relevant federal government agencies as well as the numerous Information and Communication Technology (ICT) training and research establishments in the country.\n\nHe recalled that the APC had earlier released a statement asking Twitter and other operators of social media pages to use their platforms to check divisive and inciting rhetoric, particularly in Nigeria.\n\nThe ruling party said it tasked them on the important responsibilities to curb fake news, disinformation and hate speech, among others, adding that evidently, \u201cTwitter failed to do this and even allowed their platform to be used by arsonists, insurrectionists and separatists in the country.\u201d\n\nTwitter Promises Nigerians Access to New Platform, Belatedly Deletes Kanu\u2019s Bile Tweets\n\nAmerican microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, has promised to restore access to its new platform to all Nigerians.\n\nA tweet by Twitter\u2019s Public Policy yesterday said open internet was an essential human right and would help Nigerians, who relied on its platform to connect with the world.\n\nTwitter made the vow in reaction to the indefinite suspension slammed on it by the Nigerian Government.\n\nMeanwhile, less than 24 hours after the federal government banned Twitter, the global microblogging platform has deleted \u2018inciting\u2019 tweets from the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, a separatist group agitating for the Republic of Biafra.\n\nIn the controversial tweet, the IPOB leader vowed to unleash terror on Nigerian soldiers deployed to the South-east.

          "text": "\u2022Already proposes June 12\n\n\u2022Sacks all commissioners to accommodate APC in new cabinet\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nWith the 2023 political permutations in focus, Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State might have concluded plans to leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC), but there are far more serious grounds why his defection might be impossible for now.\n\nThe reason is that the Supreme Court decision, which ceded the Zamfara governorship to the PDP immediately after the 2019 elections, did not consider any individual in arriving at the decision but the party, a situation which makes the opposition party the owner and sole beneficiary of the governorship and not Matawalle.\n\nAlready, arrangements are said to have been perfected for the governor to defect to the APC on June 12, where he is expected to be received by the ruling party\u2019s National Caretaker Committee Chairmanand Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nAlso, as a prelude to the defection, Matawalle had on Monday, May 31, sacked his entire cabinet, including the commissioners, special advisers, the Secretary to the State Government, Chief of Staff and the Deputy Chief of Staff in other to be able to accommodate some members of the APC in the new calculations.\n\nTHISDAY gleaned that the cabinet sack was to prevent some commissioners from refusing to defect with him and avoid the kind of backslash experienced in Ebonyi and Cross River States, where some commissioners and aides refused to go to the APC with their former principals.\n\nCuriously, however, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP has yet to officially speak on the developing story, but an informed party source hinted that having given all the political structures in the state to the governor, the PDP was at a loss as to why Matawalle wanted to leave the party.\n\nBut the source was confident that the governor would not gamble with the idea, knowing that the seat is the party\u2019s and not his, the reason the deputy governor is said to have declined being part of the defection plan, since he would be the sole beneficiary of Matawalle\u2019s false move if he eventually dared the consequences.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the governor\u2019s planned defection was due to the politics of 2023. The governor, it was learnt, has been promised a return ticket for 2023. He is currently serving his first term in office.\n\nIn 2019, the APC won all the state and national elections in Zamfara State, the PDP came second but due to the Supreme Court judgement, the PDP inherited the victory across the board.\n\nThe state was considered an APC state and it was therefore to ensure his reelection in 2023 that Matawelle was being poached to defect to the APC.\n\nAnother party source also hinted that, \u201cThere is no free ticket for him in the APC by 2023, as the former governor of the state, Abdulazizi Yari and Senator Kabir Marafa have reconciled and will surely give him a fight \u201d\n\nBut a PDP source said the APC in Zamfara State was like a shark infected water, waiting to consume the governor, if he made the mistake of defecting to the APC.\n\nIn February this year, the political feud between the two warring camps in the state chapter of the APC \u2013 Yari and Marafa \u2013 were reconciled, by the national caretaker committee of the party as part of the 2023 scheming.\n\nThe source said it was not certain whether all PDP senators and members of the House of Representatives that benefited from the Supreme Court judgement would be willing to defect with himtoo.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cIf the governor defects what will happen to the governorship ambition of Senator Marafa? Will he subdue his ambition that caused his initial political feud with former governor Yari or will he go back to the senate? If he decides to go to the Senate, what will happen to the current senator that is from the PDP?\u201d, the PDP source stated.\n\nYari, Zamfara\u2019s immediate past governor is plotting to become the national chairman of the APC, and has been at daggers-drawn with Matawalle, who became an unexpected beneficiary of the APC crisis in the 2019 primaries in the state.\n\nThe source that spoke to newsmen said Mattawlle was expected to join the APC on June 12 as ademocracy dividend to the state.\n\nSo far, two PDP governors have joined the APC. The first to dump the PDP was the Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi and he was recently followed by the Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, with Matawelle already in view, if he defected as being planned.\n\nHowever, Yari is said not to be not living any thing to chance as he still holds the ace in the state.\n\nBut a source claimed that to weaken Yari, all the states structures of the APC in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory would be dissolved soon.\n\n\u201cThis is part of the reasons APC is delaying their convocation of the national convention of the APC. By the delay, all the interests would be accommodated, including all that are defecting, so that everyone will be equal and own the structures at all levels of the party,\u201d the source explained.\n\nBut, the former governor, the source noted, would not go down without a fight, because if Mattawelle joined, the APC, he might be finished politically, as state structures are naturally in the hands of the governors.\n\nWhen THISDAY contacted PDP\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, he said, \u201cI will see the National Chairman and thereafter contact you \u201c, but he did not eventually get, even though sources claimed the opposition party was waiting for Matawalle to make the biggest mistake of his life.\n\nA PDP source said the party was in possession of intelligence report that the Zamfara governor had gone as far as seeking the opinions of some Supreme Court justices, who had told him leaving the PDP would definitely cost him the seat, based on the Supreme Court judgment of 2019.\n\nBut the governor was said to have contacted some highly placed persons in the government and party, who had allegedly assured him that they would circumvent the law for his sake and ensure he did not lose the seat.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Any continuous persuasion on Igbos to be part of United Nigeria under the current neglect is a risk and herculean task for any Igbo leader or politician, based on the evidence of the structural imbalance, threats of violence, killing sprees, harsh government's policies, and killer bandits.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the Federal government pretends to turn a blind eye to the looming dangers before the leaders or continue to believe in the fake news from their Igbo allies in the All Progressives Congress (APC), there is the possibility that the masses will sort things themselves without adherence to the directives of constituted authorities in the nearest future, which may spell doom for the nation if the Federal Government refuses to act urgently and renegotiate with South-East over marginalisation of the zone.\n\n\u201cFederal government should as a matter of urgency, relocate all federal appointees and APC leaders of Southeastern Nigeria, especially those that are residing in Abuja to come back home immediately to help solve the crisis in the region or be disengaged from the position they are occupying.\n\n\u201cIgbos want fair treatment as Nigerians and sincerely Federal Government should do more.\u201d",

It was a response to open criticism of government officials. It applied retroactively to journalists and citizens, punishable by jail time.\n\nUnder the same retired major general\u2019s supposedly democratic reawakening a generation later, the biggest independent platform for citizens to bond over grievances, where they come together to pool medical, legal and educational aid, has come under his hammer.\n\nAn infamous ban\n\nAs of the morning of Saturday June 5, most people living in Nigeria could no longer access Twitter.\n\nTelecommunications providers like MTN, Airtel and 9Mobile have cut off access to the social media app and website. Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Netflix, Shomax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not yet clear how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted. Will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow country under democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on their timeline will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but generating viral marketing content isn\u2019t as easy as it is on Twitter.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "text": "On behalf of the ownership of Farmsponsor Nig Ltd, we want to thank our sponsors for their unwavering support and trusting us as we work to improve the Agricultural sector in Nigeria.\n\nWe deeply share in your displeasure with the upset that the company has had in paying out its sponsors.\n\nThe past few days has been quite a challenge as the company has been facing some difficulties which has destabilized our crowd funding operations.\n\nThese challenge stems from the recent SEC cease announcement on all crowdfunding platforms by June 30, 2021. This has made it impractical for Farm-sponsor to continue its crowding operation as the notice came upon us abruptly, by the first week of June.\n\nWe are taking appropriate measures to see that all funds collected from every sponsor will be paid back accordingly.\n\n\n\nAn overview of Farmsponsor facilities and operational layout\n\nPlease bear with us as payments will likely be staggered. We are working to make payout as fast as possible but to be honest, it may take up to 18 \u2013 24 months to finish. Paying everyone at once will eat too deep into our operational cash flow. Let us continue to work to pay you.\n\nThe stated timeline is only but the very least. We are already working hard to see everyone is paid in the shortest of time, nevertheless we wouldn\u2019t want to disappoint twice so we have to settle for the stated projected timeframe.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that over the last two years, Farm-sponsor have accomplished a great deal, and we owe it to all your sponsorship.\n\nIn the time that we have been doing business together along with the funds you have trusted us with, we have been able to establish the following:\n\n\u2022 A 360,000-broiler Pen (biggest in South-South Nigeria).\n\n\u2022 60,000 capacity breeders pen (with over 10,000 laying breeder birds).\n\n\u2022 10 tons per hour feed mill.\n\n\u2022 24,000 per day fully automated chicken processing plant (recently installed and commissioned).\n\n\u2022 128,000 birds per week state of the art hatchery.\n\n\u2022 823 Hectares of land in Oyo State (valued above $3m).\n\n\u2022 A veterinary clinic and two retail supermarket outlets in the heart of Port Harcourt, amongst many other great features that we have achieved together.\n\nWe are just stating to make certain, perhaps you\u2019re in doubt that you have invested wisely.\n\nPart of our short term strategies is through overdraft or a term loan from some of our financial institutions. Our mid term strategy is through equity investment from institutional investors and we are willing to relinquish 30-50% of directors shares in the company. Our long term strategy would be direct revenue from the business, hence the 18-24 months.\n\nOur entire workforce is working tirelessly to ensure that we regain the trust you\u2019ve always had with Farmsponsor.\n\nIt\u2019s uneasy on our part that we are writing this letter instead of payment slips.\n\nWe apologize for any undue hardship or inconveniences that this might cause you.\n\nWe really appreciate your understanding, and support as well as believing in us as we walk this journey of emerging a stronger Farm-sponsor.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAkpa Chike\n\nCo-founder, Globetrot Farmsponsor Nig Ltd.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Just two days after a ban on microblogging platform, Twitter, the Nigerian Federal Government is reportedly working to gain control over what Nigerians can access on the Internet.\n\nIf reports by the Foundation for Investigative Journalism (FIJ) are anything to go by, the Nigerian Presidency has reached out to the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) to discuss plans to build an internet firewall.\n\nFij also reports that Ibrahim Gambari, the Chief of Staff to the President, and Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture were among those present in the meeting.\n\nThe Internet Firewall will be similar to China\u2019s Great Firewall, which allows the Chinese government to prevent access to social media platforms like Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp, and any other website it chooses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sophistication of China\u2019s Firewall also allows the government to block its citizens from using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).\n\nRecall that on June 4, 2021, the Nigerian government enforced a ban on Twitter, stating that the platform undermines the country\u2019s corporate existence. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) was also required to licence over-the-top (OTT) platforms like YouTube, Netflix, or other social media platform.\n\nThe Nigerian government has flirted with this move in the past. The Nigerian Communications Commission already has a framework to regulate OTT platforms, arguing that they negatively affect telco revenues.\n\nIn 2019, Nigerian lawmakers introduced two controversial and heavily criticised bills: The Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation and other Related Offences bill (Social Media Bill) and the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech bill.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Finance Act 2020 also contains a legal provision to tax tech giants like Google and Facebook for the revenue they make from the country.\n\nHowever, we raised a major issue: a lack of the required technical expertise to implement regulations on or collect taxes from OTT platforms.\n\nIf the Nigerian Internet Firewall comes to fruition, Internet censorship of Nigerians, social media regulations, and taxation might become possible.\n\nInterestingly, China would also add Nigeria to a list of African countries where it has a significant but questionable presence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina\u2019s Huawei helped design the African Union (AU) Headquarters in Addis-Ababa, Ethiopia, but according to Le Monde reports (in French, use Chrome to translate), the US accused China of stealing data from the AU headquarters.\n\nHuawei was also accused of helping the Ugandan and Zambian governments spy on opposition parties.\n\nFigures from Nigeria\u2019s Debt Management Office show that Nigeria\u2019s debt to China grew 136% between September 2015 and September 2020, from $1.4 billion to $3.3 billion.\n\nA significant part of that debt is a $328 million loan to install fibre optic cables in Northern Nigeria.\n\nConsequently, Nigeria\u2019s growing partnership with China could extend to much more than just building an Internet firewall.\n\nThis is a developing story.",

          "text": "On Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nHe also disclosed the government\u2019s directive to the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing all over-the-top (OTT) and social media operations.\n\nThe move has understandably drawn outrage from Nigerians who see it as yet another attack on free speech by the government. However, free speech is not the only thing affected.\n\nThe Twitter ban could also affect the country\u2019s economy. Consequently, investor confidence would weaken, and there\u2019d be a negative impact on development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2016 World Bank study found a correlation between increased broadband penetration and an increase in per capita GDP.\n\nIn addition, Internet or social media shutdowns cost sub-Saharan countries $237.4 million in 2020.\n\nWe examine how this ban could affect Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nInfluencers\n\nOver the past few years, the influencer marketing space in Nigeria has grown so much that almost anyone with dedicated followers could snag deals with organisations looking to extend their reach.\n\nThough some influencers \u2014 mostly lifestyle \u2014 use Instagram more, Twitter is the primary platform for most of them.\n\nWhile the organisations that work with them can easily use other channels for their marketing activities, it could be harder for them to do the same.\n\nAlso, while they may be able to afford VPN services, their followers who keep them in business may be unable or reluctant to do so. Either way, this does not end well for these influencers.\n\nFreelancers\n\nThe increase in Internet penetration has increased the number of people making a living off the Internet, specifically social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom social media managers to content creators and product photographers, thousands of Nigerians have created careers off these platforms. This ban puts their sources of livelihood at risk.\n\nIn a previous article, we examined how Nigerians are now using Twitter to get jobs, investors, and fill vacancies. These are all activities that a social media ban would hinder.\n\nStartups\n\nNigeria\u2019s startup scene has experienced tremendous growth in a short time, with $3,77.4 million raised in 2019, although that figure fell to $120.6 million in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis has resulted in jobs for a significant number of people and revenue in the form of taxes for the government.\n\nHowever, this ban puts all of that at risk. For most startups, their businesses depend, in some part, on social media.\n\nWithout access to social media to run marketing campaigns or build relationships with their customers, business would take a hit. Applications that are built using Twitter APIs are also affected.\n\nWhat did these humans do fgs? Block twitter and thereby blocking every other domain that has twitters apis embedded in it? React native elements, UI kitten, my components libraries are not working. I can\u2019t do my work. Wth is wrong with this country! \u2014 Mazi Juls (@AAjulibe) June 5, 2021\n\nWhile these businesses would find ways to innovate around the ban, their users may not.\n\nYou now have to add \u201chow would navigate a government ban\u201d to the type of questions you might have to answer when fundraising. \u2014 Oluyomi Ojo (@OluyomiOjo) June 4, 2021\n\nPolitical stability is one of the factors that investors consider while making investment decisions. By banning Twitter and directing the NBC to start licensing OTT services in the country, investors are not likely to jump at the opportunity of investing in Nigerian startups depriving the country of much-needed investments.\n\nMerchants\n\nSmall and medium enterprises are vital to the growth of any economy, frequently providing as much as 60-70% of the economy with jobs. Numbering about 117.4 million, SMEs in Nigeria contribute 48% of national GDP, account for 96% of businesses, and 84% of employment.\n\nMany SMEs have leveraged the Internet, especially social media, for business activities such as marketing and customer service. The number of vendors on Twitter and Instagram is a testament to this.\n\nWhile these businesses could move to other platforms, their posts might not gain as much engagement as Twitter provides. What\u2019s more? There are no assurances that a ban on other social media platforms would not follow.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Federal Government has announced that it will be indefinitely blocking access to microblogging and social media platform, Twitter, in Nigeria.\n\nOn Friday, June 4, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Ministry of Information and Culture made this move known on its Twitter and Facebook handles.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n\n\nFG Suspends @Twitter Operations in Nigeria pic.twitter.com/7z5BQ0Mi3U \u2014 Fed Min of Info & Cu (@FMICNigeria) June 4, 2021\n\nPer the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, the government made this suspension due to the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis move comes just a few days after Twitter deleted a controversial tweet made by Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari. That action had since been criticised by some government officials, and decisive action appears to have been taken.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook has also deleted the President\u2019s message on its platform. Could the hands of Nigerian law also fall heavily?\n\nOver the years, Twitter has become an important social media platform for Nigerians. Several humanitarian causes and protests have moved from hashtags to reality. #OccupyNigeria and #BringBackOurGirls are some notable ones.\n\nNigeria\u2019s latest suspension means that it could order telecom companies to block access to Twitter if this move is not fought against.\n\nRecall that there were fears of a possible Internet shutdown, or, at least of social media after Twitter aided in the #EndSARS campaign \u2014 a nationwide protest against police brutality. That led us to curate an informative piece on how to bypass an Internet shutdown in Nigeria.\n\nIt is then interesting that all it took this time was a deleted tweet, for the Nigerian government to take such drastic action.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture has also ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing other over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms going forward.\n\nIt is probably safe to state that this suspension might not end with Twitter if the NBC implements the full provisions of its broadcast code. In 2019, Nigerian lawmakers passed a Social Media Bill through a second hearing in record time, and it took several human rights bodies to pause proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all signs point to the fact that the Social Media Bill could be very much alive.\n\nSadly, Nigeria has finally joined the ranks of African countries that have implemented some form of Internet censorship.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to open its first African office in Ghana, while advertising job roles meant for Nigeria might now be deemed a masterstroke.",

I will get Special Assistants (SAs) from each ward across the six local government areas. Leaders must sit down to nominate qualified and the best people that will represent them well in government.\n\n\u201cI will appoint three persons per ward, and one of them must be a woman. During this process, there must not be quarrel or misunderstanding or I will nominate for your ward myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe plan to build a generation of young leaders as such there is an age limit for SAs. I need young people between the ages of 35 years and below,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cLeaders must meet at the local government level to nominate four persons each that will be appointed as Senior Special Assistants (SSAs). One will be supervising at the local government level, one will be with me in Benin, while the other two will be given special assignments, depending on the area. I need five nominees for each position and out of which two must be women.\u201d\n\nThe governor said each local government is entitled to one commissioner, adding that there must be five nominees, out of which two must be women.\n\n\u201cI urge all the leaders in these council areas and wards to give me their very best as I thrive to build a world-class government. These people must not be analogue but conversant with digital. All these nominations must happen before 15th of June 2021.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comr. Philip Shaibu said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to work in unity and achieve the set goals of this administration. Government can\u2019t work without your support.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nMigration is the movement of persons from their place of usual residence and across international borders to a country of which they are not national, usually for the benefit of all \u2013 country of destination and country of origin.\n\nSuch movement which are due to different factors could be immidiate or remote and could regular or irregular.\n\nIrregular migration is that movement which takes place outside the regulatory norms of the sending, transit and destination country. Those who migrate are call migrants.\n\nA migrants is any person who is moving or has moved across international borders or within a state, away from his/her habitual place of residence, regardless of the person\u2019s legal status, cause (s) of the movement and whether the movement is voluntary or involuntary.\n\nRecently, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) organised a training programme for selected journalists in the print, radio, television and digital media spread across different states of Nigeria.\n\nThis was within the framework and understanding of the role of the media in information dissemination\n\nThe three days training held in the FCT, Abuja was part of IOM awareness raising interventions designed to create positive behavioral change among potential migrants, their families and friends to make safe and informed migration related decisions and promote the positive impact returning migrants bring to their home communities.\n\nBeyond awareness raising, the training was aimed at building the capacity of participants in providing legal, ethical and well informed migration related reporting, with focus on data analysis and reporting, migration and challenges of COVID-19, interviewing migrants and their families, especially vulnerable migrants, social media, migration and technology, migration terminologies, human rights, mental health psychosocial support in reporting, gender and migration, as well as working with editors in migration reporting, among others.\n\nIt was also aimed at equipping them with the requisite knowledge to adequately situate migration related matters in the public domain, besides being a platform to strengthen existing partnership between IOM and the media organisations.\n\nAlso, in line with the concept of bridging capacity gap in reporting on migration, the Civil Society Network on Migration and Development (CSOnetMADE) organised a 2-day Capacity Building Workshop for Media Agencies on Migration Reportage in the South-South region of Nigeria.\n\nIt was a follow up to a similar one in the South-East and North-West, with a prospect of another in the North-Central.\n\nIt was in recognition of the fact that in the context of migration, the media are crucial in delivering verified information, informed opinion, as well as balanced and incisive narrative.\n\nCSOnetMADE believes that the madia contribute and shape public, political perception on all aspects of life, including migration.\n\nFor instance, such perception portrays migration as a problem, rather than a multi-faceted global phenomenon, with a variety of challenges and opportunities.\n\nNowadays, migration is largely illustrated by scenes of boat crowded with migrants risking their lives to reach Europe.\n\nIt believes that the media reportage and use of concepts in reporting these scenario have not always been done with appropriate terminologies and understanding of the core migration concern, a development which presented some challenges for policy makers and service providers to effectively respond to the situation.\n\nThe fundamental questions that arose from the 2-day workshop were, how are\n\nmigration issues reported and documented by Nigerian media? How do the media portray migrants and migration? Are madiamen/women properly trained and equipped to report migration related matters?\n\nTo CSOnetMADE, \u201cIt is imperative for the media to understand migration issues if they, as relevant stakeholder of the Nigeria migration management mechanism must add value to migration governance and awareness creation on regular and irregular migration.\u201d\n\nFew days later, IOM organised a Town Hall meeting with key stakeholders for the purpose of establishing ways and links on how to integrate migration discussions in schools so as to bring about increased knowledge and awareness on the risk of irregular migration, human trafficking and smuggling of migrants.\n\nIt was also meant to promote the tenets of safe migration practices, as well as provide avenue for social cohesion for returned migrants to reduce stigma and help them reintegrate into the society.\n\nThe key stakeholders included the National Orientation Agency (NOA), Edo State Ministry of Education, Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Private School Owners Association and the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP).\n\nTown Hall meeting is one of the numerous avenues through which Migrants as Messengers (MaM), a project facilitated by IOM engages key stakeholders in communities to proffer solutions aimed at addressing the challenges of migration.\n\nMaM is a migrants centered approach to awareness raising \u2013 giving returned migrants opportunity to share their experiences, with IOM providing the platform.\n\nIt is a peer to peer awareness raising campaign through volunteer returned migrants to empower young people in Nigeria and some other West Africa countries to make informed decisions.\n\nTown Hall meeting also provide a platform for returned migrants to showcase their contributions toward addressing irregular migration by promoting safe and orderly migration, as well as sharing experiences and information as to opportunities in their home communities.\n\nThe move by IOM, though novel, is a demonstration of commitment to working with different cadre of journalists in promoting safe migration, telling stories of returnees and the benefits of migration without prejudice to the fact that migration also has its negative side.\n\nAs the United Nations Migration Agency, IOM in collaboration with other stakeholders between April 2017 and January 2021 facilitated the voluntary return of 17,359 Nigerians migrants from 22 countries, including Libya, Niger, Mali and other transit/destination countries.\n\nThe figure is made up of 10,141 males and 7,218 females. A further breakdown of the figure indicated that 12,667 returnees were between the 18 and 35 years; 2,436 were between 36 and 45 years; 1,640 were between 0 and 12 years; 363 were between 46 and 53 years; 153 were between 13 and 17 years while 100 were between 54 and 66 years.\n\nOf the total figure, Edo State has the highest figure of 38.1 percent, followed by Delta, 22.6 percent and Ogun State with 6 percent.\n\nThey were provided with immidiate protection and reintegration under the EU-IOM Initiative for Migrants Protection and Reintegration.\n\nIOM also act with its partners in the International and local communities to assist in meeting operational challenges of migration, advance understanding of migration issues as well as encourage social and economic development.\n\nHowever, since 2001 when IOM began operation, it has been in the vanguard of, not only promoting safe migration, it has also assisted migrants find meaning in life.\n\nThrough behavioral Change Communication (BCC) campaigns, outreaches, media reports, IOM seeks to equip vulnerable migrants with the information they need to migrate safely and access assistance when necessary, hence the setting up of three Migrants Resource Centre, each in Abuja, Lagos and Benin City in Edo State.\n\nThe centers offer free information services on migration options to empower potential Nigerian Labour Migrants make informed decisions.\n\nIOM offers Technical Support for the implementation of Labour Migration policy Action Plan which aims at managing labour migration and mobilising diaspora for international development.\n\nIt helped review the National Labour Migration Policy and the National Policy on Migration to ensure that emerging migration issues were well captured and facilitated the high level meeting that led to the adoption of draft and final policies.\n\nIOM aims to address the root causes of vulnerability to trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants through engagement with the media and targeted interventions at the individual, household, commmunity and structural levels.\n\nFor instance, it provides mental health psychosocial support and counseling, not only to returned migrants, but to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).\n\nMore often than not, the most vulnerable get additional support through reintegration assistance.\n\nA case in point is one Sandra (not real name), an AVR after four years harrowing experience in Libya courtesy of IoM presently operates an hair dressing saloon in the outskirt of Benin City.\n\nShe disclosed to this writer that barely few months after her return, not been able to integrate speedily and in what seems to her as IoM delay in assisting her with empowerment tools, set out to return to Libya, but for the later and timely intervention by IoM with empowerment tools worth over #800,000.\n\nToday, she operates a thriving hair dressing saloon.\n\nAVR (Assisted Voluntary Returnee) include those who traveled for economic reasons, unaccompanied children and survivors of trafficking. IoM assist them with travel logistics and flights. Many receive protection support as well.\n\nOver the years, and based on partnership, IoM has supported efforts of Nigeria government to manage migration, while strong collaboration has established with stakeholders on migration, both nationally and internationally in order to enhance border management, fight human trafficking, reduce irregular migration and mainstream migration policy decisions.\n\nIts migration policy based research contributes to evidenced-based policies on migration that address the needs of migrants and supports the national capacity to address them.\n\nAs at today, IOM is a reputed UN agency that promotes migration policies and legislation which are coherent, comprehensive and in line with national realities and which correspond to international norms and good practices.\n\nIt is a leading and accredited inter-governmental organisation working with migrants and government to respond to contemporary migration challenges. It is well positioned to build on its grassroots experience and provide guidance on migration policy. It provides information, advice and support to further the efforts of its stakeholders to develop effective national, regional and global migration management policies and strategies, as well as contributes to increased dialogue between migration stakeholders at bilateral, regional and global levels.\n\n...",

Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe statement, coming a day after millions in the Southeast mourned their dead, 54 years after the state of Biafra was proclaimed, after coups and counter coups and systemic massacre of people of Eastern origin, triggering the bloody 30-month civil war, did not sit well with many who saw it as a threat to repeat the events of the war, amid security concerns in the region.\n\nReacting to the statement, President-general of Ohanaeze, Professor George Obiozor at a press conference in Enugu on Friday, described as unfortunate, what he called the \u201cshock threat\u201d by President Buhari, stressing that \u201cshock and awe\u201d was reserved for enemies and not citizens, appealing to the Federal Government to reconsider the use of force in addressing the nation\u2019s challenges.\n\nObiozor emphasized that Ndigbo would not support the breakup of the country, but would resist any attempt to make them victim of Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\nHe noted that majority of Nigerians prefer unity to secession, adding, however, that such unity should exist in an atmosphere of justice, peace, equity and fairness.\n\nThe Ohanaeze president also gave backing to the declaration of May 30 as \u2018Biafra Day\u201d by Southeast governors, saying the time to mourn or remember the dead was traditionally a solemn occasion.\n\nHe said it was imperative and proper for Ndigbo to remember their own who died across the country either in genocide or the civil war in Nigeria between 1967 and 1970.\n\nObiozor, also called on the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Igbo youths to employ dialogue as a means for resolving current challenges facing Ndigbo, noting that there was nothing to celebrate in violence.\n\n\u201cWe cannot change our lots and situations by steering and provoking hatred amongst ourselves, raining insults and abuses on ourselves and declaring war against those who disagree with your own ideas and approach to resolving our common problems,\u201d said.\n\nObiozor, who expressed sadness over the situation of things in Igboland, especially increased extra-judicial killings, urged the Federal Government to take note of \u201congoing human rights violations in the Southeast zone, adding: \u201cWe must beware of its international consequences and domestic implications in our ability to heal the Nigerian nation. Nigeria is at crossroads of its history and destiny. Let wisdom prevail.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that dialogue was the panacea to the challenges facing the country, saying it was patriotic. He added that the international community was expecting the Nigerian leadership to resolve the present national crises and not by military action.\n\n\u201cTo secure Nigeria, to develop Nigeria and to have peace, the Federal Government should immediately engage all Nigerian groups through their various leaders in an urgent dialogue.\n\n\u201cDialogue is what patriotic Nigerians and the international community is now expecting of Nigerian leadership to resolve the current problem,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated that using violent means to solve national problems had always led to national fractionalisation, anarchy and eventual disintegration, adding that Nigerians must recognise the historical fact that in any society where injustice becomes the rule of law, \u201cresistance becomes a duty or an obligation.\u201d",

          "title": "TB Joshua: Our helper is gone, Synagogue members, residents mourn",
          "text": "By Taiwo Okanlawon\n\nSympathisers and mourners at the Synagogue Church of all Nations (SCOAN) have described the late Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua as a great father and their helper who would be missed.\n\nJoshua, who died on Saturday night, few days to his 58th birthday which is June 12, was born in 1963, in Arigidi-Akoko, Ondo State.\n\nFollowing the news of his death, church members and sympathisers thronged the church looking dejected and in tears to either confirm the news of his demise or to come and express their grief and sadness.\n\nSpeaking to PM NEWS in separate interviews at the Church located at Ikotun, Lagos State, many said the death of the founder and leader of SCOAN, was \u201cunbelievable and shocking\u201d.\n\nSome also described the clergyman as an epitome of humility, a true man of God, a philanthropist, amongst others.\n\nThey said that Joshua would be greatly missed by his followers and those seeking miracles for their challenges from all over the world.\n\nMrs. Mary Inyang, who is an elder in the church, described him as a man filled with the Holy Spirit. She said that God has only called him home to rest and that she would not cry; but celebrate his life.\n\n\u201cThe man is resting at the bosom of Abraham\u201d, she said.\n\nOn who takes over as the leader of the church, she said: \u201cGod has enough people to do his work. Nobody knows who that will be, but time will tell.\u201d\n\nMr. Lucky Inaba, another member of the church said he was perplexed and dumbfounded when he heard the news of the prophet\u2019s passing, and that the void he has left behind would be very difficult to fill by another person.\n\n\u201cThe man of God was a philanthropist and a great man. Whatever business you see people doing around this environment is because of the input of the man of God. He made this community not to feel the impact of COVID-19 by providing for everyone to the best of his ability. He also maintained decorum and respected the government\u2019s directives while doing so.\n\n\u201cWe are very sad as a church and as a community. We didn\u2019t see this coming. But if it is the will of God to take him from us, we have no choice but to accept our fate. We have lost a great man. Not just the Bolorunpelu community, Alimosho local government, or Lagos; people all over the world are in great pains from this huge loss\u201d, he said.\n\nJesus of Alimosho is gone \u2013 Bolorunpelu resident\n\nAhmed Sikiru who is an indigene of Bolorunpelu the host community of SCOAN compared him to Jesus, saying \u201cJesus of Alimosho is gone\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can replace him in death if I have the opportunity. I love him that much, because he has done so many things for me and my community.\n\n\u201cWhen our electric transformer blew up due to too much load on it, he got two brand new ones for us the next day without asking for anything in return.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to appreciate his kind gesture, he gave us four trailer loads of rice and N500,000. He fed us well during COVID-19 and gave us money so that we won\u2019t go hungry. \u2018Jesus of Alimosho\u2019 is gone. President and Governors in Nigeria cannot do half of what he did for us single handedly.\n\n\u201cWhen the Baale of Bolorunpelu community died, he donated one million for his burial this month. He was a great human being and a man of the people. We love him, but God loves him most. So we will take solace in that.\u201d\n\nAnother sympathiser, Jackson Ovie-Johnson, described the late Joshua as \u2018a practical Jesus\u2019.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe late prophet was my mentor and spiritual father. He knows my face spiritually and physically. It was he who reconciled me with my wife when my marriage collapsed after 21 years.\n\n\u201cMy father has gone to heaven, just like Elijah, and I am not surprised because he always preached in parables. Just yesterday, I was watching him perform miracles and then he said there is time for everything but people didn\u2019t understand him.\n\n\u201cI just want to hear his voice. He is an example, a practical Jesus Christ in the physical for my generation.\u201d\n\nMrs. Abraham Victoria said of the prophet: \u201cDuring Christian and Islamic festivals, he gives us money and trailer loads of bags of rice to celebrate. He once healed my brother of appendix. He was a true man of God.\n\n\u201cI came from Abuja for the burial of my father, the Otun of Bolorunpelu which we did last week. Pastor TB Joshua contributed immensely to that. He helped the widows and needy in this community tremendously; and to a great extent, Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\u201cOur community is in pains. We have lost an irreplaceable gem. We will miss his charitable works and help to our community.\n\nMr. Vincent Uche, a resident in the community said that TB Joshua has completed his work on earth and is gone, leaving behind a good legacy.\n\n\u201cHe has left a big shoe to fill. Other men of God in the country need to step up. My worry now is that there are a lot of widows who rely on him for survival. What will happen to them? Though I am not a full member of the church, but I have been living around here since 1994, and I observe and see things happen. What will happen to all these people he has been helping?\u201d He asked.\n\nMr. Ibrahim Jimoh, an indigene of the community described the prophet as a cheerful giver.\n\n\u201dHe gives us money anytime his car passes. When we heard of the news yesterday, we didn\u2019t believe initially and said it was a rumour; not until people started gathering and the flags were flown at half-mast. We have been out since 3 am mourning his demise.\n\n\u201cHe was an easy going person who was always willing to help others. He was a strong pillar in this community and we will miss him terribly. He can never be replaced. There will never be another like him.\u201d\n\nFatima Badru, who resides and owns a shop in the area, described the deceased as generous man of God.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe late prophet did well to everyone around. We enjoyed great security of our goods and property because of him. Whenever you meet him, you are sure of getting something tangible.\n\n\u201cWe can feed for about four months without buying anything with our money because of the late prophet.

          "text": "Prominent contender in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, Chief George Moghalu, has expressed confidence he\u2019ll emerge as the preferred All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate should the party go for consensus.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the national secretariat of APC after submitting his nomination and expression of interest forms, Moghalu noted that winning the Anambra State Governorship election would require consensus of the political elites across party lines, adding that for APC to win the election \u201cwe have to generate this consensus and we have to do that only with a candidate that is generally acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe party chieftain said, \u201cIf I must be honest with you, I will wish there is consensus and that consensus will be me but the truth about it is that, I know a good number has collected forms and I know a good number has returned their forms but that is not to say that there is still no room for discussion.\u201d\n\nThe constitution of the ruling APC allows for direct primary, indirect primary and consensus as the three options for conducting primary election to produce its candidate.\n\nThere is presently no sign of the party adopting the consensus option but Moghalu remains upbeat there is possibility of discussion in that direction.\n\n\u201cIn politics, 24 hours is a long time. I\u2019m sure that consultations will still take place. People will look at the possibility of working together but the important thing here is that, as I always said, every person is qualified to be governor. So I respect that belief as we go along.\n\n\u201cSince Consensus is not the only option, it is either direct primary, indirect primary or consensus. Since it is part of the option available to us, I don\u2019t see why we cannot exploit it because the important thing is that we remain united as a political party, that we remain together because if we are together, the likelihood of being stronger is there. So that door is not shut. I\u2019m sure that we could still exploit that option.\n\nWhile emphasizing that the election of November 6 will not be a tea party, but rather a strong contest as every party will come to the election with their best with the desire to win, the party chieftain expressed confidence that he has got enough experience to match the demands of the election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming to the business with experience, with knowledge, with capacity, with integrity, with courage and determination to win the election. So I want to once again say thank you to all of you who accepted to be with me at this time,\u201d Moghalu said.\n\nSpeaking earlier while receiving the submitted forms from the aspirant, secretary to the national caretaker committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, assured that the party will ensure that a level playing ground is provided for all the aspirants at the forth coming party primary.\n\nUdoedehe maintained that the party has no anointed candidate and it is ready to work with who ever emerge at the primary.",

          "text": "Digital Rights Advocay Group under the aegis of Paradigm Initiative has said that the Federal Government\u2019s (FG), s uspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria violates the rights of citizens.\n\nIt explained that the directive by the Nigerian government is at its core, an abuse of the rights of Nigerians not just to freedom of expression, but many other rights guaranteed in the Nigerian 1999 Constitution (as amended), the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Righ ts.\n\nThe group in a statement said that the suspension, which is a reaction of the Nigerian government to the company\u2019s enforcement of its platform rules, is aimed at insulating the government from criticism, especially by Nigeria\u2019s youth who are over 70% of the country\u2019s population.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria announced its suspension of Twitter operations, that the application can be used as a platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians read the announcement of the ban on Twitter as a reflection of the importance of the platform and other digital (social media) platforms to Nigerians in accessing information and disseminating the same.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that Nigeria\u2019s President has notably been insulated from every form of public accountability. He is perhaps the only president since the country\u2019s return to democracy in 1999 who never grants live interviews or holds media chats. This move is therefore aimed at making him unaccountable to the people of Nigeria who constantly take to social media platforms to share their views on the actions and policies of the government.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that shutting down Twitter is illegal and illegitimate policies such as this are unacceptable!\n\n\u201cA 2016 United Nations resolution affirms that the rights that citizens have offline must apply online. Coincidentally, this resolution was co-sponsored by Nigeria with others. We urge the Nigerian authorities to respect and enforce citizens\u2019 fundamental rights as provided for by the Nigerian constitution and International human rights treaties that Nigeria is a party to\u201d.\n\nThe group added that it will further contact the Ministry of Information to get exact details of the announcement, and the legal framework that supports such undemocratic pronouncement.\n\nThe group, however, advised all users of Twitter and other social media platforms in Nigeria to download virtual private networks (VPNs) to enable them to continue to use the platforms for their economic survival and social and political engagements while they all push back on this draconian order by the Nigerian government.",

          "text": "At least 20 people have been allegedly killed in Igangan, one of the towns in Ibarapa North local government area of Oyo State, southwest Nigeria, as unknown gunmen Saturday night opened fire on the community.\n\nIt was learnt that the palace of the the royal father Asigangan as well as a popular petroleum station were not spared as they were razed by the suspected bandits numbering 50, who were said to have invaded the town around 11 pm in more than 20 motorcycles.\n\nThis is coming few days after the Chairman of Oyo State Security Network codenamed, Amotekun Corps, General Kunle Togun (rtd), alleged that foreign Fulanis have encamped the entire Southwest region and may strike if nothing is done urgently.\n\nWhile confirming the attack, a former caretaker chairman of the council, Tunji Omolewu, said he had to rush down around 5 am (Sunday).\n\nAccording to him, \u201dPeople had barely retired to bed when they said they sighted motorcycles entering the town. Before our people could know what was going on, they had started killing people. I got the call around 11 pm. We were on our way from Ekiti where we had gone to do the Yoruba nation rally.\n\n\u201cI got to Ibadan around 12 am and when the calls did not stop coming, I decided to come home. I have counted more than 20 dead bodies.\n\n\u201cThe palace of our monarch was torched. Adolak filling station too was burnt. We are assembled here\u201d he said, almost breaking down in tears.\n\nAlso a former caretaker Chairman of neighbouring Ibarapa Central, Yemi Akinlabi, who is holidaying in the United States of America, said his phone was bombarded with calls.\n\n\u201dIt is so sad. Only few days ago, our people got intelligence report and forwarded it to the appropriate quarters for action but here we are today. Are we going to continue to live in fear in our land?\n\n\u201cI have spoken to General Toogun about last night\u2019s incident and we would want him and his team to do something. Our people must not be allowed to resort to self-help,\u201d he added.\n\nIt could be recalled that last Wednesday, during the tour of projects to mark his two years in office, Governor Seyi Makinde had disclosed that insecurity in Ibarapaland has been the most challenging and that his government has put in place several measures, including the creation of a Base for Operation Burst in the area and deployment of more Amotekun corps, among others.\n\nHe added that these measures have yielded positive results in the last few months.\n\nThe governor has however confirmed the latest attack,stating that security operatives are already on the spot for thorough investigation.\n\nA brief remark posted on his official Facebook timeline quoted Makinde as saying that he received the news of the attack on resident of Igangan in the early hours of the morning.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have received the shocking news of the attacks on residents of Igangan, Ibarapaland, in the early hours of this morning.\n\n\u201cI am currently being briefed on the incidents. I urge residents to remain calm as security operatives are now in control of the situation.\u201d\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan",
