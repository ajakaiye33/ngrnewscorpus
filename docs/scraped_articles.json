          "title": "Poor infrastructure affecting our money transfer business \u2013 Postmaster-General",
          "text": "The Postmaster-General, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Nigerian Postal Services speaks with SAMI OLATUNJI on how NIPOST operates as a regulator and service provider in the fast-changing, highly competitive logistics sector\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted logistics and supply chains, there has been an increasing need to explore beyond traditional methods of business operations. What is NIPOST doing currently to rebrand logistics in Nigeria?\n\nThe pandemic brought about several challenges to our operations as postal operator. We are the designated postal operator for Nigeria. The problem that happened following the pandemic was that the entire global postal operations stopped because of the closure of several borders. During the pandemic, it was difficult. Sixty per cent of our revenue comes from the export of items, particularly mails, parcels and cargoes. During the pandemic, all of these stopped. Although the pandemic abated, the fallout of it is still living with us today. That is why we have these global prices of food going up, and we still have the problem of inflation, which cuts across the world. It is not only Nigeria and Africa, even the United States and the other parts of the world are affected. The Russia-Ukraine crisis also compounded inflation. The truth of the matter is that every postal administration globally needs to come back and tinker with its processes and operations in order to remain relevant. For us, we also have to remain on alert. We need to continue to work around and do the needed things to catch up. What we have done since the pandemic abated was to look at how we can engage positively and leverage technology by building sustainable partnerships with organisations, especially those who have done a lot of work in the area of logistics. Logistics as you know is one of the major thriving businesses in our environment today. Our own role actually has to do with even regulating the logistics operators in Nigeria, most particularly because we have seen incidences where most of the operators are now using their platforms to cause security problems. So, we had to do something about that. In the area of rebranding, we signed an agreement with Egypt for a fleet management platform. We have also signed agreements with owners of vehicles and motorcycles. They are used to pick up and deliver parcels across the country. We started with Lagos and we are coming to Abuja.\n\nIn terms of security, you mentioned that some logistics service providers use their platforms to move around weapons and contrabands. What is NIPOST doing to ensure that dangerous/contraband weapons and equipment are not moved from one point to another via courier or mail?\n\nThe starting point was when we met with the leadership of the NDLEA. During the meeting, they told us that the problem with many of the courier logistics operators in the country is that in many instances they use those motorcycles to traffic drugs and weapons. So, what we have done is to have some kind of understanding with the NDLEA, which means that for every registered operator that we licensed, we sent the list of the names of the company, their location and directors to the NDLEA. So, if you are riding your motorcycle on the road and you are accosted, they have the up-to-date list and if your name is not on the register, they will impound the vehicle.\n\nWith increasing competition in the logistics sector in Nigeria, some people claim NIPOST may become irrelevant in a few years. In light of this, how is NIPOST staying ahead of its competition? Also, how do you create a balance as a service provider and a regulator?\n\nThis has always been the most interesting part of the work we do. NIPOST has been regulating and also been an active part of this logistic chain for so many years. That is why one of the major complaints of the operators is that it is not right for us to be an operator and regulator at the same time. That has been taken into account in the new NIPOST Bill, which is at the National Assembly. That has been the issue. It is better to separate these two functions. Even though we are serving both ends of the market, we have managed to ensure that it does not affect the way we operate.\n\nSome courier and logistics companies complain about high licensing fees and over-taxation by NIPOST and state government agencies. What is the agency doing to address this?\n\nThere is nothing like over-taxation because we don\u2019t collect taxes. The only thing we collect is the licensing fee. If you want to run a courier operation in Nigeria, you must be licensed. That is what the law says. So, nobody is overtaxing anybody. However, there is a natural process in our country that people will shout to the rooftop once a little input is made. For instance, when we were doing the new regulatory framework (2020/21), the last time that such reform took place was in 1992. So we were still charging for licences the price of 1992 in 2020. That is not feasible given what has happened in the industry. So, there was nothing like overtaxing.\n\nThere has been a proliferation of courier and logistics companies in Nigeria, and there have been complaints of poor regulation on the part of NIPOST. How would you react to this?\n\nInterestingly, on the issue of monitoring, we have done a lot of work in the recent past. Since last year, when the new regulatory framework took effect, the operation has been continuous. We have a monitoring task force in Lagos, Benin, Abuja, and we are still going around. It has been very effective because in some peculiar cases like in Edo State, the government invited us to a roundtable; it also invited their courier and logistics companies and we worked out an agreement that provided an opportunity for them to pay for their licences based on a plan. How much are we talking about? N250,000 for the lowest end of the market-the SMEs; and we are saying you can break it down and pay monthly. It is also designed to make life easy for the operators. I don\u2019t think we have done anything that is not consistent with making the operators to enjoy very smooth operations. But at the same time, we will not allow operators who are not licensed, to use the logistics service to defraud innocent citizens. We have reported cases of firms collecting products for delivery and they suddenly disappear with the products. But if they are registered, we will fish them out.\n\nThe minimum postage price was moved to N250 last year from N50. Will there be another increase this year or any time soon in line with the rising cost of logistics?\n\nThe truth of the matter is that with the level of inflation now, what we have seen is the cost of operation rising by the day. At the moment, we have not come up with any upward review. We have hardly actually started implementing the new price policy, which was launched late last year. We are watching and if there is a need along the way for an upward review, we will explore. But I am sure you know it is a very technical thing. We do not just sit down and increase the price. It goes through a lot of discussions. There is actually an inter-ministerial committee that sits to look at this, using the template provided by the Universal Postal Union. So, it is not something that we can sit down and do by ourselves. But we will be watching the market to ensure that as we are increasing, we are able to close the gap in such a way that we will not be increasing every year.\n\nNIPOST is involved in some international money transfers. What have been the challenges around remittances and what are you doing to address them?\n\nThis is another area where we are looking to enhance our revenue. In the face of declining revenue coming from parcels and letters, we are trying to explore other areas to galvanise ourselves to enhance our revenue. I think the major issue we face has been mainly due to infrastructure deficiency in our country. The way the International Money Transfer operates is that we have the clearing house in the UPU. They have a very strict regulation as to the transaction cycle \u2013 if we originate a transaction today, when should that transaction finish. And it is very strict \u2013 within three days-you must complete that cycle. But we have seen a situation whereby it is either the Internet is down or the Central Bank of Nigeria is unable to respond in time. All of these have slowed down our performance in that area. We have had consultation with the Central Bank of Nigeria, and we have been assured that things will get better.\n\nWhat role is NIPOST playing in eCommerce and other sectors of the economy?\n\nThe eCommerce is one area we are pushing so hard to get a properly designed application. We have an application called Postagy, which will leverage all eCommerce platforms. Amazon and Alibaba are coming to operate in Nigeria through our Postagy platform. Once that happens, we will further enrich capacity to push things into national space. E-commerce has been expanding since the pandemic, and we expect that this will continue as we move on. Also, we are contributing to Nigeria in several ways. For instance, NIPOST is also involved in the distribution of support to the rural community through the cash transfer programme. We have just completed the third tranche of the distribution to states like Kebbi, Enugu, and Uyo. Most importantly, the role that we play should be seen from the perspective of an agency of government that plays a critical role in moving goods from one place to another, moving cargoes, mails and parcels. And substantially, our operation is subsidised.",

This was from the total revenue generated in December 2021.\n\nThe amount disbursed comprised N560.07bn from the statutory account, N5.15bn from the Exchange Gain difference, and N201.26bn from Valued Added Tax. The Federal Government received a total of N279.46bn from the N766.47bn, while states and local governments received a total of N221.19bn and N163.88bn, respectively. The sum of N35.30bn was shared among the oil-producing states from the 13 per cent Derivation Fund.\n\nIn February 2022, the FAAC disbursed the sum of N692.86bn to the three tiers of government from the total revenue generated in January 2022.\n\nThe Federal Government received a total of N204.58bn from the N692.86bn, while the states and local governments received a total of N179.25bn and N131.88bn, respectively.\n\nFigures for March 2022 showed that the FAAC disbursed the sum of N722.38bn to the three tiers of government from the total revenue generated in February 2022. The amount disbursed comprised N457.03bn from the statutory account, N80.00bn from the Non-oil Excess account, N7.48bn as Excess Bank Charges, and N177.87bn from Valued Added Tax. The Federal Government received a total of N236.18bn from the N722.38bn, while states and local governments received a total of N190.01bn and N140.61bn, respectively.\n\nCumulatively, the sum of N2.18trn was disbursed by the FAAC to the three arms of government in the first three months of 2022.\n\nHowever, the N2.18tn is lower than N2.24tn disbursed in the preceding quarter, Q4 2021.\n\nOther remittances were made to the revenue-generating agencies comprising Nigeria Customs Service, Federal Inland Revenue Service, and Department of Petroleum Resources.\n\nFurther breakdown of the disbursements showed remittances to FGN consolidated revenue account, the share of derivation and ecology, revenue for the development of natural resources; and allocation to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nAccording to a professor of Economics at Covenant University, Jonathan Aremu, the decline in FAAC allocation to the three tiers of government is not unconnected with a decline in government revenue in recent months.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s simple. The money that is allocated around the three tiers of government depends on what comes in. Then the indication is that what is coming in is becoming low. That\u2019s the simple logic. That\u2019s just an indication that the money coming into the Federal purse is going down. That\u2019s the meaning.\u201d",

God said Emenike \u2018ll be Abia\u2019s next gov \u2013 Rep Onyejeocha\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nThe governorship candidate of the All Progressive Congress, APC, in Abia State, High Chief Ikechi Emenike, has said that his candidacy has never been in dispute, insisting that contrary to any claim by anybody, he is the authentic flag bearer of the party in the 2023 Abia governorship contest.\n\nChief Emenike who made the clarification weekend while handing APC National and state House of Assembly candidates, acknowledgement letter of the acceptance of their candidature by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, said any other claimant to the governorship ticket in Abia was hallucinating.\n\nHe said that it was only his name that was submitted by the party to INEC and acknowledged by the electoral umpire as the party\u2019s flag bearer for the 2023 governorship poll in the state, challenging any other claimant to show proof of INEC acknowledgement.\n\n\u201cTheir fabricated result is not anywhere near our national secretariat. Somebody collecting money from them wanted to smuggle it in but was resisted\u201d.\n\nEmenike advised media organisations against addressing any other person as Abia APC governorship candidate as the party has only one governorship flag bearer in the state.\n\n\u201d If anybody is claiming to be candidate, ask him: why is he going to court? You don\u2019t need to go to court if you are sure you are the authentic candidate.\n\n\u201d Ask the person to show his INEC acknowledgement letter. We have gone past the primaries. We are now faced with election.\u201d\n\nEmenike, who said that Abia APC had united behind him at an earlier reconciliation meeting at Ntalakwu Oboro, however, acknowledged that there were other groups in the party that were on their way to the mainstream.\n\nHe urged party faithful to make sacrifices to accommodate the returnees at their various wards and council areas for peace and unity.\n\nThe APC governorship candidate urged his supporters not to discriminate against the returnees or tag them moles of other parties but to concede positions to thrm where necessary as part of sacrifices for unity.\n\nHe promised to create institutions where there would be enough room for people from other states in Abia and make the state a role model in the country.\n\nChief Emenike appealed to Abians to unite behind him to rescue the state from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, who he alleged, had ruined the state.\n\n\u201cOur stakeholders are sacrificing because they believe that Abia is so decayed and needs a change\u201d.\n\nThe Development Economist who said that his major preoccupation was how to rebuild the state, declared that APC would win the 2023 polls by landslide both in Abia and at the centre.\n\n\u201cAnybody saying that APC will not win 2023 is asleep. APC will win by landslide both in Abia and Abuja. Don\u2019t be deceived by social media.\n\n\u201cWhen the battle starts they will know we are prepared\u201d, Emenike boasted.\n\nHe, however, urged all candidates and party faithful to work hard to deliver the party, in the collective interest of all.\n\nSpeaking at the gathering, the Deputy Whip, House of Representatives and member representing Isuikwuato-Umunneochi federal consituency, Rep. Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, said God had told her that Emenike would be Abia\u2019s next Governor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe what I see, I believe what God has said. God has said that Chief Ikechi Emenike will be next Abia Governor. Don\u2019t doubt so that you see it because if you doubt you may not be alive to see it.\u201d\n\nOnyejeocha tasked the party faithful to work hard to deliver APC in their various booths, urging them to be visible in their wards and not on only on social media.\n\nThe four time Rep member also urged members to accommodate the returnees to the party, saying that the support of everyone is needed to secure victory for the party in 2023.\n\n\u201cEverybody must work hard. Don\u2019t expect any surprised results. Know those supporting you. I count my own results before going into election. It\u2019s not by magic\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn a remark, the pioneer Chairman of the party, Mr Fabian Okonkwo, said the contention over the governorship ticket of the party had been laid to rest following the acknowledgement of Emenike as the authentic governorship candidate of the party in Abia.\n\n\n\nOkonkwo said that PDP and other parties were jittery as Emenike had been confirmed APC governorship flag bearer in the state, adding that he is the instrument God will use to liberate the state from bondage and under development.\n\n\n\nThe former party Chairman also said that APC in Abia had only one recognised leadership under the chairmanship of Dr Kingsley Ononogbu.\n\nVarious speakers including the National Welfare Secretary of the party, and former governorship aspirant, Chief Friday Nwosu, harped on unity and collaboration among the party faithful to be able to win the state in 2023.\n\nAPC faithful from all 17 councils in the state were at the meeting while the various candidates came with their supporters to receive INEC acknowledgement of their certificate of return.",

          "text": "By Goodluck Ibem\n\nIn the last one week, Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has met in London, the United Kingdom with those whose voices are not taken for granted on issues of global peace and security. The Governor is deeply worried over the fate of hapless Nigerians who are killed on a daily basis. He is particularly concerned about the persecution of Christians and the general muscling of religious freedom in his country where clergy men have become the target of wanton kidnappings and assassinations.\n\nReports from London indicated that Governor Ortom met with several personalities such as Baroness Cox of the UK House of Lords, MP Fiona Bruce, Special Envoy on Religious Freedom, her Deputy former MP David Burrows, The Archbishop of Canterbury, His Grace Most Revd Justin Welty, Dr. John Eibner (Switzerland), Pastor Ayo Adedoyin, PSJ, UK, Dr. Richard Ikiebe PSJ and The Revd Dr. Gideon Para-Mallam of The Gideon & Funmi Para-Mallam Peace Foundation, whose organization was one of those that invited the Governor to the UK.\n\nIn his meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Head of the Church of England, the Most Revd Justin Welby, the Governor spoke on the suppression of religious freedom and persecution of Nigerian Christians among other silent issues affecting the marginalized people of his country.\n\nResponding, Archbishop Welby described Governor Ortom as a man of uncommon courage who is truly moved by love for his people to seek help for them. He offered prayers for the security and peace for the people of Benue State and Nigeria at large.\n\nGovernor Ortom also paid a visit to the Westminster House of Lords and witnessed its session when Baroness Cox raised concerns on the killings in Nigeria. The Governor briefly sat in during the debates in the House of Lords on the invitation of Baroness Cox. He met with Dr. John Eibner, President CSI, Switzerland, in company of Revd Dr. Gideon Para-Mallam of the Gideon & Funmi Para-Mallam Peace Foundation: President and CEO, the Gideon & Funmi Para-Mallam Peace Foundation; who was a delegate at FORB and had accompanied the Governor from Nigeria.\n\nThe Governor equally met with the Deputy Envoy MP Burrows at one of the Conferences. Recall that when seven members of the UK Parliament came on a fact-finding visit in Nigeria at the end of May 2022, Governor Ortom was one of the two Nigerian Governors they met privately. The All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) visit to Nigeria was led by David Burrows.\n\nOrdinarily, Ortom wouldn\u2019t have bothered because as a governor, personal security is guaranteed 24hours of the day. So why is the Benue State Governor taking the pain to draw the attention of the international community to the evil taking place in Nigeria? That is where the distinction and measure of a man\u2019s content of character is known. Leadership entails being selfless and thinking about those you lead. In Ortom\u2019s case, he is not only concerned about Benue people. He cares about the well-being, freedom, safety and justice for all Nigerians.\n\nNigeria has produced great leaders who spoke passionately to the nation\u2019s soul to provide direction in curing the injustices that threatened the unity of the country. Leaders like Nigeria\u2019s former Permanent Representative to the United Nations, the late Alhaji Maitama Sule and several others had spoken and provided solutions to the myriad of Nigeria\u2019s problems, but their words seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. Unfortunately, Nigeria\u2019s unity is on the verge of collapse again. The signs are glaring, but those who can save the country are either not reading the signs well or are not seeing them at all.\n\nReligion, ethnicity and politics have masked most political leaders, barring them from speaking the truth to save the country. However, amid lily-livered leaders, there has been a brave one diagnosing Nigeria\u2019s current situation while proffering solutions. He has also made several strong statements that could have saved the country if only those who should act had listened to him. Ortom\u2019s patriotic statements were dismissed, and today, the same statements of his have come to pass.\n\nGovernor Ortom of Benue State is writing his name on the sands of history as one of the great leaders of this country who stands for justice and truth, equity and fairness, and one who has the vision to forecast what would become of a situation if the right steps are not taken. I am not saying he is a prophet, but if after reading this you find him fit into what qualifies one as a prophet, then we will be on the same page.\n\nOnly two weeks ago, Governor Ortom spoke on two television programmes \u2013 Arise News and Channels TV. He stated unequivocally that if nothing is done to arrest the worsening insecurity in the country, one day soon, terrorists will take over the Presidential Villa. Some Nigerians found his statement as a prophecy of doom. In fact, Channels TV host Seun Akimbaloye openly disagreed with Governor Ortom in strong terms. The Governor was not deterred as he went on to state his case courageously and proffered the way forward. A few days later, terrorists attacked the Kuje Prison and freed hundreds of inmantes among who were their members. That was Ortom\u2019s prediction coming to pass faster than anyone would have imagined. Even those who doubted his warning about the possible attack on the Villa are now speechless.\n\nTo bring Governor Ortom\u2019s warning closer home, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s advance team was attacked right in the President\u2019s home state Katsina by terrorists. What affront can be more worrisome than that? Those who had thrown darts at the Benue State Governor have now put their tails between their legs.\n\nIn 2015, Governor Ortom after carefully studying the Fulani herdsmen attacks on farmers in Benue State, came up with the novel solution of ranching and the banning of open grazing in the state. Through the enactment of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law, 2017, Benue bade farewell to open grazing to welcome ranching. However, the backlash the Governor received was from just one ethnic group, the Fulani tribe who have taken open grazing as a way of life and would not like it changed. Through their social-cultural groups: Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore and Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders, Fulani Nationality Movement, and other Northern elites and governors, they opposed the ban on open grazing with threats of attacks on the state, which were carried out unhindered even as the President and security agencies were timely alerted by Governor Ortom.\n\nHe predicted that one day, ranching will be accepted the same way that June 12 has today been accepted as democracy day! It has come to pass.\n\nThe opposition could only last for a while because today, they are singing the Ortom song of ranching. They have all agreed with Governor Ortom that Open grazing is not practicable in the present circumstance of Nigeria. Northern Governors Forum in February 2021, resolved that open grazing was out of date. Contained in the forum\u2019s communique, it reads: \u201cThe current system of herding mainly through open grazing is no longer sustainable, in view of growing urbanization and population of the country.\u201d The forum only repeated what the Benue Governor had said a few years ago which they opposed.\n\nToday, the ranching crusade led by Governor Ortom has reached the nooks and crannies of Nigeria. All the regions, North, South, East have banned open grazing as many of the States have signed into law the Anti-Open Grazing law with several other states in the process of doing the same.\n\nWhile the attacks by Fulani herdsmen were heavy on Benue State with the denial from the Presidency that those attacking Benue were not Fulani herdsmen but bandits, Governor Ortom warned that if nothing is done fast the so-called bandits will be difficult to contain in the near future. Today, the reality is here. Fulani bandits have become more vicious than Boko Haram and even President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s home state is not spared from terrorists\u2019 deadly operations of killing, kidnapping and shutting down the economies of many states.\n\nThe \u2018fight\u2019 against banditry by the Federal Government has been treated with kid gloves which is why they have continued to fearlessly operate on Nigeria\u2019s territory unchallenged. Just like the Federal Government was quick to proscribe Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and declared it as a terrorist organisation, Governor Ortom has demanded that the gun-wielding Fulani herdsmen who are today nicknamed bandits be declared as a terrorist group which after all is the fourth deadliest terror group on the Global Terrorism Index. In the usual way of the people from the North, particularly, Fulani and the Presidency, they came on Governor Ortom as a lion going after its prey.\n\nWhen Governor Ortom advocated licensing of AK-47 to private individuals for self-defence, it first appeared as though it was an unpopular opinion. Of course, Ortom knew what he was saying. He foresaw things soon getting out of hand as the situation has now got worse. Just like his other patriotic calls which took time before the authorities accepted, it does appear that it would only take some time for licensing of guns for private individuals to begin in Nigeria. Now, you can call it \u2018Ortom: The making of a true prophet\u2019.\n\nShockingly, the Presidency and other members of the All Progressive, APC, both at the Federal and state level have baselessly regarded Governor Ortom as an enemy of President Buhari when he speaks on issues concerning Nigeria. How is Ortom an enemy of the President? When did it become an offence to look your leader in the face and tell him where he is wrong and where he is right. Governor Ortom has, on several occasions, commended President Buhari when he does the right thing. But the Governor also owes no one any apology when he tells the President where he is wrong.\n\nIn my opinion, Governor Samuel Ortom is the best friend of President Buhari who wants him to succeed. Those who flatter Mr President with lullabies to lure him to sleep while Nigeria burns are the real enemies of this country, not Ortom.\n\nWhen Governor Ortom said the President is the worst President regarding issues of security and keeping his promises, there was a media buzz and the Presidency almost rolled out the entire weaponry to crush Ortom as if he was wrong. Ortom is right. The President has failed on all fronts.\n\nIt is worthy of note that when the Benue State Governor speaks, he speaks the minds of the majority of Nigerians and from the information at his disposal. Governor Ortom\u2019s position has been\n\nGovernor Ortom has stood out as one of the outspoken Governors in the times where many have recoiled into their safe havens for fear of losing power and money. The Benue State Governor is the crusader of justice for all, the justice the country needs to correct the many decades of impunity, injustice, marginalization and subjugation.\n\nGovernor Ortom speaks from the vantage point of one who is concerned about the unity and progress of the country and he has said a lot that were ignored but have come to pass as the country battles with the grave consequences of its negligence, the negligence of the voice of reason.\n\nGovernor Ortom\u2019s trip to the United Kingdom and his call for religious freedom in Nigeria is not only timely but it is also another patriotic call that will yet again yield fruits for the people of this country.\n\nIbem writes from Umuahia, Abia State.",

          "text": "By Okodili Ndidi and Eric Ikhilae, Abuja\n\nDefence Headquarters (DHQ) has accused a former Aviation Minister Femi Fani-Kayode of plotting to create rivalry among security agencies.\n\nIt said Fani-Kayode\u2019s \u201cwild and unsubstantiated\u201d allegations against the Armed Forces following last week\u2019s Kuje Prison invasion and a spate of terror attacks were intended to mislead the public.\n\nAlso, a pro-democracy group the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) cautioned Fani-Kayode against \u201cunguarded\u201d utterances that could escalate the security challenges in the country.\n\nBut the former minister dismissed the accusation by the DHQ, saying he stood by his statements.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja by its Director of Defence Information, Maj.-Gen. Jimmy Akpor, the DHQ said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to a video produced by Mr Femi Fani-Kayode wherein he made wild and unsubstantiated allegations against the Armed Forces regarding the recent spate of terrorist attacks, particularly the attack on the prison in Kuje, Abuja, on July 5, 2022.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the video and its maker would have been ignored, considering the antecedents of the person behind it as a known rabble-rouser. However, in the interest of members of the public who might be misled by the deliberate falsehood and the sensibilities of service personnel and their families who have been paying dearly to keep Nigerians safe, it has become urgent to respond to the video currently circulating in the social media.\n\n\u201cAmong other allegations, Mr Fani-Kayode claimed that the Department of State Services (DSS) informed the military about the impending attack on Kuje Custodial Centre and even the previous attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail service. He also claimed that soldiers were withdrawn shortly before the prison attack. In all these allegations, Mr Fani-Kayode is merely playing to the gallery.\n\n\u201cHe is not in any position to know whether the DSS notified the military of any attack or not. It may not be impossible that such a claim is part of a calculated attempt to cause division and rivalry amongst all government agencies that have been working collaboratively in addressing issues of insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe claim that soldiers were withdrawn from the Kuje Correctional Custodial Centre before the attack is laughable. It is said that Mr Fani-Kayode is ignorant of whose responsibility it is to guard the prison.\n\n\u201cMr. Fani-Kayode further claimed that the military took no action on the recent Shiroro terrorists\u2019 attack, which resulted in the unfortunate death of some soldiers, some policemen and members of the public. This is also an attempt to smear the military and create bad blood between service personnel and the military high command.\n\n\u201cA despicable statement that dishonours the sacrifices of the gallant officers and soldiers that paid the supreme price whilst responding in defence of the civilians and the mining community (it is). What a shame! Mr Fani-Kayode is encouraged to pay more attention to the weekly briefs by Defence Media Operations.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state that the Nigerian Armed Forces have toiled to sustain and nurture our democracy, hence the same military cannot contemplate a coup d\u2019etat, as alluded to by Mr Fani-Kayode in his video.\n\n\u201cFinally, in a miserable attempt to malign the leadership of the military, Mr Fani-Kayode gave the impression that while junior military commanders and non-commissioned officers are working hard, senior commanders are doing nothing.\n\n\u201cThis is sheer ignorance, and nothing more. Mr Fani-Kayode is completely oblivious of the fact that in the military, orders, instructions and directives are issued from the hierarchy to the lower rungs of command.\n\n\u201cThis is indeed a difficult time for the Armed Forces of Nigeria and Nigerians as a whole. It is not a time for attention-seeking individuals to cause needless distractions.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t be cowed, says ex-minister\n\nBut the erstwhile minister said in a statement said he would not be intimidated by the military high command from saying the truth.\n\nHe added that the military cannot impose a culture of silence on Nigerians when it was evident that its leadership has not frontally addressed insecurity in the country.\n\nFani-Kayode said: \u201cI read the response from the Defence Headquarters (dated July 9, 2022) to my video about the insecurity in the country and the attack on Kuje prison and I was utterly amused.\n\n\u201cGiven the gravity and seriousness of the deteriorating security situation in our country, I did not know whether to laugh or cry when I read through it.\n\n\u201cI would advise strongly that the military high command and Defence Headquarters spend their time facing up to and fighting the terrorists that have turned our nation into a functional killing field and horrendous bloodbath and abattoir over the last few years and attempt to carry out their constitutional role of protecting us from enemies within and without rather than trying to engage me in a press war or cow me into silence.\u201d\n\nHe said if the military commanders knew his antecedents as they claimed, they would appreciate the fact that attempting to threaten or intimidate him into not pointing out and exposing their abysmal failures cannot work.\u201d\n\n\u2018Are we supposed to sit by idly and clap for our military\u2019s field and operational commanders when things are clearly going wrong?\n\n\u201cCall it \u2018rabble rousing\u2019 if you like (as they did in their press statement) but the overwhelming majority of Nigerians are appalled and disgusted with the degree to which our security situation has degenerated and are demanding that the Military High Command either goes or does far better.\n\n\u201cTheir glaring and embarrassing failures are as repugnant to them as it is to me,\u201d he said.",

In doing that, they had thrown caution to the wind.\n\n\u201cln all the cases involving Okorocha and lmo State Government, including the one decided by Justice Njemanze (retd), which is now at the Appeal Court, the government never mentioned Okorocha\u2019s personal cars and those of his aides, associates, his security details, Rochas Foundation College, et al.\n\n\u201cThere are also valuable materials and documents in some of the vehicles, including international passports.

          "title": "CAN, others kick as Tinubu picks Muslim running mate",
          "text": "From Fred Itua and Juliana Taiwo-balonye, Abuja, Agaju Madugba, Katsina, Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure and Steve Agbota\n\nThe presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, yesterday, unveiled Senator Kashim Shettima, Muslim and former governor of Borno State as his running mate, ending weeks of cat and mouse game.\n\nHowever, the decision to settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket has elicited wide condemnations from Christians and Northern minorities.\n\nTinubu disclosed his choice to journalists at the Daura residence of President Muhammadu Buhari. The APC flag bearer arrived Daura to pay Sallah homage to President Buhari who arrived his home town on Friday. The former Lagos State governor was in Daura to pay Sallah homage to Buhari as well as intimate him of his decision to pick Shettima as his running mate.\n\nThe former two-term Lagos State governor, who won APC\u2019s presidential ticket at the June 8 special national convention and presidential primary election, had earlier chose Ibrahim Kabiru Masari as place holder for the vice presidential slot.\n\nTinubu was away in France from June 27 on a short vacation during which he held some strategic meetings. He returned to Nigeria on Saturday early enough for Sallah festivities.\n\nThe Sun had last week exclusively reported that Tinubu had settled for North East and that his choice had been narrowed down to two \u2013 Governor Babagana Zulum and Shettima.\n\nTinubu\u2019s announcement came amidst protests from the leadership of various Christian bodies in Nigeria, especially the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and Catholic Bishops. His choice, Daily Sun learnt, does not not enjoy the backing of Northern APC governors especially those from the North West, who had insisted that one of them be picked.\n\nCAN fumes\n\nMixed reaction has trailed the APC\u2019s presidential candidate\u2019s decision to run a same religion card.\n\nCAN\u2019s spokesperson, Adebayo Oladeji, said Nigerians should be ready to face the consequences of their actions if they endorsed and vote for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cWe knew this was what he was going to do and we have warned against it. It is up to Nigerians to decide on what they want.\n\n\u201cYou are all alive when we warned Buhari not to allow Muslims to dominate the security architecture of the country and he did it. I think we can see the way the criminals are operating with impunity.\n\n\u201cSo, if Tinubu says he is opting for a Muslim-Muslim ticket in a polarised country like ours, if Nigerians endorse him and vote for him, whatever happens, Nigerians will face the consequences.\n\n\u201cIf you have a government where a pastor is a vice president and pastors and worshipers are being killed you can imagine what will happen when we have a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cIt is left to Nigerians to make their choice, let them vote them in and we will all face the consequences together.\n\n\u201cWe are raising our alarm. It is an irony that Buhari they regarded as an extremist when we raised an alarm to warn him against a Muslim-Muslim ticket, he heeded and opted for a Christian as his vice presidential candidate. \u201d\n\nAPC, Tinubu misfired\n\nPDP chieftain and former presidential aspirant, Alhaji Isa Saulawa, described the Muslim-Muslim ticket as signifying victory for his party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cThis is good news for us because it\u2019s an indication that the PDP will return to power in 2023. There is no doubt that whatsoever that the current regime of President Muhammadu Buhari, right from inception, adopted a policy of deliberate marginalisation of the Christian community in Nigeria despite a Christian vice president. So, you can imagine a scenario where we have a Muslim-Muslim presidency. In fact, we are already celebrating the APC and Tinubu blunder.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s best choice -Publisher\n\nRenown newspaper publisher and politics analyst, Malam Mohammed Katsina, described Tinubu\u2019s choice as the best for the APC arguing that Shettima recorded outstanding performance when he was governor of Borno State.\n\n\u201cThis issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket is irrelevant and it\u2019s my view that Nigerians should rise above such pedestrian sentiments and forge ahead for the overall development of the country. There is nothing wrong with Muslim-Muslim ticket or Christian-Christian ticket in a democratic setting.\n\n\u201cIf you take Kaduna State as a case study, you see that the Muslim-Muslim ticket is viable where the governor is Muslim and the deputy is also Muslim.\n\nIt\u2019s not best arrangement -Kwankwanso\n\nThe presidential candidate of the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, said Muslim-Muslim ticket agenda is not a good arrangement.\n\nSpeaking in an interview on national television last night, he said so many things have changed in the country since 1993 when MKO Abiola and Babagana Kingibe, both Muslims, ran on the platform of the then Social Democratic Party (SDP) and won.\n\n\u201cIn 1993 in SDP, I was deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, we found ourselves in a similar situation where we had a Muslim-Muslim ticket. That was almost 30 years ago and in 2023, it would be exactly 30 years. And so many things have changed in this country. The possible thing to have changed is the quality of leadership that we have seen over the years, which allowed Nigerians to, unfortunately, take to their cocoons in terms of religion, ethnicity region and so on.\n\n\u201cThat is why NNPP will do whatever it can to bring Nigerians together but for now I believe the persons and people who are talking about Muslim-Muslim tickets will soon know that is not the best arrangement. And it is just a matter of time they will realize the mistake of doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhy I settled for Shettima \u2013 Tinubu\n\nRegardless of the criticisms, Tinubu has said the ticket represents a milestone in Nigeria\u2019s political annals, just as it was when Abiola chose Kingibe.The 1993 presidential election which was won by Abiola is adjudged to be the freest and fairest election in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\nTinubu\u2019s statement read in part: \u201cAll my life, my decisions regarding the team around and supporting me have always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence.\n\n\u201cWhen I was governor of Lagos State, these principles helped me assemble one of the most capable governing cabinets any state or this nation has ever seen. I trust enough in these principles to allow them to, once more, guide me to construct another exemplary team that can do Nigeria proud.\n\n\u201cSecond, this chapter in our country\u2019s history demands a bold yet pragmatic approach, a path already chartered by the progressive ethos of the APC. The foundation for sustainable progress has been laid these past seven years by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The challenges of today are consequential because the lives and livelihoods of millions of Nigerians lie in the balance. Visionary and creative leadership will take us to our goal.\n\n\u201cOur focus, therefore, must be on getting the job done; and that means getting the very best and competent people to do it. In this crucial moment, where so much is at stake, we must prioritize leadership, competence, and the ability to work as a team over other considerations.\n\n\u201c I am mindful of the energetic discourse concerning the possible religion of my running mate. Just and noble people have talked to me about this. Some have counselled that I should select a Christian to please the Christian community. Other have said I should pick a Muslim to appeal to the Muslim community. Clearly, I cannot do both.\n\n\u201cBoth sides of the debate have impressive reason and passionate arguments supporting their position. Both arguments are right in their own way. But neither is right in the way that Nigeria needs at the moment. As president, I hope to govern this nation toward uncommon progress. This will require innovation. It will require steps never before taken. It will also require decisions that are politically difficult and rare.\n\n\u201cIf I am to be that type of President, I must begin by being that type of candidate. Let me make the bold and innovative decision not to win political points but to move the nation and our party\u2019s campaign closer to the greatness that we were meant to achieve.\n\n\u201cHere is where politics ends, and true leadership must begin.\u201d\n\nTinubu added: \u201cSenator Kasim Shettima\u2019s career in politics and beyond shows that he is eminently qualified not only to deliver that all important electoral victory, but, also, step into the shoes of the vice president. As a man with the talent, maturity, strength of character, and patriotism he has my implicit confidence and faith.\n\n\u201cI am aware that many will continue focus on a particular detail, the question of his faith.\n\n\u201cHowever, if we truly understand the challenges upon us a nation, then we must also see the imperative of placing competence in governance above religious sentiment.\n\n\u201cIn 1993, Nigerians embrace Chief MKO Abiola and a fellow Muslim running mate, Baba Gana Kingibe in one of our fairest elections ever held.\n\n\u201cThe spirit of 1993 is upon us again in 2023.\n\n\u201cAs such, the ticket we present today represents a milestone in our political history. It symbolises our party\u2019s determination to be a leading light among political parties in Africa.\u201d",

A stitch in time saves nine,\u201d the union said.\n\nNUEE charged government to address all issues concerning non-implementation of agreements and other matters affecting Nigeria\u2019s tertiary education institutions.\n\nIt noted that a nation that is committed to human capital development does not toy with the education, training and manpower needs of its youth population.\n\n\u201cThe laissez-faire attitude of the government whether in the states or national towards continued closure of schools is a sorry state in the process of our development towards nationhood.\n\n\u201cIt is through education that this country Nigeria could be pulled out of the current doldrums and be positioned towards socio-economic and technological development of the next millennium,\u201d the union said.\n\nThe Nigeria Union of Railway workers, on its part, said it strongly condemned the vapid and uninspiring attitude of the Federal Government to end the lingering faceoff between it and the unions of universities, polytechnics, colleges of education, and research institutions, especially on the government\u2019s no-work-no-pay policy for the striking workers of universities and other tertiary institutions.\n\nIn a statement signed by NUR president-general, Innocent Luka Ajiji, and the general secretary, Segun Esan, the union appealed to the Federal Government to meet the legitimate charter of demands of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) with no further delay and save the nation\u2019s education sector from total collapse.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should be responsible enough to end the ongoing ASUU strike and rescue millions of Nigerian schooling youths who are majorly the children of the working class and poor masses from ruins and tempestuous engagements. The Federal Government should always remember that an idle hand is the devil\u2019s workshop,\u201d the union said.\n\nAccording to the union, most importantly, government should adopt the preferred salary payment platform in place of IPPIS as proposed by the striking university lecturers and also do all that is necessary for the infrastructural development of the nation\u2019s ivory towers.\n\nMeanwhile, the railway workers said they may be compelled to embark on a total and indefinite strike any moment from now to challenge the insensitivity of the management and the board of Nigerian Railway Corporation to the welfare and wellbeing of the railway workers.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt is unfortunate and most disheartening that, almost eight months after the Nigerian Railway workers\u2019 three-day nationwide warning strike of November 2021 was suspended and clear agreement reached between the union and the management, with January 2022 deadline for the management to provide answers to the charter of demands of the workers, no significant achievement has been made by the management so far to assuage the aggrieved workers till now.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the standard condition of service, which was reviewed last in 1978 and on which the workers demanded a review for immediate application, has been kept in the cooler, unattended, after a review committee was inaugurated to work on it.\n\n\u201cThe review committee worked inconclusively and, till now, there is no known standard condition of service in the rail transport industry. Similar to this, the approval of 95 per cent for salary enhancement has remained a nominal approval without any hope in sight as to when it will translate to cash for the workers.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose of recollection, other workers\u2019 welfare demands that led to the warning strike include non-payment of allowances; slavish use of the workers beyond the prescribed eight hours a day and 40 hours a week (weekends excluded) by the Public Service Rule; non-payment of workers\u2019 salaries by IPPIS till the salaries are lost and unpaid; administrative delay in promotion procedures, which culminate in accumulation of promotion arrears and subsequent loss of same; serial ejection of workers from their staff quarters with unfulfilled promise to replace and allocate quarters to the affected staff accordingly; transferring workers from one location to another without adequate provision for their comfort and convenience; among many others.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, and Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has beefed up security within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) following a security alert on fresh terrorists\u2019 attacks by the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).\n\nThe NSCDC FCT Command in a letter dated July 8, signed by Peter Maigari and addressed to the Permanent Secretary, FCTA, had alerted of renewed threats of attacks by ISWAP terrorists on targets within the nations capital. The letter which stated that ISWAP had declared war on Christians in Nigeria has gone viral creating fear among FCT residents, especially Christian faithful.\n\nIn the letter, titled \u201cRenewed threat of attack by ISWAP\u201d, NSCDC wrote: \u201cCertified intelligence reveals that members of the decimated terrorist group ISWAP have concluded plans to launch more coordinated and spontaneous attacks on selected targets within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and had declared war against Christians in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIntelligence abounds that ISWAP terrorist group has claimed responsibilities of the Tuesday July 5, 2022 attack on Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre, releasing their adherent members.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing is to enable them hibernate in targeted communities (FCT) and re-strategise for further terrorist activities, especially on soft targets to keep the agenda of the group alive to the public.\u201d\n\nThe report added: \u201cTaking into consideration the recent terrorist attack on Kuje medium security custodial centre good two hours without any security resistance indicated their readiness to carry out more coordinated attacks in selected cities/towns, security formations, schools, and worship centres in FCT, hence the released of their members for more formidable squad to achieved their dastardly act.\u201d\n\nIn its tecommendation, the NSCDC, wrote: \u201cAgainst this backdrop, it is advised that counter measures be emplaced, and there is need to review existing security measures around such targets and other sensitive facilities with security formations, in FCT to frustrate the planned attack. This report is submitted for your information and necessary action.\u201d\n\nReacting to the leakage of the intelligence, Civil Defence spokesperson, Shola Odumosu, expressed disappointment, warning that the person who leaked the letter from the Permanent Secretary\u2019s office should be held responsible for the ripple effect it has generated.\n\n\u201cEvery security agency gives intelligence report to the concerned authority from time to time and this one from the NSCDC is not an exception. The leakage of letter is not good for the battle the government is fighting against the insurgence,\u201d he frowned.\n\nThough police sources told Daily Sun that the NSCDC has been condemned for issuing the statement, which is considered to be out of its purview, Daily Sun observed increased security presence within the FCT with the military, police, DSS and other security agencies embarking on series of patrols to ward off possible attacks. Heavy deployment of police was also sighted at soft targets like churches, mosques, recreational and business centres, yesterday.\n\nA police source said the deployment was to forestall what happened at St. Francis\u2019 Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State.\n\nDaily Sun also learnt that the police working in partnership with the military, DSS, hunters and vigilance groups, have also launched series of raids with the FCT to rit of miscreants and other criminal elements.\n\n\u201cThe police have embarked on constant raid on criminal hotbeds in the Abuja. The raid which is carried out on daily basis is being led by the Commissioner of Police, Babaji Sunday, and is yielding positive results with several suspects arrested so far,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source gave names of some the hotspots to include Zuba, Gwagwalada, Gwagwa, Karmo, Jabi, Bwari, Dutse, Jabi, Lugbe, Nyanya, Kugbo, Mararaba, Mpape, Karshi, Massaka, Abaji, Utako market, Apo, Bwari, among other spots.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies are also on surveillance in villages in the area councils where bandits have continued to carry out attacks on innocent villagers,\u201d he said.\n\nFCT Police Command Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, confirmed the raid saying it was part of measures to checkmate the activities of criminals.\n\n\u201c\u2026We have beefed up security in worship nod recreational centres in and around Abuja\u2026so we are at alert we have beefed up security as expected. Our advice to resident is that they should be alert, they should not be scared seeing the massive deployment. It is just a security measures that we are taking,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilarly, the commander Guards Brigade, Nigerian Army, Brigadier General Usman, called on resident continue to be security conscious and report any suspicious movement to the security agencies.",

I will create 100,000 jobs.\u201d\n\nHe told other contestants to step down for him, saying, \u201cI will collaborate with all security operatives and recruit more Amotekun. I won\u2019t allow the Amotekun to carry arms.

Our collaboration with Amotekun has been effective.\n\n\u201cThere was a helicopter but it has broken down and the cost of repairing it is huge. It will cost about 300,000 dollars. The address can be given to whoever likes to see it in Port-Harcourt.\n\nAmotekun had been very effective. They collaborate with the hunters to go into the bush and pursue the kidnappers.\u201d\n\nThe former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuf, said he remains the most qualified because he has occupied Ine of the highest positions in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI will develop a robust community development association that will work with Amotekun and collate intelligent information.\n\nSenator Adeleke said he would provide equipment and gadget for the police as well as collaborate with the traditional rulers to resuscitate the neighbourhood watch.\n\nAlso, Omigbodun promised to incorporate vigilantes by making laws to make it effective, saying, \u201cwe can use drones for intelligence gathering.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Inspector General of Police(IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, has ordered the deployment of the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID), DIG Johnson Babatunde Kokumo to Osun.\n\nDIG Kokumo, supervisory DIG for the South-West Geo-Political Zone, is to be assisted by four Assistant Inspectors-General of Police, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police.\n\nForce Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, in statement, said the IGP has also ordered deployment of adequate police personnel in the ranks of Chief Superintendents of Police and below to ensure a crisis free election.

          "text": "Finally, Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has announced his running mate for the 2023 election. The announcement comes after a meeting of some APC chieftains with President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Kastina, on Sunday. Kabiru Masari stepped down from his \u201cplaceholder\u201d position and Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno, took his place on the party\u2019s ticket beside Tinubu.\n\nFor the first time since the historic 1993 presidential election with Moshood Abiola and Babagana Kingibe on the ticket of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), a mainstream Nigerian political party would be fielding a same-faith ticket.\n\nMany consider this a risky move for the APC given the religious sensitivities, but Tinubu has probably done their calculations.\n\nTINUBU\u2019S FOOT SOLDIER\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose in the Tinubu camp are not shocked at the choice of Shettima as he has been one of the staunch advocates of the former Lagos governor\u2019s presidential bid, and both are known to be good with each other.\n\nTheCable understands that Shettima was to be officially unveiled on Tuesday but as soon as the news of his nomination leaked, Tinubu decided to go public on Sunday.\n\nShettima has been a media face of Tinibu since the former Lagos governor declared his presidential bid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn January, he declared \u201cwe owe him\u201d as he threw his weight behind Tinubu\u2019s presidential bid. In June, in the lead-up to the APC primary, Shettima warned that it would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the party if Tinubui was not elected as its presidential candidate.\n\nHe also ripped into Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo who was contesting against Tinubu in the primaries. He said Osinbajo was a nice man but \u201cnice men should be selling popcorn, ice cream\u201d, adding that Tinubu would make a better president.\n\nShettima later apologised to Osinbajo, saying his remarks were not meant as \u201cridicule but, rather, to stir up interest in the contrasting virtues of the cast of aspirants putting up a fight against my preferred aspirant\u201d.\n\nRESTRUCTURING VS NANOTECHNOLOGY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the launch of a book by Bolaji Abdullahi, former minister of sports, in Abuja in November 2017, Shettima stirred a mini-controversy when he launched a blistering attack on the campaign for the restructuring of Nigeria, insisting that it is the quality of governance that needs restructuring.\n\n\u201cRestructuring my foot!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s restructure our minds. Let\u2019s restructure the quality of governance. When people are talking of artificial intelligence, when others are talking of robotics engineering, of nanotechnology, we are talking of restructuring the federation. Our problem is not an issue of devolution of powers, let\u2019s be very honest.\n\n\u201cOur problem, as Chinua Achebe rightly encapsulated, is largely that of leadership. Leadership that will put the nation first is much more important than restructuring the nation. Let\u2019s restructure our minds. Let\u2019s restructure our quality of leadership.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNanotechnology is the revolutionisation of technology and industry sectors such as information technology, medicine, transportation, energy, and environmental science, among others, to make humans live better and smoother.\n\n\u2018ACCIDENTAL GOVERNOR\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShettima began his political sojourn in 2007 when he was appointed as a commissioner by Ali Modu Sherrif, then governor of Borno. He served in five different ministries.\n\nUpon the completion of the Sheriff\u2019s tenure, a silver lining in the cloud of misfortune sent fate down the path of Shettima: in January 2011, Modu Fannami Gubio, the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) governorship candidate in Borno, was shot dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShettima was elected as the party\u2019s candidate in a second primary held a month later. He went on to be governor of Borno state for two terms, and has been praised for backing Babagana Zulum as his successor.\n\nZulum has enjoyed good reviews as governor of Borno state and was one of those being touted as potential running mates to Tinubu.\n\nShettima was elected a senator in 2019.\n\nAT WAR WITH BOKO HARAM FOR EIGHT YEARS\n\nShettima\u2019s tenure as governor of Borno, the \u201cHome of Peace\u201d, from 2011 to 2019 was marred by Boko Haram insurgency.\n\nHe once said: \u201cBetween 2013 and 2014, we witnessed the most daring and most vicious evil of the Boko Haram, losing 20 LGAs of the 27 in Borno, establishing caliphates in a territory almost twice as big as Lagos state.\u201d\n\nHe said Boko Haram insurgents \u201cdestroyed 156,453 houses in Borno. The houses represent about 30 percent of the housing stock in the state.\n\n\u201cThey also destroyed 5,344 classrooms in 21 primary schools, destroyed 38 secondary schools and two tertiary institutions in the state.\n\n\u201cThe insurgents also destroyed 665 municipal buildings, including local government secretariat, police stations, as well as 201 health facilities.\u201d\n\nHe was the governor when Boko Haram insurgents invaded the Government Girls Secondary School (GGSS) in Chibok local government area of Borno state from where they abducted 276 students.\n\nTHE CHIBOK BLAME GAME\n\nIn the aftermath of the Chibok girls\u2019 abduction in April 2014, the federal government led by President Goodluck Jonathan took the majority of the blame for its slow response to the attack.\n\nHowever, after Shettima claimed, in 2017, that Jonathan almost removed him as Borno governor in 2014 with the belief that he was responsible for the disappearance of Chibok schoolgirls, the former president struck back.\n\nIn a statement by Ikechukwu Eze, Jonathan\u2019s spokesperson, the former president accused Shettima of exposing the girls of Chibok Secondary School to danger by failing to heed the federal government\u2019s directive to relocate them while writing the West African School Certificate Examinations (WASCE).\n\n\u201cHe should be able to tell us if it was Jonathan\u2019s poor choices that led the Governor to expose students of Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok to avoidable danger, in total disregard of a Federal Government directive to the Governors in the three states most affected by Boko Haram to relocate their students writing the West African School Certificate Examinations to safe zones,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive that while other governors in the zone heeded the security advice, Shettima remained the only one that flagrantly flouted it.\u201d\n\nThe former Borno state governor hit back and accused Jonathan of deliberately omitting facts about the abduction of Chibok girls.\n\nHe said the former president attempted to sweep under the carpet a report submitted to him by an investigative committee in June 2014 about the abductions.\n\nTHE BANKER\n\nBorn on September 2, 1966, Shettima was educated at the Lamisula Primary School in Maiduguri from 1972 to 1978 before proceeding to Government Community Secondary School in Biu LGA and the Government Science Secondary School, Potiskum, for high school education from 1978 to 1983.\n\nHe earned his first degree in agricultural economics in 1989 and, two years later, obtained a master\u2019s degree in the same discipline at the University of Ibadan.\n\nUpon completion of his second degree, Shettima was employed as a lecturer at the University of Maiduguri\u2019s department of agricultural economics, where he taught until 1993 before segueing into the banking sector.\n\nHe was employed as a head of accounts at the now-defunct Commercial Bank of Africa Limited in Lagos and moved to become a deputy manager at the African International Bank Limited in 1997. He would be promoted to a manager in 2001.\n\nHe joined Zenith Bank as head of its main branch in Maiduguri in 2001. Shettima rose through the ranks of the bank and became its zonal head in the north-east. He left the bank as a general manager in 2007 when he was appointed as commissioner for finance in Borno state.\n\nHe and his wife, Nana, have three children.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Freelance digital marketer Baraka Mafole wants Tanzanians to thrive in the digital economy",
          "text": "In 2019, Baraka Mafole, then 19, gained admission into the National Institute of Transport (NIT), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to undertake a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology (IT). He was excited about this. But then, things took a wrong turn.\n\nAfter discovering that his fellow students were making money online, Mafole decided to join them; he spent hours learning digital skills. But this distracted him from attending classes. As a result, he failed his first-year university exams and was expelled from the university. He didn\u2019t sulk, though. Instead, he started applying for opportunities at different companies. At first he was rejected by many companies he pitched to because, according to them, he wasn\u2019t skilled enough.\n\nHe pored over online courses on YouTube, Udemy, and other educational technology platforms to learn more about digital marketing and social media management. After upskilling, he resumed his search for jobs. This time around, he was successful; a startup in Dar es Salaam hired him as a social media manager.\n\nBut 4 months into the job, he quit. His confidence in his skills had grown, and he was receiving multiple offers for lucrative digital marketing and design gigs.\n\nIn 2020, he decided to become a full-time freelancer. That same year, he registered on online freelancing platform, Upwork, and since he joined, he has earned at least $4,000 from gigs\u2014over a dozen times more than the country\u2019s upper range TZS 315,000 ($135) for minimum wage. He has been awarded a top-rated badge (for earning more than $1,000 on the platform).\n\nShortly after he began making money on Upwork, he began sharing his freelancing journey online, which helped him build a large online following and get invited to speak at events.\n\nIn the last decade, the Tanzanian digital ecosystem has evolved as more Tanzanian citizens have access to digital services. In 2010, just 18.5% of the country\u2019s population had mobile phones. That number has grown 6-fold to reach 82% or 50 million people in 2021. Similarly, mobile internet penetration has grown 5-fold from 2.9% or 3 million people in 2010 to 25% or 15 million people in 2021\u2014with 12 million new mobile internet subscribers added over the decade. Within this period, the East African country has seen significant economic growth\u2014average annual GDP growth of 7%\u2014which has improved the lives of its citizens. This growth and improvement in quality of living can be traced to the use of digital technologies to improve access to key services such as education, agricultural market information, healthcare, financial services and employment, through digital technologies.\n\nIn recent years, Tanzania has seen heavy investments in fibre infrastructure in recent years to connect more Tanzanians to the internet. Back in 2016, the government updated the Tanzanian National ICT Policy of 2003, in what serves as a recognition of the contribution of the ICT sector to promoting socio-economic development in the country.\n\nDigital technology is poised to help Tanzania in achieving its developmental goals. Already, the mobile industry contributes 5.2% (or $5.2 billion) to Tanzania\u2019s GDP, and employs 2.6 % (or 1.5 million) of its total population.\n\nBut despite having an impressive 2.6% unemployment rate, millions of young Tanzanians remain unemployed, and the skills of those that are currently employed risk becoming obsolete in the coming years if they don\u2019t book their place in the digital economy.\n\nFrom university withdrawal to helping thousands of unemployed\n\nDuring his one year away from school, Mafole discovered that a communication degree could improve his chances of getting higher-paying gigs. So in 2021, he returned to the University of Dar es Salaam to study communication.\n\nOne day in May 2021, another enterprising Tanzanian, Leyla Mohamed reached out to him, out of the blue, and encouraged him to spread his impact further by training young people on digital skills. This led them to co-found an initiative called Tanzania Digital Trailblazers later that month, a series of virtual events to bring awareness of digital skills to young Tanzanians.\n\nAfter 3 months, the co-founders changed the initiative\u2019s name to one in Swahili, Sanuka Kidijitali (roughly meaning, \u201cGet informed fast about the digital world\u201d) to help people easily recall the name better. This time around, they added physical monthly digital skills training events to the mix. This helped Sanuk Kidijitali train over 300 people on digital skills such as writing, digital marketing, and blockchain; guides to get jobs on freelancing on job platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn; using video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet to speak with clients, and other digital tools such as Canva and Wix for various digital tasks.\n\nSanuk Kidijitali has a 3,000-strong community of young people in various Telegram groups that it is training and connecting to opportunities. It has also spread its awareness through its newly developed university outreach programme to university students across Tanzania, starting from the University of Dar es Salaam.\n\nSanuka Kidijitali launched a podcast, The Founders Confessions, where its co-founder Mohamed, speaks with startup founders in Tanzania to start and increase conversation about the digital economy in the country. Mafole is the country director of Social Media Day Tanzania, an event which took place last Saturday, on July 2, at the Nkrumah Hall, University of Dar es Salam. It brought together digital entrepreneurs for networking while offering them upskilling sessions.\n\n\u201cOur plan at Sanuka Kidijitali is to reach as many youths as we can, as we currently reach 5,000 plus, but one day we will hit our target of 100,000 per year,\u201d Mafole, who is also Sanuka Kidijitali\u2019s chief operating officer (CPO), told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe have an employment problem and digital jobs are a solution to this problem, but university students can\u2019t use computers and unemployed graduates do not have digital skills,\u201d he said.\n\nMafole said that dozens of Tanzanian youths have connected with his story and have been inspired to upgrade their lives by learning digital skills. After discovering that only 18 Tanzanian freelancers have earned over $1,000 on Upwork as compared to Kenya\u2019s 300, he realised that his country is playing catch-up. \u201cMy task is to help people who don\u2019t have digital skills build them and also help those that do identify and navigate freelancing platforms to get jobs,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut it is not all rosy, Mafole warned. Tanzanian freelancers still have to deal with inaccessible payment gateways or cut-throat transaction costs, high data pricing, and bad internet connection. And that\u2019s not all. They also have to deal with societal stereotypes. \u201cMany Tanzanians still see freelancing as an extra job and not as a real job. When you tell people you are a freelancer, they make you feel like you are unemployed,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Today on Everyday People, we meet Rita Anwiri Chindah, an intellectual property and information technology lawyer and an arbitrator based in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State. A random decision at the university led her down a path that would eventually turn her into an educationist. Now she hosts the IPSERIES podcast, a mini blog series on Twitter, and publishes a Substack newsletter to educate people on how much intellectual property is a part of all we do.\n\nI published my first [IPSERIES] episode on May 18, 2020. I think I had about 65 plays in how many days, but the feedback I kept getting from people was that I was sniffing and truthfully I was sniffing because I have allergies.\n\nI started getting comments from people on how to record. Someone suggested I should record in a quiet place. So sometimes when I want to record, I have to tell my family, cause I stay with my parents.\n\nI tell them, \u201cI\u2019m recording today. Please, can you guys, you know, tone down the noise,\u201d and they do that.\n\nThen someone else suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a mic?\u201d\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cWhere am I going to get a mic?\u201d I tried to get one from Jumia, and when they did not deliver after one month, they said I should go to the nearest post office.\n\nI went there the first time and they said, \u201cOkay, maybe come back next week.\u201d\n\nAnd I went back the following week.\n\nThey said, \u201cAh, Madam, we never receive anything [we haven\u2019t received anything].\u201d\n\nI was like, \u201cAh!\u201d\n\nSo I think I sent an email or I called. And they said if I couldn\u2019t wait, I should cancel the order.\n\nI was like, \u201cAfter waiting this long, are you people joking?\u201d I had had enough. Like, seriously, why are we not moving forward? Why do we always look for ways to frustrate people?\n\nThen this year, I think I saw someone on Instagram selling a mic, and I was like, \u201cOkay, let me try her,\u201d and I bought it, and it was excellent.\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nRita Anwiri speaking at a South South Media event. Source: Instagram\n\nI did my LLB at Madonna University, Okija, and in 400 level, they introduced three elective courses: oil and gas, banking and finance, and intellectual property (IP). And I was like, \u201cWhat is intellectual property?\u201d\n\nI just decided to do the random one I\u2019d never heard of.\n\nIP education for me started when I was at Infusion Lawyers. Senator Ihenyen, my boss at the time, and I had this conversation about IP awareness and educating people. And then, the firm came up with a Frequently Asked Question blog called IP ABC.\n\nThat was where the interest started to build up. Then I started dropping IP bits on Twitter and tagged it IPSERIES. I\u2019m not sure if that was the first major case I analysed. It wasn\u2019t much of a case, but I saw someone post something that I felt was untrue because Deola Sage put up a notification saying her Komole design had been registered as a design under the Nigerian Design Act.\n\nSomeone said she didn\u2019t have the right to do that, \u201cHow can you protect aso oke [traditional Yoruba fabric]?\u201d\n\nI thought about it and concluded it was not ordinary aso oke. So I sat down and compared the original Yoruba aso oke and Deola Sage\u2019s Komole [Kandids].\n\nI went on Instagram and I stumbled on this post and it makes me very excited because creatives such as Deola has taken a bold step in the fashion industry to protect her designs.\n\nNow the not clearly states that any infringement of any sort would be prosecuted \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/qdshVQz92w \u2014 ANWIRI (@esmeraldo99) October 23, 2019\n\nI did that tweet, and people received it well, so I started building on that.\n\nThen during the pandemic, LolA With The Duffle Bag on Twitter shared a link to her podcast and said that she uses Anchor to do her recording.\n\nHere\u2019s the trailer for my new podcast where I\u2019d be sharing and answering your questions. Watch, listen and enjoy!\n\n\n\nFirst episode drops May 4, links would be available then. Get ready to subscribe on Spotify, Apple podcast, google podcast and other platforms.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f, \ud83d\udca1 and \ud83d\udcbc pic.twitter.com/covcNVmnrh \u2014 LolA With The Duffle Bag\u2026 (@L3galtool) April 27, 2020\n\nSo I checked it out, and when I realised it was very easy to record and share, I decided to try doing a podcast.\n\nAfter the podcast, I began considering a newsletter. Telema Davis, one of my friends who always pushes me to do more, told me to do it if I wanted to. Expectedly, he edited my first newsletter publication.\n\nI didn\u2019t know which platform to publish on, and he suggested Substack? So I got my Substack account. So far, I have 66 or 67 podcast episodes, 12 newsletters, and over one hundred mini blog series on Twitter.\n\nSomeone who has listened to all my podcasts suggested I put my microphone in a pillowcase and, you know, talk into it, and the background sound would be muffled.\n\nSo I\u2019ve done all those things just to make sure that I put out good quality content.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not easy staying consistent; it\u2019s a bit overwhelming because each content must have a different storyline. So it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re just copying, pasting, and resharing.\n\nContent is key, and everything is content. When you\u2019re just starting, you don\u2019t get likes or retweets, and at such times, you wonder if you\u2019re making sense. But once you keep at it, people get to know and interact with you.\n\nWalking through the process\n\nRita Anwiri (third from the left) speaking at a panel at the Africa NXT 2022 event\n\nFirst up for me is usually the research, where I have to study the case and look out for things people didn\u2019t notice while reading or talking about the case because I\u2019m giving a Nigerian/African perspective. So I also have to read and compare many documents and conversations.\n\nThe next step is structure. How do you want the story to flow? Are you going to tell a very witty story? I write and then type because I\u2019m used to capturing my thought processes on paper first. As I type, I figure out what is relevant and what to discard.\n\nOnce I\u2019m done with research and typing for the Twitter series, I start posting. Sometimes I try to throw in pictures to help people better understand the conversation.\n\nWhen that is done, I share the link on LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nSometimes, depending on how complex it is, I decide to have a guest on my podcast. I remember we had this Tracy Chapman and Nicki Minaj case when I started, and I was wondering how to discuss it. So I reached out to Mark Jaffe, a colleague and friend who is more into copyrights. Interestingly, this connection was not physical, and that is the beauty of the Intenet \u2014 it is easy to connect with people.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that foreigners always want to help, so I was not surprised when he asked what I needed. We had a very interesting conversation and he said he was willing to come back and talk about something else if I needed him to.\n\nDealing with Internet connection issues\n\nRita was selected as a Trailblazer by the World Intellectual Property Review (WIPR) magazine in 2020\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, especially with network issues; I once went in and out of a session with a guest ten times.\n\n\u201cLook, I hope the last episode recorded?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cFingers crossed,\u201d I replied\n\nWhen I was listening to the recording, I did not hear anything that I said, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThere was this time when it was a football matter and I wanted to interview two guests, but only one of them could log in. After many attempts, we cancelled and did not try to record afterwards; I felt bad because I was really looking forward to that conversation, which was going to shed light from the eSports sector to the regular sports sector\n\nSo while the Internet is good, the technical issues are not fun. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing sometimes because you\u2019re all hyped up. You have your router or your MiFi on standby. You have your mobile data, just in case. And before you know it, something unexpected happens. I sometimes ask myself why I am in Nigeria.\n\nI was so upset once that I tagged Anchor on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhy are you guys doing this to me, today of all days? I can\u2019t even log in. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies, maybe check your Internet,\u201d they responded.\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cOh gosh, the Internet again!\u201d\n\nThe thing is you are trying to task yourself mentally while doing many things simultaneously, but people have no idea what goes into producing content. When you\u2019re Googling and reading different documents, make sure give a brief summary of everything because that is really where the work is.\n\nAnd the thing is, you are trying to tax yourself mentally while doing all of this and people don\u2019t see behind it. When you\u2019re trying to Google, trying to read different documents, make sure that you give a brief summary of everything. That\u2019s where the work is.",

          "text": "No complacency as we transform to limited coy \u2014 Kyari\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd.) started the new week with an assurance to its investors and stakeholders that the days of complacency were over.\n\nThe assurance came following the repositioning of the company to focus on profitability and value addition to its shareholders.\n\nThe GMD/CEO of the NNPC, Malam Mele Kyari, gave the assurance at the opening ceremony of the 2022 edition of the Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Conference and Exhibition which held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\nDeclaring the conference open, Kyari who was represented by NNPC Chief Financial Officer, Mr Umar Ajiya, called on operators in the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry to focus more on gas development.\n\nKyari said emphasis should be on gas-to-power, gas-to-industry and gas-for-export projects and activities.\n\nHe explained that with the reality of the global energy transition and Nigeria\u2019s commitment to use gas as its transition fuel, value now lies in gas development.\n\nThe NNPC GMD/CEO also said that the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) had also provided ample incentives for investors in the gas sector.\n\nKyari urged delegates and exhibitors to use the opportunity provided by the conference to network and brainstorm on solutions to the challenges brought about by the global energy transition and the Russian-Ukraine war.\n\nHe also urged them to find better ways to maximise the potentials inherent in the nation\u2019s abundant gas resources.\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC Ltd. within the week called on its partners and operators in the oil and gas industry to beef up investment in order to close the yawning energy supply gap in the country.\n\nThe GMD/CEO of NNPC Ltd., Malam Mele Kyari, made the call at the NNPC Spotlight Session of the just concluded 21st Nigerian Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition which held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\nSpeaking at the conference with theme, \u201cFunding the Nigerian Energy Mix for Sustainable Economic Growth\u201d, Kyari said there was a huge gap in the Nigerian energy market with 80 per cent of citizens lacking access to clean cooking gas and 48 per cent lacking access to electricity.\n\n\u201cThat gap is huge and we cannot fill it with the scale of investment we are doing in the renewable.\n\n\u201cThis is critical for us and we will continue to emphasise that our key role is to be able to bring gas and make it available to everyone.\n\n\u201cThe fact that energy transition is unfolding to everyone means we must invest in it and we are seeing a great resistance across the globe on funding fossil fuel until the Ukrainian challenge came up.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kyari, NNPC is currently engaging with partners and multilateral institutions that are involved in energy transition to find ways of resetting financing strategies in a manner that will enable energy companies and institutions to collaborate for investment in order to eradicate energy poverty.\n\nOn the new role of NNPC as a limited liability company, Kyari said that NNPC had been positioned as the company with the largest capital base in Africa to serve as a reliable partner to all willing investors.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, NNPC Ltd. offers a lineup of investment opportunities that guarantee positive returns across the energy value chain.\n\n\u201cOn July 19, 2022, Mr President will unveil the new NNPC Ltd. to the world. I am inviting you to that epoch-making event in the history of our company,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking at the conference, Chairman of Board of Directors, NNPC Ltd., Sen. Margery Chuba-Okadigbo said that the mandate of the new NNPC was clearly spelt out in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\nAccording to her, the PIA is a testament to the Federal Government\u2019s commitment to put in place the right environment for the advancement and development of oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cNNPC limited is a commercially oriented and profit driven company which creates opportunities for improved indigenous participation.\n\n\u201cThe new entity presents opportunities for enhanced revenue and returns on investment.\u201d\n\nShe stated that the effective implementation of the PIA would stimulate sustainable social impact through the creation of quality jobs for the teeming youth and consequently change the social perception of the industry.\n\nIn the meantime, the Group General Manager of the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), Mr Bala Wunti, disclosed that Nigeria needed about 800 billion dollar-worth of investments to meet the crude oil production target of four million barrels per day.\n\nWunti made the disclosure in Abuja during a panel session at the just concluded 21st Nigerian Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition with the theme, \u201cFunding the Nigerian Energy Mix for Sustainable Economic Growth\u201d.\n\nHe said the money must be channeled into exploration and production, midstream conversion capability and requisite downstream infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking on the theme, \u201cEnergy Transition: Making Nigeria the Preferred Africa Energy Investment Hub\u201d, the NAPIMS boss said Nigeria had abundant crude oil and natural gas resources which can only translate to value for the country if properly harnessed and produced for the benefit of the people.\n\nHe said that the time had come for the country to look inwards and develop its huge oil and gas potentials by restructuring the industry to attract the much-needed investments across the oil and gas value chain that would create wealth and prosperity for the people.\n\nHe called for stronger partnership and collaboration among stakeholders in the oil and gas sector, particularly in the area of finance, project execution, and technology development.\n\nGiving a breakdown of the investments required, Wunti said that the country needed about 400 billion dollars in the upstream and midstream segments of the value chain, while another 250 billion dollars investment would be required in the downstream sector across the country in order to ensure energy sufficiency.\n\nInternational oil companies (IOCs) operating in Nigeria including Shell, Chevron, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil in the week under review expressed their frustration over the escalating oil losses in the Niger Delta due to the activities of oil thieves.\n\nSpeaking at the industry leaders\u2019 panel session at the 2022 edition of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition, the CEOs said the unrelenting menace of crude oil theft had led to a decline of the nation\u2019s daily oil production from 1.8million barrels per day in the last three years to just a little over one million barrel per day.\n\nFiring the first salvo on the topic: \u201cThe Future of Nigeria\u2019s Energy Sector in the PIA Era\u201d, the Chairman of Shell Companies in Nigeria and Managing Director of Shell Petroleum Development Company, Mr Osagie Okunbor, warned that the new marginal field licensees that would operate Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) 53 and 57 may experience difficulties evacuating their crude oil.\n\nOkunbor said that two of the most important oil pipelines in the country were currently shut down with hundreds of thousands of barrels a day shut-in.\n\n\u201cIn three to five years, we were brought down from 1.8 million barrels. So it is an existential issue for us.\n\n\u201cWe need to address it; if we do not address it, we cannot do all the new oil development issues, and that will continue to occur.\n\n\u201cBut what is really going to move the needle for us in terms of bridging this gap of hundreds of thousands of barrels a day is solving the evacuation problem.\u201d\n\nHe tasked stakeholders and participants at the conference to put heads together to seek ways to deal with the challenge.\n\nManaging Director of Chevron Nigeria Limited and Chairman of the Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS), Mr Rick Kennedy, said while the industry stakeholders collaborate to fine-tune the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in a manner that offers encouragement to all players, it was also imperative for the oil theft challenge to be addressed by all parties.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Director at ExxonMobil Nigeria, Mr Oladotun Isiaka, who represented the Managing Director, Mr Richard Laing, also said stakeholders should work together to tackle the oil theft challenge as it was impacting negatively on investments in the upstream sector.\n\nThe Managing Director of TotalEnergies E&P Nigeria Limited, Mr Mike Sangster, called for further dialogue between the industry stakeholders and the authorities on the PIA.\n\nThe TotalEnergies boss called for the constitution of another working group made up of persons from the authorities and the industry in order to find ways to address some of the issues.\n\nStill in the week under review, the federal government made a payment of 100 million dollars as part of Nigeria\u2019s counterpart fund in the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) undertaken by German power firm, Siemens.\n\nThe development was aimed at solving the electricity challenge usually caused by the collapse of grid in the country.\n\nChairman, Senate Committee on Power, Sen. Gabriel Suswan disclosed this at the NOG conference during his presentation on the topic:\u201d Developing the Power Sector Policy for an Emerging Economy\u201d.\n\nHe said the Minister of Power, Mr Abubakar Aliyu, revealed that to the Senate committee during a meeting recently.\n\nSen. Suswan added that with this development, power supply would increase to about 7000 megawatts.\n\n\u201cThe government has paid 100 million dollars for the project so that someone can quickly activate that contract, so that the power deficit which has militated against proper servicing of the industry will come to an end.\u201d\n\nAmidst the current global posture on energy shift to renewables to reduce carbon footprint, the NNPC Ltd. said that there was need for Nigeria to adopt homegrown solutions to the nation\u2019s energy poverty challenge.\n\nThe GMD/CEO of NNPC Ltd., Malam Mele Kyari, stated this in an address at a plenary session on \u201cOil and Gas Industry in Nigeria and the Quest for Energy Transition\u201d at the 2022 National Energy Summit held in Abuja.\n\nKyari was represented at the event organised by the Energy Commission of Nigeria in collaboration with the International Energy Charter (IEC), Brussels, Belgium and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) by the NNPC Group General Manager, Corporate Planning and Strategy, Mrs Oritsemeyiwa Eyesan.\n\nHe contended that given present realities in the global energy community, it had become imperative for the country to focus more on in-country initiatives to harness its abundant natural resources to bridge existing energy gap.\n\n\u201cNNPC is working on floating various LNG projects that will harness the nation\u2019s natural resources to grow the domestic gas market in line with Federal Government\u2019s aspiration to meet energy needs of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cPrior to the technical transition to a limited liability company on July 1, 2022, NNPC has proactively set up a world class Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) Division as part of the efforts to become a global energy company of choice.\n\n\u201cThis is because we recognise that innovation remains a core tool in actualising energy transition aspiration.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the General Manager, Gas and Renewable Energy of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Dr Ola Agbaje, pointed out that virtual gas transportation was gaining traction in Nigeria.\n\nHe described the NNPC\u2019s ongoing 614km Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) gas pipeline as a \u201cTransformational Project\u201d.\n\nEarlier in her presentation on \u201c2020/2021 Energy Investment Risk Assessment Reports\u201d the Official of the International Energy Charter (IEC), Ishita Pant, applauded the numerous gas expansion programmes and reforms in the nation\u2019s oil and gas sector, especially, the PIA.\n\nThe session was moderated by a former Group Executive Director of the NNPC and Partner, Gulf of Guinea Petroleum Consulting, Mr Onochie Anyaoku.\n\nIn another development, an oil and gas sector pressure group, Women in PENGASSAN called for stiffer punishment for domestic and gender-based violence offenders to serve as deterrence.\n\nThe call became important following the increasing wave of domestic and gender-based violence across the country.\n\nThe group made the call at the grand finale of its nationwide advocacy programme tagged: \u201cPENGASSAN Women Say No to Domestic/Gender-Based Violence\u201d which held in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking during an awareness march from the Unity Fountain to the Ministry of Women Affairs in Abuja, the Chairperson of the group, Faith Usoro, said tougher punishment for perpetrators of domestic and gender-based violence was the only way to stem the tide of the crime as desperate situations required desperate remedies.\n\nReceiving the group on behalf of the Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs Pauline Tallen, the Director, Economic Services, of the Ministry, Mr Idris Mohammed, said the Ministry was working with stakeholders to enact more laws to protect the rights of women.\n\nTallen said that even the Bills that were earlier thrown out by the legislature would be revisited.\n\nThe Minister listed some of the measures put in place by the ministry to curb domestic and gender-based violence to include, \u201cone, launch of sexual offenders\u2019 register aimed at naming and shaming.\n\n\u201cWe have a contact line +234-8031230651 and +234-7053576528 for receiving complains.\u201d\n\nOn a final note, the international oil community lost Mohammad Barkindo, the Secretary General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nBarkindo whose tenure commenced in 2016 and was to end this month, was born on April 20, 1959 in Yola, Adamawa State.\n\nHe held a B.Sc. (Hons) in Political Science, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State and Post Graduate Diploma in Petroleum Economics, in Oxford, United Kingdom.\n\nHe also held an MBA in Finance and Banking, Washington University, in the United States.\n\nBarkindo who was a Fellow, George Mason University, Fairfax VA, U.S., also held a Doctorate Degree in Science (Honoris Causa) of the Federal University of Technology, Yola.\n\nHe began his working career as a Special Assistant to the Minister of Petroleum Resources and Head, Office of the Chairman of the Board of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC Board between 1986 and 1989.\n\nHe also served in various capacities in the NNPC Group, spanning some 24 years, namely:\n\nHead, International Investments, Investment Division, NNPC Headquarters (1992)\n\n\u2013 Head, International Trade, NNPC London\n\n\u2013 President, Duke Oil Inc.\n\n\u2013 Chairman NAPOIL (1993\u201394)\n\n\u2013 General Manager, NNPC London Office (1993\u201397)\n\n\u2013 Managing Director/Chief Executive, HYSON/CALSON, an international trading arm of the NNPC (1998\u20132003)\n\n\u2013 Group General Manager Investments, NNPC Headquarters (2003\u201304)\n\n\u2013 Deputy Managing Director/Chief Executive, NLNG (2005).\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, he served as Coordinator, Special Projects, NNPC, with the mandate to oversee all Federal Government projects vested in the NNPC.\n\nBarkindo participated as a member of the Oil and Gas Industry Reform Implementation Committee (OGIC) that produced the original draft of the Petroleum Industrial Bill (2008) and led the Transformation Programme of the NNPC as enshrined in the Oil and Gas Industry Reform Implementation Committee Report (2008).\n\nBetween January 2009 and April 2010, Barkindo served as Group Managing Director of the NNPC.\n\nBefore becoming the Secretary General of OPEC, he served at various capacities in the organisation between 1986 and 2010.\n\nHe was a Nigerian Delegate to OPEC Ministerial Conferences between 1993 and 2008 and served as Nigeria\u2019s National Representative on OPEC\u2019s Economic Commission Board (ECB).\n\nBetween January and December 2006, he served as Acting OPEC Secretary General, before chairing the ECB from 2009 to 2010.\n\nHe became Nigeria\u2019s Governor for OPEC and served as Adhoc OPEC Governor at various times, as well as Chairman OPEC Task Force of the 15th Session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD).\n\nAlso on the international energy scene, he spearheaded the OPEC/European Union dialogue on Energy Markets, Taxation and Environment.\n\nHe was a key player in the first Long Term Strategy (LTS) at OPEC, and a delegate to the African Petroleum Producers Association (APPA) conference in Algiers, Algeria, in 1986.\n\nHe was also a delegate to the African Petroleum Producers Association (APPA) Ministerial Conferences from 1987 to 2010.\n\nThe late Barkindo was a pioneer member of the International Energy Forum (IEF), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nHe helped to facilitate and consolidate the OPEC/non-OPEC cooperation and dialogue on climate change and led Nigeria\u2019s technical delegations to the climate change negotiations that produced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC.\n\nIt is worthy to note that he was the only Nigerian Delegate to attend all 15 Conferences of the Parties to the UNFCCC from Conference of the Parties, COP1 in Berlin 1995 to COP15 in Copenhagen 2010.\n\nIn 2002, he served as Coordinator, Group of 77 and China at UNFCCC, and was elected Vice-President of the Conference of Parties at COP13 of the UNFCCC in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2007.\n\nHe was re-elected Vice-President variously at COP14 in Poznan, Poland, in December 2008 and at COP15 in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December 2009.\n\nBarkindo participated at the UNFCCC COP22 (Marrakesh 2016), COP23 (Bonn 2017) and COP24 (Katowice 2018).\n\nHis hobbies included reading, charity work, the environment and soccer.\n\nThe Nigerian oil and gas industry, and indeed the entire global energy community missed his invaluable contributions to the growth of the industry.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Attacks on Military, Police Formations, Correctional Centres and Aregbesola \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nOver the last one month we have series of chaotic events in Nigeria. How do you blame Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior for the terrorists attack in Owo where more than 30 people were killed? How do you blame Aregbesola for the killing of more than 90 people in Zamfara State which has provoked the Governor to tell their people to arm themselves? How do you blame Aregbesola for the killing of more than 30 soldiers in a mining site in Niger State? How do you blame Aregbesola for the attack on President Buhari convoy in Katsina State? Those requesting for Aregbesola to be sacked as minister of interior are not objective because the police and army got a report of the Kuje\u2019s correctional attack.\n\nOF late, there had been series of sponsored attacks on military, police, INEC offices and correctional centres facilities. The gory attacks on police stations and other government institutions are launched to strike fear. There have been more attacks on military and police facilities than correctional centres. The military and police provide security for our correctional centres across Nigeria. Why are some people being mischievous about calling for the sack of Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior? The Federal Government has said the security personnel deployed to man Medium Security Custodial Centre, Kuje, in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) did their best to repel the terrorists\u2019 attack but were subdued. Terrorists Succeeded Because They Had Superior Firepower. The Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammed Dingyadi, said this while fielding questions from State House reporters after a briefing on the outcome of the emergency National Security Council (NSC) meeting presided over by President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) on Thursday demanded the sack of the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, for failing to stop attacks on prisons in the country. The group was reacting to Tuesday night\u2019s attack on the Kuje correctional centre in Abuja by the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP).\n\nHURIWA demands the arrest of the persons who gave the order purportedly for the withdrawal of soldiers before the attack.\u201d \u201cWe demand the sack of the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, and his Defence counterpart, Bashir Magashi, for perpetual incompetence. They also call for a broad-based judicial panel of inquiry on prison breaks in Nigeria to be constituted.\u201d I want to educate HURIWA that there was a platoon of the Nigerian Army with sophisticated weapons, elite men of the Nigeria Police Force, officers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence, and armed officers of the Nigerian Correctional Service, on ground during the time of the attack.\n\nAfter the Abolongo, Oyo State, attack on a correctional facility, in October last year, it became apparent that a new form of attack for which correctional system was not prepared for had emerged. Correctional system was primed to prevent and foil internal disturbance and riots, not external attacks/invasion, since the facilities were usually built around police and military formations.\n\nAregbesola applied section 1 of the Armed Forces Act Cap A20 2004, which pointed out that the establishment and functions of the Armed Forces, which comprise the Army, Navy and Air Force, include functions as may be assigned to them by the President in consultation with the National Assembly. This was carried out by Aregbesola when armed soldiers, police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) officers were drafted to correctional facilities nationwide, to secure them against further attacks. Several but unsuccessful attempts were made to attack correctional facilities since then, as the armed guards repelled them on each occasion.\n\nAregbesola has made Nigerian Army to complement the Police in the discharge of its duties when called upon by correctional authorities in restoring law and order in situations as contemplated in section 305 of the Constitution, which is in time of emergency. Some may justify it on the basis of Doctrine of Necessity and in the name of national security.\n\nThe consequence of the present security situation is that soldiers, who are trained statutorily to fight international aggressors, have been deployed to assist the police in performing their duties. The military have the constitutional role of defending the territorial integrity of the country against external aggression, to coordinate the enforcement of immigration law and customs, as well as to protect the country\u2019s borders, among others. On the other hand, the police have the responsibility to protect life and property, detect and investigate crimes, and to maintain law and order. Therefore, the increasing deployment of military forces for internal security operations across the country underscores the profoundly dysfunctional state of Nigeria\u2019s public safety institutions, particularly the ineffectiveness of the police force. By law, the police and the Army have their primary duties and responsibilities, which they are trained to do, spelt out in black and white. Section 214 (1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) establishes the Nigerian Police Force as the only policing authority in Nigeria.\n\nAttacks on police, army and correctional facilities have continued across Nigeria with many officers killed in the past one year. Several police officers have been killed in the past one year in targeted attacks on police officers and correctional facilities. The attacks have occurred mainly across the regions of Nigeria.\n\nThere have been many reports of attack on formations and troops in recent months even though some are not confirmed. IF the presence of military institutions were to guarantee peace, safety and protection, Kaduna State would have emerged as the most peaceful and protected entity in Nigeria. Kaduna is blessed with not only elite military establishments but is also home to the largest number of respectable military institutions, making the state the envy of other parts of Nigeria.\n\nIndeed, it leaves one wondering how one state managed to be so blessed with such a large number of elite military agencies, with both intimidating artillery weapons and infantry personnel with global battlefield medals. Unlike other states of the federation with the presence of one military base, a police command and a few security outfits, Kaduna has no fewer than 13 military establishments spread across the state. These are not mean institutions, and are manned by many top officials\n\nThe state is host to the elite 1st Division of the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Army Depot, Zaria, Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Nigerian Defense Industry, Nigerian Airforce Training School, Nigerian Police College and the Nigerian Navy School of Armament, Kachia. Other military institutions in Kaduna are: The Nigerian Army School of Legal Services, Bassawa Zaria, the Nigerian Defence Academy, the Nigerian Army School of Artillery, Kachia, the Nigerian Army School of Military Police, Army Operation Base, Southern Kaduna and the Nigerian Army School of Infantry.\n\nWith these and other security agencies operating in Kaduna, the state and its environs should have become a veritable military fortress that cannot be easily overrun by bandits or terrorists. But this is not the case. It has paradoxically suffered more attacks by daring bandits and terrorists than many other states in the North or any other part of the country. These audacious attacks have come in torrents and destructive fashion, leading to the killing of thousands of innocent persons, destruction of key national infrastructure and the kidnapping for ransom of very important Nigerians. Members of the armed forces have also fallen victims to the ravenous elements, which apparently are always on the lookout for top officials to maim, kill or kidnap for pecuniary gains.\n\nAs a proof, between 2021 to March 2022, security was breached around Mando, Afaka and the International Airport Kaduna with impunity. First, the criminal elements attacked the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation and abducted over 40 students, which they kept in their custody for months until their financial conditions were met by parents of the victims. Next, the terrorists descended on the premier military university, Nigerian Defence Academy, where an officer was brutally slain and another taken captive and only freed by colleagues after some time in captivity.\n\nDo not blame Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior but the police and judiciary system for the continuous correctional facilities congestion due to slow pace of dispensing justice in Nigeria. The correctional service officials should not be blamed for lapses at the correctional yards because they have alerted the police authority and especially the judiciary on the congestion.\n\nCorrectional Centres officials make monthly updates to the Attorney General both in the states and federation on the challenges and the situation has not been addressed over the years. Every Month, the service write to the Attorney General to update them the development on the number of inmates and congestion situation but it has remained like that.\n\n________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Abuja\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Victor Isuku in his presentation defined community policing as \u201ca philosophy that aims to position the police and the public to cooperate in a situation of mutual consultation and partnership at addressing problems of crime and disorder.\u201d\n\nAccording to him \u2018community policing is a democratic policing, of the people, by the people and for the people.\n\n\u201cVigilante or vigilantism on the other hand, is the act of an individual or group to uphold and protect the law within their area of responsibility with the backing of the law.\u201d\n\nHe said that the dicotomy between community policing and vigilante is a bridge by the fact that both are aimed at enhanced security.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Bola Tinubu, presidential Candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has defended his choice of Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate, noting that he could not choose a Christian and a Muslim at the same time.\n\nSpeaking on his choice of Shettima, Tinubu said all his life, decisions regarding the team around and supporting him had always been guided by the principles of competence, innovation, compassion, integrity, fairness, and adherence to excellence.\n\nAccording to him, he consulted widely on the issue of running mate and he appreciated the perspectives of leading members of the party, political allies and key national figures \u201cwho see Nigeria\u2019s future as I do.\u201d\n\nThe former Lagos governor said the belief in prioritising leadership, competence, and the ability to work as a team over other considerations influenced his running mate choice.\n\n\u201cI am mindful of the energetic discourse concerning the possible religion of my running mate. Just and noble people have talked to me about this. Some have counselled that I should select a Christian to please the Christian community. Other have said I should pick a Muslim to appeal to the Muslim community. Clearly, I cannot do both,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth sides of the debate have impressive reason and passionate arguments supporting their position. Both arguments are right in their own way. But neither is right in the way that Nigeria needs at the moment. As president, I hope to govern this nation toward uncommon progress. This will require innovation. It will require steps never before taken. It will also require decisions that are politically difficult and rare.\n\n\u201cIf I am to be that type of President, I must begin by being that type of candidate. Let me make the bold and innovative decision not to win political points but to move the nation and our party\u2019s campaign closer to the greatness that we were meant to achieve.\n\n\u201cHere is where politics ends, and true leadership must begin. Today, I announce my selection with pride because I have made it not based on religion or to please one community or the other. I made this choice because I believe this is the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation or considerations of ethnicity or region.\u201d\n\nTo those who might feel displeased by his action, Tinubu said, \u201cMay I say this to all of you, especially to those who will be disappointed in my selection based on religious considerations. I will not and cannot ignore the religious concerns and ethnic sensitivities of our people. Taking them into due consideration is an important part of good and able governance. But religion, ethnicity and region cannot always and fully determine our path. To forge ahead as a nation toward development and prosperity, we must break free of old binds. We must recalibrate our political calculations to where competence and fairness matter more than reductive demographics.\u201d",

          "text": "The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has kicked against the decision of Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to select former governor of Borno state, Kashim Shettima as his running mate.\n\nTinubu had during a visit to the President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura on Sunday announced Shettima, a Muslim, as his running mate, a decision that not gone down well with the umbrella body of Christians in the country.\n\nReacting to the development, CAN\u2019s spokesperson, Adebayo Oladeji, said making such a decision in a polarised country was a wrong move.\n\nHe stated, in an interview with Punch, that if having a pastor as the vice president of the country and Christian clerics and worshipers are being killed , the security of lives and properties of Christians under a Muslim-Muslim could not be guaranteed.\n\nOladeji warned that Nigerians should be ready to face the consequences of their actions if they endorsed and vote for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cWe knew this was what he was going to do and we have warned against it. It is up to Nigerians to decide on what they want,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou are all alive when we warned Buhari not to allow Muslims to dominate the security architecture of the country and he did it. I think we can see the way the criminals are operating with impunity.\n\n\u201cSo, if Tinubu says he is opting for a Muslim-Muslim ticket in a polarised country like ours , if Nigerians endorse him and vote for him, whatever happens, Nigerians will face the consequences.\n\n\u201cIf you have a government where a pastor is a vice president and pastors and worshipers are being killed you can imagine what will happen when we have a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cIt is left to Nigerians to make their choice, let them vote them in and we will all face the consequences together.\n\n\u201cWe are raising our alarm. It is an irony that Buhari they regarded as an extremist when we raised an alarm to warn him against a Muslim-Muslim ticket, he heeded and opted for a christian as his vice presidential candidate. \u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State chapter of CAN has declared that it will not encourage Christians to vote for any political party that fields same faith for the 2023 governorship election.\n\nThe state CAN Chairman, Most Reverend Bulus Dauwa Yohana who made this known after an emergency meeting with State Executive members, Local Government Coordinators, Bloc and other leaders held at the State Secretariat in Minna said Christians had been marginalised in the past adding that it is now time to take a decisive stand.\n\n\u201cAs equal stakeholders in Niger state who are concerned about the development of the state, we are ready to mobilize all Christians not to support and vote for any Political Party that undermines us to present a same faith ticket for the forthcoming general elections,\u201d the Chairman declared.\n\nIn a statement by his Media Aide, Daniel Atori, the Chairman also remarked, \u201cwe have resolved to allow equity, justice and fairness to play out. We are aware that there have been so many arguments as to the population of Christians in the state; Well, democracy is said to be a game of numbers and the next elections will surely show our position.\n\n\u201cWe call on all eligible Nigerlites especially Christians to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) so as to participate in the 2023 general elections if you truly want to effect positive change.\n\n\u201cIf Niger State must be rescued, then Christians both in the rural and urban areas must wake up and do the needful. We need to arm ourselves with our PVCs and this is the time to make all necessary efforts to do so and also come out and vote,\u201dhe remarked.\n\nBishop Yohanna said , \u201call we are telling political parties is that with our voters\u2019 cards, we will sway votes towards the party that respect Christians in the state.\u201d\n\nThe CAN Executive had few weeks ago met with executive members of both All Progressives Congress,(APC) and that of Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party,(PDP) on the need for them to consider Chritians as their deputies.\n\nThe PDP Govermorsip Candidate, Alhaji Isah Liman Kantigi picked a Christian- Samuel Gomna as his running mate which was endorsed by the Party in the state while APC Governorship candidate, Alhaji Umar Bago has picked a Muslim and incumbent state NLC Chairman, Comrade Yakubu Garba as his running mate which has also been endorsed by his Party.",

          "title": "Stemming the alarming exodus of professionals",
          "text": "On June 20, 2022, Business Hallmark published a story titled: \u2018Mass exodus hits Lagos State agencies\u2019, where it reported that over 700 workers in the employment of Lagos State government had resigned their appointments in the last five months to take up lucrative offers in Europe and America.\n\nParticularly affected, the report stated, are the Ministries of Education and Health which are daily recording exodus of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, laboratory technologists and teachers in large droves.\n\nOfficials in the state\u2019s civil service commission who spoke with this newspaper had claimed the exodus had negatively affected the already fragile health and education sectors, which suffer from shortage of personnel and facilities.\n\nAs alarming as the figure is, it does not affect those that left between 2018 and 2021.\n\nIt is worthwhile to state here that the Lagos conundrum is not an isolated case. In fact, all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory are not immuned to the daily loss of experienced hands. For instance, earlier this year, security agencies were used to disperse large crowd of doctors who thronged recruitment centres by foreign countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar etc.\n\nUnvalued, underpaid and unsecure in their fatherland, Nigeria\u2019s professionals are daily leaving our shores to seek greener pastures abroad.\n\nWhile the mass migration is going on at an alarming rate, government officials at all levels seemed unperturbed and are busy preparing for the 2023 general elections. Unfortunately, there are no signs that the trend will abate soon.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, there are currently approximately four physicians per 10,000 population in Nigeria, as against the organisation\u2019s recommended doctor-to-patient ratio of 1 physician to 1,000 people.\n\nAlso, the British General Medical Council, said 805 medical doctors migrated to the UK between July and December 2021. This translates to 134 trained doctors a month, 33 per week and four a day.\n\nThis figure is for the UK alone where 8,178 medical doctors of Nigerian origin were practising as at December 2021.\n\nFigures released by the British Nursing and Midwifery Council also showed that from March 2016 to March 2021, 15,049 Nigerian nurses moved to the UK.\n\nThis translates to 3,009 annually, 228 per month, 57 per week and 8 per day nigerian nurses that abandoned the country to serve in the UK health system. This is alarming.\n\nWhile the health sector is reeling and begging for attention, the nation\u2019s education sector has not done better. For instance, based on the National Policy on Education, the teacher-pupil ratio should be 1:40.\n\nHowever, the average ratio is exceeded in most schools, with the national average teacher-pupil ratio standing at 1:70.\n\nThese malformation, apart from puting the educational future of millions of Nigerian children of school age in jeopardy, has also exposed most Nigerians, especially the masses to needless health risks and avoidable deaths.\n\nOut of school and unable to make something meaningful out of their lives, these out-of-school pupils are daily turning to misfits and nuisance to the society. They have become tools in the hands of religious extremists and criminal warlords.\n\nThe unceremonious exits of professionals is also coming at a huge cost to the country. Educating health professionals and teachers is an expensive enterprise for any developing country.\n\nAccording to a conservative estimate, it takes about N30 million to train a medical doctor through medical school and N7 million to train a teacher in a university.\n\nWhat this implies is that while the government subsidies the tuition of its professionals through the university, the nation rarely benefits from their services before they move abroad.\n\nThe reality is stark and frightening. While our hospitals have become mere consulting rooms and death traps, our children are turning to undesirable elements.\n\nThis anomaly has marred the polity for decades and ought to be reversed as quickly as possible with holistic programmes and practical policy implementations as done in civilized climes.\n\nPretending as if all is well will be tantamount to sitting on a keg of gunpowder. The trend, if allowed to fester, will sooner than later turned catastrophe for the nation.\n\nWe admonish the government to stop living in denial and wake up to its duty of serving the people who elected it into office. However, there is the argument that the development is beneficial to the country because these professionals export their skill and repatriate foreign exchange to the country, which helps to boost the naira.\n\nA survey report by NOIPolls and Nigerian Health Watch on the \u2018Emigration of Nigerian Medical Doctors\u2019 highlights several contributory factors to the lingering brain drain, with the most common being high taxes and deductions from salary, poor salaries, huge knowledge gap, and poor quality of practice and insecurity\n\nTo address these challenges, the government should create a conducive environment that will ensure job satisfaction among its dissatisfied workforce.\n\nGovernment must also provide the needed infrastructure such as good transport systems, affordable and functional education, electricity, stable energy in addition to good health care system.\n\nThe issue of insecurity should also be tackled headlong as no professional would be comfortable where his colleagues are being targeted by kidnappers who often kill them despite their families and colleagues paying the ransom demanded.\n\nGovernment should ensure proper funding of the two critical sectors. It can do this by blocking leakages in government to save more funds for the expansion of the health and education budgets.\n\nWhile more facilities and modern equipment should be provided in public hospitals, modern classrooms and teaching aids should be provided in all public schools.\n\nGovernment should strive to meet the 26 percent recommended by UNESCO. This is about N3.5 trillion allocated annually to the education sector by the Federal Government in the last six years which is less than 10% of the budget is a far cry from the ideal. It should be improved on.\n\nWelfare of its essential and emergency workers should be made paramount. For instance, the salaries allowances of these workers should be reviewed upward, no matter how minimal.\n\nWhile this will not immediately stop the brain drain, it will be a starting point and will represent government\u2019s good faith to meet the workers\u2019 demands midway.\n\nWe, however, urge Nigerian professionals running away from the country to reconsider. Teachers and health professionals, like all other professionals, are trained in the nation\u2019s tuition free universities.\n\nTherefore, they have an obligation to give back to the country. The country cannot continue training them for other countries free of charge. This comes at a cost. And the sooner they realise this, the better for everyone.",

          "title": "Parliament of Eunuchs, By Tola Adeniyi",
          "text": "I really don\u2019t know what to call them. We labelled them men without balls, it didn\u2019t bother them. We accused the few women in their midst as being mere decorations and carriers of scents and perfumes to deodorize the legislative chambers, those lipsticked \u2018wives and mothers\u2019 merely shrugged their shoulders. We say they are irredeemably corrupt and lacking in character and stature befitting people expected to represent their constituents, they just look the other way as if our words were Greek to their ears.\n\nWikipedia says a eunuch is a man who has been castrated. Throughout history, castration often served a specific social function. The earliest records of intentional castration to produce eunuchs are from the Sumerian city of Lagash in the 2nd millennium BCE. Over the millennia since, they have performed a wide variety of functions in many different cultures: courtiers or equivalent domestics, for espionage or clandestine operations, castrato singers, concubines, or sexual partners, religious specialists, soldiers, royal guards, government officials, or guardians of women or harem servants\u2019\n\n\u2018Eunuchs would usually be servants or slaves who had been castrated to make them less threatening servants of a royal court where physical access to the ruler could wield great influence. Eunuchs supposedly did not generally have loyalties\u2026 they were thus seen as more trustworthy and less interested in in establishing a private \u2018dynasty\u2019. Because their condition usually lowered their social status, they could also be easily replaced or killed without repercussion\u2019\n\nThe current National Assembly is crowded by eunuchs, servants and slaves who had been castrated by greed, gluttony, selfishness, political ignorance and stupidity. Except for a negligible few, the so-called parliamentarians are a bunch of shameless individuals who are not fit to be called representatives of their constituencies. Most of them only show up in parliament when there is money to be shared and whenever they show up, most of them are either sleeping, snoring or emitting silent odious farts. The tiny few who ever displayed any independence are usually swept off by the establishment.\n\nI crave Dr Michael Owhoko\u2019s indulgence to let me quote copiously from his recent comprehensive damnation of the 9th Assembly:\n\n\u201cIn the absence of 11th hour miracle, when an assessment of performance of the Executive arm of government will be carried out on May 29 next year, using the economy, security and corruption as index, President Muhammadu Buhari may likely go down as a failed President.\n\nIf this happened, the Legislative organ of government should largely be blamed. Firstly, for failing to invoke the doctrine of checks and balances to ensure the President discharges his statutory obligations in line with national interest and aspirations. Secondly, for failing to halt breach of federal character principle by the President. Thirdly, for failing to interrogate the Executive for sliding economic indices, worsening corruption, rising insecurity, capital flight, mounting loans, multiple tax burden, unemployment, and decaying infrastructure, including poor electricity and education.\n\nFor these flops, the 9th National Assembly is an accessory to current woes of the country, and cannot be absolved. The Legislature is the second organ of Government, free and independent from the control of the Executive, yet, the lawmakers have made it an extension, and apron string of the President.\n\n\u201cSigns that the 9th National Assembly will be a weakling and lacking a mind of its own, emerged when the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan said \u201cany request that comes from Mr. President is a request that will make Nigeria a better place\u201d, and would therefore expeditiously ensure passage of legislation therefrom.\n\n\u201cWith this declaration by the Senate President and head of National Assembly, the Legislature has violated the doctrine of separation of powers and checks and balances as enunciated by French philosopher, Charles Baron Montesquieu, in his book, The Spirit of Law. The intention of Montesquieu was the need to separate the three organs of government, namely, the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary, to enable each arm serve as check on the other to ensure equilibrium.\n\nIt is aimed at protecting their respective liberty, and preventing any organ of government from becoming too powerful as to transmute into tyranny and authoritarianism. The doctrine has become a template for good governance and global reference for protection and advancement of egalitarianisms. It forms part of constitution in countries where democracy is practiced.\n\nFor undermining this doctrine, Lawan has not only sacrificed the trust of the people on the altar of self-aggrandizement but projected President Buhari as all-knowing and omniscient President who can do no wrong, and whose intellectual capacity is beyond the competence of the Senate and House of Representatives combined.\n\nBesides, the National Assembly (NASS) has encouraged the creation and emergence of an all-powerful President with uninhibited liberty to go off course at will even on matters of national interest. For example, the federal character principle as contained in the 1999 Constitution is breached with impunity by President Buhari, and despite criticism, has shown no remorse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 14, Sub-section 3 of the 1999 Constitution says that \u201cThe composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to command national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that Government or in any of its agencies.\u201d\n\nThe Buhari Administration has done exactly the opposite. All key national appointments contravene Section 14, Sub-section 3 as evidently reflected in the dominance of people from the north, particularly, from the Fulani ethnic group. Yet, the Senate sees nothing wrong with this imbalance, as long as it originates from the President. By this, the President has promoted what the constitution intended to avoid \u2013 disunity and national disloyalty.\n\nAll key and juicy ministries, departments and agencies of government (MDAs), including security agencies, are headed, and firmly in the hands of northerners, just as all three organs of government were headed by northerners up till few weeks ago when Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad resigned as Chief Justice of Nigeria, paving the way for the most senior justice, Olukayode Ariwoola, a southerner, in acting capacity.\n\n\u201cIn advanced democracies, the Senate would have compelled the President to reverse such appointments to reflect federal character or face impeachment. But the National Assembly lacks the courage to reject Buhari\u2019s nominees or even initiate impeachment threat, obviously, for fear of Executive intimidation.\n\n\u201cWhen a country deliberately closes its doors against other sections and ethnic groups just to achieve ethnic dominance, unwittingly, misses contributions of intelligent and bright minds from the neglected areas to national development. That the country has been on a downward swing in the last seven years, is the price of nepotism.\n\n\u201cIronically, those who have been favoured by this structural abnormality do not see anything wrong with it, even within the context of the constitution. They keep blind eyes, reminding others that Nigeria\u2019s unity is not negotiable. This is an illusion. Attaining peace in the face of obvious mismanagement of diversities and dishonest policies, is a tall order..\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Judiciary is also unable to invoke the doctrine of checks and balances, as it appears not to have recovered from the intimidation it suffered in the hands of the Executive when operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) in 2016 raided the homes of some federal judges, including serving Supreme Court justices.\n\nPerhaps, if the law makers were courageous enough, and the Judiciary lives up to its billings to restrain the President appropriately, the Executive would have been shaped up.\n\n\u201cSince NASS has abdicated its autonomy and authority, who then can challenge the Executive over breaches of federal character principle and other statutory obligations, including economy and security management? If Chief Gani Fawehinmi of blessed memory were alive, no doubt, would have instituted litigation.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, what legacy will the 9th National Assembly under the chairmanship of Ahmad Lawan, be leaving as the law makers vacate office in less than a year from now? Certainly, they cannot be divorced from the performance of the Buhari Administration when the score card is evaluated on May 29, 2023.\u201d\n\nThis is the conclusion of Dr Owhoko\u2019s incisive treatise which is unassailable and perhaps requires no further elucidation. My only addition is the reality of Buhari being a completely calamitous President and deceitful and callously insensitive Dictator.\n\nOne can only ask the spineless members of the National Assembly what devil has befallen them and has eaten up their awareness of their environment and the reason why they went to Abuja to feast on our national treasury.\n\nAre they scared-stiff of Major General Buhari? Are they afraid of Mamman Daura as they were afraid of Abba Kyari, Ismaila Funtua before him? Are they afraid of El-Rufai or other shadowy characters who are the real puppeteers in Aso Rock? Or is the semi-illiterate Malami who ordinarily should not have been appointed a court clerk that has made eunuchs of them all? Or is it the grand-patron of the Caliphate?\n\nIt is shameful that Senators and Representatives from Taraba, Benue, Plateau, Zamfara, Katsina, Kogi, Niger, Southern Kaduna and Southern Adamawa, and the entire South of the Rivers Niger and Benue are just sitting down like ducklings while their families back home are being slaughtered on daily basis by bloodthirsty hounds that are being led to believe they can overrun the Nigerian space and drive the owners of the land into the sea or out of their ancestral lands.\n\nAll the eunuchs in the National Assembly and the eunuchs in the so-called rubber-stamp executive council should realise that a time may come, God forbid, when the hungry and angry masses of the people may descend on them individually or collectively and give them the Sri Lanka treatment. And all those who are carrying out unlawful orders like Zombies should realise that the uniforms they wear shall fall off their backs sooner than later even before the imminent collapse of the Lugardian contraption happens.\n\nLawan must visit Saraki today and learn how the latter stoutly resisted every attempt made to make him a eunuch.\n\nHigh Chief Tola Adeniyi is a veteran columnist, author and former MD of the Daily Times of Nigeria.",

          "text": "That terrorists and bandits are getting bolder, more daring, and more sophisticated is not debatable. After a period of relative peace, the nation, has entered a new phase of terrorist attacks that frontally challenges state power. It needs no further evidence after last Wednesday\u2019s Kuje Correctional Facility attack. That the nation is in a state of war is no more contentious when non- state actors target, with utmost audacity and recklessness, the convoy of our President (the commander in chief of the armed forces) to disrupt our chain of command and control.\n\nThese two events happening a few days apart speak volumes about our foes\u2019 intent and coordination. The choreographed attacks are evidence of the sophistication and astuteness of the terrorists in challenging our power structures with no regard or respect for the sanctity of symbols of power \u2013 the presidency and prisons. These are a determined group of terrorists and not opportunistic bandits.\n\nThis latest upsurge of terrorist attacks and banditry is symbolic of the failure of intelligence, aversion to planning, compromise of law enforcement, and lack of operational capacity of security and law enforcement apparatus. It is indicative of the rot in the system that must be dealt with decisively for our collective good. The success rate of these attacks is becoming alarming. The ability of bandits and terrorists to graduate from attacking soft targets to boldly and ambitiously attacking symbols of state power speaks volumes about their shifting of modus operandi.\n\nPreviously, they were busy capturing, maiming, and killing villagers at the remote boundaries and ungoverned spaces without border controls. Now, they boldly attack trains and airports in Kaduna, shoot at planes with land-to-surface missiles, attack military barracks and kill soldiers at will, attack a correctional centre at the centre of power ,and attack the President\u2019s convoy with temerity.\n\nThis recent attack marks an epoch in Nigeria\u2019s struggle for its heart and soul. Where we go from here is significant and must shape our collective future. How we match this shifting paradigm by bandits and terrorists will define our collective future. The audacity with which terrorists and bandits challenge the state\u2019s authority and the ordinary functioning of its coercive apparatus is unimaginable. This disaster is a symptom of danger looming around, which we must collectively tackle in a nonpartisan, multidimensional manner devoid of any sentiments.\n\nLast week\u2019s unusual security breaches highlighted how exposed and vulnerable we are. Enough is enough. A feeling of insecurity in the country is now pervasive. And the high and low in the country are victims of their shadows. As it is now, terrorism and banditry are winning. Both have altered our way of life and are pushing us to the edges where people resort to self-help to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n\nTravelling to some parts of the country by road is usually risky and going to churches and mosques is dangerous and a suicide mission in some areas. Going to the farm is a sure trip to yonder for some farmers in some parts of Nigeria. Living in Nigeria has become an existential crisis, and we are still treating the situation with nonchalance. Everyday activities, existence, and survival have become a mirage for some Nigerians, and there appears to be no hope.\n\nCombining insecurity of these sorts with the crushing economic hardship in Nigeria occasioned by both local and international factors is devastating. Most Nigerians have never got it this bad, and never have we felt so insecure and uncertain of our future as today. Imagine how residents of Abuja would be feeling now. It is unbelievable that terrorists could lay siege and destroy Kuje prison in an operation that lasted almost 3 hours without a corresponding repelling force from our security operatives. What would be the fate of residents had these terrorists and bandits decided to operate in estates or residential areas of the metropolis? We cannot even imagine the carnage. This is the reality of the Nigeria of today.\n\nThe breach of National Security Act 1990, as amended, seen in this week\u2019s events, requires an effective response from the government, security ecosystem, and citizens of Nigeria. The details of the incidents are still unfolding, but existing reports are heartrending and disturbing. The attack on Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS); was a development that left at least 879 inmates fleeing from custody. Besides, at least five persons died when attacked by terrorists, numbering over two hundred on motorcycles , who did not only bomb the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre in Abuja but also threw the facility open for inmates, including incarcerated terrorists, to flee .\n\nAmong the injured casualties of the attack was an officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) attached to the facility, and three personnel of the Nigerian Correctional Service. At the same time, terrorists killed four inmates said to have attempted an escape. Meanwhile, as shock and apprehension trail the attack, the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) has owned up to the attack, claiming responsibility for same.\n\nIt is disturbing that attacks on prisons by terrorists and bandits have been increasing in recent times. The security at the Kuje Correctional Centre was found wanting and caught unawares, which is lamentable. The recurring attempts and attacks are enough signals to intimate the government to beef up security across the Correctional facilities in the country. The fact that terrorists took the attack to the capital city within the central government\u2019s jurisdiction of authority is a spit on its face.\n\nThe second incident is even more daring. First, news broke that the ubiquitous \u2018bandits,\u2019 by design or by accident, had laid siege into an advance convoy of the President. The convoy was travelling to the President\u2019s village to lay the groundwork for him to spend Salah in Daura, his hometown. The bandits opened fire, and the President\u2019s men returned fire and defended the convoy. Some personnel were injured, and others died. I sympathise with the victims and families of both incidents.\n\nThe symbolism of these attacks is obvious to contemplate. First, these criminals can attack anywhere and anytime they choose and are brazenly audacious. Besides, no one is off-limits to them. By attacking the number one citizen\u2019s convoy, they have sent a clear message they can strike anyone.\n\nFurthermore, they have declared conventional war on Nigeria using asymmetrical methods. This is guerrilla warfare, for want of words to describe it. And they have struck terror in our collective consciousness. If they can reach the Kuje Correctional facility and the convoy of the President, they can get anyone. The gradual boldness and audacity signal a shift in approach that requires a corresponding response. Finally, they have raped the sense of security of Nigerians and created a perversive cloak of insecurity in cities and remote villages in Nigeria.\n\nThere is a need to create counter symbolism and narrative to reduce the impact of these symbols and bolster our collective psyche to confront, obstruct and defeat terrorism and banditry in all their ramifications. These new symbolisms must be created from the actions and reactions of the government and security community to confront existing terror-inspired symbols that dominate our consciousness.\n\nThe onus lies on the government to protect citizens\u2019 lives and property and create an atmosphere of tranquillity and security in the country. The lessons of the Kuje terror attack and bandits\u2019 attack on the presidential convoy are glaring for all to see. We must stop treating insecurity with sentimentality and as business as usual. The hydra-headed monster breeding may consume us all if we do nothing now.\n\nThis is \u201ca swim or drown situation\u201d, and Nigeria has no choice but to swim at all costs.\n\nBeyond the collective shame, the sensations that these attacks throw up go beyond mass hysteria and feelings of insecurity but also bear instigating substances to further embolden terrorists and bandits in Nigeria. We are now amidst the turbulence of insecurity and mayhem, demanding nothing but the full attention of the government. Such a response requires a radical security strategy and emergency operations to deform Nigeria\u2019s insecurity and terror networks. The threats before us have grown beyond maintaining a docile posture. Government and security agents must rise from slumber and become vehemently driven by concerted firmness to clamp down on security threats.\n\nThere seems to have been no severe consequences for bandits and terrorists\u2019 minor transgressions, so they have graduated to major ones. Civilians\u2019 homes, police officers\u2019 stations, and soldiers\u2019 bases were all attacked without clear consequences for the attackers. The rhetoric should go beyond repelling theattacks to preventing such attacks. government and security architecture celebrate repelling attacks on presidential convoys, prisons, and military bases. What would ordinary Nigerians who have no protection do or celebrate when attacked?\n\nIt now sounds pusillanimous to the hearing of tired and frightened Nigerians when the government and its security agencies talk about gallantry in repelling terror and bandit attacks. Nigerians want permanent solutions to prevent and end attacks on the Nigerian state and its citizens.\n\nWith fear in the air and a sense of hopelessness in dealing with insecurity, calls are coming from usual places, especially among governors asking for a license to arm citizens to defend themselves. As unbelievable as this sounds, it is a call for survival and a testament to the fact that people are beginning to lose faith in the government to tackle insecurity. A vigilante-style protection system may emerge from the seeming collapse of security when it becomes a Hobbesian natural state of every man to himself, and life becomes \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d because individuals are in a \u201cwar of all against all\u201d. We must avoid this state because Nigeria cannot afford to fail, and it will be too expensive.",

          "text": "The General Overseer, Salvation Ministries, Pastor David Ibiyeomie has vowed to tear anyone to pieces and kill him if the person should insult Bishop David Oyedepo.\n\nHe first dropped the bombshell in February and re-echoed it again on Sunday during a sermon.\n\nBishop Oyedepo is the founder of Living Faith Worldwide and a flamboyant prosperity preacher currently building the largest single auditorium in the world that will take 109,000 worshippers at a single service.\n\nHe is the mentor of Ibiyeomie who came through his tutelage. He has pattern his lifestyle after Oyedepo and would dare no one to speak ill of him.\n\nIbiyeomie does not care if anyone should insult him or his wife, but to touch Oyedepo means death for such adversary running foul of Christ\u2019s doctrine of forgiveness.\n\nHe had once threatened to kill critic, Daddy Freeze for insulting Oyedepo. In the Pastor\u2019s words- \u201cI will kill (Daddy Freeze) you. I will crush you to pieces. I curse the day you were born.\u201d\n\nBut on Sunday he reasserted his crude bruteness: \u201cI can tell you something: there are people you insult, I won\u2019t forgive you. In human life, the first person you will insult that I won\u2019t forgive you is Oyedepo.\n\n\u201cInsult me, insult my wife, I don\u2019t care but if you take your mouth to touch my wife you are touching me. If you insult Oyedepo I will kill you; and that\u2019s how God is. You know why? If Bishop Oyedepo was not alive my Christianity would have been nonsense.\n\n\u201cHe made me love Christianity. Can you be alive and somebody is insulting your father? I will slap you; you are not born. Don\u2019t you see how I tore that beast to pieces? I will tear you to pieces. I will fight you spiritually, fight you everywhere, fight you law court, till they send you to jail.\n\n\u201cWhen people fight you, fight them till they go down. God is jealous about you. If we the humans can be jealous about people, God is so jealous about you.\u201d\n\nAn unrepentant Ibiyeomie told a story how a man attempted to run his mouth against Oyedepo in his office and had to shut him out for four years.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor four years, I did not pick his call. He said because of Oyedepo? I said, \u2018Yes sir. Don\u2019t you know where to have your tongue? I knew you because of him; if you insult him, you are insulting my father.\u2019 He said, \u2018ah! You are overdoing your own thing.\u2019 I said, before? Okay if you say Oyedepo is bad, me, am I good? You say the chicken is bad and the egg is good?\u201d",

          "text": "Kashim Ibrahim Shettima was born on September 2, 1966. He is currently a Senator and former governor of Borno State.\n\nSenator Kashim Shettima is a very intelligent and outspoken politician from the Kanuri tribe. He is generally seen as extremely hospitable to other faith and ethnic groups.\n\nDuring his time as a Governor, Shettima had amongst his closest aides, an Ibo Christian from Anambra State in the Southeast, an Urhobo Christian from Delta State in the South-South, a Christian from Edo State in the South-South, a Yoruba Christian from the Southwest, a fulani man from Gombe in the northeast and a Hausa man from Zamfara State in the northwest.\n\nSen. Kashim Shettima was born in Maiduguri, Borno state, Nigeria to the family of Sir Kashim Ibrahim. He is married to Nana Shettima, and they have three children: two females and a male.\n\nEducation:\n\nSen. Kashim attended Lamisula Primary School in Maiduguri from 1972 to 1978; Government Community Secondary School, Biu in southern part of Borno State from 1978 to 1980; transferred to Government Science Secondary School, Potiskum (now in neighbouring Yobe State) where he completed his secondary education in 1983. He studied at the University of Maiduguri and earned a Degree (BSc) in Agricultural Economics in 1989. He had his one-year compulsory membership of the National Youths Service Corps, NYSC, at the defunct Nigerian Agricultural Cooperative Bank, Calabar, capital of Cross River State in South-South, Nigeria, from 1989 to 1990.\n\nHe obtained a master\u2019s degree (MSc) in Agricultural Economics in 1991 at the University of Ibadan in Southwest, Nigeria. Shettima joined the University of Maiduguri as a Lecturer with the Department of Agricultural Economics and was in the academia from 1991 to 1993.\n\nEarly career:\n\nIn 1993, he moved into the banking sector and was employed by (now defunct) Commercial Bank of Africa Limited as head of accounts unit at the bank\u2019s office in Ikeja, Lagos State, Southwest, Nigeria.\n\nShettima was there from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 he crossed over to the African International Bank Limited as a Deputy Manager and rose to become a Manager in 2001. In 2001, he moved to the Zenith Bank as head of its main branch in Maiduguri. At the Zenith Bank he rose to Senior Manager/Branch Head; Assistant General Manager (AGM)/Zonal Head (North-East), Deputy General Manager/Zonal Head (North-East) before he stepped out of the Zenith Bank as a General Manager in 2007 following his appointment as Commissioner for Finance in Borno State.\n\nShettima worked with the Commercial Bank of Africa as an Agricultural Economist at its Ikeja Office, Lagos State (1993-1997). He then became a deputy manager, later manager, at the African International Bank Limited, Kaduna Branch (1997\u20132001), and was appointed Deputy Manager/Branch Head of the Zenith Bank\u2019s Maiduguri Office in 2001, becoming General Manager five years later. In mid-2007, Shettima was appointed Commissioner of the Borno State Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. Later he became Commissioner in the Ministries of Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs, Education, Agriculture and later Health under his predecessor as Borno Governor Ali Modu Sheriff.\n\nPolitical career:\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, he served as Commissioner in 5 Ministries. In the January 2011 ANPP primaries, Engineer Modu Fannami Gubio was selected as candidate for the governorship. However, Gubio was later shot dead by gunmen, and Shettima was selected in a second primary in February 2011. In the 26 April 2011 elections, Shettima won with 531,147 votes while the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Muhammed Goni, gained 450,140 votes.\n\nHe was Commissioner of Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs (2008), Education (2009), Agriculture and Natural Resources and finally to the Ministry of Health from where he contested the Governorship in 2011 which he won under the platform of the now defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party, ANPP and was inaugurated on May 29, 2011. He won reelection in 2015 under the All Progressives Congress, APC and was unambiguously chosen as Chairman of the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum, an umbrella body of Governors in the 19 States located in northern Nigeria. He has so far been driving key changes in the affairs of the forum with focus on promoting northern unity and reviving ailing industries belonging to northern States.\n\nAs Governor of Borno State, he has efficiently managed challenges arising from the Boko Haram insurgency which he inherited in 2011. With the approval of the National Security Adviser and the Nigerian Army in 2013, his government formalized establishment of youth volunteers called the Civilian JTF.\n\nThe volunteers have played very significant role in supporting the military in ongoing fight against Boko Haram insurgents. He approves salaries, kits and patrol vehicles for the civilian JTF while at the same time giving so much support to the Nigerian Armed Forces.\n\nHe leads in mobilization of community based intelligence gathering and the provision of hundreds of patrol vehicles and material logistics to the military in particular and to all other security agencies. In September, 2014, Maiduguri, the seat of Government became very vulnerable to being occupied by insurgents. The fear was so intense that notable residents relocated their families to Abuja. However, amidst such fright, Governor Kashim Shettima who was out of the country for an official assignment, returned to Maiduguri in a show of courage and patriotism. On his return, the Governor mobilized residents towards rising up in defense of their ancestry.\n\nAlthough Maiduguri didn\u2019t fall, the insurgents succeeded in occupying 20 out of the 27 local government areas of the State before the Nigerian Armed Forces liberated them between 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe Governor has been coordinating and leading the temporary accommodation, rehabilitation and resettlement of victims of the Boko Haram insurgents. With peace building, Governor Kashim Shettima has been championing Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Resettlement of victims. He has focused so much attention on expansion and remodeling of existing schools and the building of new boarding primary and junior secondary schools to cater for over 50, 000 unaccompanied orphans whose parents were killed by insurgents across the 27 local government areas of the State.\n\nGovernor Kashim Shettima\u2019s leadership credentials have attracted positive recognition within and outside Nigeria. Governor Shettima emerged the 2014 Governor of the Year (Leadership Newspapers), Governor of the Year, 2015, (Nigeria Union of Journalists, national body); Governor of the Year, 2015 (NewsWatchTimes Newspapers); Governor of the Year, 2015 (Vanguard Newspapers); Governor of the Year, 2016 (Tell Magazine); 2017 Zik Prize for Leadership; Kaduna NUJ Award for courage and exceptional leadership (2017), FCT NUJ Merit Award for exceptional Leadership, 2017.\n\nIn February, 2019 he became the winner of the Borno Central Senatorial District election, thereby replacing Senator Babakaka Bashir.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

This was made known in a statement made available to the media yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, REA Mr. Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad explained that the framework underpinned by the MoU between both parties, is expected to be implemented in a sustainable and impactful manner, while also addressing one of the Agency\u2019s strategic objectives \u2013 to promote electricity consumption for \u201cproductive use\u201d in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe MoU will mutually benefit both the REA and FADAMA. Both parties are keen to unlock the economic potential in agrarian communities, through the provision of electricity solutions for agro-processing and irrigation schemes\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe MoU will ensure timely communication and cooperation during the implementation stage of the programme, including support (where applicable) in conducting field surveys, monitoring/supervision and impact assessments.\n\nAlso Executive Director, Technical Services, REA Barka Sajou said that subsequently the agro-energy programme, as well as other proposed programmes under the framework, will be implemented to demonstrate opportunities for the private sector.\n\nAnd based on the lessons learned, viable agriculture-energy solutions and business models can be adopted and scaled commercially.\n\nThe MoU is also expected to consider the Agency\u2019s recently-launched Energizing Agricultural Programme EAP.\n\nThe EAP is a three-year initiative with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet GEAPP, with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation that aims to stimulate the use of mini-grid electricity in agricultural productive uses.\n\nThese \u201cAgro-Energy\u201d programmes are intended to provide electricity for productive use and unlock the economic potential/activities in rural and agrarian communities alike.\n\nSo far, the Agency has communicated and cooperated with stakeholders during the pre-implementation stage, including support in conducting desktop and field surveys to identify viable sites.\n\nMore specifically, and in line with REA\u2019s proposed agro-energy programmes, the NFDP\u2019s component 2 (Small Scale Community Owned Infrastructure) aims to rehabilitate surface water and construct new small-scale irrigation schemes and borehole schemes, as well as other groundwater irrigation schemes and infrastructure support. REA intends to provide decentralised solar pumps and/or centralised solar mini-grids to viable FADAMA irrigation schemes.\n\nThe National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI) are a Federal Government Agency mandated to provide assistance, durable solutions and support to persons of concern, including Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), Refugees, Migrants, Asylum Seekers, Stateless Persons, as well as Returnees.

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations. May the good Lord bless all of you and the work that you do\u201d added Jime.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Economic Diversification: Value addition in solid minerals sector will spur industrialization- DG NSRMEA",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

With that being said, it didn\u2019t appear to phase him for the rest of the match.\n\nHowever, the quarter-final outing against 10th-ranked Jannik Sinner was arguably his toughest test yet. He would come back from two sets down to win 5-7, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nIt is fair to say that he showed great adversity in the showdown with the Italian.\n\nIn the semi-final, Djokovic would face home favourite Cameron Norrie for a chance to face Kyrgios in the final, who progressed after Rafael Nadal pulled out of the pair\u2019s semi-final outing.\n\nAfter losing the first set, Djokovic came back in some style to defeat the Brit 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.\n\nKyrgios did cause Djokovic a lot of problems throughout the match. His serve proved to be a real problem for the Serb.\n\nEven though Kyrgios had his moments, Djokovic went on to show his class in the end when it really mattered.\n\nVictory over the Aussie means that Djokovic has now won four Wimbledon titles in a row and his seventh overall.\n\nAs of right now, Roger Federer has won the most Wimbledon titles with eight.\n\nWith 21 Grand Slam titles to his name, Djokovic has consistently shown why he is one of the greatest players of all time.",

Russia wants to wrest control of the Donbas on behalf of the separatists that it supports.\n\nMoscow says ejecting the Ukrainian military out of the region is central to what it calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to ensure its own security, an offensive that has lasted for more than four months and which the West calls an unprovoked war.\n\nRussian forces attacked Ukrainian positions near the town of Sloviansk in Donetsk but were forced to withdraw, Ukraine\u2019s military said, adding that Russian forces had launched a cruise missile attack on the northeastern city of Kharkiv from their side of the border. It gave no details of damage or casualties.\n\nLuhansk region Governor Serhiy Gaidai said Russian forces were gathering in the area of the village of Bilohorivka, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Sloviansk.\n\n\u201cThe enemy is \u2026 shelling the surrounding settlements, carrying out air strikes, but it is still unable to quickly occupy the entire Luhansk region,\u201d he said on Telegram.\n\nRussia claimed control over all of Luhansk province last weekend.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said its forces had destroyed two hangars near the Donetsk town of Kostyantynivka holding the U.S.-made M777 howitzers, which it said had been used to shell residential areas of Donetsk.\n\nReuters could not independently verify battlefield accounts.\n\nUkrainian military spokespeople were not immediately available for comment.\n\nUkrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw.\n\nIn the south, Ukrainian forces fired missiles and artillery at Russian positions including ammunition depots in the Chornobaivka area, Ukraine\u2019s military command said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on a trip to Asia, urged the international community to join forces to condemn Russian aggression. He said he had raised concerns with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, over Beijing\u2019s alignment with Moscow.\n\nThe two met for more than five hours on the sidelines of a gathering of G20 foreign ministers on the Indonesian island of Bali. Russia\u2019s Sergei Lavrov walked out of a meeting there on Friday, denouncing the West for \u201cfrenzied criticism\u201d.\n\nShortly before the Russian invasion, Beijing and Moscow announced a \u201cno limits\u201d partnership, although U.S. officials have said they have not seen China evade U.S.-led sanctions on Russia or provide it with military equipment.\n\nZelenskiy dismissed several of Ukraine\u2019s senior envoys abroad on Saturday, saying it was part of \u201cnormal diplomatic practice\u201d. He said he would appoint new ambassadors to Germany, India, the Czech Republic, Norway and Hungary. read more\n\nZelenskiy has urged his diplomats to drum up international support and high-end weapons to slow Russia\u2019s advance.\n\nUkraine suffered a diplomatic setback on Saturday, when Canada said it would return a repaired turbine that Russia\u2019s state-controlled Gazprom used to supply natural gas to Germany. Ukraine had argued that a return would violate sanctions on Russia.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has decried the rising cost of diesel in the country and urged the federal government to issue its members licences to import the product from the Republic of Niger and Chad.\n\nThe association, which raised the alarm that industries were being converted to warehouses of imported goods and event centres, also called on the federal government to avert the total shutdown of production operations.\n\nThe Director-General of MAN, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, made the call in a statement issued on Saturday in Lagos.\n\nMAN represents more than 3,000 manufacturers spread across 10 sectors, 76 sub-sectors, and 16 industrial zones.\n\nThe manufacturing sector, which dominates export trade in the West African sub-region, employs more than five million workers, directly and indirectly, and contributes 8.46 per cent to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAjayi-Kadir stated that the call was pertinent during times of crisis to enhance the performance of the sector through a pro-manufacturing policy that would encourage scale-up and lower unit cost of production.\n\nHe added that the manufacturing sector had been battered by many familiar challenges that had plummeted the number of industries and converted industrial hubs to warehouses of imported goods and event centres.\n\nThe MAN president also stated that top on the list of challenges confronting the sector was high operating cost caused by the twin problem of inadequate electricity supply and the high cost of alternative energy sources.\n\nHe added that the more than 200 per cent increase in the price of diesel had become a major constraint with spiral effects.\n\n\u201cMAN is greatly concerned about the implications of the over 200 per cent increase in the price of diesel on the Nigerian economy and the manufacturing sector in particular.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the deafening silence from the public sector as regards the plight of manufacturers,\u2019\u2019 he stated.\n\nAjayi-Kadir urged the government to strengthen the nation\u2019s economic absorbers from external shocks to reduce the myriad challenges the manufacturing sector was already beguiled with.\n\nHe stated that by the time the current domestic reserve of manufacturing inputs was exhausted, prices of manufactured products would soar in the face of an acute shortfall in supply.\n\nAjayi-Kadir added that government should continue to support manufacturing to accelerate the process of recovery from the aftermath of COVID-19 and previous bouts of recession.\n\nThis, he explained, would avert a complete shutdown of factories nationwide.\n\nHe urged the government to issue licenses to manufacturing concerns and operators in the aviation industry to import diesel and aviation fuel directly to avert the avoidable monumental paralysis of manufacturing.\n\nAjayi-Kadir also called for the removal of VAT on diesel as an instant stimulus for an immediate price reduction and expedite action in reactivating or privatising petroleum products refineries in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of urgency, the government should address the challenge of repeated collapses of the national grid which is causing acute electricity shortage, especially for manufacturers,\u2019\u2019 he stressed.\n\nMeanwhile, MAN has also asked the federal government to issue its members licences to import diesel from the Republic of Niger and Chad, Nigeria\u2019s neighbouring countries, to avert the avoidable monumental paralysis of manufacturing activities that could arise from the total shut down of production operations.\n\nThe MAN also tasked the government to develop a response strategy to address challenges emanating from the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe MAN said: \u201cIn light of the gravity of the precarious situation that we have found ourselves as a nation and the looming dangers ahead, the expectations of manufacturers in Nigeria are as follows: that government should urgently allow manufacturers and independent petroleum products marketing companies to also import AGO (diesel) from the Republic of Niger and Chad by immediately opening up border posts in that axis to cushion the effect of the supply gap driven the high cost of AGO (Automotive Gas Oil).\u201d\n\nThe association also requested the government to \u201cissue licences to manufacturing concerns and operators in the aviation industry to import diesel and aviation fuel directly to avert the avoidable monumental paralysis of manufacturing activities arising from total shut down of production operations and movement of persons for business activities.\u201d\n\nAjayi-Kadir noted that Nigerian manufacturers are greatly concerned about the implications of the over 200 per cent increase in the price of AGO on the Nigerian economy and the manufacturing sector.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the deafening silence from the public sector as regards the plight of manufacturers. Four obvious questions that readily come to mind that are seriously begging for answers are: What can we do as a nation to strengthen our economic absorbers from external shocks? Should manufacturing companies that are already battered with multiple taxes, poor access to foreign exchange, and now over 200 per cent increase in the price of diesel be advised to shut down operations? Should we fold our arms and allow the economy to slip into the valley of recession again? Is the nation well equipped to manage the resulting explosive inflation and unemployment rates?\u201d he asked.\n\nIt also implored the government to \u201ccontinue to support manufacturing to accelerate the process of recovery from the aftermath of COVID-19 and previous bouts of recession to avert the complete shutdown of factories nationwide with a multiplier effect on the employment.\u201d\n\nThe MAN also asked the federal government to \u201cas a matter of priority develops a National Response and Sustainability Strategy (NRSS) to address challenges emanating from the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia.\u201d\n\nThe MAN also tasked the government to \u201caddress the challenge of the repeated collapse of the national grid (twice within a week), which is causing acute electricity shortage in the country, especially for manufacturers,\u201d adding that government should \u201cremove VAT on AGO as an instant stimulus for an immediate price reduction and expedite action in reactivating or privatising the petroleum products refineries in the country.\u201d\n\nIt also demanded that the government should \u201crestrict the export of maize, cassava, wheat, food-related products and other manufacturing inputs available in the country; and grant concessional foreign exchange allocation at the official rate to manufacturers for the importation of productive inputs that are not locally available.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",
