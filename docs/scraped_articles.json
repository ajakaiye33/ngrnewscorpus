          "text": "There was a crisis on Thursday over the move by the House of Representatives to establish a Chartered Institute of Forensics and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria, as different groups clashed at the public hearing held by the parliament.\n\nThe Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria alleged that the bill being considered by the House was plagiarised, as the National Assembly had recently passed a similar bill it sponsored.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria\u2019s Chiefs of Army Staff since return to democracy\n\nThe legislation for which the hearing was held is titled, \u2018A Bill for an Act to Establish the Chartered Institute of Forensics and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria to Provide for the Regulation and Control of Its Membership and Promote the Practice of Forensics and Fraud Examiners in Nigeria; and For Related Matters 2021.\u2019\n\nEarlier at the hearing, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria and the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria had differed on the proposal in their separate presentations. While ICAN opposed the bill, ANAN supported it.\n\nThe Pro-tem President, CIFIPN, Mrs Victoria Ayishetu, expressed opposition to the bill in her oral and written submissions.\n\nShe noted that the CIFIPN had been in existence since 2009, recalling that the 8th National Assembly unanimously passed the bill to legalise the body.\n\nShe said the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), did not assent to the bill before the dissolution of the last Assembly in June, 2019, and it was reintroduced in the current 9th Assembly.\n\nAyishetu said, \u201cConsequently, the Senate at its plenary sitting on Tuesday, 2nd March, 2021, passed the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Investigative Professionals of Nigeria Bill, 2021, after it was read for the third time. And due to the bi-cameral nature of our legislature, the House of Representatives passed the bill on Wednesday, 19th May, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe accelerated response our bill received from the two chambers of the National Assembly is a testament to the fact that its intents and purports are of strategic importance to the fight against corruption and would boost all national efforts targeted at eradicating corruption, which has eaten deep into the fabric of our nation.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were taken aback when we heard that a bill that seeks to establish the Chartered Institute of Forensic and Certified Fraud Examiners of Nigeria was introduced at the floor of the House of Representatives, immediately after the passage of our bill by the Senate on March 2nd 2021.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn hearing this, we became curious and our curiosity led us to critically look at the provisions of the newly introduced bill alongside with ours, which has already been passed by the National Assembly, and we discovered that the provisions of the new bill merely duplicate the provisions of our bill.\u201d\n\nThe President/Chairman of Council, CIFFEN, Iliyasu Gashin-Baki, said there were concerns, even before the public hearing, as to whether this bill was encroaching on the functions of ICAN and ICAN.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor the past 10 years, the institute has been promoted by ANAN, which is a sister-body of ICAN. There are only there accounting organisations in Nigeria \u2013 ICAN, ANAN and in addition to that is the Chartered Institute of Taxation.\n\n\u201cFor someone to claim that it (forensics) is part of accounting is misinformation and misrepresentation. Yes, there is forensic accounting but there is forensic medicine too, and all the various disciplines that forensics covers.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the House had worked on a bill in the 8th National Assembly. I want you to investigate and interrogate why that bill was declined by the President. On the issue of whether that bill is the same thing with our own, it is a complete and outright misrepresentation.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, while declaring the hearing open, decried that corruption was frustrating the country\u2019s growth and development.\n\n\u201cThe different manifestations of corruption in our society have long militated against our national development. Until we have slayed this monster, we may not achieve the ambitions we have for our country. Therefore, we have an obligation to do what we must to strengthen the institutions of state responsible for leading the charge against this menace,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The NEC recalled that the last meeting with Government in February 2021 was adjourned sine die. Since then, no other meeting has been called by government. The NEC recalled and reiterated the decision it took on February 17, 2021, after the last meeting between labour and the Federal Government team on fuel price increase.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cThe NEC reiterated that it still stands solidly by its decision taken at its meeting which took place on 17th February 2021 to reject further increases in the price of refined petroleum products particularly the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS); The NEC also re-echoed its decision that the only sustainable way out of the crisis of fuel importation and associated dislocations in the downstream petroleum sub sector is for government to rehabilitate all four public refineries in Nigeria and build new ones;\n\n\u201cThe NEC resolved that any decision to increase by even one cent the price of refined petroleum products especially PMS will attract an immediate withdrawal of services by Nigerian workers all over the country without any further notice; and NEC resolved to write officially to the Federal Government of Nigeria conveying the plight of Nigerian workers, the concerns of Congress and the resolutions of the NEC on the matter of fresh proposals for an increase in the pump price of fuel especially as informed by the stance of the Nigeria Governors Forum.\u201d\n\nOn the ongoing review of 1999 constitution, NLC has called on the National Assembly to retain Labour administration, National Minimum Wage, Pension and Industrial Relations in the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\n\nAccording to the communiqu\u00e9 \u201cThe NEC reviewed the preparation of Congress for appearance and presentation of workers\u2019 demands at the Zonal Public Hearings on the Review of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The NEC re-echoed the resolve of Nigerian workers to steadfastly defend the retention of the core Labour issues of Labour administration, the National Minimum Wage, Pension and Industrial Relations in the Exclusive Legislative List of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe NEC also deliberated on how to robustly promote autonomy for local government, autonomy for the judiciary and autonomy for the state legislatures during its engagement at the Zonal hearings.\u201d\n\nThe NEC also stated that issues including those canvassed in the foregoing and others that promote good governance and inclusive national development and as already captured in a published Memorandum to be submitted by representatives of Congress at the Zonal Public Hearings would be strongly advocated for at the Zonal Public Hearings.\u201d\n\nIt directed the full mobilization of workers at all the Zonal Public Hearings to lend weight to the demands and aspirations of Nigerian workers in the ongoing review of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka was declared a prisoner of conscience, for being detained solely for his dissenting opinion.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1969 the annual report documented and expressed concern over suspension of human rights in the context of the civil war. \u201cNot much has changed about human rights in Nigeria since 1967 and the concerns remain flagrant disregard for human rights, failure of authorities to protect the people, threats to human rights including the right to freedom of expression, suppression of dissenting voices and lack of accountability.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cIncessant killings and the stunning failure of the authorities to end them and bring suspected perpetrators to justice have been and continues to be a threat to the right to life in Nigeria.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nA coalition of human rights organizations and Islamic bodies in Nigeria have called on the United Nations and United States of America to immediately halt the killings of Palestinians by Israel as well as its continued occupation of Gaza.\n\nThe organisations under the auspices of International Muslim Women Union led by Dr Khadijah Olaniyan during a press conference held recently in Ikeja, Lagos, also called for a total boycott of all Israeli products and its allies, just as it vowed to continue to sensitize the world on all social platforms on the war crimes committed by Israel and its allies.\n\nOlaniyan urged the United Nations to go beyond condemnations and take all the necessary steps to stop Israel from its continued illegal occupation and forced evictions of Palestinians from their homes.\n\n\u201cPalestine predates Israel but the latter is really out to wipe out Palestine. The powers that be have watched Israel maim, kill, and commit war crimes on innocent civilians in Palestine. In the just concluded Gaza onslaught, Israel killed over two hundred civilians, including sixty five (65) children, during the pogrom that lasted eleven (11) days before allies of Israel could make it call a unilateral ceasefire. Eleven days of horror and wanton waste of innocent lives and properties.\n\n\u201cWe condemn this in the strongest terms and call on the United Nations (UN) to stop Israel from future evictions, occupation of Palestinian homes and lands, and provocations which may lead to escalation of violence and the accompanying killings.\n\n\u201cWe align with the conditions of the ceasefire given by the Palestinians. Israel must desist from further occupations of East Jerusalem, illegal settlement building on Palestinian land, Al-Aqsa Mosque hostilities and continued siege and invasions of Gaza.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Muslims, Christians and even Jews had been living peacefully in Palestine until after the First World War when the allies won and they felt Palestine should become the exclusive preserve of the Jews scattered all over the world. They thereby gave a phantom, non-existent right of return to the Jews in 1948, while Palestinians expelled in 1948, almost a million of them, were not given equivalent rights of return since then. Palestine has known no peace ever since. Israeli settlers thus sent Arabs and others away from their houses and lands and became the \u2018owners\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe terrorist State of Israel has since expanded and taken over 80% of the Palestinian lands. Gaza is presently 45km by 12km, housing over 2 Million people, thus becoming the world\u2019s largest open air prison. With the full support of the western world and docility and disunity among the Arab states, their brethren live in appalling conditions while the apartheid Zionist state, Israel enjoys the stolen land and its resources.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, children who go to school are not sure to return to the same home still standing, or meeting their parents and siblings alive. On a near-daily basis since 1948, Palestinians have known no peace.\n\n\u201cOur concern is both religious and human. The Al-Aqsa Mosque is our 3rd holiest mosque as Muslims, coming after the Haramain in Makkah and Madinah. It was our first Qiblah. So, we are, as Muslims, actually bereaved with the onslaught.\n\n\u201cThese have gone on for too long. The United Nations (UN) Security Council allows Israel to have all weapons including lethal ones for use on our brethren in Palestine, but holds the victim back from having anything near such weapons. To make matters worse, Gaza remains under a stiff, debilitating blockade, coordinated by Israel and Egypt. When media says \u2018fight\u2019 or \u2018uprising\u2019 between Israel and Palestine, note that it is nothing but wanton killings and daylight robbery of ancestral properties by Israel.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the above, International Muslim Women Union (IMWU) in collaboration with all our sister organizations in Nigeria have no option than to call on all humans and especially our brethren the world over to among other penalties:-boycott the products of the friends and allies of Israel; create awareness in your locality and on social media on the war crimes Israel and its allies are perpetrating on the stolen Palestinian lands and people; continue to call on your government to be stern on Israel and review its policy on Israel; continue to call on the UN to facilitate giving Palestine a full member status; continue to call for the prosecution of Israel for war crimes and raise funds to rebuild infrastructure destroyed in Palestine and provide financial support for the basic human needs of Palestinians,\u201d Olaniyan stated\n\nWe will hold US govt responsible \u2014 MURIC\n\nProf Ishaq Lakin Akintola, Director, Muslim Rights Concern in Nigeria, MURIC, condemned the attacks on innocent civilians and called on the UN and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to hold the US responsible for the crimes against humanity, adding that the offensive in Gaza and the West Bank, which claimed the lives of 233 Palestinians, including children is nothing but injustice, ethnic cleansing and inhumanity of the highest order to the Palestinians.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to hold the US government responsible until it stops Israeli aggression because we know the answers to the Palestine-Israel crisis, lies squarely with America,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said: \u201cIsrael is the greatest apartheid country in existence today. The South Africans who segregated blacks from the rest of the community and who compared blacks to dogs have been vanquished.\n\n\u201cApartheid has fallen in South Africa. But we are surprised that around the same time that South Africa\u2019s apartheid fell, Israeli aggression, segregation, marginalization, discrimination against the Palestinians who own the land just started, with more vicious wickedness.\u201d\n\nHe noted that many Americans with \u201cgood conscience\u201d have demonstrated against the Israelis and the US government.\n\nHe also stated that the Palestine-Israel crisis is not a religious issue. \u201cIt isn\u2019t religion. This is clearly ethnic cleansing. There are Christians in Palestine, with 27% population, and yet, the world is keeping quiet against the right of this minority, as they, alongside Palestinian Muslim population were strangulated by Israel for 11 days,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",
          "summary": "\u201cPalestine predates Israel but the latter is really out to wipe out Palestine.\nThe powers that be have watched Israel maim, kill, and commit war crimes on innocent civilians in Palestine.\nIsrael must desist from further occupations of East Jerusalem, illegal settlement building on Palestinian land, Al-Aqsa Mosque hostilities and continued siege and invasions of Gaza.\n\u201cThe terrorist State of Israel has since expanded and taken over 80% of the Palestinian lands.\nWhen media says \u2018fight\u2019 or \u2018uprising\u2019 between Israel and Palestine, note that it is nothing but wanton killings and daylight robbery of ancestral properties by Israel.",

          "text": "The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has appealed to the protesting Ijaw youths to sheath their swords and allow peace to reign.\n\nRecall that the Ijaw Youths Council had on Thursday staged a nationwide protest, shutting down all the NDDC offices in the country in demand for a constitution of substantive NDDC board members.\n\nThe Minister, according to a press statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary Anietie Ekong and issued to our Correspondent in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital, on Friday, immediately met with the angry youths and appealed for calm.\n\nSenator Akpabio reminded them that the Niger Delta has been one of the most peaceful regions in the country therefore should not be allowed to be plunged into crisis even as he promised to address the issues that led to the protest\n\nHe also noted that a board for the NDDC would be constituted after the conclusion of the forensic audit ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said, \u201cactually the audit exercise was to be completed within six months, unfortunately that exercise was extended due to the national lockdown occasioned by the outbreak of CoronaVirus and logistical challenges.\n\n\u201cBut the forensic auditors have already submitted two interim reports to the President, by July the auditors are expected to submit the final report to pave the way for the inauguration of the board.\u201d\n\nHe therefore appealed to the youths to resist attempts by unscrupulous politicians and contractors to use them to cause a crisis in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, the leadership of IYC after a consultative meeting with Akpabio urged the youths to remain calm and maintain peace adding that they should not allow the genuine protest to be hijacked by people who never meant well for the region.\n\nThe National Spokesperson of IYC, Comrade Ebilade Ekerefe while addressing the press said: \u201cOur position is very clear: The protest was not intended to cause unnecessary havoc in the region.\n\n\u201cNobody wants a protest that will not take us anywhere. The essence of the protest is for discussions. And now we\u2019ve discussed with the Honourable Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\n\u201cImmediately after now, we will communicate back to our people that something is in the offing that will benefit everybody in the region and the youths will be carried along.",

          "title": "Tackling security challenge in Lagos State",
          "text": "By Ayo Oyoze Baje\n\nThis is the melting pot for our nation where anybody can come in with a lot of aspirations and do well. Lagos is a state that gives hope to a lot of Nigerians. So, we cannot afford anything to happen here. I can assure you with every sense of commitment that we will stop at nothing to make sure that Lagos remains safe and secure\u201d \u2013 Sanwo-Olu while speaking at the 3rd Session of the 34th Synod of the Diocese of Lagos, Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion.\n\nThe ever-escalating insecurity challenge in Nigeria has become a clear and present danger to all of us. Over the past two decades the rampaging monsters of Boko Haram terrorism, banditry, armed robbery, killings by armed herdsmen and kidnapping for ransom have spread their tentacles from the Northeast, across the Northwest through the North-central geo-political zone down to the southern states.\n\nEven as efforts are on (both genuine and self-serving) to clip the wings of the hovering hawk of insecurity, the gnawing fear of millions of Nigerians is for Lagos State to be spared its devastating blow. The reasons are obvious. Not only is it the commercial nerve-centre of the country, it has become the \u2018melting pot\u2019 for citizens and foreigners alike, wishing to actualize their dreams, as rightly noted by the determined and peace-loving Governor Sanwo-Olu.\n\nBut the bitter truth is that if the killing spree could affect the other states, the likelihood of it getting to the Centre of Excellence is there for real. And that has been the warning signal from the United States\u2019 intelligence forces.\n\nPerhaps, the reality of insecurity in the Southwest zone must have informed the establishment of Operation Amotekun on January 9, 2020 in Ibadan, Oyo State. According to Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State: \u201cWe are not here to undermine the power of the Federal Government of Nigeria, but our primary interest is the security and safety of our people.\u201d On his part the former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu compared Operation Amotekun to the \u201cNeighbourhood Watch\u201d program which his administration instituted to pass credible information along to the police.\n\nFrom whatever perspective one looks at it therefore, securing the good people of Lagos from the furious fangs of the anarchists will definitely take grits, guts and a firm grip on the socio-economic and political spectrum of the state. For a leader worth his salt to frontally battle insecurity would also take effective communication and collaboration with the stakeholders, to quickly identify the thorns on the paths to lasting peace and nip them right in the bud.\n\nBeyond all these factors is the significance of transparency on the part of the security forces. In specific terms, the top police brass and military helmsmen must be ready to fully account for every kobo earmarked for recruiting, training security personnel and buying arms and ammunition. They should deploy such as at when due and resist the temptation to feather one\u2019s nest at the expense of communal peace.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is in the light of this that one would commend the Sanwo-Olu-led administration for rolling out extensive policies to tackle impending security challenges in line with the six-pillars of THEMES developmental agenda for \u2018Greater Lagos\u2019. Good enough, part of the efforts is the provision of far-reaching support, in terms of vehicles and logistics to all security operatives to keep the state safe.\n\nOn some of the proactive measures taken by his administration to curb insecurity in the state, Sanwo-olu has banned the ubiquitous motorcycles (Okadas) and tricycles. Several road accidents, thefts, driving against the approved traffic lanes and excruciating traffic gridlock have been traced to them. As for the long stretch of trailers and other articulated vehicles parked on the Oshodi-Apapa express-way, efforts are on in conjunction with the Ministry of Transportation to keep them off the express-way.\n\nIn the place of the banned bicycles and tricycles government has launched 500 safe, secure units of First and Last Mile (FLM) buses. They are assembled locally, as mini-passenger buses (between seven- and 11-seater), which will operate on 286 community routes. They will take passengers from the closest points to their areas of residence to standard transportation corridors. Payment for FLM services will be through an automated payment system, using Cowry Travel Cards. The fleet would be gradually increased to 5,000 buses in the coming months.\n\nSanwo-Olu in his statement said: \u201cTalking about security, we can say Lagos is relatively better but I sit on it and I know what we are doing and the things we need to do. We know we have issues to deal with as a country and Lagos will certainly be leading that conversation because we know how critical this state is to the nation\u201d.\n\nIn spite of all these salutary efforts, it is important to note that to strike at the heart of the bull of insecurity cannot be left to the government alone. That explains the rationale behind the call by the First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Saanwo-Olu that residents should become more aware of the goings on in their environment and report suspicious movements.\n\nThe deployment of CCT cameras, street lights and drones all over Lagos State will do it a world of good. These will assist to curb the menace of street urchins, some of who are able-bodied young men that have turned themselves into miscreants, beggars and cultists taking undue pleasure in frequent clashes.\n\nBeing a state that boasts of the Atlantic Ocean coastline and lagoons, it needs effective collaboration with the Nigerian Navy, NIMASA and the NPA to maintain safety, away from pirates. Its efforts to reinforce transportation by boats and ferries should be sustained, to ease the traffic gridlock inland.\n\nAs recently highlighted by the United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken the battle against insecurity in Nigeria would involve building \u201c its capacity through training, through resources, through information sharing, through equipment, and all of that done, very importantly, with full respect for human rights.\u201d Well said!\n\nAnd with regards to involving the people, it has become imperative for the government to hold more meetings with the local government chairmen, councillors, leaders of youth groups and traditional rulers of different ethnic groups resident in Lagos State. They should be made to understand that true safety means being protected from the event or from exposure to something that causes health or economic losses. It can include protection of people and their possessions.\n\nThrough them sustained media outreach on television and radio expressed in their local languages should be engaging. Such should shed light on government\u2019s efforts, as well as the critical roles they have to play to engender inter-communal peace and unity.\n\nIn fact, this brings to mind the admonition of Kenneth Trump, a security expert who insists that true safety and security is more than just a camera on a building. It is about securing our networks, preventing disasters, responding to threats and communicating across channels, sectors, and boundaries. And it is about planning and collaborating. Network security and physical security are converging.

This is the time to thoroughly deal with the matter and ensure that the agitations and anxieties being expressed are addressed.\n\n\u201cAs Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, to say that we have since set up committees on restructuring, role of traditional rulers, engagement with the youths and even economic reforms of the region. The reports of these committees will also be submitted to the Constitutional Review Committee for consideration.\n\n\u201cWe have to conduct the discussion on the review of the 1999 constitution within the context of the unity, stability, peace and progress of the country. We should have an open mind to every submission, we should also not be ignorant of the desire by some internal or external forces to destabilise our nation by pushing their interests, under the guise of promoting constitutional review.\n\n\u201cWe have to realise that there is no constitution that will ever resolve all our challenges as a people who are diverse in ethnic, religious, political and tribal affiliations.\u201d\n\nLalong said issues of state police should be given top priority in view of the insecurity in the country, adding that his administration has gone far with the implementation of autonomy for the Judiciary, Legislature, and the Local Governments, even before the commencement of the strike by judiciary and legislative workers.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of women from Plateau, Nasarawa and Benue States, under the umbrella of Women Political Participation Technical Working Group (WPP-TWG), have advocated for the creation of 37 more Senatorial seats in the country, that would be exclusively be occupied by women.\n\nThe group, which submitted a memorandum to the Senate Committee for the review of the 1999 constitution at the North Central public hearing in Jos, supported the proposed amendment of the constitution and called for a special consideration for women in governance.\n\nSpokesperson of the group, Mrs Jiritmwa Morgak Goyit, who addressed journalists in Jos, after the submission, yesterday, said Nigerian women should also be honoured with the 35 percent affirmative action.\n\nShe appealed that the Constitution should kick against same sex running for a position that has deputy so that a man should either be Chairman and a woman serve as Deputy or vice versa, to promote gender equality.\n\nShe believed that the temporary but necessary positive measures would enhance inclusive governance that women earnestly yearn for.\n\nMeanwhile, the leadership of Ohaneze Ndigbo worldwide, led by its President General, Ambassador Professor George A. Obiozor, yesterday, renewed the demands for restructuring, devolution of power and true federalism as panacea for the crisis bedevilling the nation.\n\nHe made the submission in Owerri at the Abia/Imo public hearing for the amendment of the 1999 constitution chaired by the former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu.\n\nHe said: \u201cFundamentally, what Ndigbo really want is some form of internal autonomy, based on a Restructured Nigeria,\n\n\u201cWe (Ndigbo) are of the view that the federation of Nigeria must be a union of equals and the composite units must have the ability to stand without begging the centre for survival.\n\n\u201cThat is a federal system of government with its characteristics of decentralisation and devolution of power among the federating units.\n\n\u201cIn the context of the imperatives and urgency of restructuring Nigeria, we should focus on getting the right things done for the right reasons, and at the right levels of government.\n\n\u201cIndeed, what must be done and no longer what to do, is to recognise that history has an iron law of seriality of which no country, including Nigeria, can ask for exemption or exceptionalism.\n\n\u201cAll signs of national tragedies foretold are present, today, in full force in Nigeria. In fact, it would require a restructured Nigeria to contain the present forces and tendencies towards a synchronised national crisis and even a possibility of national disintegration.\n\nUrging leaders in the country to confront the nation\u2019s realities and challenges, Obiozor said the nation\u2019s political crisis stemed from injustice, inequity and lack of fairness.\n\nHe said: \u201cTherefore, as national leaders, we must learn the lessons of history that in societies here, truth comes last, tragedy comes first. And that the perennial problem or continuous dilemma in Nigerian politics always evolve around the issues of justice, equity and fairness. As has been said several times, throughout history, those denied justice have had no interest in peace.\n\n\u201cWe would expect you at the end of this exercise, and in the interest of the nation, its unity and progress, to conclude with decisions guided by love and not by hatred; and guided by our collective hope and not by our fears.\n\nIn his concluding remark the Southest Zonal Chairman of the public hearing, Senator Orji Kalu, reiterated the commitment of the Senate to address the submissions made by various groups at the two-day exercise. He appealed for calm among from various agitating groups, saying that the National Assembly would expedite action on their demands for befitting amended constitution.\n\n\u2022 How Nigeria can enact new Constitution- Ekweremadu\n\nFormer Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, said while a new constitution is possible and would become ultimately inevitable, the nation needs to amend the 1999 Constitution to create a provision for achieving that.\n\nEkweremadu, while fielding questions from reporters in Enugu on the sidelines of the ongoing zonal hearing on constitution review exercise of the 9th National Assembly said:\n\n\u201cI have heard the suggestions for a new constitution over and over again. Some say, bring back the 1960 Constitution; some say bring back the 1963 Constitution. Some others say, okay, why don\u2019t we just throw away this constitution and bring a new one.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is no such provision to do so under our present Constitution, unless you are calling for anarchy. If you say we need a new constitution, the answer is simple. When other countries like Kenya and Brazil had a similar challenge, what they simply did was to amend the original constitution, in order to make a provision for how a new constitution can be enacted. We (the National Assembly) did it the last time, specifically in the 7th Assembly, including making a provision for a referendum, but it was not accepted.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to amend Section 9 on how we can create a new Constitution, including the issue of referendum, to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, who chairs the Enugu centre of the South East zonal hearing, also explained that creating an avenue for a new constitution would also help make the constitution more organised.\n\n\u201cWe have done a whole of amendments, which many Nigerians don\u2019t even know about. So, there is confusion already in differentiating what has been amended and what has not been amend. And it will only increase as we make more amendments. Even with ordinary Acts of the National Assembly, after several amendments or a far-reaching amendment, the usual and proper thing we do is to repeal and reenact the law.\n\n\u201cWhether we are doing a new constitution today, tomorrow or next year, we need to take advantage of this constitution amendment exercise to provide for and spell out how a new constitution can come into being.\n\nThat way, at the appropriate time, we can now trigger that provision and be able to have a conversation, draft a new constitution, and go through the constitutional provision and have it approved at the requisite levels and with the requisite numbers, so that we can have a new constitution that will encompass all these amendments.\u201d\n\nOn the calls for a national dialogue by ethnic nationalities, he said: \u201cOnce any nation runs into a problem like we do now, the usual thing to do is to say, okay, let us come together and talk. But in our case, there is nothing really new, say in this constitution amendment exercise from the past ones.\n\n\u201cLikewise, if you bring together all the ethnic nationalities, they are not going to say anything new. We have had conversions. We have had the national confab.\n\n\u201cJust as someone suggested, why don\u2019t we just dust up all of the constitution amendments we have done before or simply improve on them and get the reasonable and required number to approve it and send it to the president? That is my opinion too.\n\n\u201cIn the same manner, if we say let us look at those issues and resolutions we have had in the past confabs, nothing is new, and nothing has changed. But if we look at the recommendations and set up a committee to look at it in one week, we can now find a way to legislate on it.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to talk, we have to agree on how do we operationalise what we discussed. That is the issue. Unless we address this, it will be like every other talks or confabs.\u201d\n\nOn the position of the constitution on grazing, Ekweremadu said: \u201cThe laws are straightforward and it was better for the states and federal officials to meet on the matter to resolve the impasse.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Constitution, the issue of grazing, essentially, should be a matter for the states because it has to do with land. Under the Land Use Act, which is part of our Constitution, the lands belong to the States and not to the Federal Government. So, when the states met and said, look, we don\u2019t want open grazing, it was within the purview of their powers.\n\n\u201cI think we need to have a meeting between the state officials and federal officials at some point, instead of talking as if they don\u2019t read anything in the constitution. We can\u2019t be insulting ourselves on the pages of newspapers.\u201d\n\n\u2022Falana makes case for secessionists, change of name for police\n\nRights activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Femi Falana, yesterday, made case for secession agitators across the country before the Senate zonal public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution in Lagos.\n\nFalana, while giving insight on the memoranda he submitted before the committee, insisted that it was important to give secession agitators the confidence of peace and inclusion, if they must remain as Nigerians.\n\nThe lawyer also advocated that the Child Rights Act enacted in 2003, and the Disability Act, be domesticated and implemented in states if the constitution review must make meaning to the common man.\n\nFalana also proposed a change of name from the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to the Nigerian Police Service (NPS). To him, there must be sanctions for impunity.\n\n\u201cOur country is ruled by rule of the rulers and not rule of law. People commit all manner of crime and get away with it because there are no sanctions. This must change. The Social Security Bill must also work, so that jobless people can get stipends pending when they will get full employment.\n\n\u201cWhat can we do very quickly to save this country which is on the verge of collapse? If you don\u2019t want people to break away from Nigeria, we must give them confidence, don\u2019t declare a war.\n\n\u201cTherefore, for the constitutional amendment to be fruitful, for us to have genuine outputs from this meeting, peace must reign. We must address Nigeria\u2019s problem frontally.\u201d",

It was paid to Delta state,\u201d Idris said while appearing before the senate committee investigating the status of recovered loot.\n\n\u201cAny recovery arising from looted funds from a particular state goes to the state. State governors will not even allow it to fly. They will take the federal government to court. We pay them their money.\u201d\n\nBut the accountant-general recanted his claim after Lauretta Onochie, media aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, said the funds cannot be returned to the state because it would be breaching the terms and conditions on which the repatriation was done.\n\n\u201cFor now, no money has been returned to Delta state. This is the true position as regards the \u00a34.2m Ibori loot. The issue of the \u00a34.2m Ibori loot has not been properly resolved,\u201d Idris said in a statement signed by Henshaw Ogubike, his spokesperson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLEGAL IMPLICATION OF MAKING FALSE CLAIM UNDER OATH\n\nIt is customary to administer oath on witnesses who come before the legislative house to give information, and TheCable can confirm that Idris was examined under oath.\n\nSection 7 of the Legislative Houses (Powers and Privileges) Act stipulates that: \u201cA committee of a legislative house, if authorised by standing orders or resolution of that House to send for persons, papers and records, may require that any facts, matters and things relating to the subject of inquiry before such committee be verified or ascertained by the oral examination of witnesses, and may cause any such witnesses to be examined on oath, which the chairman of the committee or the Clerk thereof is hereby authorised to administer.\u201d\n\nSection 10 provides the consequences of giving false evidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAny person who before a committee of a legislative house knowingly gives a false answer to any question material to the subject of the inquiry of the committee which may be put to him during the course of his examination shall- (a) if the answer was given on oath, be deemed to be guilty of an offence against section 117 of the Criminal Code and shall be liable on conviction to the punishment therefore prescribed by that Code\u2026\u201d\n\nAccording to section 117 of the Criminal Code, the accountant-general may be guilty of perjury.\n\nThe section reads: \u201cAny person who, in any judicial proceeding, or for the purpose of instituting any judicial proceeding, knowingly gives false testimony touching any matter which is material to any question then depending in that proceeding, or intended to be raised in that proceeding, is guilty of an offence, which is called perjury.\u201d\n\nSection 118 of the Criminal Code states that: \u201cAny person who commits perjury is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years. If the offender commits the offence in order to procure the conviction of another person for an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for life, he is liable to imprisonment for life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut given that he has recanted his previous claim, will the accountant-general be spared of facing the consequence of making a false claim under oath?",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "title": "GovTech In Nigeria: From Regulatory Maze to Models of Good Practice",
          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "text": "OPay is reportedly in talks to raise $400 million from investors at a valuation of $1.5 billion, according to an exclusive report from The Information.\n\nOPay is looking to raise funding to finance its expansion plan, having launched in Egypt this year. The payments giant says it processed $1.4 billion in payments in October 2020 alone, and that number also reportedly increased to $2 billion by December 2020.\n\nHaving done impressively in Nigeria since its launch in 2018, the new push for funding means that the company has bigger plans.\n\nAn Africa-focused company with Chinese backers\n\nWhile OPay is based in Nigeria, its backers are mostly Chinese companies like Meituan, a multi-billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform.\n\nIn July 2019, OPay raised $50 million from Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital, Source Code, GSR Ventures and Meituan-Dianping. Opera itself also invested in the round. Four months later, it raised a massive $120 million in a Series B round.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial play seemed to be focused on building a super-app, and it led with its popular bike-hailing service, ORide. But the ban on bike hailing in Nigeria stopped that, and the company focused on what had always been at its core: payments.\n\nThe pandemic is one factor that spurred growth for OPay, and as social distancing and Covid-19 regulations made banking halls challenging to access, more people are leaning on mobile money services. The company also has plans to roll out debit and credit cards.\n\nCompetition in the mobile payments space is stiff; while at one time OPay seemed to be the only company growing its agent network, other rivals have now tapped into the same network. Telcos like MTN and Airtel are spinning their mobile money arm into standalone businesses as they are betting on it for the future.\n\nIt means that at home, where OPay may claim dominance, challengers are arising, and outside Nigeria, grabbing market share from more established players will be no easy feat. Yet, should they successfully raise $400 million, it will be the kind of war chest that makes anything possible.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "text": "OctaFX brought two popular bloggers together in a cooking studio: the comedian Apaokagi Maryam and the music video director Abdulazeez Greene. They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively. The company is well-known for its social and charity activities.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations? Read\n\nWhat you need to know, as Kenya moves to outlaw pornography.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re following\n\nDubai is a paradise for \u201cdigital nomads\u201d \u2014 and hell for low-wage gig workers.

This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations?

          "title": "Green Africa disrupts airline business with cheap airfares",
          "text": "With insecurity driving more people to travel by air and the incessant surge in airfares as a result of depleting fleet and high foreign exchange, Green Africa, a new entrant in the Nigerian aviation sector, may cause disruption in airline business as it commences sales of tickets with airfares as low as N16,500.\n\nFrom N28,000 for one hour flight after the high season in December 2020, the average cost of one hour ticket has now risen to N60,000 for one-way ticket and rising still as high as N80,000 for passengers who buy a ticket on the day they are travelling.\n\nAirlines have continued to increase the price of tickets because they source foreign exchange from the parallel market at N500 per dollar.\n\nThis is also as operators point out that many aircraft that were taken out of the country overseas were yet to be brought back because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has hindered activities in most countries, so the Nigerian carriers have limited fleet but high demand for air travel, as insecurity continues to discourage many people from travelling by road.\n\nWith the 70 percent slash in airfares offered by Green Africa, stakeholders are concerned if these fares would be sustainable and if passengers would be willing to fly propeller aircraft instead of jet aircraft, considering how uncomfortable these aircraft can be.\n\n\u201cActually, if I ran an airline in Nigeria, I would do exactly what Green Africa appears to be trying to do \u2013 target the mid-to-lower end of the market with cheap tickets by using propeller aircraft instead of jet aircraft.\n\n\u201cUp to 40 percent less fuel consumption so cheaper tickets. The trade-off is longer flight times and more in-flight turbulence since turboprops have lower cruising altitude (and turboprops are also noisier than jets). But in Nigeria, the deciding factor is always price,\u201d David Hundeyin, a renowned writer, journalist and researcher stated via his twitter handle @DavidHundeyin.\n\nRead Also: Green Africa commences flight tickets sales with fares as low as N16,500\n\nHe acknowledged that turboprops are less comfortable and take longer time than jets, adding that some aircraft type like the ATR72, which Green Africa uses are known to have tail rudder issues in severe icing conditions, but in our equatorial climate, that is unlikely to be a factor.\n\nHundeyin, who expressed his optimism in Green Africa\u2019s business model, added, \u201cLet people fly for N20,000 and you\u2019re printing money.\u201d\n\nWith Green Africa\u2019s commencement of ticket sales, some airlines are already slashing fares.\n\nFor instance, airfares from Lagos to Abuja has dropped from N60,000 in April to between N25,000 and N35,000 now.\n\nAirPeace slashed the airfare from Lagos to Ilorin from N52,500, some airlines charged last month, to N32,700.\n\nSeyi Adewale, CEO, Mainstream Cargo Limited, told BusinessDay that N16,500 airfares was just a promotional fare by Green Africa to appeal to passengers not used to flying a propeller aircraft and who were yet to experience the airline for the first time.\n\n\u201cIf Green Africa does not get people to experience their flights, they won\u2019t be able to penetrate the market. People would be willing to fly the turboprops, as long as it is cheaper,\u201d Adawale said.\n\nHe assured that after two weeks of offering promotional prices, Green Africa would begin to adjust prices to fit into current operational and economic realities.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay show that the seat capacity for an ATR 72-600 aircraft that would be operated by Green Africa would take between 70 and 78 passengers, depending on the seat configuration.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and secretary general of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), told BusinessDay that the load factors of the small aircraft were lower, so they may not break even if they charge the same rates with airlines having bigger aircraft.\n\nIt cost airlines between $500,000 and $1 million to carry out mandatory C-checks on their aircraft every 18 months.\n\nChecks show that it cost not less than N2 million to operate a one-way flight using a Boeing 737 aircraft. Aviation fuel cost about N220 per litre and operators would need not less than 8,000ltr (N1.7m) to operate a one way Lagos- Abuja flight. In addition, operators need to pay for landing and parking fees, ground handling fees, en-route air navigation services, catering, among others.\n\nAviation analysts say when airlines charge passengers less than N40,000 for a one-way flight, they are operating at a loss or relying on government intervention funds, palliatives or concession on recurring debts.\n\nHowever, Tolu Odutola, a pilot and aviation expert, argued that Green Africa operates ATR 72-600, which are generally cheaper to maintain than the 737s, CRJs and other aircraft operated by local airlines.\n\nOperations cost is generally cheaper and that is probably why ticket costs are commiserate, Odutola said, but noted that N16,500 fare may also just be an introductory rate to break into the market.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a bid to transform the operations of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) has recommended the full privatisation of the country\u2019s electricity transmission network.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday, the BPE Director-General, Alex Okoh, said the agency will \u201cshare its proposal very shortly with the National Council on Privatisation that the state-owned corporation be unbundled and then privatized\u201d.\n\nThe Transmission Company of Nigeria, which coordinates the nation\u2019s electricity transmission network, is one of 18 companies that were unbundled from the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) in April 2004. It was incorporated in November 2005 and issued a transmission license a year later.\n\nTCN\u2019s licensed activities include: electricity transmission, system operation and electricity trading.\n\nWhile TCN is presently fully owned and operated by the government, the BPE said there was a need to privatise it by selling off the transmission network assets to interested investors, to improve its reliability and expand its capacity.\n\nProposed sale of power plants\n\nEarlier this month, the BPE called for bids from private investors to acquire five power plants with a combined capacity of almost 3,000 megawatts that the government still owns through the Niger Delta Power Holding Co, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe NDPHC built 10 gas-fired facilities from the mid-2000s as an emergency intervention with the intention of eventually selling them.\n\nWhile the BPE is proposing the sale of five of the power plants, the remaining five will still be state-owned and managed, according to Mr Okoh, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cThe objective ultimately is for the government to exit the power sector and just let the private sector drive the sector,\u201d he said.\n\nThe privatisation agency terminated all incomplete processes it had initiated in 2014 for all 10 facilities before introducing a new privatisation process.\n\nThe proposed sale of the transmission assets will be the biggest reform Nigeria\u2019s power system would witness since 2013 when the government unbundled the power company\u2019s generation and distribution infrastructure.",

          "title": "Any PDP tour of Osun without resolution chairmanship tussle a waste of time \u2013 Adagunodo",
          "text": "The embattled chairman of Osun State Chapter of People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) Hon. Soji Adagunodo recently met with some selected journalist where he bare his mind on some sundry issues. SUNDAY OGUNTUYI was there.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nIt\u2019s been two months since an Appeal Court sitting in Akure decided that you are no longer the Chairman of the Osun State Chapter of PDP\u2026?\n\nNo! no!! no!!! The Appeal Court never ruled that I am no longer the Chairman. Go and read the judgment very well. It did not say that. There was a prayer by the appellants to the court that the November 3, 2020 High Court Ikirun Division Interim/Interlocutory Order be vacated which was granted. Meanwhile my Chairmanship position that hinges on November a 9, 2020 Preservative Order was not appealed against, which means it still subsists. The Court of Appeal ruled that the substantive case be determined at the lower court.\n\nMind you, there is nowhere in the judgment where Sunday Bisi was pronounced Chairman of the Osun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. Go and get a copy of the judgment and read it very well. I\u2019m waiting for the resumption of the courts to straighten this out.\n\nOkay, what are your prayers before the court?\n\nMy prayer is that my removal is illegal, null and void, based on the 2017 Constitution of our party as amended, which incidentally was signed into law by both the National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus and the National Secretary of the Party, Senator Umar Ibrahim Tsauri. Section 2 of our Party Constitution is very clear on its supremacy, so I am praying the Court to reaffirm me as the rightful chairman, with all privileges to function and serve out my tenure, without hindrance.\n\nIncreasingly, party members are articulating that you should settle out of court. How are you going to pursue the next phase of the court case against PDP on your removal?\n\nOn the two occasions that the High Court, Ikirun Division gave an Interim order on the 3rd and 9th of November last year, I called for political solution, but those that do not have the interest of the party at heart did not allow those, who are supposedly, concerned to listen. What I believe is that there are certain elements that are feeding party members with fabricated lies, to actualize their illegal position, but by God\u2019s grace the case will reopen when the courts resume sitting. I will exploit and execute every known legal means available to clear my name and pursue same to a logical conclusion.\n\nWhat is your assessment of the party crisis and what is the way forward since some observers of the happenings in the party believe that the solution lies with your reinstatement?\n\nFor peace to reign in any society, which our party belongs, there must be justice. My removal from office illegal, it is injustice of the highest order and quite unexpected from a party I hold so dear. Suffice it to say, that political parties aggregate the destiny of citizens in trust and, therefore, should be seen to obey its own laws and constitution. That is what gives the populace the confidence to cast their votes, in trust for the party to take charge of their affairs and destiny as a people and without fear of being manipulated as being presently experienced by APC, especially at the Federal level.\n\nAre you aware of a proposed tour of the state by the Sunday Bisi led Working Committee beginning from June 1, 2021? If yes, what does this mean to you?\n\nI am aware that a group of people in the party, otherwise known as the Ademola Adeleke group, codenamed The Pathfinder Team, proposed that and also made a release about the tour which clearly indicates that it is not a party programme but a group\u2019s programme. That\u2019s what our party has been turned into.\n\nIt is not an official programme of the Osun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. Interest groups within a political party are allowed to consult but this should not be misconstrued as an official programme of Osun PDP. No, it is not. It is a group of supporters that want to do that for their preferred aspirant. There is a difference between OSUN PDP AND PATHFINDER TEAM. Many of such will still take place.\n\nAs for the party, when it is ready to move and consult with members of the party and the good people of Osun State, you will see the who-is-who that will be involved. There\u2019s no way the party will consult round the state, whether with members and or the public, without me as the party chairman being involved.\n\nOur party will never embark on state wide consultations without our revered leaders like Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola; Alhaji Shuaib Oyedokun; Dr. Olu Alabi; High Chief Dele Faseru; HE, Erelu Obada, CON; Senator Akinlabi Olasunkanmi; Chief Segun Odekunmi; Our National Ex-Officio, Hon. Paul Olakunle; Chief Olaoye Oyelayo; Alhaji Sule Oyedeji; Aremo Kunle Alao; Engr. Jide Adeniji; Barrister Kayode Oduoye; Dr. Oluomo Daisi Aina; Senator Francis Adenigba Fadahunsi, CON; Hon. Busayo Oluwole Oke; Hon. Taofeek Abimbola Ajilesiro; the Southwest Zonal Officers; Members of the State House of Osun State House of Assembly who are members of the party and many other leaders across the state that are too numerous to mention. So any arrangement or movement that does not have the inclusion of these people, to me, is a mere jamboree that we should discountenance\n\nIn addition, even in the so called Adeleke Group, the few that are planning the movement are in their minority. Others in the same group are still eagerly waiting for the court pronouncement on our case because they don\u2019t want to be caught in the web. More importantly, there is no serious minded group that will be planning a tour on behalf of an aspirant without the aspirant being physically present to meet the people. Are they going to be consulting for him by proxy?\n\nWill you consider your removal as the genesis of the Osun PDP crisis?\n\nSee, our endless journey in the wonderland of political quandary and party leadership quagmire is due to one reason: TRUTH. The same truth we all love to hate. My removal was premeditated and hatched by some Fifth Columnists within our party, who fed Dr Deji Adeleke with many lies about me. I have, on several occasions, explained to him through personal contacts and letters to clear myself of the many falsehoods and allegations they raised against me. You see, isn\u2019t it funny that I was accused of anti-party activities when, as a matter of fact, I delivered my unit, ward, state and federal constituencies in all elections? I also delivered my senatorial and Governorship votes during elections just as I did in respect of the Presidential Election for the Party\u2019s candidate. Now tell me how they want to justify my loyalty to the party and her candidates in those elections? I did everything humanly possible for the success of the Party even to the extent of putting my life on the line .Those feeding fat from the crisis are the ones who want to subjugate the supremacy of the party and our collective will, with intent to disallow free, fair and credible internal democratic processes under me, to elect the party flag bearer for Osun 2022. They prefer to select, rather than elect, a candidate so that they too can enjoy the same selection because many of them have ambition and they know they can never emerge as candidates of the party in their various domains and constituencies. Funny enough they all lost in all past and previous elections except for a few of them.\n\nWho are those few?\n\nThe few ones know themselves and those who lost, who have been serial losers, also know themselves. They are many that do not have records of electoral success or victory for themselves or for the party from time immemorial. They are now the ones in charge that want to control the party machinery at all cost, for the sake of their selfish interest , pecuniary gains and personal political ambition.\n\nBarring all obstacles, if you\u2019re back in office fully today, what will you do as the Party Chairman to chart a new course for the party?\n\nI\u2019ll renew and increase my efforts that was deployed in 2017 and which gave us the needed maximum victory in 9 out of 10 local government areas during the Osun West Senatorial bye-election. In 2018 same efforts gave us another victory at first ballot despite the fact that manipulators crept in and destroyed the lofty relationship between the party leadership and the family of our candidate. I will also ensure that we evolve new strategies to bring in more disenfranchised members. Some have distanced themselves from the party due to the lingering crises. I will bring them back in order to strengthen the party. As it is today, the advantage of the impeding implosion in APC will be fully utilized to bring PDP back to governance in Osun State in 2022.\n\nIt is everywhere that Dr Deji Adeleke solely sponsored the Congress leading to your emergence as Chairman. How true is that?\n\nNo, It\u2019s a lie. The Adelekes participated in only 1 out of the 4 congresses that we had. I appreciate Dr Deji Adeleke\u2019s contributions. Anything, or every money, he spent was after the Party had successfully installed his brother, Senator Ademola Adeleke, as Senator. They were the first, and the highest, beneficiary of our struggle. Please, don\u2019t forget that we had two formidable, qualified and acceptable Senatorial candidates, Senator Akinlabi Olasunkanmi and Col. Olayiwola Falabi, before the leadership of the Party directed them to withdraw for Senator Ademola Adeleke.\n\nOn the Governorship primaries, Osun PDP had many aspirants before the Adelekes joined our Party, only Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi and Adeleke came into the Party later and almost at the same time. There were aspirants before them, like Rt. Hon. Rafiu Adejare Bello (now in APC); Akogun Lere Oyewumi; Dr Kayode Oduoye; Senator Kola Ogunwale; Dr Ayoade Adewopo; Senator Olasunkanmi Akinlabi; Oluomo Gbenga Owolabi; Barrister N.O.O. Oke (SAN); Alhaji Fatai Akinbade and others. All these gentlemen stood with the Party. They all did everything possible to reshape and reposition the party. And they did not cry about their lofty efforts like what we are witnessing from the greatest beneficiary of our struggle when they lost the bid to emerge as the Party\u2019s candidate.\n\nFor record purposes Hon Oluwole Oke; Baba Shuaib Oyedokun; the National Secretary of our party at that time, Prof. Wale Oladipo; Sen (Dr) Olu Alabi; Erelu Olusola Obada CON; at a later date Senator Francis Fadahunsi, CON; and Rt. Hon. Albert Adeogun with the aforementioned foremost aspirants and Dr Akin Ogunbiyi also contributed immensely to the struggle, not to mention my personal involvements and contributions.\n\nOne of the allegations against you is that you were involved in anti-party activities?\n\nIt\u2019s laughable and insulting. I am a founding member of the party. I can never be involved in anti-party activities against the PDP. The party is in my blood. No matter what happens, I see PDP as my investment. I won my Unit with over 300 votes , my ward with over 1000 votes, an uncommon occurrence in the state. I won my Ward, Local Government, Federal Constituency and Senatorial district, Governorship and presidential elections as I said earlier. So where does the issue of anti-party activity come in?\n\nDuring the 2018 Governorship election, I was in my ward when I received security information that APC was trying to rig the election in Ward 4 and Ward 5 in Osogbo local government and no single leader was responding to their distress calls from Osogbo. Immediately I got that message, I left my unit in Obokun Local Government and joined our people in Osogbo to prevent the rigging and it was God that saved my life. I was attacked by APC two times that night during that election. I almost lost my life. All active members in Osogbo local government reading this interview will bear me witness. Is it possible for APC to attack someone that was working for them? I didn\u2019t engage in anti-party activities and I can never be. I will never do that against my beloved PDP as long as I remain a member.\n\nCan you confirm to us when the next Ward and Local government congresses of your party will be taking place? We heard it\u2019s October this year.\n\nThat cannot be correct. It is a misinformation. The congresses will come up anytime from March next year according to the term and years of office. If you remember, the resolution reached by the present National Working Committee of our party under Prince Uche Secondus in Abuja sometimes around February 2018 was that we should go and conduct a fresh congress from Ward to State when the attempt to install Dr. Bayo Faforiji by the Omisore group failed. They had complained that the existing Partial Ward congress conducted in October 2017 favoured me and that it was going to be an easy win for me. Despite that, we went to Ejigbo High Court and there was a judgment that was delivered on March 22. We got clearance from Abuja to go ahead with the congress in compliance with the court judgment. The fourth and last congresses that ushered us in took place on March 23, 24 and 25, 2018. Therefore, the four year tenure will lapse on those dates in 2022.\n\nAs at today, how many gubernatorial aspirants have declared their intention to contest the gubernatorial ticket of the party?\n\nThe fortune of the party depends on the ongoing leadership tussle in the court of law, Osun PDP is blessed with personalities who are well equipped in providing lasting solutions to the plight of the people. We have a few who have expressed their wish to run, but no candidate can emerge without a valid Party leadership and primaries. You can\u2019t build something on nothing. I know immediately the leadership crises is over we will have qualified and competent aspirants from our party that will become our candidate.\n\nOn a final note, what are your party\u2019s chances in 2022?\n\nThe chances of any political party to win elections depend on its stability, capacity and capability to handle internal criss that are always inevitable. Any political party that cannot handle its own internal crisis as a family affair is heading for destruction.\n\nAs it is today, I pray that our leaders at both state and national levels will quickly rise to the occasion to resolve all internal crisis within the party. To be specific, the victory or success of Osun State Chapter of PDP in 2022 is very central to the party winning the national elections in 2023, hence the need to resolve the crises in Osun state chapter as soon as possible, so that we can win 2022 Gubernatorial Election which will definitely have multiplier effects on other national elections that will follow, including the Presidential election.",

          "text": "Governor of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank, Mr. Godwin Emefiele has said the country needs N35 trillion worth of investment in infrastructure to achieve double-digit economic growth.\n\nThe Central Bank governor who stated this on Thursday at a webinar tagged \u201cFinancing Public-Private Partnership to Boost Infrastructure Delivery in Nigeria,\u201d organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), noted however, that it will be difficult to support these investments using government funds alone, so partnerships are needed.\n\nThe CBN governor, represented by Kingsley Obiora, deputy governor in charge of economic policy, declared that with the paucity of government revenues, it will be difficult to support such investments using government funds alone.\n\nIn February, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the establishment of a N1 trillion infrastructure company (Infra-Co) to focus on critical infrastructural investments.\n\nThe initial seed capital for the entity will come from the CBN, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, and the Africa Finance Corporation.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, \u201cIf we take into account Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Masterplan, we require close to N35 trillion worth of investment to attain double-digit growth. But given the paucity of government revenue, which the BPE director-general mentioned earlier, it will be difficult to support these investments using government funds alone, so we need partnerships,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, finding ways to harness public-private partnerships have become very important, and we are happy to acknowledge that these partnerships have started in earnest and the Central Bank of Nigeria looks forward to continuing collaboration with the BPE to harness these partnerships to ensure that we significantly scale up investment in our infrastructure.\u201d\n\nEmefiele noted that various interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities led to Nigeria exiting recession with muted growth.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nigeria\u2019s economy recorded a 0.51 percent growth, from 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile this news is positive, growth is still well below our population growth of 2.7 per cent. It is therefore imperative that we all work together to harness the growth potential of the Nigerian economy.\u201d\n\nIn her keynote address, Zainab Ahmed, the minister of finance, budget and national planning, said federal allocations show government resources are inadequate to bridge infrastructural gap.\n\n\u201cSo we are looking at public collaborations. One of such viable options is the adoption of PPP arrangements to unlock the huge benefit it can afford.\n\n\u201cIn addition, from the 2021/2022 budget cycle, all infrastructure projects in Nigeria must be screened for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) suitability and compliance with the National Integrated Infrastructure Master plan by her ministry and the BPE before inclusion in national budgets and subsequent procurement.\u201d\n\nAhmed said the federal government is willing to discuss and hear suggestions from stakeholders to strengthen Nigeria\u2019s PPP framework.",

          "title": "Excitement, challenges on ancestral throne for 22 yrs -His Royal Highness",
          "text": "By Gabriel Omonhinmin\n\nOn Saturday, May, 22, 2021, the entire South-Ibie town, in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State went agog as His Royal Highness, Alhaji Aliu Kelvin Danesi, Oba Idanesi II and the Aidonoje of South-Ibie marked his twenty second anniversary on the throne.\n\nTwenty-two years ago. a quiet, unassuming, urban and dashing banker, Prince Danesi was called from his lucrative job in one of the new generation banks then, to take up the throne of his forefathers in a rustic semi-urban town of South-Ibie, as the Aidonojie of South Ibe.\n\nAs to be expected, very close friends to the Prince objected to him taking the appointment. The young Prince briefly worked with a law firm in Lagos known as I.B.M Haruna & Associates immediately after leaving the law school, before moving to the banking industry.\n\nOther associates and some relatives, were obviously apprehensive, not because the prince then was not qualified or competent to ascend the throne, but for the fear, that he was too quiet, urban and refined, and might not have the temperament to navigate or withstand the intense intrigues associated with the throne.\n\nOther people, especially his co-workers then, felt it was crazy for a man, who was already doing very well in the banking industry as manager in one of the major branches in a big city in Nigeria, to abandon everything he has archived for the throne.\n\nIt has been twenty-two years down the line when this very difficult decision was taken by His Royal Highness, Alhaji Aliu Kelvin Danesi. He has since proven everyone, who opposed his taking up the throne wrong.\n\nAs he has since stabilized his then troubled community and brought a lot of developments to the once rural community he now rule as its traditional ruler. Within these periods, he has brought the people of South-Ibie town together, leading to the massive development of the entire area.\n\nAmidst fierce opposition by other contending Princes from other ruling houses in South-Ibie for the throne twenty-two years ago, a calm and highly focused Oba Idanesi II, who literally lives up to his title \u201cIdanesi\u201d \u2013 I surrender or submit to my destiny\u201d still had the gut to reassure whosoever cares to listen then, when he said,\n\n\u201cThis is my forefather\u2019s throne. It\u2019s everyman with his people. I will not abdicate my responsibility to my people, I will stand with them. I shall weather this storm, no matter how big or difficult. As I do not intend to run away now, since I have been called upon to ascend this throne of my forbearers.\u201d\n\nYes! It\u2019s been twenty-two eventful years, Oba Idanesi has not only stayed with the people of South-Ibie, but has indeed weathered every ranging storms and challenges on his way and path with grace.\n\nWhat a guts! His years on the throne of South-Ibe in Estako West Local Government Area of Edo state, has not only been emotional, it is full of historical attestations.\n\nThe 67 years old Aidonojie of South Ibie, in one of his numerous chats with Palace Watch when we were much younger, once said, in those trying periods and other special interviews, \u201cThose that are wretched, in the full sense of the word, are those that are bereft of the treasures of faith.\n\nThese types of people are always in a state of misery, anger and humiliation. Oba Idanesi\u2019s unwavering faith in his personal ability and God has certainly led him into achieving great things for himself and his people.\n\nHe also once told Palace Watch, \u201cThe only means of purifying the heart, of removing anxieties and worries from it, is to have an implicit belief in Allah, Lord of all that exist. In fact, there can be no true meaning to life when one has no faith.\n\nOba Idanesi II, who always waxed philosophical whenever he engaged other people in discussions, will always say, \u201cIn all situations, always endeavor to extract the honey but do not break the hive. Everything that has gentleness within it is beautified, and whatever lacks it is spoiled.\n\nWhen you meet someone, giving them a bright smile and a kind word, you are displaying the characteristic of the truly successful man. These qualities and characteristic most successful people in the world exhibit.\n\nWhen a bee lands on a flower doing so for a practical purpose, it does not destroy it, because Allah rewards meekness and gentility. These are qualities people with harsh disposition towards others don\u2019t have.\n\nHe will always stress, \u201cThere are people whose personalities are like magnets, attracting everyone, who is nearby, simply because, they are loved for their gentle talk, their good manners, and their noble deeds.\n\n\u201cWinning the friendship of other is an art that is mastered by those that are noble and pious; a circle of people constantly surround them. Their mere presence in a gathering is a blessing and when they are absent, they are missed and asked about.\n\n\u201cThis type of people, he added, suck out malice from others with their sincerity, forgiveness, and gentleness. They forget evil that was enacted upon them and preserve the memory of kindness received.\n\nBiting harsh words may be aimed at them, but such words pass by their ears without entering and continue on their path without ever returning.\n\nThey are always in a state of calmness. People in general, and Muslims in particular, are safe from suffering any harm at their hands. If you must know, this is how, I have survived my nineteen years sojourn on the throne so far.\n\nHis Royal Highness Aliu Kelvin Danesi, the Aidonojie of South-Ibie, concludes, \u201cWe should always accept life as it is. The pleasures of life are short-lived, and more often than not, they are followed by sorrow.\n\nLife means responsibility, a journey wherein change is constant and difficulties are many. You will never find a king, a commoner, a father, a wife, or a friend, who is free from problems.\n\nAs Allah has willed for this world to be filled with two opposites; good and evil, righteousness and corruption, and misery. Thus good, uprightness, and happiness are for the Paradise; evil, corruption, and misery are for the Fire.\n\n\u201cSo live according to your reality without always envisioning the ideal life, one that is free of worry and toil. Accept life as it is and adapt accordingly to all circumstances.\n\nYou will not find in this world such things as the flawless companion or the perfect situation, because flawlessness and perfection are qualities that are foreign to this life.\u201d He concluded.\n\nAny surprise that Oba Idanesi II has done so well for himself and the people of South-Ibie, during his twenty-two years reign on the throne of South-Ibie? Congratulation Zaiki and more graceful years ahead of you on the throne.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Omonhinmin\n\nThe Benin Traditional Council in Edo State has been working frantically to stop, what a Palace Watch source described as \u2018the illegal attempt or incursion of the Legacy or Legal Restoration Trust\u201d towards appropriating the rights and ownership of the ancient kingdom\u2019s artifacts.\n\nThe prized heritage items were stolen from the Benin Palace in 1889 by the British forces that invaded ancient city in that year.\n\nThe British military reprisal on Benin kingdom exactly a hundred and thirty-two years now, was as a result of the killing of some Portuguese merchants by the Benin troops, who had hitherto prevented the merchants\u2019 from entering Benin City due to the \u2018Igwe\u2019 festival that was being celebrated by the Oba and his people at the time of the visit.\n\nThis incident happened during the reign of Oba Ovenramen Nogbaisi, who was the Oba of Benin Kingdom from 1888 to 1897. The British invaders in the process looted and desecrated the Oba\u2019s Palace in Benin City, where they stole about five thousands or more pieces of indigenous art works of the Benin people kept in the palace.\n\nThese art works are now scattered all over the world especially in some Museums in Europe. The British Museum alone still holds about nine hundred pieces of different works of arts, which include the FESTAC 77 mask up till now.\n\nPalace Watch investigation has revealed that the principal reasons for the disagreement between the Benin Traditional Council and The Legacy or Legal Restoration Trust is the alleged clandestine moves by this group to appropriate the benefits derivable from these looted items. A move, the Benin Traditional Council frowned seriously at.\n\nA senior Benin Palace Chief, who pleaded anonymity explains, \u201cthe present disagreement arose, as a result of the disgraceful attempt by this group to spoil the repatriation and restitutions plans, which the Oba personally spearheaded since his ascension to the Benin throne in 2016.\n\nThese people have become so fetish in their approach that they now want to destroy all the ground works that have been covered, and the gains already achieved over the years.\n\nNo sane person will expect His Royal Majesty, Oba Ewuare II, the main driver of this project and the Benin Traditional Council to fold their hands and watch while this damage is being done.\n\nThis anomaly and vagrant violation of our culture and tradition, which also breaches our legal system, spiritual, moral and common sense as Benin people, is without mincing words, a direct instigation of some individuals in the Edo State Government.\n\nThe government officials behind these acts, are yet to come out into the open, instead, they prefer to use a third party, which is the Legacy or Legal Restoration Trust for their nefarious activities.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cit is also a calculated attempt to corner the possible monetary gains which run into millions of dollars that might accrue to the Benin Palace when the looted artifacts are returned and restitution paid for them.\n\nThe Oba of Benin personal efforts to realize this all important goal from all indications has reached an advanced stage, hence, the desperation on their side, to seize the process for their own selfish gains.\n\nOur source continued, \u201cIf you can recall, immediately the Omo N\u2019Oba Ewuare II ascended the Benin throne, in October, 2016, as a former Ambassador, he personally kick-started this whole process and led the drive for the realization of the reparation and restitutions for the stolen Benin artifacts, using his numerous contacts globally to fast track things and the process.\n\nIt is sad, however, and painful too, disrespectful to the Benin throne and people, especially now, that all efforts are gradually coming to fruition, for an unknown group of persons, who are strange to the Benin palace, who go by the name, Legacy or Legal Restoration Trust to attempt to take over the benefits of this process, and attempt to reap from where they did not sow.\n\nThis, we as Benin people will never allow to happen, by the powers of God Almighty and the grace of our ancestors.\u201d He concluded.\n\nPalace Watch in an attempt to get to the roots of this matter, reached out to one Enotie Paul Ogbebor, who is said, to be the representative of Legacy or Legal Restoration Trust in Benin City and Nigeria.\n\nThe following dialogue ensued in the process:-\n\nPalace Watch: Am I on to Mr. Ogbebor please?\n\nMr. Ogbebor: Yes, How can I be of help to you?\n\nPalace Watch: My name is Gabriel Omonhinmin, I am doing a story on the alleged disagreement between the Benin Palace and Legacy or Legal Restoration Trust, over the reparation and payment of restitutions over the stolen artifacts by the British Army in 1889, which are expected to be returned any moment from now. I\u2019m told that you are the representative of Legacy Restoration Trust in Benin and in Nigeria. Is that correct?\n\nMr. Ogbebor: \u201cI am not ready to speak and I will not speak on this particular matter. \u201cWho gave you my telephone number by the way? If you want any information regarding this matter, Google LRT, you\u2019ll get all the information you require.\u201d\n\nA search by Palace Watch revealed that Legacy or Legal Restoration Trust (LRT) is one and the same body. It is also an independent, non-for-profit entity allegedly incorporated in Nigeria to support cultural heritage art and archaeological projects by providing research, attracting funding and securing execution capability for high-value arts and cultural projects.\n\nThe body\u2019s flagship projects according to the site, \u201cis series of activities in Benin City, Edo State, that will culminate in the establishment of the David Adjaye-designed Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA), a world-class museum, center for research and education and hub for contemporary creatives.\n\nThe proposed EMOWAA Museum when built will act as a civic and cultural space for the people of Benin City and Edo State. EMOWAA they say, will highlight, rediscover and preserve the rich history of West African culture and the heritage of the Benin kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe LRT claims further, that it was born out of discussions among HRH, the Oba of Benin, the Benin Dialogue Group, the Edo State Government and Nigeria\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments.\u201d\n\nThe above claims the Benin Traditional Council, in a Press release reference number BTC.A40/VOL.LVIV/134 dated 10th May, 2021 entitled \u201cThe Renewed Call for the Return of Looted Benin Artifacts, The Official Position of the Palace of The Oba Of Benin.\u201d\n\nJointly signed by Mr. Frank Irabor, Secretary, Benin Traditional Council and Mr. Dennis Osaretin Esq, Executive Assistant, Corporate and Legal Affairs to His Royal Majesty, Oba Ewuare II and Secretary, Oba Ewuare II Foundation.\n\nThe press release reads, \u201cIt has come to the notice of the Oba of Benin and the Benin Traditional Council, that some persons and group of individuals, parading themselves as official representatives of the \u201cLegacy Restoration Trust\u201d and \u201cLegal Restoration Trust\u201d for the return of the Benin Artifacts looted from the Palace of the Oba of Benin, by the British in the year 1889.\n\nFor categorical clarification, these individuals and group of persons are not known, not authorized by the Oba of Benin, who is the original owner of the looted artifacts and the custodian of Benin customs and tradition.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, Oba of Benin, remains the custodian Legis of all insignia, symbols and such other artifacts depicting the rich cultural heritage of the Benin people.\n\n\u201cTherefore only the Oba of Benin or his duly authorized representatives or body corporate can interact or have any dealings with any foreign donors or missions or any other international institutions globally, in respect of these looted Benin artifacts, which have attracted a renewed global attention, due to several calls made by His Royal Majesty for the return to their original place of abode.\n\n\u201cThe Oba of Benin in conjunction with the Benin Traditional Council has set up a very robust frame work and body corporate to midwife and coordinate all efforts aimed at retrieving the looted and stolen artifacts from all over the world, and the only recognized legal entities for this remain the Oba Ewurare II foundation and the Benin Traditional Council.\n\n\u201cThe general public is by this notice advised forthwith, to desist from dealing with any faceless contraption or group of individuals, particularly the group known and referred to as the \u201cLegacy Restoration Trust or The Legal Restoration Trust\u201d currently parading themselves as agents, Trustee or pseudo custodians of the Benin cultural heritage, particularly one, Enotie Paul Ogbebor.\n\nAnyone caught further engaging in such unwholesome activity will be seen and treated as a fraudster and perceived as an enemy working against the interest of the great Benin kingdom and the generality of Benin people all around the world, as personified by the Oba of Benin.\u201d\n\nIn another statement issued on the occasion of the visit of the German delegation to the Palace of the Oba of Benin in respect of the proposed return of looted Benin artifacts on Friday, 21st May, 2021, Mr. Dennis Osaretin Esq, Executive Assistant to the Oba of Benin on Corporate and Legal Affairs, said the latest push by Oba Ewuare II, has resulted in the likely return of some of the Benin Bronzes stolen during the British expedition in Benin City in 1889.\n\nThe following international museums and institutions, Osaretin stressed, are also collaborating effectively with the Benin Palace on the stolen items. They are the University of Aberdeen, Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA), Cambridge, The British Museum (BM) London, Pitt Rivers Museum, Oxford, Great North Museum, Newcastle. The Royal Pavilion & Museum Trust, (RPMT), Brighton. National Museum Liverpool and Bristol Museum & Art Gallery.\n\nOba Eware II as a direct descendant of the Royal family from whom the Bronzes were looted over a century ago, has made their return a top priority. As he has joined forces with the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, to achieve this aim.\n\nOsaretin said that the Benin Dialogue Group was formed in year 2010 to bring together museum and government representatives from Nigeria and Europe to discuss a way forward and execute the plans for the proposed Benin Royal Museum.\n\nHe added that the move by Berlin and Aberdeen to fully repatriate the stolen artefacts, marks a departure from the model of long-term loans that had previously been agreed upon by the dialogue group.\n\nAs this is likely to put pressure on other European institutions to follow suit. It is our hope, that this recent development will speed up the process of restitutions and increase support for our proposed Royal Museum projects in Benin City.\n\nAs this will again be an opportunity to right the wrongs of the past, which occurred when the British forces invaded Benin Kingdom, and massacred our people. This is an opportunity to start a much-needed process of healing and closure as a result of the looting of Benin treasures.\u201d He concluded.\n\nWhen Palace Watch contacted the Edo State Government for its comment on the matter, we were told that nobody is in a position to speak officially for the government, because no appointment has been made by Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s administration since November, 2020.\n\n",

B-lord group will be the biggest company in Nigeria soon.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Reno Omokri questions Buhari on Farouk Yahaya\u2019s appointment, \u201cBut will Buhari die?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust know that if you give up, you will have to start afresh again, and when hunger pays you a visit, you will be forced to double up your efforts.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cBeing disciplined and responsible saves you from unnecessary problems and drama. It makes you spend only on important needs which enables you to save money.\n\nTherefore, to be focused as a young person requires that you are disciplined.\u201d\n\nBlord, who is also into other businesses, including owning B-lord luxury store and recently, branching into real estate, avowed that, all his businesses are duly registered and each open to scrutiny.\n\nHe writes: \u201cI have nothing to hide from the law or the public.

The case, according to reports, has been in court for a couple of months now.",

          "text": "President of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop Francis Wale Oke, has kicked against the move to introduce Sharia law to the South-West states in the country.\n\nOke made his stand known after a group identified as the Muslim Congress had, during the zonal public hearings on constitutional amendments on Wednesday, submitted a memo to the Senate Committee, proposing the implementation of Sharia in the southwest region.\n\nThe Muslim group had said it wants Sharia implemented in the Yoruba-speaking southwest to cater to its Muslim population.\n\nOke, who is the Founder of Sword of the Spirit Ministries, however, urged the government to direct their efforts towards solving the mounting problems bedeviling the country.\n\nOke while speaking in his church on Wednesday, said Buhari is suffering from extreme fatigue and has lost touch with reality.\n\nHe further warned those pushing the \u2018Fulani agenda\u2019 to drop it or else they will drop dead.\n\nThe cleric maintained that Sharia law will not be imposed in the South West adding that some people are pushing Nigeria to the brim of war.\n\nHe said they are using the ongoing constitutional review being carried out by the Senate to create religious confusion in the South West because the hijab controversy did not work in Kwara State.\n\nIn his words, \u201cSome unscrupulous lawmakers, with all the mirages of problems we have in Nigeria; insecurity, Boko Haram, kidnapping and the economy on a free fall like the government is not in control, debt of Nigeria skyrocketing, they want to use amendment of the Constitution to propose the introduction of Sharia to all the Southwestern states of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTell them I am in the South West and there is no way for sharia here. It Is like we have an absentee President. Give credit to President Buhari, he has served Nigeria all his life but the man is suffering from extreme fatigue and he is out of touch with reality.\n\n\u201cNigeria is never as divided as this and the people that he surrounds himself with are doing a very horrible job. Those close to him are not helping him.\n\n\u201cThey are playing the Fulani agenda and it will not work. They are pushing Nigeria to the brim of war. There shall be no war in Nigeria in Jesus name. We send the war back to their homes and family in the name of Jesus.\n\n\u201cThey are pushing Nigeria to the point of breaking apart, by the mercy of God Nigeria will not break. God has an agenda for Nigeria, and it will fulfill destiny. Those wanting war for Nigeria and are pushing a sectional agenda, wanting to create trouble God will give them trouble.\n\n\u201cI invoke trouble upon their life, home and I invoke peace upon Nigeria. God will give us peace even if it means removing the trouble makers, God will give us peace. Tell them to drop the agenda otherwise, they will begin to drop dead.\n\n\u201cWe have lived together in harmony in the South West, Christians and Muslims for decades. I grew up in a village where when the Muslims are celebrating the Christians will join them in celebration, and when the Christians are celebrating the Muslims celebrate too.\n\n\u201cIn the same family, you will find Muslims and Christians living together peacefully. So they see that the hijab thing in Kwara State has not worked. They now want to create religious confusion in the South West? it will not work. We won\u2019t keep quiet.\u201d",

          "text": "The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) Wednesday warned against underhanded attempts by some groups to impose Sharia rule in the country\u2019s southwest through the Senate\u2019s ongoing constitutional review.\n\nThe Christian organization cautioned the Senate not to give in to such agitation, which it claims has the potential to further plunge the country into a theological crisis.\n\nInstead, according to a statement from the PFN President\u2019s Media Office, Bishop Francis Wale Oke, the country\u2019s politicians should focus their efforts on resolving the country\u2019s rising challenges, particularly those involving the security of people\u2019s lives and property.\n\n\u201cThe problems confronting the nation are enormous than wanting to create more. Sharia law is alien to our culture of religious existence in the SouthWest. As such, nobody should through any subterfuge bring it in to cause the crisis.\u201d\n\nAccording to the body, the introduction of such law into SouthWest would aim at pitching the Christians against their Muslim counterparts, saying: \u201cWe want to strongly warn the Senate and those behind this plan to unsettle the peace being enjoyed in this country to desist before it is too late. Don\u2019t instigate religious crisis in the SouthWest, as this could further threaten the fragile peace of the country.\n\n\u201cThe secularity of our existence, which is devoid of any religious upheaval, should not be tampered with under whatever guise. We shall resist this by every legal means at our disposal.\n\n\u201cWithout the Sharia, we have always lived peacefully with our Muslim brothers. We know that this is the handiwork of those who are hell-bent on unsettling the country at all costs. But the good news is that: They have failed. As far as we are concerned, the proposal won\u2019t fly and can never fly. It is dead on arrival.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Christian organisation has calmed the frayed nerves of its members who appeared agitated over the development and have been bombarding the body\u2019s leadership with inquiries, assuring that their interest would always be protected.\n\nIt implored them to always comport themselves by not taking laws into their hands, but make peaceful co-existence their watchword.",

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria has ordered the military junta in Mali to immediately and unconditionally release the detained transitional President and Prime Minister.\n\nSpokesperson, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ferdinand Nwonye in a statement said the action is totally unacceptable.\n\nIt warned the key military actors and perpetrators of the condemnable act to beware of the fact that stakeholders in the region and friends of Mali reject any act of coercion of the detained officials, including forced resignations.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria condemns in strong terms the detention of the duo of interim President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane of Mali.\n\n\u201cThe two key officials in the transitional government of Mali were reportedly taken by Soldiers to the Kati Military Camp near the Capital, Bamako on Monday 24, May 2021.\n\n\u201cThe action is totally unacceptable and might derail the peace building efforts and time table for the return of democratic governance in Mali\u201d.\n\nDiplomatic and government sources said that the reason for the detention is not unconnected to governmet reshuffle that affected some of the military guys in the transitional government.\n\nInternational media reported that President Bah Ndaw, Prime Minister Moctar Ouane and defence minister Souleymane Doucoure were all taken to a military base in Kati outside the capital Bamako, hours after two members of the military lost their positions in a government reshuffle.\n\nThe sacking of the pillars of the coup was an enormous misjudgement,\u201d a senior former Malian government official told the international medium.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 mission in Mali called for the group\u2019s \u201cimmediate and unconditional\u201d release and said those who hold the leaders would have to answer for their actions.\n\nA delegation from the top regional decision-making body ECOWAS will visit Bamako on Tuesday to help resolve the \u201cattempted coup\u201d, ECOWAS, the U.N., African Union, European Union and several European countries said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cThe international community rejects in advance any act imposed by coercion, including forced resignations,\u201d the group further said.\n\nThe U.S. State Department called in a statement for the \u201cunconditional release of those currently being held\u201d.\n\nRecall that on August 18, 2020 young military officers overthrew the country\u2019s elected president, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, after a mounting wave of protests against his handling of Mali\u2019s conflict and the country\u2019s economic malaise.\n\nUnder the threat of international sanctions, the officers, headed by the American trained officer and leader of the coup, Colonel Assimi Goita handed power between September and October to a caretaker government, which is meant to rule for 18 months before staging elections.\n\nThe military government was officially disbanded in January, although the army has retained a tight grip on the interim government. The pledge of an 18-month transition had spurred many doubts as to whether the military-dominated government had the will, or the ability, to stage elections on such a timescale.\n\nEarlier in the year, Lieutenant Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, the minister of territorial administration, told reporters that the first round of voting will take place on February 27, 2022 and a second round will follow in March.\n\nThe dates strictly uphold promises of an 18-month transition for returning to an elected government, Maiga said.\n\nMeanwhile the continental and sub-regional bodies have been lethargic about the issue, as all the resolutions of ECOWAS on the issue were not backed by actions ostensibly because of divergent interest of member states.\n\nOnly recently the\n\nECOWAS Parliament said that its non recognition of the parliamentarians from Mali has been referred to ECOWAS Court of Justice for interpretation.\n\nThe parliament maintained that it would not recognize parliamentarians from Mali following the military junta that took over the political leadership of the country.\n\nThe parliament further maintained that it would not recognize undemocratic governance under any guise.\n\nThe Community parliament later side tracked and allowed the MP from Mali\u2019s disbanded parliament to participate in its first extra ordinary session in Sierra Leone as observers.\n\nSuch weak disposition could not send any meaningful strong message to the transitional Government.",

          "text": "Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City are 90 minutes away from the trophy they so desperately crave but a Chelsea side transformed in recent months stand in their way in Saturday\u2019s all-English Champions League final in Porto, the Portuguese city which was named as a last-minute host.\n\nIt is the third final of Europe\u2019s elite club competition to be played between two Premier League sides, and the second in just three seasons, and so this is a match-up that underlines the strength of the cash-rich English game.\n\nAnd these are the two clubs whose own transformations in the last two decades under mega-rich foreign owners have done the most to change forever the landscape of the Premier League.\n\nNot so long ago, the idea of Chelsea and City meeting in the biggest club game of all would have been laughable. Their only previous encounter in a final came in 1986 in the short-lived Full Members Cup, when Chelsea won 5-4 at Wembley.\n\nThat was before the Premier League and modern Champions League existed before Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 and before the Abu Dhabi takeover of City in 2008.\n\nREAD ALSO: Suarez Scores As Atletico Madrid Win La Liga\n\nThe west London club had a head-start in terms of becoming big-spenders and as a club they have the experience of this stage before, having beaten Bayern Munich on penalties on their own turf in the 2012 final.\n\nThey have also won the Europa League twice since then.\n\n\u2018Close the gap for 90 minutes\u2019\n\nCity, though, have never made it this far but are finally here, after 13 years of enormous investment from the Gulf and four previous years of disappointment under Guardiola, the man who was hired principally to win them the European Cup.\n\n\u201cWe are quite a similar team to what we were in the past when we were knocked out. The margins and little details this year fell down on our side whereas before it was the opposite,\u201d said Guardiola, who is looking to win his third Champions League as a coach, a decade after his last victory with Barcelona.\n\nAfter romping to the Premier League title, their third in four seasons, and having also won the League Cup this season, a City side starring the likes of Kevin De Bruyne and Ruben Dias are the clear favourites at the Estadio do Dragao.\n\nChelsea, though, have beaten City twice in the last six weeks, first in the FA Cup semi-final and then at the Etihad Stadium in the league.\n\n\u201cI could not expect a tougher opponent,\u201d Guardiola said.\n\nThey have been transformed since Thomas Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard as coach in January, even if they did finish the domestic season with three defeats in four games including the FA Cup final against Leicester City.\n\n\u201cWe have arrived here. This is an incredible achievement and once you arrive you want to be on your very best, but it\u2019s City with Pep on the other side who are maybe at the moment the best in Europe, maybe in the world,\u201d said Tuchel, who was given a boost as fitness concerns Edouard Mendy and N\u2019Golo Kante returned to training on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is on us again to close the gap for 90 minutes and the good thing is we did it already.\n\n\u201cIn football everything is possible and in a final everything is possible.\u201d\n\nShadow of Covid\n\nOf course Covid-19 casts a shadow over the final, which is only being played in Porto after the last-minute decision to move the game away from Istanbul.\n\nThe Turkish metropolis was denied the chance to host the occasion for the second year running after the UK government put the country on its travel red list, making it impossible for fans of either finalist to attend the game from England.\n\nJust like last year when Lisbon was the last-minute solution, Portugal rode to the rescue again, and fans will be there with the country one of the few on the UK\u2019s green travel list.\n\nWith Portuguese authorities allowing the Estadio do Dragao to be filled to 33 percent capacity, there will be 16,500 spectators in total, including 6,000 fans of each club.\n\nPortuguese police have said dealing with such an influx of English fans as the country opens its borders again will be \u201can operation of great complexity\u201d.\n\nAFP",
