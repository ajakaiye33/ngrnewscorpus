          "text": "Sunday Igboho\n\nBy Dapo Akinrefon\n\nThe Oke ogun Development Consultative Forum, ODCF, on Sunday, urged both the Nigeria Government and the Government of Benin Republic to respect the fundamental human rights of Yoruba Nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo fondly called Sunday Igboho in the course of his trial in the court of law.\n\nSunday Igboho is from Igboho in Oorelope local government area of Oke-ogun in Oyo State.\n\nIn a statement by ODCF, the umbrella body for the people of Oke Ogun in Oyo State, it\u2019s President and Public Relations Officer, Messrs Olusegun Ajuwon and Jare Ajayi respectively, the body stated that Adeyemo\u2019s mission was meant to put a stop to the iniquities being meted out to Yoruba people, of which he is a proud son.\n\nMr. Adeyemo was the arrowhead of a movement peacefully tackling Fulani herders, who were terrorizing farmers and rural dwellers particularly in Ibarapa area of Oyo State.\n\nHis group later began to agitate for the creation of a Yoruba nation.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cWe are proud of his desire to see that farmers are no longer prevented from cultivating their farms and our women are no longer raped in the course of pursuing their businesses.\u201d\n\nODCF said that while it concedes that the government has a right, indeed the power, to try anybody thought to have contravened the law, \u201cbut in doing so, government should factor in the relevant sections of the law that says that a suspect is innocent until proven guilty by a court of competent jurisdiction. Not only that, the governments of Nigeria and Benin should remember the relevant sections of the African Charter and other international conventions to which they are signatories.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: Secession: Former President makes diplomatic move to save Igboho\n\nIt stated: \u201cSome of the documents being referred to include Article 4 of the ECOWAS Convention on Extradition which prescribes that a suspect can not be extradited if the offence for which he is wanted is \u2018political or for the purpose of prosecuting him on account of his ethnic group or political opinion\u2019. Various provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Nigeria is also a party, have similar provisions.\n\n\u201cFrom available reports, issues surrounding Sunday Igboho are political in nature because what he was advocating have something to do with how his people were being treated.\n\n\u201cPart of what Sunday Igboho advocated was echoed penultimate week by Emir of Muri in Taraba state.\n\nThe monarch had given Fulani herders a 30 day ultimatum to vacate his area because of the harm they were doing to farmers and women in his domain. Reports indicated that the herders last week Monday, August 2, pledged their readiness to comply with his directive.\n\n\u201cThere is no difference between what Sunday Igboho was advocating and what Emir of Muri has done. Therefore, we believe that what is good for the goose should be good for the gander.\n\n\u201cWe are law abiding citizens with commitment to the laws of the land. \u201cIt is within these laws that we seek protection for ourselves and our people including Sunday Adeyemo Igboho.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Dr. Monday Ubani\n\nBy Henry Ojelu\n\nFormer 2nd Vice President of the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Dr. Monday Ubani has demanded for the enforcement of disciplinary measures recommended by the Court of Appeal against some judges and lawyers who delved into alleged frivolous post-primary election cases filed by some parties in forthcoming Anambra governorship election.\n\nRecall that Justice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme while delivering judgment in one of such cases had recommended that the National Judicial Council, NJC, should discipline two judges for unprofessional conduct of dabbling into the Anambra State gubernatorial election controversy and gave consequential judgments on it.\n\nThe judge also recommended that the NBA should discipline the senior lawyers who filed the suit on behalf of their clients for professional misconduct.\n\nCommending the recommendation of Justice Nwosu-Iheme, Ubani noted that the NJC and NBA must urgently act on the advice of the judge so as to restore the hope of the common man on the judiciary.\n\nHe said: \u201cI must commend the courage, integrity, and the upholding of the public good that these profound pronouncements by the learned jurist has brought to the entire judiciary and perhaps the country.\n\n\u201cWe can heave a sigh of relief knowing well that there are still remnants in Nigeria that can stand and speak truth to the Nation irrespective of whose ox is gored.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of Hon Justice Nwosu-Iheme. All hope is not lost for us as a nation. Nigeria still has men and women of integrity everywhere! The few denting our image are in minority but powerful and pervasive.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, insist that disciplinary measures as recommended by her Lordship be commenced by the NBA and NJC to act as a check to the incessant embarrassment the legal profession is presently facing in all spheres and caused by those who are supposed to know and observe the ethics of the profession whether at the Bench or at the Bar.\u201d\n\nUbani further stated that it is worrisome that Anambra State has become notorious for many of the controversial election cases in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe recent happening in the electoral climate in Anambra State deserves to attract serious concern by all and sundry in the legal profession.\n\n\u201cEvery electoral season in Anambra is usually hot with bizarre happenings, especially court cases that are notoriously unprecedented.\n\n\u201cOur electoral jurisprudence is replete with so many cases that have emanated from Anambra State since the return to democratic rule in 1999. Some positive but many negative.\n\n\u201cThe most litigious state in Nigeria in electoral matters, no doubt, remains Anambra State. There are reported instances where parties in cases already decided will re-approach the Supreme Court to \u2018set aside\u2019 decisions that the Supreme Court as the final court had decided.\n\n\u201cThat such cases are usually filed by lawyers, especially senior lawyers in the rank of Senior Advocates of Nigeria are not only shocking but increasingly disgusting.\n\n\u201cWhat should evoke mourning is that such lawyers usually escape disciplinary measures of Nigerian Bar Association over the years.\n\n\u201cThe resultant effect is that cases of more bizarre nature are being filed regularly with impunity by these categories of lawyers.\n\n\u201cTake for instance the All Progressive Grand Alliance(APGA) primary gubernatorial election case that has just ended at the court of Appeal in Awka this week.\n\n\u201cThe journey of the case started in somewhere in Jigawa State that is several hundreds of kilometres away from Anambra that has territorial jurisdiction to decide the matter.\n\n\u201cBoth the lawyer and the judge that decided on the case knew that the Jigawa State High Court do not have territorial jurisdiction but went ahead to decide the case, not minding the consequence of such brazen decision that is fatally flawed.\n\n\u201cAs if that was not enough, another set of lawyers and a judge this time around, somewhere in Imo State as \u2018undertakers\u2019 undertook to decide the APGA leadership matter that should be decided in Anambra State, affirming one Jude Okeke as APGA acting Chairman, while one Chukwuma Umeoji was declared as the authentic gubernatorial candidate for the November 2021 gubernatorial election.\n\n\u201cA High court in Anambra presided over by Justice Charles Okaa corrected these anomalies and upheld the recognition of former Central Bank Governor, Charles Soludo, as the authentic All Progressive Grand Alliance candidate in the November 6 gubernatorial election in the State.\n\n\u201cDissatisfied, the opponent brought a motion seeking to stop the execution of the order of by Justice Charles Okaa.\n\n\u201cThis impunity gave ample room to Justice Nwosu-Iheme of the Court of Appeal Awka an opportunity she never wasted, to lash out at the erring legal professionals who, according to her, go from one part of the country to another in search of judgments to enable some politicians to run for public office.\n\n\u201cIt is called Forum Shopping in legal parlance.\n\n\u201cJustice Nwosu-Iheme consequently demanded punishment for Justice Musa Ubale of Birnin Kudu, Jigawa State, and his counterpart in the Imo State Judiciary, Justice B. C. Iheka for what she aptly described as their unprofessional conduct by dabbling into the Anambra State gubernatorial election controversy and gave consequential judgments on it.\n\n\u201cShe also sought, and rightly too, that lawyers who took the cases to the State High Courts in Jigawa and Imo states be disciplined for professional misconduct.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "Commending the recommendation of Justice Nwosu-Iheme, Ubani noted that the NJC and NBA must urgently act on the advice of the judge so as to restore the hope of the common man on the judiciary.\nHe said: \u201cThe recent happening in the electoral climate in Anambra State deserves to attract serious concern by all and sundry in the legal profession.\n\u201cEvery electoral season in Anambra is usually hot with bizarre happenings, especially court cases that are notoriously unprecedented.\n\u201cOur electoral jurisprudence is replete with so many cases that have emanated from Anambra State since the return to democratic rule in 1999.\n\u201cThe most litigious state in Nigeria in electoral matters, no doubt, remains Anambra State.",

          "text": "Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has commended women of the state for the noble roles they play in the development of the state in particular and the nation in general.\n\nSpeaking during the flag-off of this year\u2019s August Meeting for women held at Michael Okpara Square, Enugu, with the theme: \u201cWomen and children must be protected as a bedrock of our community\u201d, Gov. Ugwuanyi stressed that women, worldwide, have contributed immensely in the development of the society.\n\nHe added that his administration at its inception recognized the pivotal roles played by women in the initiation and effective implementation of government policies and programmes.\n\nRepresented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Simon Uchenna Ortuanya, Gov. Ugwuanyi pointed out that it was in recognition of the above that Enugu State today has the first female Deputy Governor as well as the first female Chief Judge of the State, in the persons of Hon. Mrs. Cecilia Ezeilo and Hon. Justice Priscilla Ngozi Emehelu, respectively.\n\nThe governor disclosed that four women were elected as members of the State House of Assembly with three serving as Principal Officers of the House, adding that his administration appointed women as Commissioners for Gender Affairs and Social Development, Finance, and Special Duties.\n\nStressing his commitment to women\u2019s participation in governance, Gov. Ugwuanyi revealed that a woman was elected as Chairman of a local government area under his administration, for the first time in the history of Enugu State.\n\nHe therefore reiterated the state government\u2019s commitment to continue to partner women in all sectors of development for the common good of the people of the state.\n\nGov. Ugwuanyi commended his wife, Mrs. Monica Ugwuanyi, for the laudable roles she is playing through her pet project, Ugo\u2019s Touch of Life Foundation (U-TOLF) and other children/women intervention and emancipation programmes.\n\nThe governor maintained that the annual August Meeting is timely and a veritable platform for women to unite, reflect and interact on development issues as well as proffer solutions to the challenges confronting them in particular and the society in general.\n\nHe therefore urged them to utilize the unique opportunity the gathering provides to chart a new course for their wellbeing, that of their families and the society at large.\n\nIn her speech, the Enugu State Governor\u2019s wife, Mrs. Ugwuanyi, emphasized the need for women to take their rightful positions in the scheme of things in the state in particular and the country in general.\n\nMrs. Ugwuanyi who charged the women to always endeavour to upgrade their cherished sterling qualities, such as education, humility, intelligence, good home management, community leadership, among others, advocated for girl-child education, which she said, liberates the society from the shackles of poverty, ignorance, enslavement, diseases and other problems.\n\nShe expressed delight that the Gov. Ugwuanyi administration recognizes the roles of women in governance as evidenced in the emergence of the first woman Deputy Governor and first woman Chief Judge, among other enviable positions in the state.\n\nEarlier in her remarks, the Commissioner for Gender Affairs and Social Development, Rt. Hon. Princess Peace Nnaji, thanked Gov. Ugwuanyi and his wife for signing the Child Rights Act into law and their tenacity towards the fight against gender-based violence in Enugu State, among other women-friendly programmes aimed at improving the living standard of women and children.\n\nMajor highlights of the event also include a march-past by women from the 17 LGAs and inspection of farm produce from the council areas by Mrs. Ugwuanyi.\n\nAlso present at the event were the Chief Whip of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Mrs. Jane Eneh, the Deputy Leader of the House, Rt. Hon. Onyiye Ugwu, the Deputy Chief Whip, Rt. Hon. Ethel Ugwuanyi, the member representing Isi-Uzo Constituency, Hon. Mrs. Catherine A.

At the time, she was attempting to stay away from meat and other animal products, Daily Mail reports.\n\nFor Orthodox Christians following the Julian calendar, Lent is a strict period as they are expected to stay away from meat, meat by-products, poultry, eggs, and dairy for the entire period.\n\nOvchinnikova claims that she hadn\u2019t eaten meat in a month when the fast-food chain\u2019s adverts for burgers and nuggets made her break her fast in April 2019.\n\nOvchinnikova is now accusing the fast-food giant of breaking the consumer protection law and insulting her religious feelings. She blames the company for advertising meat and animal products at a time when Christians are refraining from them, and is requesting 1,000 rubles ($14) as compensation for sustained moral damage.\n\nDespite successfully fasting for the past 16 years, Ovchinnikova was not able to resist the adverts and ended up ordering a burger from the nearest McDonald\u2019s restaurant.\n\n\u201cBy this point, I had already been fasting for a month, but when I saw an advertising banner, I could not help myself, I visited McDonald\u2019s and bought a cheeseburger,\u201d Ksenia Ovchinnikova wrote in her statement.\n\n\u201cIn the actions of McDonald\u2019s, I see a violation of the consumer protection law. I ask the court to investigate and, if a violation has taken place, to oblige McDonald\u2019s LLC to compensate me for moral damage in the amount of one thousand rubles.\u201d\n\nThe date of the preliminary hearing on Ovchinnikova\u2019s claim has not yet been set, court sources told Zamoskvoretsky press service, reported Oddity Central.",

          "text": "Barcelona stunned the football world and sent suitors scurrying for their chequebooks when they announced that Lionel Messi would be leaving the club this summer.\n\nThe Spanish aristocrats have been unable to agree a deal with the 34-year-old Argentina international which will allow them to comply with LaLiga\u2019s financial regulations, leading to a parting of the ways.\n\nHere, the PA news agency takes a look at some of the issues behind a momentous decision.\n\nHow did it come to this?\n\nWe should perhaps not be too surprised. Messi signalled his intention to leave the Nou Camp last summer, believing he could do so on a free transfer under the terms of his existing contract. A 700million Euros \u2013 around \u00a3629million \u2013 buy-out clause prevented him from doing so, but the seeds were sown regardless of the club\u2019s financial difficulties.\n\nAre Barcelona really that badly off?\n\nIn a word, yes. Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported earlier this year that the club\u2019s debt stood at 1.173billion Euros \u2013 \u00a3850million \u2013 and their wage bill currently accounts for 110 per cent of their income, a situation president Joan Laporta knows means they are on the wrong side of financial fair play regulations.\n\nHow expensive is Messi?\n\nVery. Reports suggest Messi\u2019s basic salary amounts to 45million Euros, or \u00a338.2million, and that he was willing to take a cut of more than 50 per cent to sign a new deal. Barca\u2019s statement claims the two parties had reached an agreement, but that the LaLiga rules simply do not allow it to be completed.\n\nIs the club\u2019s announcement a bargaining ploy?\n\nA good question. There is little doubt that Messi\u2019s profile has promoted LaLiga\u2019s product to a worldwide audience and his battle with Cristiano Ronaldo for the title of the greatest of all time is the soap opera which keeps giving. The governing body will not want to be seen as the villain of the piece, the role in which they appear to have been cast by the Nou Camp hierarchy. However, whether that and the public outcry which will inevitably follow the news will prompt a relaxation of the rules remains to be seen.\n\nIf not Barcelona, then where next for Messi?\n\nManchester City, Manchester United and Paris St Germain are two of the few clubs in world football with pockets deep enough to contemplate a move for a man whose advancing years are unlikely to provide a barrier to his future employment. Major League Soccer, where his enduring quality would enable him to play on for many years more, could provide a halfway house towards a return to his roots in Argentina, but the romantics in Rosario will inevitably pin their hopes on Messi\u2019s suggestion that he would one day like to return to the club where he launched his glittering career, Newell\u2019s Old Boys.",

His desire for the development and progress of our dear state, the Niger Delta region and Nigeria as well as his invaluable contributions to building bridges of peace across the country will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nFormer Governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu has described the demise of the business mogul as a painful loss to mankind.\n\nAcknowledging the contributions of the late philanthropist to the social, economic and political development of the country, Kalu stressed that the good deeds of the deceased will continue to speak for him.\n\nKalu, while advising the family of the deceased to uphold the legacies of Okunbo, prayed for strength and peace for the deceased\u2019s family in this sorrowful period.\n\nDoctors in the Commonwealth of nations and the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba also joined the list of mourners.\n\nA statement by the President, Commonwealth Medical Association (CMA), Osahon Enabulele, described the death as tragic.\n\n\u201cWhile I share the pains of his beloved family and loved ones over his earthly transition, his death has revealed once again that this terrestrial plane is a truly transient place for God\u2019s creatures. Indeed, we are undeniably passengers on this terrestrial plane and only our almighty creator can tell the precise time of our departure and the departure of our loved ones.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Agba in a statement said the death of Okunbo had \u201ccreated a huge vacuum that will be difficult to fill.\n\n\u201cMr. Hosa made a very huge difference to the lives of countless people by his philanthropy. Despite his wealth, his humility, selflessness, strength of spirit and deep sense of purpose made him a national icon, a revered symbol of humanity, and a source of inspiration to many people.\n\n\u201cWith his death, Edo people have lost one of its greatest sons. Our people have lost a colossus and a philanthropist par excellence. A guiding light has been extinguished; a philanthropic colossus no longer bestrides our world; but his legacy will live forever.\u201d\n\nWhile expressing shock, pain and disbelief, ex-governor of Edo State and immediate past national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, described Okunbo\u2019s death as an irreplaceable loss to humanity.\n\n\u201cHis generosity and capacity for empathy knew no bounds. He was a man of peace with an unlimited ability to forgive those who hurt him. He was a great source of inspiration for our youths, with a unique flair to understand and intervene on their behalf.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "*Nigeria needs detribalised leader, says Middle Belt Forum\n\n* Afenifere insists vision, political structure, key to president\u2019s performance\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Middle Belt Forum (MBF), and Afenifere have reacted to the comment by a former military President, General Ibrahim Babangida (rtd), that the next President of Nigeria should be less than 70 years and that the country\u2019s corruption index is worse now than what it was when he was Nigeria\u2019s military ruler.\n\nWhile the ACF backed Babangida\u2019s position on the next president\u2019s age limit, the MBF also supported the country\u2019s former military leader that corruption was less during his regime than now.\n\nOn its part, the pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has also backed the former military president\u2019s position on the age of the next president, citing the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo; and Chief Ladoke Akintola, who were in their 50s and 40s when they became premiers of the Western Region.\n\nAfenifere also cited the cases of the former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama of the United States, who mounted the saddle when they were not up to 60 years of age.\n\nThe socio-political group, however, argued that a president\u2019s performance does not depend on his age but his vision and the country\u2019s political structure.\n\nSpeaking on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspaper, to mark his 80th birthday, Babangida had recommended that the next president would be in his 60s.\n\nBabangida said the presidential hopefuls in 2023 should be persons in their 60s with contacts across the nation and who had been traversing the geo-political zones, marketing their acceptability and capacity.\n\nAlso reacting to the allegation that corruption was very pervasive during his administration, Babangida had stated that: \u201cYou can\u2019t compare it with the facts on the ground now. From what I read, from analyses, I think we are saints when compared to what it is under a democratic dispensation.\n\n\u201cI sacked a governor of a state for misappropriating less than N313,000. Today, those who have stolen billions and are in court are now parading themselves on the streets. Who else is better in fighting corruption?\u201d he queried.\n\nIn his interview with THISDAY, the President of MBF, Dr. Bitrus Pogu, backed Babangida, stressing that corruption is worse now than during the regime of the former military ruler.\n\nHowever, on the issue of the age limit for the next president, Pogu said the next president should be a detribalised Nigerian, irrespective of his age.\n\n\u201cThe elder statesman has spoken very well. But I think we should just allow Nigerians to make their choice. I am saying this because when people of the standing of IBB start to shape the thinking of Nigerians, then we may fall into a trap. But let\u2019s wait and see what Nigerians want.\n\n\u201cCertainly, we have seen elderly people that have performed wonderfully. I can confidently say that Olusegun Obasanjo while he was in office was over 70, but he performed wonderfully well.\n\n\u201cHe wakes up very early, has his squash, and prepares for the day ahead. Some young people were not even his match.\n\n\u201cSo, all these things depend on the person\u2019s well-being, sound mind, and mindset.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that our President in 2023 should be of detribalised character; a true Nigerian, not some kind of ethnic or religious bigots. The person should be someone that believes in Nigeria, and sees himself first as a Nigerian, not someone that looks away when his people are committing a heinous crime, and then punish others when they commit a lesser crime. We want someone who has good health and capacity to lead Nigerians,\u201d he explained.\n\nReacting to Babangida\u2019s claim on corruption, Pogu said: \u201cTo some extent, I agree with IBB that corruption has taken over subsequent administrations, especially the current administration. When the current administration came in, they had accused Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration of being corrupt, but what we see today is so terrible. What we see is the direct opposite of the promises they made to us as Nigerians. So, IBB is correct to say there has been deterioration from the time he left the government.\n\n\u201cWe have been shouting \u2018Abacha Loots\u2019, but Abacha was a saint compared to what we see today. Abacha, to me was a wonderful leader; a leader who despite all the sanctions was able to maintain the value of the Naira, made things work, and beat the Western economy to their game,\u201d Pogu added.\n\nPogu kicked against allowing only money bags to determine the direction of elections.\n\nHe also urged the National Assembly to re-visit the issue of electronic transmission of election results.\n\nThe Middle Belt leader also called on INEC to work on their card readers and make them functional for the elections.\n\nThe ACF also endorsed the suggestion by the former military president on the age limit of the next president.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, the spokesman of the forum, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe said the suggestion for the younger generation to take over the leadership of the country should not be discarded.\n\nYawe, who did not comment on Babangida\u2019s corruption claim, noted that he is an experienced military President, having ruled the country for eight years, stressing that whatever he suggests is for the good of the country.\n\nYawe said the ACF holds Babangida in very high esteem and urged Nigerians to take his ideas seriously.\n\n\u201cWe believe his suggestion that Nigerians of a younger generation should take over the presidency is worthwhile. This is the digital age and all over the world, it is the trend.\n\n\u201cIBB is an experienced military politician who ruled this country for eight years as the one and only military president. Additionally, he is one of the patrons of ACF.\n\n\u201cWhatever he suggests for this country we believe is for the good of the country, he is also a man imbued with patriotic ideas.\n\n\u201cWe hold him in ACF in very high esteem and we urge Nigerians to take his ideas seriously\u201d, the ACF spokesman explained.\n\nAfenifere Insists Vision, Political Structure, Key to President\u2019s Performance\n\nMeanwhile, the pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has also supported the idea of a youthful president, citing the case of Awolowo and Akintola, pointing out, however that a president\u2019s performance does not depend on his age but his vision and the country\u2019s political structure.\n\nAfenifere also cited the cases of the former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama of the United States, who mounted the saddle when they were not up to 60 years of age.\n\nThe organisation, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s leadership and governance is not that of the age of the person in charge but rather with the political template on which the country is operating and the kind of vision that the person brings into the office.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTo us in Afenifere, the way Nigeria political template is structured, hardly can any person in a leadership position of the country achieve much.\n\n\u201cThis is why we are clamouring for the immediate restructuring of the country \u2013 a restructured federation in which each constituent unit is in control of most of its affairs, including the resources within its jurisdiction \u2013 a restructured federation that allows institutions to operate freely as enshrined in the laws that established them.\n\n\u201cThe importance of this could be seen in how the attempt by the former President of the United States of America, Mr. Donald Trump, was successfully checked.\n\n\u201cWe have seen situations where relatively young people performed excellently just as there were instances where they failed woefully. The same can be said for people above 60 who held top political posts.\n\n\u201cExamples that can be cited among the first category include our own late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Chief Ladoke Akintola, to mention a few. They were in their 40s and under 50s when they respectively served as premiers of the Western Region. The legacies of the successes they recorded are still there today.\n\n\u201cAs at the time former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama respectively mounted the saddle in America, they were not up to 60 years of age.\n\n\u201cAgain, here in Nigeria, we have young people among the state governors who are trying to excel just as we have those who are a disappointment. Ditto for some among them who are in their 60s or above.\n\n\u201cSo, in a nutshell, it is not the age per se, but the structure and vision as well as the character of the person that determines whether or not he will govern well.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Agom Jarigbe over the incumbent Senator Steve Odey in the Court of Appeal judgment, the PDP is certain to regain power in the state.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the PDP governors would meet in Abuja on Monday to discuss and take a position ahead of their meeting with the PDP BoT committee.\n\nThe BoT committee that will meet the governors would be led by the two-time Senate President, Mark.\n\nOthers in the peace delegation are a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; Senator Ibrahim Mantu; Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyannaya Abaribe; House of Representatives Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu; former deputy speakers of the House of Representatives, Hon. Austin Opara, and Hon. Emeka Ihedioha.\n\nOthers are a former Senate President and Secretary of the PDP BoT, Senator Adolphus Wabara; and another former Senate President, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, among others.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the meeting will take a holistic decision on how to strengthen the party.\n\nTo this end, the governors and the BoT committee are weighing some options to save the party from implosion and strengthen it ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nA major option on the table, according to party sources, is to allow Secondus-led NWC to complete their tenure and also be allowed to re-contest for their positions at the party\u2019s national convention on December 9, 2021\n\nOne of the BoT members told THISDAY that allowing Secondus and his team to re-contest is not only constitutional but will also allow the party to retain experienced and tested hands that will pilot its affairs as it faces the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023.\n\nHe said that if Secondus and all members of his team are stopped from re-contesting, the time will be too short for a new set of leaders to learn the ropes before the general election.\n\nThe source, however, added that if the pressure against Secondus becomes too hot that it could polarise the party ahead of the general election, the next option is that the PDP chairman would be advised to decline to contest.\n\nHe, however, ruled out the possibility of asking him to resign before completing his tenure, adding that such a step would be unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cAs a committee, we support that Secondus and the NWC must complete their four-year tenure because it is a constitutional matter based on the constitution of PDP.\n\n\u201cWe cannot abridge anyone\u2019s constitutional right. If any member of the outgoing NWC wants to re-contest on December 9, including the national chairman, Uche Secondus, we cannot stop anyone, it is their constitutional right,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe source explained that their basic mission is to adopt an option that would restore peace and strengthen the party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cAs elders, we have listened to all sides of the divides and we believe as elders we cannot sit down in the house and allow it to divide against itself. Our intervention will bring back the vibes of the PDP as a leading opposition party ready to take over the affairs of this country. We cannot afford to fail,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked whether the sack of the NWC led by Secondus is a viable option, the source said: \u201cWe have passed that stage. We are in talks on restrategising the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meeting with the governors will not only stop the current crises, but it will also create a better environment to make us far more united and make us stronger as a party,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe PDP BoT had at their last meeting laid to rest the alleged plot to remove Secondus and the NWC, after a heated argument.\n\nAt the meeting, tampers were high to the extent that Governor Nysom Wike angrily asked the BoT members where they were when he rescued the party from the hands of the former chairman, Senator Sheriff.\n\nHe had also queried their intervention now when none of them funded the party.\n\nWike at the meeting told the BoT that Sheriff would have destroyed the PDP, had it not been for his intervention.\n\nThere were two opposing groups \u2013 those plotting the sacking of the NWC led by Secondus and those who wanted them to continue until their tenure ends on December 9.\n\nThe defection of three governors of the party and members of the National Assembly to the APC had worsened the crisis in the main opposition party.\n\nThe situation of the party was becoming worrisome as it lost over 17 senators and members of the PDP in the House of Representatives.\n\nThis development was believed to have diminished the fortunes of the party, ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nSome members believe that the best way to resolve the crisis was to sack the Secondus-led NWC.\n\nThe plot to sack the NWC thickened after seven national deputies of the party tendered their resignation letters.\n\nPDP Now Ready to Recapture Cross River, Says Imoke\n\nMeanwhile, a former Governor of Cross River State, Senator Liyel Imoke, has said that with the victory of Hon. Agom Jarigbe over the incumbent Senator Steve Odey in the Court of Appeal judgment, the PDP is certain to regain power in the state.\n\nIn a statement he issued yesterday in Abuja, Imoke commended the supporters of the Cross River PDP as the party held rallies across the 196 political wards and 18 local government areas in the state.\n\nImoke explained that the role of PDP supporters in Cross River remains very strategic and critical as Nigerians look forward to the party to rescue the country from the shackles and enclaves of poverty, insecurity, unemployment, and disunity.\n\nHe stressed the need for the Cross River PDP to remain united and prepared to put up a common front and agenda as the dynamics of politics changed within the state.\n\nHe maintained that over the last 20 years, Cross River State and its people have remained faithful to the PDP, helping to foster a united and prosperous state between 1999 and 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*NNPC targets 130,000bpd in Dangote\u2019s brand new refinery for $2.7bn\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAs the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) targets to acquire 20 per cent stake, translating to 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) capacity from the brand new 650,000 bpd Dangote Refinery for $2.7 billion, Hollyfrontier is acquiring 97-year-old 115,000 bpd refinery from Sinclair Oil for $2.6 billion.\n\nThe deal signed by HollyFrontier and its affiliate, Holly Energy Partners (HEP), to acquire almost all of Sinclair Oil\u2019s refining, renewable diesel, and logistics assets for $2.6 billion, is therefore, not similar to the planned acquisition of the 20 per cent stake in Dangote Refinery by the NNPC, a top official of the corporation told THISDAY last night.\n\nThis is coming as the NNPC has lost roughly N9.181 billion to shutdowns, mostly as a result of host community workers and contractors\u2019 protests in the Niger Delta, a review of reports on its activities from January to July this year, has shown.\n\nNNPC and Dangote\u2019s refinery deal caused outrage earlier yesterday, especially on social media, with a section of Nigerians comparing it with HollyFrontier\u2019s business agreement with Sinclair.\n\nThey argued that if HollyFrontier could buy the 678,000 barrels per day facility for $2.6 billion, there was no business sense in NNPC acquiring 20 per cent of Dangote refinery\u2019s 650, 000 for $2.7 billion.\n\nBut a top NNPC source said that people were erroneously interpreting the deal to mean that HollyFrontier is buying 678, 000 bpd refining capacity from Sinclair for $2.6 billion.\n\nThe source explained that it is the combined business: HollyFrontier and Sinclair, that will have the refining capacity of 678, 000 bpd after the acquisition.\n\nThe source further disclosed that HollyFrontier already has refineries, and is only adding Sinclair\u2019s two refineries, with a combined capacity of 115, 000 bpd to its portfolio.\n\nOut of this 115,000 bpd capacity, the first refinery with a capacity of 85,000 bpd was built in 1924, that is 97 years ago, while the second refinery with a capacity of 30,000 bpd, was built in 1992.\n\n\u201cSo, only two refineries are being purchased. As can be seen from Sinclair Oil\u2019s website, one has a capacity of 85, 000 bpd and was built in 1924, the other has a capacity of 30, 000 bpd and was built in 1992,\u201d explained the NNPC source, who spoke in confidence.\n\nAccordingly to the source, a refinery with 50 per cent petrol yield and zero per cent Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO) is way more valuable than a refinery with say 30 per cent petrol and 20 per cent LPFO.\n\n\u201cThis is simply because PMS (petrol) is way more valuable than LPFO,\u201d it noted.\n\nAccording to the NNPC top source, a new refinery with 95 per cent availability is way more valuable than an old refinery with say 85 per cent availability, noting that this is simply because the new refinery will be making money in many more days in a year.\n\n\u201cIn addition, every manufacturing plant has fixed costs; so, a small refinery will have higher fixed costs per barrel and therefore lower profitability,\u201d the source stressed.\n\nThe Dangote refinery, with a single crude oil distillation unit, when completed, around mid-next year will be the largest single-train refinery in the world.\n\nCorporation Loses N9.1bn to Community, Workers\u2019 Protests\n\nIn another development, the NNPC has lost roughly N9.181 billion to shutdowns, mostly as a result of host community workers and contractors\u2019 protests in the Niger Delta, a review of reports on its activities from January to July this year has shown.\n\nPublic demonstrations due to alleged negligence of the host oil communities where oil companies operate have been a major cause of disruptions to the national oil company\u2019s operations in the region, which produces Nigeria\u2019s and gas resources.\n\nThe NNPC maintains a Joint Venture (JV) relationship with oil companies in the Niger Delta, with such shutdowns causing huge losses to both the national oil company and its partners.\n\nIn July, NNPC\u2019s total losses hit N1.644 billion due to such disruptions, while JV cost recovery was $147 million or about N56.6 billion when converted with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) exchange rate at the time.\n\nGovernment priority projects cost $40.5 million, about N20 billion, while export crude oil was N4.48 billion and Nigeria LNG feedstock was N13.8 billion, whereas feedstock gas arrears stood at N1.5 billion.\n\nFor its June operations, the NNPC lost N1.109 billion in terms of lost products as a result of shutdowns, whereas export crude volume was 2.7 million barrels, valued at N69.3 billion or $181.1 million, going by the CBN\u2019s N382.80 to a dollar exchange rate at the time.\n\nIn May, total products losses were worth N961.3 million, a huge difference of about N680 million from the succeeding month.\n\nStill, in May, government priority projects gulped N15.8 billion while export crude oil stood at N723.8 million and export gas was N6.09 billion, as NLNG feedstock gas recorded during the month stood at N20 billion.\n\nIn the preceding month of April, product losses due to shutdowns stood at N1.639 billion, export crude was N35.7 billion and export gas was worth N10.1 billion.\n\nSimilarly, in March, product losses recorded, according to the national oil company, hit N1.618 billion, while export crude oil remained N30.9 million, an equivalent of N11.7 billion, given an exchange rate of N378.88.\n\nIn the same vein, February figures showed that the NNPC export crude oil was N9.2 billion, while Nigeria LNG feedstock gas was worth N15.904 billion and 6 million barrels of crude were lost to shutdowns, resulting in about N1.41 billion.\n\nFor its January operations, the national oil company forfeited 2 million barrels to shutdowns, due to host community issues, generator failures, maintenance, sabotage, among others, standing at a loss of about N800 million, going by the N380 exchange rate.\n\nMost of the losses were due to the activities of disgruntled community workers and contractors who had issues to sort out with the oil companies. For instance, according to NNPC data in March, SPDC declared force majeure in January, due to the shutdown of Trans Forcados Pipeline (TFP) as a result of community issues over outstanding payments.\n\nIn April, it was reported that Addax production into Brass was curtailed due to workers strike, while Seplat shut in 43, 000 barrels of oil due to third-party interference.\n\nIts May report indicated that Pan Ocean shut down production due to workers\u2019 action, same with Jisike, which was abandoned as a result of industrial action by petroleum workers.\n\nAdditionally, in July, NNPC announced that Eroton production was shut down as it was vandalised, coupled with what it described as community disturbance. In the same month, Seplat Jisike\u2019s low stock was shut in due to the Addax contract personnel strike.\n\nIn June, Batan station was shut down due to unpaid community workers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 salaries, the same way that Kokori station was closed due to the same problem.\n\nAlso, Aiteo shut down some flow stations due to community issues around the same time, the NNPC data stated, while Jones Creek station completely went down due to unpaid salaries of surveillance contractors.\n\nSimilarly, in April, the Egwa flow station came down due to community agitations, leading to a loss of 36, 000 barrels, while Olomoro and Uzere suffered the same fate due to agitations by community workers and unpaid contract staff salaries.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell had recently begun massive divestment from its onshore and shallow water assets, saying its long-term business plan does not align with its activities in the area, with recent information revealing that it plans to completely sell off one of its subsidiaries, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Wants next President to be versed in economics, able to talk to the people\n\n*Says military overstrained in war against terrorists\n\nAhamefula Ogbu\n\nFormer military President, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida has described his regime as a saint, when compared to the level of corruption being witnessed today in the country under a democratic government, and further denied the notion that he popularised corruption in Nigeria.\n\nBabangida, who spoke in an exclusive interview on Arise News Channel yesterday from his Minna Hilltop Mansion, also wants the next Nigerian president to be an acceptable person who has contacts across the country, and given the peculiarities in our economy, should be well versed in economic matters, and be in his 60s in terms of age.\n\nAnswering directly on the allegation that he popularised corruption, Babangida, who was head of state between 1985 and 1993, said: \u201cWell, you can\u2019t compare it with the fact on the ground now. From what I read, from analysis, I think we are saints when compared to what is happening under a democratic dispensation.\n\n\u201cI sacked a governor for misappropriating less than N313, 000; today billions are there in the streets. Those who have stolen billions are in courts, and are now parading themselves on the streets. So, who is better in fighting corruption?\u201d\n\nOn the kind of President Nigeria deserves in 2023, Babangida ruled out former vice president, Atiku Abubakar and a former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, because they would be in their 70s by the next election.\n\nAlthough IBB, as Babangida is fondly called, did not in any way mention their names as ineligible for the nation\u2019s number one seat, he however suggested that individuals in their 60s should be the focus of Nigerians as potential presidential candidates in 2023.\n\nBy the next general election in 2023, Atiku, who is 75 this year, would be 77, while Tinubu, who marked an official 68th birthday in March, would have turned 70 years.\n\nSpecifically on the importance of leadership in nation-building and where he thought the likes of Atiku and Tinubu no longer fit the bill, IBB said: \u201cIf you get a good leadership that links with the people and tries to talk with the people; not talking on top of the people, then we would be okay.\n\n\u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country, has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very verse in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties.\u201d\n\nBut when asked if the person could emerge victorious in the 2023 presidential election, the Minna-born former military leader said, \u201cI believe so, if we can get him.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on whether or not he still believed in the future of Nigeria, IBB, who turns 80 on August 17, 2021, said: \u201cI do believe in the future of Nigeria, but Nigerians don\u2019t believe in the future of their country. They created and they destroyed.\u201d\n\nReiterating his belief in the future of Nigeria and urging Nigerians to remain patriotic, Babangida, who claimed to feeling good as he was about to turn 80 years, with gratitude to God for sparing his life, advised Nigerians to go for the person that has what it takes to transform the country when the time comes.\n\nHe also stated that the need to avoid a bloody coup, which would have set the country back several decades, informed the annulment of the 1993 Presidential election presumed to have been won by late Moshood Kashimowu Abiola.\n\nBabangida said: \u201cYou want me to be honest with you? If it materialised, there would have been a coup which would have been violent, that\u2019s all I can confirm. It didn\u2019t happen thanks to the engineering and Maradonic way we handled you guys in the society; but that could have given room for more instability in the country.\u201d\n\nProdded further on whether the sentiment was among the military or cut across civilian population, he said, \u201cBoth. The military, they can do it because they have the weapons to do it but the other society members will agitate.\u201d\n\nOn insecurity, he admitted that the military needed to be better equipped, trained and offered improved leadership, adding that \u201cthey are not overwhelmed but overstretched\u201d because of the expansive areas of coverage arising from spread in insecurity.\n\nBabangida regretted that the stultified system of things in the country was due to what he described as tyranny of the elites who had made no efforts to harness the positive qualities naturally embedded in the multi-ethnic composition of the country.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians are too intelligent, resourceful and hardworking not to be able to pull the country back from the brinks, but regretted that poor leadership had been the bane which had divested the nation of a rallying point.\n\nWhile proffering solution to the myriad problems of the country, he pulled his weight behind resource control but warned that some people who either misunderstood the working principles of the proposition would call for the head of whoever propounds such.\n\nApparently not backing zoning and power shift, he was insistent that unless the country wanted to introduce its own whims and caprices in the practice of democracy, there was need for politicians to allow the principles of democracy, as globally practiced, to choose its leadership, insisting that it would be done now or in the future.\n\nHe argued that with time, people with the finest qualities of leadership, that had popular appeal, would emerge no matter what part of the country such would come from which would be immaterial once things start working fine.\n\nTo him, the economy was being overregulated as he called for freeing it, while arguing that production and export would be the twin redeeming principles for the sliding Naira, pointing out that Nigerians had the capacity to achieve it.\n\nHe denied being anti-media, claiming that he libralised it, leading to the birth of many private media, both print and electronic. He further dismissed as silly, trying to muscle the press as it would be an exercise in futility.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fear the media, I libralised it, you don\u2019t forget. Today, you have private televisions, private newspapers and so on, so I have no fear of the media; I believe they are an essential part of the society and they should play the role for the society. So, I have no fear of the media whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\nOn moves to muscle the media, he pointed out: \u201cThe media and the public will not allow that to happen and it is even silly to start trying clipping them. I said Nigerians are very wonderful people, you cannot intimidate them.\u201d\n\nAn ebullient Babangida described the relationship between him and President Buhari, whom he had a hand in his overthrow, as normal and cordial and accused the media of manufacturing a bad relationship between them, adding, \u201cOur relationship is still very good and I am happy we relate good but the seeming bad relationship was the creation of your people the media.\u201d\n\nAppearing unfazed about the agitation for secession he said, \u201cWell, my thoughts are: it is always good to agitate but because there is this belief that this country should be one, when they make the noise, they will find out that it won\u2019t get support because Nigerians don\u2019t generally believe on anything that will disturb their peace of mind.\u201d\n\nOn restructuring, he said it had as many meaning as the number of people speaking on it, adding that there was no general consensus on what it was and how to go about it but opined that it could start with allowing the people at the grassroots to determine and have more participation in how their affairs were run.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We archived some of them here, here, and here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police officer was appointed to quite some applause on and off social media.\n\nBeyond news reports, multiple biographies on the internet stated that Disu \u201cwas born in Southwest Nigeria on 17 April, 1960\u201d.\n\nAll the posts which seemed to have quite a number of similarities did not attribute their assertions to any clear source. They have since raised conversations as to why the DCP is yet to be retired from the police force.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs Disu 61 years old and due for retirement?\n\nThe claim that Disu was born on April 17, 1960, simply implies that Disu is currently 61 years, three months, and 21 days old as of Monday, August 9, 2021. According to the newly amended Police Act, signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari in September 2020, the retirement age of a Nigerian police officer is 60.\n\nIn cases where the officer has been in service for 35 year before he or she is 60, the officer will have to retire before their 60th birthday.\n\nIn the case of former IGP Mohammed Adamu, CSOs called for his retirement as soon as he turned 60. President Muhammadu Buhari insisted that Adamu could stay on till 2023, but the president eventually bowed to the law by replacing the IGP.\n\nTo get clarifications on the matter, TheCable called Disu to speak about the issues surrounding his age and retirement, but the calls were not answered nor returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrank Mba, the Police Force public relations officers (FPRO), however, told TheCable that the widely shared claims that Disu was born in 1960 are false and should be disregarded.\n\n\u201cThe records are there, and there is absolutely no need for the controversies. I can affirm that DCP Tunji Disu was born on the 13th of April, 1966 according to the police records,\u201d Mba told TheCable by phone.\n\nTheCable also obtained a record of senior officers currently in the employ of the Nigerian Police Force. The records show that Disu was born in 1966 and only became 55 years old in April 2021.\n\nAccording to documents seen by TheCable, the new head of the Police IRT is not due for retirement until April 2026.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisu joined the force on June 18, 1992, and would not have served for 35 years by the time he is due for retirement in 2026 \u2014 except there is an amendment to the Police Act that necessitates extension beyond the age of 60.\n\nThe DCP was commander of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in Lagos State between 2015 to 2020.

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It also plans to train and connect them with their dream jobs and funding.\n\nKepple Africa and Timon Capital led the round, with investments from Paul Kokoricha \u2014 ACA Managing Partner \u2014 and Tokyo-based UNITED Inc.\n\nAdditionally, it has raised a $25 million student loan financing facility. The funding was made possible by a partnership between the financier, Sterling Bank, and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe startup claims to operate as an intersection of edtech, fintech, and the future of work. It specialises in software and mobile application development, website creation, UX design, and product marketing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 2018 by Chika Nwobi (CEO), Decagon trains and connects engineers to work remotely with local and international companies.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Nwobi said that tech giants like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have established engineering offices in Nigeria. Decagon helps companies unable to afford such offices to reach top talent willing to work as remote engineers.\n\nThe startup runs a six-month paid software engineering programme that costs $4,000.\n\nHowever, if the trainees cannot afford the programme, student loan financing will cover the cost. Students who choose this option are expected to repay approximately $6,000 over three years.\n\nThis allows the company to offer a Pay-After-Learning plan that includes laptops, housing, Internet, meal allowance, and a stipend. According to the company, no upfront payment is required.\n\nDecagon claims to be the first in Nigeria to provide students with such merit-based loan financing. It also claims to have accepted 440 candidates from a pool of 80,000 applicants for its programme.\n\nNwobi stated that the company has a 100% placement rate for its trainees, a 100% loan repayment rate, and a 410% salary increment made by its software engineers after placement.\n\nThe IT company plans to address the global underrepresentation of black people in the tech space, beginning with Nigeria. It also wants to promote gender inclusion by increasing female participation in its cohorts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe funding will also be used to scale the company\u2019s efforts in edtech, fintech, and the future of work.\n\nReacting to Nwobi\u2019s claim that Decagon, a tech talent catalyst, is sustainable and growing at a rate of 500% per year, Timon Capital Partner, Chris Muscarella, said they are excited to collaborate with Decagon to identify and connect with vetted engineering talent in Africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Africa has gradually become home to exciting innovations. Startups, raising capital in billions, are birthing disruptive models across sectors, and global tech giants are extending their tentacles to the untapped markets in the continent.\n\nSeamless connectivity is essential to help businesses and individuals reap the rewards of the disruptions happening across the continent. Still, the lack of the required infrastructure to effect this has caused slower growth in Africa.\n\nAs of March 2021, Africa had a 37.42% average Internet penetration with wide gaps between juggernauts like Kenya at 85% and smaller countries like Eritrea at 6.9%.\n\nA map showing Internet penetration rates in Africa. Hover your mouse on each country map to see the numbers\n\nIn the early 2000s, Africa\u2019s policymakers made significant strides to tackle this issue, but the game changed in 2009 with the launch of the MainOne cable on the West African coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPropelled by CEO Funke Opeke\u2019s passion for connecting Africa to the Internet, MainOne\u2019s feat initiated a boost to Internet speeds that seemingly aided the proliferation of startups and tech-enabled businesses in Nigeria, one of Africa\u2019s most developed tech ecosystems.\n\nRecognising another apparent gap, the company subsequently launched a series of data centre facilities, through its subsidiary, MDXi, in Lagos, Nigeria, to support the myriad of businesses popping up in the nation\u2019s commercial capital.\n\nMainOne is not resting on its laurels, as MDXi announced its data centre facility expansion to Appolonia City in Greater Accra, Ghana.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, data centres are facilities that house computer systems and other components like telecommunications and storage systems.\n\nLike fibre optic cables, and base transceiver stations (telecom masts), data centres are a critical part of the global Internet infrastructure.\n\nThese centres process large amounts of data and host websites, manage emails, and even help instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram run effectively. Data centres are grouped in tiers, with tier 1 being the simplest and Tier 4 being the most advanced.\n\nA 2020 researchandmarkets.com report titled Data Center Market in Africa \u2013 Industry Outlook and Forecast 2021-2026 reveals that Africa has invested up to $2 billion in data centres and will reach $5 billion by 2026.\n\nThe report argues that the rise in data traffic caused by COVID-19 will further increase African businesses and governments\u2019 demand for data centres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, few African countries are cloud-ready, considering constraints from a lack of inland and submarine fibre and power availability.\n\nResearchandmarkets.com states that economic heavyweights like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, and Ethiopia will witness significant growth in data centre activities. Still, several countries with those constraints could miss out on this growth.\n\nSo what\u2019s the attraction in Ghana?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainOne\u2019s data centre launch in Ghana\n\nMainOne\u2019s past initiatives suggest launching its data centre in Ghana as a natural progression that aligns with its connectivity ambitions.\n\nIn 2019, the company launched its second data centre \u2014 the first outside Nigeria \u2014 in Ivory Coast, one of West Africa\u2019s major economic hubs. Through this move, MainOne solidified its intention to oil the engine of Ivory Coast\u2019s digital economy.\n\nIn an exhaustive chat with Techpoint Africa in July 2020, Funke Opeke hinted that MainOne would be expanding its data centre footprint to Shagamu, Ogun State \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s second most industrialised state \u2014 and other West African countries.\n\nTrue to her words, MainOne has seemingly set its sights on Ghana.\n\nBacked by a large population, a vast economy, and increasing digitisation, Nigeria has grabbed the major headlines for West Africa\u2019s tech-related activities.\n\nHowever, past events also suggest that African tech companies planning to expand nearly always have Ghana in their sights. Recent examples include Nigeria\u2019s GIG Logistics and Cars45, and Kenya\u2019s Quickbus.\n\nWhy?\n\nGhana is West Africa\u2019s second-largest economy, and about 57% (17.6 million) of its 31 million population are below the age of 25, while over 14 million out of 18 million adults are literate. The country is home to startups like mPharma, Jetstream, Bace Group, OZ\u00c9 , and Nvoicia.\n\nIn 2019, Google launched its 5th Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab in Accra, Ghana and in 2021, Twitter surprisingly chose Ghana to launch its first African office.\n\nBesides, the Ghanaian government recently started introducing forward-thinking digital projects.\n\nFollowing the pandemic\u2019s onset, in July 2020, it began building a digital template for elections using the African Union\u2019s proprietary technology \u2014 the PanaBIOS online platform.Seven months later, in February 2021, it piloted a regulatory innovation sandbox for financial services companies.\n\nAs recently as June 2021, it commenced West Africa\u2019s first digital census.\n\nSuch digital activity requires fast and reliable Internet access, which is only possible with the presence of basic and advanced telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Ghana\u2019s Internet space look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Speedtest\u2019s global Internet index, Ghana currently has the fastest fixed broadband speeds in Africa at 51.93 Mbps, ahead of South Africa (47 Mbps) and Egypt (42 Mbps).\n\nThe Speedtest Global Index is a service owned by Ookla, a US-based Internet analytics company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana has the fastest broadband speeds in West Africa. It, alongside Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal, lead the region by a wide margin.\n\nHowever, just 0.3% of Ghana\u2019s population has access to fixed broadband services, hinting at low adoption.\n\nFor mobile Internet, the numbers are slightly different. Internet World Stats reveals that, in December 2020, Ghana had a 46.5% mobile Internet penetration rate. While this is higher than the continental average of 37.42%, it falls behind 27 other African countries.\n\nAs of January 2021, Ghana reportedly has 15.7 million registered mobile Internet users. It, however, only has a mobile Internet speed of 13.8 Mbps.\n\nWhile Internet penetration has been increasing, Ghana\u2019s 79th and 132nd positions globally for fixed broadband and mobile Internet show there\u2019s significant room for improvement. Like other African countries, infrastructure remains a major challenge.\n\nHow Africa has improved its Internet speeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA glut of Internet cables in Africa. Source:\n\nDespite immense growth in recent years, several Africans still don\u2019t have access to the Internet. The continent has the slowest Internet speeds and the highest costs relative to income. This gap has presented opportunities and challenges.\n\nSince MainOne\u2019s cable launch, other submarine cables have landed in Africa to give it a combined capacity of 100 terabits, and upcoming initiatives from Google and Facebook could add 280 terabits. Still, cables are only one layer as several other challenges plague African countries.\n\nCountries like Nigeria and Kenya have taken it a step further by improving the usage of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).\n\nPer the Internet Exchange Society, websites load slowly in Africa since several of them have servers outside the continent. Encouragingly, local IXPs resolve this problem by lowering the cost and latency of accessing content from foreign websites.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2020, Nigeria and Kenya have localised 70% of Internet traffic through local IXPs, which has helped them save a combined $46 million. Other African countries have seemingly not witnessed as much success.\n\nCould MainOne push Ghana even further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nSince Ghana decentralised its telecom sector in the late 90s, MTN, Vodafone, and Airtel have provided healthy competition to drive Internet adoption.\n\nHowever, MainOne plans to take this a step further. The newly launched data centre will offer open access connectivity options to Ghana\u2019s leading telecom operators and direct access to the MainOne cable and other submarine cable systems.\n\nIt also offers access to Internet exchanges like the GIX (Ghana), IXPN (Nigeria), LINX (London), DE-CIX (Frankfurt/Lisbon), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Internet Exchange (CIVIX), and the West Africa Internet Exchange (WAF-IX).\n\n\u201cThis creates shorter routes for internet traffic with direct access to content providers, which enables better internet resilience, reduced latency, and improved customer experience for internet users in Ghana,\u201d MainOne says.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ghana could well be on its way to localising Internet traffic, boosting its speeds, and saving millions of dollars in the process.\n\nEven more business benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosting Internet speeds affects individuals and businesses in Ghana, but the MDXi\u2019s other features shoot its business value up a notch.\n\nIt reportedly features private data centre suites, precision cooling, and enterprise-grade 24\u00d77 multi-level security and video surveillance. It also has safety and fire suppression systems with multiple redundancies built into the power, cooling, and security infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to eliminate the challenges businesses face with setting up IT infrastructure in-house, by presenting a shared Data Center model, which optimises cost, and improves performance and efficiency.\u201d\n\nMainOne reveals that enterprises, government agencies, multinationals, and startups can now subscribe to colocation or cloud services, which allow them to focus on their core businesses.\n\nAfricanus Mensah, Chairman, MainOne Ghana, believes that the data centre will impact Ghana\u2019s business growth and human capital development. He believes the facility will \u201cexpand the frontiers of the digital revolution and transformation in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MDXi Appolonia Data Center will contribute to the growth of the local economy by providing jobs, enhancing capacity development, and serving more businesses in Ghana as the region continues to grow its digital economy.\u201d\n\nThe company reveals that as Ghana\u2019s digital economy keeps growing, the data centre facility will contribute to its growth by creating jobs and enhancing capacity development.\n\nWhile MainOne\u2019s data centre could offer several benefits for businesses and individuals in Ghana, this is only one part of the puzzle. Factors like ease of doing business, terrestrial Internet infrastructure, and a skilled workforce will prove a solid foundation for Ghana\u2019s digital economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Website Writer, Narrator, tech, business and policy analyst.

Source TechCrunch\n\nNigerian digital freight company, MVX, has raised a $1.3 million seed round to scale its operations, hire staff, and improve its technology.\n\nWho participated in the round? Kepple Africa Ventures, The Continent Venture Partners, Founders Factory, Launch Africa Ventures, and Oak Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy MVX? Per Techcrunch, Tonye Membere-Otaji, CEO and Founder of MVX, was fascinated by the lack of an online marketplace for vessels while working in the maritime industry in 2016.\n\nHowever, he couldn\u2019t launch because it was challenging to find the right partner and team. But, in 2019, he established MVX with Tobi Amusan (CTO) after raising a $100,000 pre-seed round.\n\nBecause its business model centred around offering a support vessel booking platform that linked vessel chartering requests, MVX was previously referred to as MVXchange.\n\nHowever, this changed in 2020 because of the uncertainty of oil prices and the economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nThe freight company launched MVXtransit, a digital freight booking platform that helped cargo owners find deals on moving containers. And in April 2021, it launched MVXpay, a finance and payment solution to provide trade finance for freight operators.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? The two products are now rolled into MVX. Also, the startup plans to make freight shipping and trade finance easier for African businesses by bringing booking and deployment processes online.\n\nThe startup claims it has expanded beyond Nigeria and that merchants from the West African country and Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, and Rwanda can use its platform to move freight in and out of their countries.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Ghana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Dignited\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has launched Tingg in Ghana. Tingg is a digital payments network that allows businesses and their customers to accept and make payments easily.\n\nThis announcement is coming after Cellulant was granted a Payment Services Provider (PSP) licence by the Central Bank of Ghana (CBG).\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that Cellulant is now one of the PSPs supported by the Bank of Ghana to provide digital payment solutions throughout the country.\n\nAlso, the PSP licence allows Cellulant to aggregate merchant services and payments for banks, institutions, and the general public, process financial services, acquire merchants, and build PoS systems.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more. The licence permits establishing a third-party payment gateway, and a marketplace for fully regulated financial service providers. It also allows merchant acquisition and aggregation, the printing and display of EMV cards, and the limited usage of closed-loop virtual cards.\n\nWhy the licence? The licence is required under the Payment Services Act 2019, which requires any fintech or digital payments company to be licenced by the Bank of Ghana before operating in the nation.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the requirements.\n\nAccording to Cellulant, Tingg helps businesses to digitise their payments using different options.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will enable consumers\u2019 merchants to pay for products and services using regionally appropriate payment options.\n\nRevio raises over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African billing startup, Revio, has raised more than $1 million in a seed round. International venture development firm, The Delta, led the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Brent Maropis (CEO) and Louis Buys (Co-founder), Revio is dedicated to assisting startups, particularly those in the Software as a Service (SaaS) space, get the most out of their billing subscriptions.\n\nAccording to Buys, the company improves client loyalty and makes it easy to avoid unsuccessful payments and customer loss. Essentially, it enables organisations to communicate with customers in real-time through the intelligent use of machine learning and analytics.\n\nRevio claims it supports all currencies and integrates with the African payments startup, Flutterwave, to allow its SaaS clients to sell their products to all African customers.\n\nExpansion plans?

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has hailed the Senator representing Edo South Senatorial District, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, for his role in his re-election.\n\nThe governor made the remarks at a reception in celebration of Senator Urhoghide\u2019s 66th birthday anniversary in Benin City.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cFor me, he is more than a brother. I am in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the governor of Edo State today largely because of his efforts and persuasion.\n\n\u201cWhen I was going through those challenges in the other political party, the senator and the Senator representing Edo Central Senatorial District, Senator Clifford Ordia approached me and said to me, my brother, don\u2019t worry, when you are ready, we have a platform for you. Just let us know, when you are ready, we will bring you in.\n\n\u201cSenator Urhoghide said to me, because of you, I am not going to contest. People have been approaching me to contest. I want you to come and take this ticket and once you take this ticket, I will work for you.\u201d\n\nHe described the celebrant as strategic in leading his reelection campaign in Edo South, adding, \u201cThat campaign was historic because we were in every ward and that singular effort changed the politics of Edo and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in our history, every local government in Edo South came together and voted as one. And that is not attributed solely to me. In fact, the person who made it happen is our very own Senator Urhoghide.\u201d\n\nEarlier, during a thanksgiving service, the governor urged politicians to learn from the life of Senator Urhoghide whose perseverance gave him electoral victory in 2015 after 23 years of trying to make headway in politics.\n\n\u201cA lesson to learn from Sen. Urhoghide is that of perseverance. Remember he just told us that for 23 years he kept trying in politics and continued to fail but he never gave up until God answered him. When your desires are genuine God will see you through.\n\n\u201cOnce you pass through a road and make promises, always remember to go back and fulfill the promises you made. We thank God that we have a senator who is responsive to the call of his people\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Urhoghide commended the governor for his exceptional leadership in the state and the party, adding that PDP under his leadership is wearing a new shape.\n\n...",

Dr. Augustine O. Akubeze on his tenth year anniversary as an Archbishop, saluting his contributions to the development of Edo State and Nigeria.\n\nObaseki, who at the weekend led top government officials and other dignitaries to a book launch in commemoration of the archbishop\u2019s tenth year anniversary, described Akubeze as one who is readily available to provide solutions and support to the government.\n\nThe governor was joined by his deputy, Rt. Hon. Comr. Philip Shaibu; Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie, former Governor of Cross Rivers State, Donald Duke; Chief of Staff to Edo State Governor, Osaigbovo Iyoha and the Esama of Benin, Chief Gabriel Igbinedion.\n\nOthers are the Senator representing Edo South Senatorial District, Sen. Matthew Urhoghide; member Representing Oredo Federal Constituency, Hon. Ogbeide Ihama and a former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie Oyegun, among others.\n\nUnveiling the book titled, \u201cExercise of Prophetic Ministry, selected Homilies and Addresses of Archbishop Akubeze,\u201d the governor hailed the Archbishop for his sacrifice and selfless service to God and humanity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor me, it is a rare privilege as a non-catholic to have been invited to come and unveil this seminar works. I didn\u2019t hesitate when I was told to come and unveil this book, because for me, it\u2019s a privilege to honour someone who has been one of my pillars.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of the occasion, Chief John Odigie Oyegun, told us more about who His Grace is and what he represents to us as Christians and a leader in this country. But personally, he means even more, because you all know what we have gone through politically.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cBut more importantly, as a community, you may not understand the depth of the decay and rot in our society. But as a leader, he is always looking for a solution; one person who has always been there to provide solutions and support for us in government has been His Grace.\n\n\u201cWhen we were thinking through how to deal with our educational system, we called on him and asked him to send somebody to come and help us in thinking through the ideas.\n\nSame thing happened with reforms in healthcare and charity, among others. In fact, he has made himself that unspoken head in our government.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, unveiling this book today is a privilege; not just because it offers me an opportunity to say thank you in a very modest manner, but also to identify with the reason for which he has written this book. He needs to raise a resource to continue to pursue those charitable causes to which he has dedicated his life,\u201d the governor added.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, the Chairman of the book launch, Chief John Odigie Oyegun, described Akubeze as a simple clergyman with a kind heart, who has made worshipping God appealing to the people.\n\n...",

          "text": "Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers over the weekend, abducted a Swiss expatriate attached to one of Olabel Farms in Ogun State, Andred Beita, after a gun duel with the police along Ibese \u2013 Itori road in the state.\n\nBeita was kidnapped alongside his driver simply identified as Ifeanyi while returning from the farm on Saturday evening in an ambush, which also resulted in the death of one of the staff of the farm.\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered that police escort attached to the Swiss expatriate and those of the chairman of the farm, Ola Bello, had engaged the gunmen in a gun battle, when the attackers ambushed them while returning from the farm in Ilaro, headquarters of Yewa South local government area of the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA source in Ilaro told LEADERSHIP that the convoy of the farm chairman, led by one Inspector Hassan Kumode, ran into the kidnappers and courageously engaged the kidnappers in gun fight.\n\nIt was further gathered that two staff of the company, Ishaya Ibrahim and Michael Kujore, were hit by stray bullets during the gun battle and were rushed to different hospitals in Sagamu for treatment.\n\nOne of the staff hit by a stray bullet, Kujore who was rushed to State Hospital in Sagamu was, however, later confirmed dead as a result of the gunshot injuries he sustained during the incident, while Ishaya was still responding to treatment as of the time of filing this report.\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the incident told LEADERSHIP that two of the kidnappers were killed, while one AK47 was recovered.\n\n\u201cI am aware. The victims went to their farm around Ibese and on their way coming, the gunmen attacked them. But the policemen with them displayed a rare courageous bravery. They killed two of the kidnappers and recovered one big AK47 loaded with nine ammunitions from the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cIn the process, two of the people were injured and were taken to hospitals. One died while receiving treatment.\n\n\u201cThe hoodlums went away with a Swiss national and one other person. The policemen did not want to increase the collateral damage because if they continue to engage them, they had already kidnapped two of them and the police didn\u2019t want to lose the victims, so we are still on their trail making efforts to ensure that those people are rescued unhurt,\u201d Oyeyemi stated.",

          "text": "The Senate Sunday declared it has not recommended any of the states being demanded by some Nigerians in the report to be submitted by the Constitution Review Committee.\n\nSenate\u2019s declaration is sequel to a media report (not in Blueprint) that 20 new additional states were being recommended by the upper legislative chamber out of the many requested by different groups across the country.\n\nThe requests were contained in the memoranda submitted to the Senate Committee on Constitution Review headed by Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo \u2013 Agege.\n\nIn a rebuttal issued and signed by Senate\u2019s spokesman, Dr Ajibola Basiru (APC Osun Central), the lawmakers said none of the series of states as demanded in the memoranda submitted, was recommended for creation in the committee\u2019s report.\n\nBasiru, who is a member of the committee, also said going by the provisions of Section 8 of the 1999 Constitution, the committee cannot make any recommendation for state creation without following the laid down procedure which starts with referendum where two thirds of people residing in an area where a new state is to be created, must vote yes.\n\nThe referendum, he further explained, would be conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and also supported by 2/3 of members of the National Assembly and at least 24 out of the 36 States Houses of Assembly.\n\nIn the statement titled: \u201cSenate Committee did not propose creation of 20 New States,\u201d the lawmakers said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a media report that the Senate Committee on Review of 1999 Constitution has proposed the creation of additional 20 States.\n\n\u201cThe report is a gross misrepresentation of the decision of the committee on the request for creation of more states. Far from recommending creation of any state, the Senate Committee, while acknowledging receipts of several Bills proposing creation of new states, decided that it is not in a position to recommend or propose the creation of any state unless there is compliance with the provisions of Section 8 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic as amended.\n\n\u201cFor ease of reference, Section 8 of the Constitution provides:\n\nAn Act of the National Assembly for the purpose of creating a new State shall only be passed if \u2013\n\n(a) a request, supported by at least two-thirds majority of members (representing the area demanding the creation of the new State) in each of the following, namely \u2013\n\n(i) the Senate and the House of Representatives, (ii) the House of Assembly in respect of the area, and\n\n(iii) the local government councils in respect of the area, is received by the National Assembly;\n\n\u201c(b) a proposal for the creation of the State is thereafter approved in a referendum by at least two-thirds majority of the people of the area where the demand for creation of the State originated;\n\n\u201c(c) the result of the referendum is then approved by a simple majority of all the States of the Federation supported by a simple majority of members of the Houses of Assembly; and (d) the proposal is approved by a resolution passed by two-thirds majority of members of each House of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, the Senate Committee is not in a position to propose creation of any state as reported. Rather the committee decided to refer the requests received to Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure compliance with Section 8 of the Constitution by conducting referendum in the areas if the requests supported by at least two-thirds majority of members (representing the area demanding the creation of the new State) in the Senate, the House of Representatives and the House of Assembly in the area.\n\n\u201cThe above clarifications are imperative to set the record straight.\u201d\n\nDuring the submission of memoranda, committees of the two chambers on Constitution Review received states creation agitations like Adada from Enugu, Oke \u2013 Ogun from Oyo , Okura from Kogi , Gurara from Kaduna, Okun from Kogi , Katagum from Bauchi states among several others.\n\n...Frowns at N132m NBET expenses\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has ordered the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET), to refund the sum of N132, 066, 948.00million expended on Drivers Uniforms, Overseas training etc, into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) .Senate\u2019s directive was sequel to queries issued to that effect by the Auditor General of the Federation in the 2015 Audit Report.\n\nThe N132million as stated in the queries, sustained by Senate committee on public accounts and adopted by the upper chamber, comprised N95.320million spent on overseas training for staff which never took place , N34.163mllion payments for unverifiable services and N2.583million spent for production of uniforms for outsourced drivers.\n\nThe queries read: \u201cPayment of the sum of N34, 163,948.00million without internal audit checking for unverifiable services in violation of extant Financial Regulations.\n\n\u201cPayment of N2, 583,000.00 million to a contractor for production of Uniform of outsourced drivers who supposed to be kitted by their firm and not NBET.\n\n\u201cExpenditure of the sum of N95, 320,000.00million for overseas training of Staff against Presidential directive and without documentary evidence.\u201d\n\nAdopting the report as recommended by the committee, the Senate directed NBET to remit the purported N132million expenses into the CRV.\n\nSpecifically, on the N2.583million expended on uniforms for outsourced drivers, the Senate said: \u201cProvision of Uniform to outsourced drivers is illegal. The contractor is supposed to provide uniforms for his staff and not NBET.\n\n\u201cNBET should therefore refund the sum of N2.583million to government coffers and evidence of refund submitted to the Senate Public Accounts Committee in accordance with Financial Regulations 3102, 3103 and 3115.\n\n\u201cN95million purportedly expended on overseas training for Staff between October and November 2014 which was in violation of Presidential directive of February 2014 and which has no documentary evidence, should be refunded into the CRF.\n\n\u201cUnpre \u2013 audited payment of N34.163 million for unverifiable services should also be refunded into the CRF.\n\n\u201cThe Accounting Officer, who authorised the payment, be removed from his /her schedule according to Rule 3115 of the Financial Regulation for contravening the provision of Financial Regulation 1705 and evidence of compliance should be forwarded to the Auditor General as well as the Senate Public Accounts Committee.\u201d\n\n",

This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe marathon, moved north to Sapporo to avoid Tokyo\u2019s summer heat, was one of the few events to allow spectators.\n\nSunday\u2019s closing ceremony will take place at a largely vacant Olympic Stadium, rounding off an extraordinary Games conducted mostly without live spectators for a worldwide audience of billions.\n\nFears of a major outbreak proved unfounded in the mostly vaccinated Olympic contingent and 430 cases were picked up during the Games, including 32 in the Olympic Village.\n\nBut athletes had the added pressure of strict \u2018bubble\u2019 conditions including orders to wear masks unless competing, training, eating or sleeping.\n\nVictory celebrations have been low-key, with lonely laps of honour and sparsely attended medal ceremonies. But the emotions of the competitors have been on full view.\n\n\u2013 Trans athletes, \u2018twisties\u2019 \u2013\n\nSuperstar gymnast Simone Biles provided the most jaw-dropping moment when she abruptly pulled out of competition over a bout of the \u201ctwisties\u201d, a disorientating mental block.\n\nBiles, widely acknowledged as the greatest gymnast in history, recovered sufficiently to return for the final event, the beam, claiming a redemptive bronze.\n\nWeightlifter Laurel Hubbard became the first openly transgender woman to compete at the Games and Canada\u2019s Quinn became the first openly transgender Olympic medallist, with gold in the women\u2019s football.\n\nIn other highlights, the US men\u2019s team won their fourth consecutive men\u2019s basketball crown and US swimmer Caeleb Dressel assumed the mantle of Michael Phelps with five gold medals in the pool.\n\nAmong the final events on Sunday, Canadian cyclist Kelsey Mitchell took gold in the women\u2019s sprint while Jason Kenny won the men\u2019s keirin to become the first Briton to win seven Olympic titles.\n\nThe Americans started the day two golds behind China but the women\u2019s basketball and volleyball titles and US track cyclist Jennifer Valente\u2019s omnium victory put them top of the final table.\n\nUzbekistan\u2019s Bakhodir Jalolov beat US fighter Richard Torrez in the super-heavyweight boxing final, while Britain\u2019s Lauren Price and Ireland\u2019s Kellie Harrington also boxed their way to gold.\n\nThe Olympic flag will now pass to 2024 hosts Paris.

Research also shows that two-thirds of Nigerian victims of trafficking are victims of domestic human trafficking. The tools developed are a first step in providing a voice to the victims as it allows them to share their experiences, help service providers facilitate referral pathways, and provide comprehensive protection services.\u201d\n\nAlso, the IOM Nigerian Chief of Mission, Franz Celestin was quoted in the statement as saying that, \u201cThis initiative will strengthen the identification process and ensure that more VoTs are referred to the right services.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the profiling exercise would strengthen the understanding of Trafficking in Persons in Nigeria and inform the development of national policies and future programming.\n\nAccording to him, data collected from screening activities will be disaggregated by sex, age, forms of exploitation, and other relevant indicators. The aim of the identification tools is to provide first-line officials with harmonized tools to effectively identify and refer victims of human trafficking in line with the National Referral Mechanism.\n\nHe explained that the process for the development of the tools commenced in November 2020 and received reviews from relevant stakeholders to ensure that the tools are comprehensive and stand the test of time.\n\nCelestin said the tools will be piloted in Edo, Lagos, and Delta states where NAPTIP officials would be trained on how to use them, adding that screening and reporting tools will be rolled out along the Nigerian border at points of entry and exit.\n\n\u201cVictims of human trafficking need to be protected to ensure they live a life of integrity devoid of any form of dehumanization and degrading treatment\u201d the statement quoted NAPTIP Director-General Sen. Basheer Garba Mohammed.\n\nNigerian Pilot gathered that since 2017, IOM Nigeria has provided support to 21,771 returnees of which 2,302 are VOTs.\n\nThe long-term goal is to ensure these tools are integrated into an information management system, IMS, that all stakeholders can easily access.",

          "title": "Tokyo Douses Olympic Flame, IOC President Says Games a Success Despite Pandemic",
          "text": "The Tokyo Olympics, christened with \u201c2020\u201d but held in mid-2021 after being interrupted for a year by the coronavirus, glided to their conclusion in a COVID-emptied stadium Sunday night as an often surreal mixed bag for Japan and for the world.\n\nA rollicking closing ceremony with the theme \u201cWorlds We Share\u201d \u2014 an optimistic but ironic notion at this human moment \u2014 featured everything from stunt bikes to intricate light shows as it tried to convey a \u201ccelebratory and liberating atmosphere\u201d for athletes after a tense two weeks. It pivoted to a live feed from Paris, host of the 2024 Summer Games. And with that, the strangest Olympic Games on record closed their books for good.\n\nHeld in the middle of a resurging pandemic, rejected by many Japanese and plagued by months of administrative problems, these Games presented logistical and medical obstacles like no other, offered up serious conversations about mental health \u2014 and, when it came to sport, delivered both triumphs and a few surprising shortfalls.\n\nFrom the outset, expectations were middling at best, apocalyptic at worst. Even Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, said he\u2019d worried that these could \u201cbecome the Olympic Games without a soul.\u201d But, he said, \u201cwhat we have seen here is totally different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were faster, you went higher, you were stronger because we all stood together \u2014 in solidarity,\u201d Bach told gathered Olympians as he closed the Games. \u201cThis was even more remarkable given the many challenges you had to face because of the pandemic. In these difficult times, you give the world the most precious of gifts: hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time since the pandemic began,\u201d he said, \u201cthe entire world came together.\u201d\n\nHe overstated it a bit. At these Games, even the word \u201ctogether\u201d was fraught. Spectators were kept at bay. A patchwork of rules kept athletes masked and apart for much of medal ceremonies, yet saw them swapping bodily fluids in some venues. That was less about being remiss than about being real: Risks that could be mitigated were, but at the same time events had to go on.\n\nAthletes\u2019 perseverance became a central story. Mental health claimed bandwidth as never before, and athletes revealed their stories and struggles in vulnerable, sometimes excruciating fashion.\n\nJapan\u2019s fourth Olympics, held 57 years after the 1964 Games reintroduced the country after its World War II defeat, represented a planet trying to come together at a moment in history when disease and circumstance and politics had splintered it apart.\n\nThe closing ceremony Sunday reflected that \u2014 and, at times, nudged the proceedings toward a sci-fi flavor. As athletes stood in the arena for the final pomp, digital scoreboards at either end of the stadium featured what organizers called a \u201cfan video matrix,\u201d a Zoom call-like screen of videos uploaded by spectators showing themselves cheering at home.\n\nEven the parade of athletes carrying national flags \u2014 thousands of Olympians, masked and unmasked, clustering together before fanning out into the world again \u2014 was affected. Volunteers carried some flags into the stadium, presumably because of rules requiring athletes to leave the country shortly after their events concluded.\n\nIn front of such formidable backdrops, athletic excellence burst through, from the Games\u2019 first gold medal (China\u2019s Yang Qian in the 10-meter air rifle on July 24) to their last (Serbia defeating Greece in men\u2019s water polo on Sunday afternoon).\n\nAmong the highlights: Allyson Felix taking a U.S.-record 11th medal in track, then stepping away from the Olympic stage. American quintuple gold medalist Caeleb Dressel\u2019s astounding performance in the pool. The emergence of surfing,skateboarding and sport climbing as popular, and viable, Olympic sports. Host country Japan\u2019s medal haul \u2014 58, its most ever.\n\nAny Olympics is a microcosm of the world it reflects. These Games\u2019 runup, and the two weeks of the Games themselves, featured tens of thousands of spit-in-a-vial COVID tests for athletes, staff, journalists and visitors. That produced barely more than 400 positives, a far cry from the rest of non-Olympic bubble Japan, where surges in positive cases provoked the government to declare increasingly widespread states of emergency.\n\nAnd, of course, there was that other microcosm of human life that the Games revealed \u2014 the reckoning with mental and emotional health, and the pressure put on top-tier athletes to compete hard and succeed at almost any cost. The interruption of that pressurized narrative, led by the struggles of gymnast Simone Biles and tennis player Naomi Osaka in particular, permeated these Games and ignited the spark of an athlete-driven conversation about stress, tolerance and inclusivity that everyone expects to continue.\n\nWhile Tokyo is handing off the Summer Games baton to Paris for 2024, the delay has effectively crammed two Olympics together. The next Winter Games convenes in just six months in another major Asian metropolis \u2014 Beijing, Japan\u2019s rival in East Asia and home to a much more authoritarian government that is expected to administer its Games in a more draconian and restrictive way, virus or no virus.\n\nBeyond that, Paris organizers promised Sunday to \u201ctake sport out of its traditional spaces\u201d and \u201cconnect with new audiences in new ways\u201d in 2024 \u2014 presuming, of course, the absence of a protracted pandemic. They went live from the closing to excited groups of fans clustered near the Eiffel Tower, a crowded public scene that Tokyo didn\u2019t allow.\n\nIn recent weeks, lots of people \u2014 officials, athletes, journalists \u2014 have been chewing over how these Tokyo Games will be remembered. That\u2019s up to history, of course, but there are hints.\n\nThe runup was messy and disputed. The days of competition were fraught but, in general, without incident other than sporting milestones. Even a moderate earthquake rumbled through and was quickly forgotten. Scattered protests of the Games \u2014 including one outside the stadium Sunday night \u2014 reflected a portion of Japan\u2019s sentiment, though certainly not all. The expenses \u2014 upwards of $15 billion \u2014 were colossal and will echo in Tokyo long after athletes are gone.\n\nWhat are the Olympic Games supposed to be? A politics-free sporting event, as the IOC insists? A bonanza for sponsors and broadcasters? One small step toward world peace? Despite all the yarn-spinning, their identity remains up in the air and that fundamental question remains.\n\nBut as the cauldron was snuffed out Sunday night after the Pandemic Olympics concluded, it\u2019s easy to argue that Tokyo can take its place as a Games that didn\u2019t fail \u2014 as one that overcame a lot to even happen at all. And as vaccines roll out, variants emerge and lockdowns re-emerge, another city and government \u2014 Beijing, the Chinese capital \u2014 must grapple with the very same question.\n\nIn the meantime, the program for Tokyo\u2019s closing ceremony, outlining its \u201cWorlds We Share\u201d theme, captured the effect of the pandemic and the virtual worlds and separation anxiety to which it has given birth.\n\n\u201cWe are in a new normal, and this edition of the Games were a different affair,\u201d it said. \u201cEven if we cannot be together, we can share the same moment. And that is something that we will never forget.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP",

          "text": "A tearful Lionel Messi has said his next move is not confirmed at an emotional farewell news conference Sunday, but ESPN sources say a deal with Paris Saint-Germain has already been agreed.\n\nA tearful Lionel Messi has said his next move is not confirmed at an emotional farewell news conference Sunday, but ESPN sources say a deal with Paris Saint-Germain has already been agreed.\n\nThe Argentina forward said he had received several calls from clubs since the news broke, confirming PSG\u2019s interest, and multiple sources have told ESPN that he has already agreed to sign for the Ligue 1 side.\n\nSources added that Messi is expected to travel to Paris on Sunday before completing a medical in the coming days and signing a two-year deal with the option for a third season. He could be presented at an event at the Eiffel Tower in the coming days.\n\n\u201c[PSG] is one possibility,\u201d Messi said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing closed at the moment, but we\u2019re talking about a lot of things. After Barca\u2019s statement, a lot of clubs showed an interest. There\u2019s nothing final but, of course, there are talks.\u201d\n\nAsked about the prospect of joining a rival, he added: \u201cThere is no doubt that I will go to a team that will compete with Barca. I didn\u2019t want to leave, but I have to. And I want to keep winning. That\u2019s my mentality. I want to win.\u201d\n\nMessi said a photograph of him with several PSG players in Ibiza last week, including Neymar and Angel Di Maria, was just a coincidence, although he said they did joke about him moving to Paris.\n\nInstead, in an event at the auditorium to the side of Camp Nou attended by the board, the first-team squad and his family, Messi insisted he had done everything possible to stay at Barca.\n\n\u201cI am really sad because I didn\u2019t want to leave because this is the club I love,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this. I have never lied; I have always been honest and up front. Last year I wanted to leave; this year I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s why I am so sad.\n\n\u201cAs the president [Joan Laporta] has explained, the club has debt [problems]. It\u2019s not possible. Why keep drawing it out if it\u2019s nearly impossible? The talks stopped as Barca did not want to go on, they knew LaLiga would not let it happen, it was impossible.\n\n\u201cI did everything I could to stay and it wasn\u2019t possible. I offered to reduce my salary by 50% and Barca didn\u2019t ask for anything else. They didn\u2019t ask for another 30%; that\u2019s a lie.\u201d\n\nMessi, 34, had agreed to a new five-year contract with Barca, but that would have meant the club\u2019s wage bill stood at 110% of their revenue. Their spending cap with LaLiga has dropped from over \u20ac600 million in 2019-20 to an expected \u20ac200m for the coming season, making it impossible to register Messi\u2019s new deal, even with a big pay cut. His previous terms included a base salary of around \u20ac70m gross without bonuses.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, this is the most difficult time of my career,\u201d Messi said. \u201cI have had a lot of tough moments, but the other day, [learning I was] not going back to training, not going to be on the pitch again, that this is the end with this club, yes, it\u2019s one of the most difficult moments for me.\n\n\u201cThis year is different from last year [when I wanted to leave]. My family and I were convinced we were going to stay, that\u2019s what we wanted more than anything. We are at home here. Now I have to say goodbye to all of this. I have been here since I was 13. After 21 years, I am leaving with my wife, with my three little Catalan-Argentine kids. I can\u2019t say that we won\u2019t come back in some way because this is our home and I promised my children we would.\u201d\n\nMessi lamented that he had been unable to say goodbye on the pitch with the fans chanting his name, bemoaning that his last 18 months at the club have been played in empty stadiums due to the pandemic.\n\nWith 672 goals in 778 games for Barca, Messi leaves as both the club\u2019s record appearance maker and top goal scorer. However, he says no one person comes before the club and assured supporters there is a squad built for success even without him.\n\n\u201cBarca are one of the best teams in the world, they have an amazing side,\u201d he said. \u201cMore players will come, not just now but in the future. Players come and go. As Laporta said, no one person comes before the club. At first, it will be weird, but people will get used to it.\u201d\n\nESPN",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated last year\u2019s dividend of $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria.\n\nThe company reported the payout recently during the release of preliminary financial results for six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nMTN had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company had said in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75 per cent to 85 per cent drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75 per cent stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked N600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in the country.\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1 percent year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to N790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6 per cent to N417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8per cent year-on-year to 55.6 million.

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo held a meeting with President of Benin Republic, Patrice Talon in the first week of August to seek soft landing for an agitator for Yoruba Nation, Chief Adeniyi Adeyemo (a.k.a Sunday Igboho), a report by TheCable has revealed.\n\nApart from Obasanjo\u2019s intervention, THISDAY checks revealed that prominent leaders of Yoruba have been lobbying the international community and British to prevail on the Government of Benin Republic to reject Nigeria\u2019s request to extradite the embattled agitator.\n\nThese moves coincided with a revelation by Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu penultimate Saturday that the people of South-west states \u201care working behind the scenes concerning Igboho\u2019s apprehension in the Republic of Benin.\u201d\n\nCiting anonymous diplomatic sources, TheCable reported that Obasanjo was in Benin Republic in the first week of August 2021 and held a meeting with a Beninese leader on the travail of Igboho.\n\nThe report claimed that the former president travelled to Zanzibar, an island in Tanzania, on August 1 and re-routed to the Francophone country on his way back to Nigeria.\n\nThe report, further, claimed: \u201cHe was said to have travelled to Benin Republic in the guise of condoling with Nicephore Soglo who recently lost his wife \u2013 Roseline Soglo. Roseline died on July 25 at the age of 87 in Cotonou. Soglo was president of the Benin Republic from 1991 to 1996.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, one of the diplomatic sources revealed that Obasanjo travelled to Zanzibar on August 1. Perhaps to conceal his trip, he re-routed to the Benin Republic. He was to condole with former President Soglo who recently lost his wife.\n\nAnother source cited by TheCable said: \u201cHe also met with Patrice Talon. The purpose of the meeting was to seek soft-landing for Sunday Igboho. He is asking the Beninese authorities to grant the embattled agitator asylum and not to return him to Nigeria. The former president intervened on the request of some south-west leaders.\u201d\n\nA prominent socio-cultural leader in the South-west last night confirmed the veracity of the report, claiming that the leaders of Yoruba had held a meeting with Obasanjo and pleaded with him to use his diplomatic channels to secure Igboho asylum in the Benin Republic.\n\nThe leader, who spoke anonymously with THISDAY, revealed that prominent leaders of Yoruba had been lobbying the international community to prevail on the Republic of Benin not to honour Nigeria\u2019s request to extradite Igboho.\n\nThe leader said: \u201cWe have lobbied contacts in french government. We have also lobbied British Government. However, France has much influence on the Benin Republic. There is every indication that the Benin Republic will not extradite Igboho.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, they will not extradite him because we pointed the attention of France to the judicial process in Nigeria. Under the present administration, the judicial process in Nigeria has been compromised.\n\n\u201cIt is not wise to expose Igboho to face the compromised judicial process in a country where the government does not obey court orders. Most times, the court dances to the tune of the government.\n\n\u201cEven where the courts have been courageous, the government has ignored them. Nigeria does not have a regime that upholds the rules of democracy and transparent judicial process. And the process cannot be trusted.\u201d\n\nThe leader pointed out that it was not difficult to convince the diplomatic community, especially Britain, France and the United States, given the antecedence of President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration\u2019s disregard to the rule of law and judicial decisions.\n\nThe leader explained that the representatives of these countries \u201ctoo are living witnesses to the socio-political dynamics in Nigeria. We had interface with all embassies in Nigeria. We told them our own stand.\n\n\u201cWe also told them the consequences for them. But they always look at the national interest before they make their decisions. We believe they cannot wait for Nigeria to explode before they act. We believe strongly that they will do whatever they can to salvage Nigeria,\u201d the South-west leader said.\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) had invaded Igboho\u2019s residence in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, killing two persons and arresting 12 supporters.\n\nSubsequently, the operatives of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) had arrested Igboho at the Cadj\u00e8houn Airport in Cotonou while attempting to flee to Germany after the operatives of the DSS raided his residence.\n\nIgboho\u2019s apprehension had ignited legal and diplomatic fireworks to secure the release of the embattled agitator from the custody of the Benin Republic.\n\nWith the intense lobby to secure Igboho\u2019s release, Sanwo-Olu had disclosed that the governors of South-west \u201care working behind the scenes concerning the apprehension and prosecution of Igboho at the Republic of Benin.\u201d\n\nThe governor had said although most of the strategies are not being made public, there are ongoing plans by southwest governors to address the situation.\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",
