          "title": "N4tn petrol subsidy\u2019ll kill economy, MAN, LCCI, others warn Buhari",
          "text": "The National Assembly on Thursday passed amendments to the 2022 Appropriation Act and 2022 Fiscal Framework, which raised the deficit in the Federal Government\u2019s budget by N965.42bn, to N7.35tn; and subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (petrol) by N442.72bn, from N3.557tn to N4tn.\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives considered and adopted reports on the amendment bills based on the request by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.).\n\nThe federal parliament approved a new oil price benchmark of $73 per barrel, a new oil production volume of 1.600 million per day, and a PMS subsidy of N4tn.\n\nHowever, in swift reactions, economists and the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria warned the President that the N4tn subsidy would worsen the economic situation of the country and adversely affect individuals and companies.\n\nBut the organised labour commended the Federal Government.\n\nThey spoke in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, also passed by the National Assembly was an additional provision of N182.45bn to cater for the needs of the Nigeria Police Force as well as provision of N76.13bn for domestic debt service, with net reductions in statutory transfers by N66.07bn.\n\nThe statutory transfers\u2019 adjustments are: the NDDC by N13.46bn, from N102.78bn to N89.32bn; NEDC by N6.30bn, from N48.08bn to N41.78bn; UBEC by N23.16bn, from N112.29bn to N89.13bn; Basic Health Care Fund by N11.58bn, from N56.14bn to N44.56bn; and NASENI by N11.58bn, from N56.14bn to N44.56bn.\n\nThe Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, Aliyu Betara, while addressing journalists after the passage, said, \u201cThe President brought an amendment to the 2022 Appropriation Act, which the House passed today. We passed the budget with an increment to police salaries. We increased the police budget by N182bn. That is the only difference between the Appropriation Act and the amendment bill. It\u2019s just the police increment. The budget now is N17.319,704,091.19.\u201d\n\nBetara, who was accompanied by the Deputy Chairman, Iduma Igariwey, also disclosed that the lawmakers made some adjustments to projects in the budget based on the request by the President.\n\nThe President had written two letters to the National Assembly to call for amendments to the budget and the fiscal framework for 2022.\n\nIn the first letter transmitted in February, Buhari had presented the 2022 Appropriation Act (Amendment) Bill to the National Assembly, seeking the approval of the federal parliament for a supplementary budget with estimates totalling N150,032,091,096.\n\nThe President also sought approval for another N2.557tn to extend the regime\u2019s subsidy payment on petrol.\n\nIn the second letter, Buhari said the adjustments to the 2022 Fiscal Framework included an increase in the project oil price benchmark by $11 per barrel, from $62 per barrel to $73 per barrel; a reduction in the projected oil production volume by 283,000 barrels per day, from 1.883 million barrels per day to 1.600 million barrels per day; an increase in the estimated provision for PMS subsidy for 2022 by N442.72bn, from N3.557tn to N4tn.\n\nOther adjustments include a cut in the provision for federally-funded upstream projects being implemented by N200bn from N352.80bn to N152.80bn; an increase in the projection for Federal Government independent revenue by N400bn; and an additional provision of N182.45bn to cater for the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nBuhari listed statutory transfers\u2019 adjustments as follows: NDDC by N13.46bn, from N102.78bn to N89.32bn; NEDC by N6.30bn, from N48.08bn to N41.78bn; UBEC by N23.16bn, from N112.29bn to N89.13bn; Basic Health Care Fund by N11.58bn, from N56.14bn to N44.56bn; and NASENI by N11.58bn, from N56.14bn to N44.56bn.\n\nHe said, \u201cTotal budget deficit is projected to increase by N965.42bn to N7.35tn, representing 3.99 per cent of GDP. The incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\u201d\n\nSenators lament oil theft, dwindling revenue, budget deficit\n\nThe Senate, just as the House, passed the amendments as requested by the President.\n\nThe Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, Senator Olamilekan Adeola, in his presentation at the Committee of Supply, said the additional deficit of N965.42bn, which raised the total in the 2022 budget to N7.35tn, represented 3.99 per cent of Gross Domestic Products.\n\nAdeola also stated that \u201cthe incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\u201d\n\nHowever, lawmakers took turns to blame the country\u2019s economic downturn on crude oil theft.\n\nIn his remarks, Senator Olubunmi Adetunmbi stated the Federal Government, especially security agencies, owed it as a duty to stop the stealing of the nation\u2019s commonwealth.\n\nAdetunmbi decried that at a time when most countries were reaping from the increase in global oil prices due to the Russian-Ukrainian crisis, Nigeria had been left out owing to its inability to meet its OPEC quota.\n\nThe Majority Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, while corroborating Adetunmbi, said Nigeria should be worried over what was currently happening to it.\n\nAbdullahi blamed the decline in the economy on the failure of security agencies to protect oil assets. He decried the increasing cases of oil theft despite the huge resources allocated to the military and paramilitary agencies.\n\nSenators Gabriel Suswam and Betty Apiafi urged the Senate not to hastily approve the President\u2019s request until certain questions had been answered.\n\nWhile rounding off the debates, Lawan called on the Federal Government to take \u201cradical\u201d steps towards stopping the theft of crude oil by economic saboteurs.\n\nThe Senate President also called for a stop to the importation of refined petroleum products into the country, so as to cut down on expenditures incurred in the process, as well as to maximize profits from crude oil sales.\n\nLawan constituted a 13-member ad hoc committee to investigate oil theft in Nigeria and its impact on petroleum production and oil revenues.\n\nThe committee has Senator Bassey Akpan as Chairman and Senators Yusuf Yusuf, Solomon Adeola, Kabiru Gaya, Adamu Aliero, George Sekibo and Gabriel Suswam, Kashim Shettima, Aliyu Sabi-Abdullahi, Ali Ndume, Stella Oduah, Sani Musa and Ibrahim Gobir as members. The committee is to report back within one month.\n\nMeanwhile, the House has passed repealed the Customs and Excise Management Act 1958 which deals with new taxes on carbonated drinks, telecom\n\nN4tn petrol subsidy\u2019ll kill economy, Buhari warned\n\nThe President of MAN, Mansur Ahmed, said petrol subsidy was a yoke on the Nigerian economy, arguing that placing much importance on petrol over issues of health and infrastructure was misdirected.\n\n\u201cWe believe that subsidy is a yoke on our economy. First of all, the social sector is critical. Maybe people feel that fuel is so important, but if you compare it with health, education and security, you will notice it is nowhere near them.\u201d\n\nHe explained that perhaps, there were people benefitting from the subsidy, which makes it difficult to end.\n\n\u201cThere are inefficiencies and leakages, but that is because of subsidy. Government should invest that money in infrastructure, health and education. The money will make bigger impact on the economy when invested in those critical areas, but what impact will subsidy make on the economy and what impact has it made so far?\u201d he asked.\n\nAn economist and Chief Executive Officer of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, Dr Muda Yusuf, warned that the new approvals by the legislature would adversely affect the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the approvals will lead to higher debt service, increase in fiscal deficit, increasing inflationary pressure and even naira depreciation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWith this development, our macroeconomic outlook in the near term should be a cause for worry. The outcomes of these approvals include increased borrowing, higher debt service, surge in fiscal deficit, heightening inflationary pressure and a risk of further depreciation in the naira exchange rate.\u201d\n\nHe added that there would be increase in recurrent expenditure as debt service and fuel subsidy will gulp a significant part of government\u2019s revenue.\n\nHe also urged Nigerians to be prepared for more challenging times, as necessary reforms for economic recovery and growth may not happen soon.\n\nMuda said, \u201cInfrastructure budget implementation may be negatively impacted as recurrent expenditure increases sharply. The combination of debt service and fuel subsidy is likely to consume the entire revenue.\n\n\u201cThe implications are that we should brace up for more challenging times. There is no quick fix. Major reforms necessary to return the economy to a recovery and growth path are unlikely to happen in the near term. This is coupled with the distractions that come with electioneering and transition periods.\u201d\n\nA former President, Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Dr. Sam Nzekwe, stated that the government was increasing its projected subsidy spending when it could not tell the actual volume of petrol consumed in Nigeria.\n\nHe stated that the funds being channelled for fuel subsidy should be used to solve the concerns in other sectors of the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat is the quarrel we keep having with the government because for this fuel subsidy, nobody has actually known the actual quantity of fuel that we consume in Nigeria.\n\nHe stated, \u201cInstead of cutting down you are increasing. Why are you increasing when you don\u2019t know the actual volume consumed? I know they will say it is because of inflation and some other factors, but we can continue like this.\u201d\n\nNzekwe added, \u201cThis will hit our economy negatively because we have been talking of how to remove subsidy and not to increase it. So this move is not well-thought out. Universities are on strike, they need money and you are increasing fuel subsidy budget, no!\u201d\n\nA professor of Energy Economics at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Uche Nwogwugwu, condemned the N4tn petrol subsidy, saying that it was a tax on consumption.\n\nHe said the amount was enough to subsidise the cost of local refining, noting that channeling Nigeria\u2019s scarce resources to subsidy when issues of funding education, infrastructure and security were on the front burner was a waste of money.\n\n\u201cNobody knows the basis of the N4trn subsidy. We in energy economics say that any subsidy on petroleum is corruption. A lot of development can be done with N4trn and we can develop alternative energy sources of energy and renewable energy with that amount, to rely less on fossil fuel.\u201d\n\nA development economist, Aliyu Iliyas, decried the poor state of the country, urging the Federal Government to eliminate fuel subsidy.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell, the fact remains that the country is in a serious mess as the revenue is very poor; consequently the government has to borrow. However, the government\u2019s borrowing rate is very dangerous.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the oil market now, the price of oil has been increasing for some time now but the country isn\u2019t benefiting from it because we are not producing at home. Unfortunately, as the price of oil continues to rise, so also will our subsidy bail out which causes a series of problem. So the best decision is not to borrow to pay for subsidy but to remove it and focus on revamping refineries in the country, in addition to the Dangote refinery that we are waiting for.\n\n\u201cHowever with the route the government has chosen, it is clear that the economy will suffer and so will the Nigerian people. We should expect inflation to rise in the next few months and development in the country to suffer.\u201d\n\nAfter over 40 years of fuel subsidy, what we have is more hardship \u2013 LCCI\n\nReacting to the development, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry described the decision of the National Assembly to approve more loans for the Federal Government as one that would plunge Nigeria into \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the LCCI Deputy President, Mr Gabriel Idahosa, historical antecedents have shown that fuel subsidy continues to divert a significant fraction of revenue which can be injected into other aspects of the economy for developmental purposes.\n\nHe said, \u201cFuel subsidy already has a negative effect on the economy. What it means is that useful resources that should go into social services like education, healthcare, roads and other common services that everyone should enjoy, are used to subsidise petrol, of which about 30% is actually not consumed in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut the Nigeria Labour Congress lauded the Federal Government for not removing the fuel subsidy as earlier threatened.\n\nThe Chairman of NLC in Ogun State, Emmanuel Bankole, said the action was commendable.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is commendable and shows that the government is responsive and sensitive . But, that has not solved the problem . All our refineries must be made to function.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Haroon-Ishola Balogun\n\nIt\u2019s expected that in this month, everyone of us become conscious of our actions, what we do and what we don\u2019t do; our speech, our gaze, where we go and what we do. It is in this month we step up our ibadah during the day and night. Never in the whole year do we monitor our behaviour as we do in Ramadan.\n\nWe should also know that this is for a period of time, and that is why after two to three weeks, we begin to count down and before we know it, it will be a thing of the past.\n\nIn essence, it has only limited time (it is for only 29 or 30 days) and that is why we should take advantage of it because Allah is offering Janah for it. The gates of hell fire are shut; even the sinners can\u2019t go into it while also the gates of Janah are flung open; becoming only the way for people to go in. What a grea t opportunity!\n\nThe third aspect of it is Allah linking the month with the Quran. Dear brothers, this is the only month mentioned by Allah in the Quran. This emphasises its sanctity. It is the month in which the Quran was sent down.\n\nIbn Abass said in the month of Ramadan, Allah sent down the entire Quran from the the highest heavens to the lowest heavens. He said the whole of the Quran came down from lahul-mahfuz to baitul izam, then the first revelation came in the month. Some scholars say it was a day after lailatul-Qadr.\n\nThe association of the Quran with the month of Ramadan comes before the association of siyam (fasting) with Ramadan. The significance of the two is massive. Just as the Quran is guidance for mankind, fasting is meant for Allah to attain consciousness. The reward is massive but He alone will apply His measure in reward of it. The import of this is that siyam is high before Allah and Allah has raised it among all actions of mankind. Brothers, Allah will take charge in terms of apportioning reward for siyam.\n\nAllah is proud that His servants abandon the two essentials for living \u2013 flood and drink in obedience to Him. He will surely reward it bountifully. So, let\u2019s make this Ramadan the best for ourselves, with the fact that we don\u2019t even know our last. Certainly, there will be one last Ramadan for everyone of us, but who knows which one will be the last? It is better to strive harder and make this one the best in terms of spirituality.",

          "text": "By Haroon-Ishola Balogun\n\nApart from the inner feeling of satisfaction of carrying out the ordinance of Allah that you get when breaking your fast, you also feel happy that you are legible for the blissful abode prepared by Allah as reward for those who carries out His orders.\n\nThe joyful feeling of long night prayer, the spiritual contentment, the joy of exchanging gifts to your brothers, to the needy, to the poor and putting smiles on their faces radiate your inner self and become new.\n\nThe whole exercise is geared towards gaining God\u2019s consciousness. (taqwa),\n\nWe read from one of the authentic Hadith of a dream reported by one of the companions to the Prophet on two friends who accepted Islam the same day, practiced good deeds and even one died as a martayred in the battlefield. The other lived a year longer and observed Ramadan.\n\nThe narrator of the dream reported that he saw the one who died later was given the honour to enter Paradise first before the the one who was martyred. The prophet (PBUH) said it was as a result of fact that the one who died later and enter Paradise first had the opportunity of witnessing another Ramadan and observed it diligently.\n\nBecause of these and many more blessings, It is reported in some narrations that the companions of the prophet (s.a.w.) used to pray for longevity of their lives six months before Ramadan in order to witness Ramadan and to reap the benefits in it. Immediately after the month, they also beseech Allah to accept their ibadaah for six months.

In it there is a night which is better than a thousand months, and whoever is deprived of its goodness is indeed deprived.\u201d Narrated by al-Nasaa\u2019i, 2106; Ahmad, 8769. classed as saheeh.",

I have gone back and I have found out that the oldest living party is the PRP, it still holds those ideals of what Nigeria and democratic practice should be like.\n\n\u201cIt is a party that was started by the people and truly for the people. It is a party that has shown first, as its priority, internal democracy.\n\n\u201cI have come back to PRP to show Nigerians that not too long ago, we did things in the right way and the new entities that have come together nowadays forget that there was Nigeria that did things right.\n\n\u201cI am one that believes in an equal opportunity employer be it employment, be it business, equally in politics and I believe this party represents all of these.\n\n\u201cEverybody should have equal opportunity irrespective of age, religion and ethnicity and that is represented here.\u201d\n\nAbiola who raised concerns over the low participation of youths in politics, said \u201cWe have a youth population that has been caught out of the system, the political process.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I want to do is to disrupt the political process, to disabuse the minds of the youth on godfatherism.\n\n\u201cThe way to do this is to give the true owners of Nigeria, that is, the 18 to 36 years age group that make up over 75 per cent of the population an opportunity for their voice to be heard and their numbers to count.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the party Mr Falalu Bello said \u201cI formally welcome you into our fold.

          "text": "Hoodlums numbering over 30 yesterday disrupted the hearing of a suit on the disputed ward, council and state congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Bayelsa State High Court.\n\nAn official of the court, the claimant, Alex Blackson and his brother, Osom Blackson were injured during the stampede and violence inside the court.\n\nPresiding Judge, Justice Nayai Aganaba, was stoned with plastic bottles by the hoodlums but was taken to safety by his police orderly.\n\nIt was gathered that most of the lawyers in court were also chased out, while those that came with the claimant were brutalised.\n\nThe suit sought the order of the court to set aside the disputed congresses of the APC held last year.\n\nIt was equally gathered that there was shooting at the state secretariat of the APC following the attempts by riot policemen to arrest some chieftains of the party over their alleged involvement in the court invasion.\n\nTwo persons were reportedly arrested.\n\nBut the chairman of the party in the state, Dr Dennis Otiotio- Odoni distanced members from the court fracas.\n\nHe alleged that those involved were suspected supporters of the opposition who were in the courtroom and hanging around the premises.\n\nDescribing the incident as one too many, Eradiri called on the state chapter of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) to wake up from its slumber and protect the temple of justice in Bayelsa.\n\nIt was gathered that thugs loyal to the two factions of the APC clashed in the court when a matter challenging the party\u2019s congresses came up for hearing.\n\nEradiri, a former President, Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) recalled that three similar incidents happened in the past with NBA taking no drastic measures to punish the perpetrators.\n\nHe said the lack of punitive measures had emboldened recalcitrant individuals to visit judges, lawyers and court officials with violence in a bid to settle their political scores.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that Bayelsa among other states in the country is trying to make violence in the temple of justice a norm. The Wednesday incident in my calculation is the fourth in the series of desecration of the temple of justice in our dear state.\n\n\u201cIn each judicial assault, political actors deployed their armed thugs to harass, intimidate and in some cases injure judicial officials as a way of frustrating cases they reasoned would not be in their favour.\n\n\u201cThese disgraceful acts have cast serious dent on the judicial image of the state. In the case of Wednesday, we learnt that gunshots were fired. This is demonic, unacceptable and steps must be taken to avert recurrence\u201d.\n\nEradiri said physical attacks and abuses on courts in Bayelsa had affected the development and practice of the legal profession in the state.",

          "text": "No fewer than 1,500 schoolchildren have been abducted by armed groups since April 2021.\n\nThis disclosure was made by Amnesty International, yesterday, on the eighth anniversary of the abduction of 276 schoolgirls in a government secondary school in Chibok community in Yobe State.\n\nThis came as the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said security challenges have affected the education of 1.3 million children in less than two years. The UN body said since December 2020, 11, 536 schools were closed due to abductions and security issues.\n\nPeter Hawkins, the UNICEF representative in Nigeria, said school abductions and attacks have discouraged children, especially girls, from learning.\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s Nigeria Director, Osai Ojigho, in a report, said the increasingly brazen manner of recent abductions showed that the Nigerian authorities were failing to prevent these crimes from taking place and have not learnt any lessons from the abduction of the Chibok school girls eight years ago, as families of abducted children are left without any hope of reuniting with their loved ones.\n\n\u201cNigerian is failing to protect vulnerable children, by refusing to respond to alerts of impending attacks on schools across the North of the country, the Nigerian authorities have failed to prevent mass abductions of thousands of school children.\n\n\u201cIn all cases, the Nigerian authorities have remained shockingly unwilling to investigate these attacks or to ensure that the perpetrators of these callous crimes face justice. Every fresh attack is followed by further abductions that deprive school children of their right to liberty and leave victims\u2019 families with no hope of accessing justice, truth, or reparations.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian authorities must urgently comply with the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child to which it is a state party. They must take concrete steps to prevent abduction of children and ensure that those suspected of criminal responsibility face justice in fair trials and rescue the hundreds of children who remain in captivity.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cThe recent upsurge in abductions is also leading to prolonged shutdowns of schools. As a result, affected regions have seen a decline in school enrollment and attendance, as well as a rise in child marriage and pregnancies of school-age girls.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cOf the more than 1,500 school children, who have been abducted in Northern Nigeria since the Chibok attack on April 14, 2014, at least 120 students remain in captivity. They are mostly schoolgirls, and their fate remains unknown.\n\n\u201cOf the 276 schoolgirls abducted in Chibok by Boko Haram, 109 are still unaccounted for. Of 102 students, who were kidnapped from the Federal Government College in Birnin Yauri, nine are still being held by their captors. One of the 121 students abducted from Bethel Baptist High School in Kaduna State remains in captivity. Five of the 19 students abducted from Greenfield University were brutally murdered, while one of the 333 students kidnapped in Kankara, was also killed. Five of the 276 students kidnapped in Dapchi were killed, while one student, Leah Sharibu, remains in captivity. Five of the 136 school children kidnapped from Salihu Tanko Islamiya School in Tegina, have also been killed.\n\n\u201cOne returnee, who was interviewed, lamented the stigmatisation she has suffered in her local community after returning. They call us Boko Haram wives and our children are not even allowed to mingle with other kids in the village.\n\n\u201cI am happy to be back home, but it\u2019s been difficult with no financial support. The government promised to help us, but we are still waiting for them. I just want to go back to school and continue with my studies. I wish the government will fulfill their promise to help us.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International in the report interviewed some parents of schoolchildren, who remain in captivity, who described their ordeal as traumatising and frustrating.\n\nAccording to a report, which quoted a mother of some of the Chibok girls still in captivity, said, \u2018We sent our children to school, but they are neither in school nor at home. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to see my daughters again.\n\nThe trauma of not knowing where my children are is silently killing me. I am socially and psychologically degenerating.\n\n\u201cAnother mother said: \u2018It does not appear that the government is on top of the matter, and I am not hopeful that I might reunite with my daughter someday. I\u2019m already getting tired of following up with the authorities. Also, community support and sympathy are declining every day. I\u2019m hopeless! I\u2019m hopeless.\u201d",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu, Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Merit Ibe\n\nThe Senate and the House of Representatives, yesterday, approved the request of President Muhammadu Buhari to earmark N4 trillion for premium motor spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol after they considered reports from their committees on finance.\n\nThe approval was sequel to a request by President Buhari for revision of the 2021 fiscal framework.\n\nHowever, the approval has drawn the ire and comdemnations of some Nigerians and group.\n\nPresident Buhari had written the National Assembly in two separate letters, dated, April 5, requesting approval of N4 trillion for fuel subsidy in the proposed amendment to the 2022 Fiscal Framework.\n\nIn forwarding the request for the revision of the medium term expenditure framework, the president requested the lawmakers to approve an additional N3.557 trillion in addition to the N442.72 billion provided in the 2022 budget for subsidy.\n\nThe lawmakers also approved the reduction in crude oil production quota from 1.8 million barrel per day to 1.6 million barrel per day and a $73 oil price benchmark.\n\nThe two chambers also approved a cut in the provision for federally funded upstream projects being implemented by the Federal Government by about N200 billion from N352.80 billion\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAccording to the letter, the president had said: \u201cAs you are aware, there have been new developments both in the global economy as well as in the domestic economy, which have necessitated the revision of the 2022 Fiscal Framework on which the 2022 budget was based.\n\n\u201cThese developments include spikes in the market price of crude oil, aggravated by the Russian Ukraine war, significantly lower oil production volume due principally to production shut-ins as a result of massive theft of crude oil between the production platforms and the terminals.\n\n\u201cThe decision to suspend the removal of the Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy at a time when high crude oil prices have elevated the subsidy cost has significantly eroded government revenues. There is also the need to make adequate provisions for the recent enhancements of allowances for officers and men of the Nigeria Police to boost their morale as they grapple with heightened security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cFollowing these developments, it has become necessary to adjust the fiscal framework and, accordingly, amend the 2022 Appropriation Act to ensure its successful implementation.\n\n\u201cThe adjustments to the 2022 Fiscal Framework include an increase in the project oil price benchmark by $11 per barrel, from $62 per barrel to $73 per barrel. A reduction in the projected oil production volume by 283,000 barrels per day from 1.883 million barrels per day to 1.600 million barrels per day.\n\n\u201cAn increase in the estimated provision for PMS subsidy for 2022 by N3.557 trillion from N442.72 billion to N4.00 trillion. A cut in the provision for federally-funded upstream projects is being implemented by N200 billion from N352.80 billion to N152.80 billion.\n\n\u201cAn increase in the projection for the Federal Government independent revenue by N400 billion; and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigeria Police.\n\n\u201cBased on the above adjustments, the Federation Account (main pool) revenue for the three tiers of government is projected to decline by N2.418 trillion, while the Federal Government\u2018s share from the account (net of transfer to the Federal Capital Territory and other statutory deductions) is projected to reduce by N1.173 trillion.\n\n\u201cHowever, the amount available to fund the Federal Government budget is projected to decline by N772.91 billion due to the increase in the projection for independent revenue (operating surplus remittance) by N400 billion.\n\n\u201cAggregate expenditure is projected to increase by N192.52 billion, due to increasing in personnel cost by N161.40 billion and other service wide votes by N21.05 billion (for the Nigeria Police), additional domestic debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in statutory transfers by N66.07 billion, as follows: Niger Delta Development Commission by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion: North East Development Commission, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; Universal Basic Education COMMISSION, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion; Basic Health Care Fund by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion.\n\n\u201cTotal budget deficit is projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99 per cent of Gross domestic product. The incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nIn his reaction, Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre and Chairman, Transition Monitoring Group, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani, accused the National Assembly and the executive of colluding to fund corruption, especially when the lawmakers have several times investigated corruption in the fuel subsidy regime and the presidency, describing fuel subsidy as a fraud.\n\nHe also noted that the manner the money for the subsidy was approved lent credence to allegations by Nigerians that the legislature might be colluding with the executive to fleece taxpayers and raise money for the 2023 general election.\n\nPresident of Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, Yerima Shettima, said he was not surprised because the Buhari government has never said anything and stood by it.\n\n\u201cRemember that when they were coming to power, one of the things they used to woo Nigerians was the fight against corruption, fight against insecurity and improvement of the economy but out of everything they promised Nigerians, none has been fulfilled. Instead, the reverse has been the case. Things are even worse than they were when they took over. So, I won\u2019t be surprised if they are saying they are paying such money for subsidy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said what the government action represents is hard days ahead even as he wondered where the government expects to get the money to repay all the loans it has been borrowing.\n\nOn his part, President of the Middle Belt Forum, Bitrus Pogu, said everything about the government is mysterious.\n\n\u201cBefore they came in, Nigerians were buying a litre of fuel for N87 and we all knew what subsidy payment was at that time. They claimed they were going to reduce the fuel pump price, but instead, they jacked it up and because Nigerians had sympathy for them, people didn\u2019t protest; Nigerians took the fuel price increment in good faith.\n\n\u201cDown the line, not only has the cost of pump price increased further, including the unavailability that we are now facing, they are bringing this humongous money to be settled and the National Assembly, for whatever reason, is accepting this kind of thing; it is an unfortunate development for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis government came in and continued to devalue the naira. They met it at N189 to the dollar, but today, a dollar is nearly N600 in the open market. Rather than repair our refineries, they continued importing fuel and a lot of money has been sunk into the maintenance of the refineries that don\u2019t produce fuel; this is unacceptable. The government is supposed to serve the people, not be their enemies. Where are these monies going?\u2019\n\nAlso, National Operations Controller of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mike Osatuyi, warned that the country would be in serious financial crisis in the months ahead because the subsidy figure will keep rising.\n\n\u201cWhen government initially set aside N2 trillion for subsidy, I warned then that the figure will gallop because crude oil prices have been on the upward swing and it has kept rising,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOsatuyi said over 80 per cent of government revenue was being filtered away through debt servicing for both domestic and external debt, subsidy payment and recurrent expenditure with little left for capital expenditure.\n\nHe disclosed the N4 trillion will further deplete our external reserves because the fund is sourced at Central Bank of Nigeria rate and not black market.\n\nChief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE), Muda Yusuf, said: \u201cWith this development, our macro-economic outlook should be a cause for worry. The outcomes of these approvals include increased borrowing, higher debt service, surge in fiscal deficit, heightening inflationary pressure and a risk of further depreciation in the naira exchange rate.\n\nBut, Executive Secretary of Major Oil Marketers Association, Clement Isong, said he empathised with government and warned that there were consequences to every decision taken.\n\nHowever, he noted that the Russian-Ukraine crisis which was unanticipated caused an upward review in the subsidy budget from N2 trillion to N4 trillion.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is a tough decision for any government to make in the circumstances we have found ourselves.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Govt paying deaf ears to killings, Ortom insists\n\n\u2022Alleges plan to hand over seat of govt to bandits\n\n\u2022Plateau killings: Angry lawmakers restate call for state of emergency, demand NSA, defence minister\u2019s sack\n\n\u2022Lament Nigeria a failed state, under siege\n\n\u2022Obi: Killings in Plateau, Benue horrific, unacceptable\n\n\u2022Presidency: Call for Buhari\u2019s resignation, ploy by desperate politicians to get power\n\n\u202211, 536 schools closed since 2020, UNICEF reveals, remembers Chibok girls\u2019 abduction\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu, Kuni Tyessi in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi\n\n\n\nAs Nigerians continue to lament the insecurity ravaging the country, the federal government yesterday blamed the recent attack on a Kaduna-bound train on an unholy alliance between Boko Haram insurgents and rampaging bandits. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed this at the State House, Abuja, while briefing newsmen, along with Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (rtd), at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe government\u2019s latest position came as Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom accused the Buhari administration of pretending not to notice the unremitting killings of innocent Nigerians. Ortom, who spoke during an interview in Makurdi, also alleged plans by the government to yield power to criminal elements.\n\nThat was as members of the House of Representatives, yesterday at plenary, reiterated their call on the federal government to declare a state of emergency on security in Nigeria. Reacting to the recent escalations in insecurity, particularly the killings in Plateau State, the lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd.) and Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd.).\n\nFormer Governor of Anambra State and presidential aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi, stated the recent killing of over 100 people in Plateau State and over 20 persons in Benue State was horrific and unacceptable.\n\nBut the presidency yesterday reacted formally to Tuesday\u2019s call by the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) on Buhari to resign as a result of the worsening security situation in the country. The presidency dubbed the call a ploy by desperate politicians to get power.\n\nThe federal government said, though the security agencies are still working hard to unravel the group behind the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, preliminary report showed that some criminal groups had collaborated to perpetrate the act. It urged Nigerians to also cooperate with government to smoke out the criminals.\n\nBriefing newsmen in Abuja, at the end of the weekly FEC meeting, Magashi and Mohammed assured that the government was on top of the matter.\n\nResponding to a question on whether the government had identified those behind the attack, Magashi said, \u201cHonestly, I think the security chiefs are working hard to unveil those that are involved, and we will tell you very soon those that are carrying out these attacks.\n\n\u201cBoth attacks in Jos and Kaduna, we will come and explain to the public what is really going on and our efforts to ensure that all these activities are stopped once and for all. We are really on top of the situation, we are planning hard and we will get it out as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also, Mohammed said, \u201cWhat is happening now is that there is a kind of an unholy handshake between bandits and Boko Haram insurgents.\n\n\u201cPreliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attacks show that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and the dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the North-east. I can tell you very confidently that the federal government is on the top of this matter.\u201d\n\nThe information minister said the federal government was doing all within its powers to achieve the rescue of the train passengers kidnapped by the terrorists. He said this in response to the 72-hour ultimatum given government by families of victims of the train attack to secure the release of their loved ones or they would take their fate in their hands.\n\nHe submitted that security operatives were working behind the scenes to get the captives released before long, adding that such moves would not be made known to members of the public in order not to jeopardise the steps being taken.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cWhat the federal government is doing won\u2019t be subject matter of a press conference, because we have lives at stake. The various arms of security are working night and day to unravel the mystery surrounding the attack as a whole.\n\n\u201cOn the kidnapped people, what I can assure you is that the respective arms of government actually engaged, as we speak, are working to get those victims released.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural for anybody who is a father or a mother of a kidnapped person to be worried and to be concerned. But at the level of government, we appreciate that and we are leaving no stone unturned, but that we\u2019ll give you specific steps we\u2019re taking, I think it will be counterproductive and not going to aid or help those who are kidnapped or help the security forces who are tracing and ensuring that there\u2019ll be no repeat of such attacks.\u201d\n\nIn his own reaction to the killings in Plateau and Benue states, Obi said, \u201cSuch violence questions government\u2019s responsibility to protect lives and property. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of these wicked acts.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we cannot be insensitive to the on-going bloodletting and targeting of the most vulnerable and helpless in our society. Security measures must be proactive and holistic; more so, in areas close to ungoverned rural and urban communities. Nigeria must cease being a killing field. These numbers are human beings and loved ones of many families.\u201d\n\nPlateau Killings: Angry Lawmakers Restate Call for State of Emergency, Demand Sack of NSA, Defence Minister\n\nThe appeal by members of the House of Representatives followed the amendment of two separate motions of urgent national importance on the recent massacre by terrorists in Plateau and Benue communities, which led to the death of over 100 people and destruction of property.\n\nThe two motions were sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Navy, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi (APC Plateau), Hon. Bem Mzondu (PDP Benue), and Hon. John Dyegh (PDP Benue).\n\nThe lawmakers across party lines took turns to condemn the endless killings, the federal government\u2019s failure to secure lives, and the lackadaisical attitude of security agencies. They demanded that in the best interest of the country and to solve the security crisis,President Muhammadu Buhari should sack the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Babagana Monguno (rtd.) and Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd.).\n\nGagdi, while moving the motion on the terror attack in Kanam and Wase local government areas of Plateau State, prayed that the House should urge the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), to immediately provide relief materials for the victims.\n\nHe also prayed that the House should urge the president to, as a matter of urgency, direct the Minister of Defence, Chief of Defence Staff, Inspector General of Police, and Director General of the State Security Service to initiate a coordinated joint security operation and provide aerial surveillance and support to flush out the terrorists and destroy their camps.\n\nWhile further praying that the House should urge the Inspector General of Police to immediately deploy the Police Mobile Force squadrons to maintain law and order in the affected areas, he asked his colleagues to mandate the Committees on Emergency and Disaster Preparedness; Armed forces (Defence, Army, Navy, Air force); Police; National Security and Intelligence as well as Legislative Compliance to ensure compliance and furnish the House with a weekly report until the insecurity was brought under control.\n\nGagdi said persons responsible for the safety of lives and property in the country must be held accountable.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have governors, we have National Assembly members, who is responsible for the safety, security of lives and property of the people of this country?\n\n\u201cWithout fear of political misrepresentation, it\u2019s Mr. President. We must ask ourselves questions, insecurity issues will never be discussed correctly if you don\u2019t detach political affiliation from it. Is Mr. President aware of what is going on in this country? Before people are killed, one of the operational commandants must be responsible, who allowed that thing to happen?\n\n\u201cWho are the various security agencies that are supposed to protect the lives of the people? Of course, the armed forces.\n\n\u201cWe vote money to these agencies every year and we provide supplementary budgets to them. We must hold someone accountable; there must be someone somewhere who has neglected his responsibility.\u201d\n\nHe said it was either the president had failed to hold accountable heads of the security services or the security agencies had refused to heed distress calls from troubled citizens.\n\n\u201cThis is not acceptable,\u201d Gagdi stated. He added, \u201cWe must hold somebody responsible for failing in the discharge of the duties to Nigeria people.\u201d\n\nOn their part, sponsors of the motion on the terrorist attacks in Mbadwem and Tiortyu communities in Guma and Tiortyu local government areas, Hon. John Dyegh and Hon. Bem Mzondu, lamented that Nigeria was bleeding. They said if those in the executive arm of government could not secure the country, then, they should resign.\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Bamidele Salam (PDP Osun) lamented that information and early warnings were given to the security agencies, but the failed to act.\n\nSalam said, \u201cWe have come to a situation in this country where evil is perpetrated and no one is held accountable for the perpetration. We are the privileged class, we move around with convoys and security men, we are being paid to occupy this position of privilege by the sweat and taxes of some people.\n\n\u201cThe part of this motion that touched me was the reference that there were early warning signals, information given to security agencies about the plans by some terrorists to attack innocent persons and this information were not acted upon by the security agencies.\u201d\n\nHon. Fatuhu Mohammed (APC Katsina) said despite budgetary allocations, security agencies appeared to be unwilling to do their job. Mohammed said in his Daura constituency no security agent was willing to come out and do their job, but they were more interested in money.\n\nDeputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase (APC Plateau), who presided over the plenary session, made reference to a case when a soldier who was supposed to be stationed in Zamfara was given a pass to his Wase community in Plateau and was caught distributing uniforms to bandits.\n\nWase said the security agencies were part of the worsening insecurity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis situation is not about politics, anyone that wants to politicise this is making a huge mistake. In my own community, we had a soldier who was supposed to be in Zamfara, but was given pass for consecutively six months, giving uniform to the bandits.\n\n\u201cTill this moment, he has not been taken to court. I want you to understand the complicity of security agencies in this matter. Why would you give your personnel six months\u2019 pass?\u201d\n\nHon. Lynda Ikpeazu (APC Anambra), in her submission, described Nigeria as a failed state, saying, \u201cNigeria right now is a failed state. What can we do? It is a failed state where you cannot protect your people. We have had cases where information were cast to the security agencies and still these terrorists overcome the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nIn his submission, Chairman, Committee on Police, Hon. Bello Kumo (APC Gombe), wondered why Buhari was still keeping Babagana Monguno and Bashir Magashi as NSA and defence minister, respectively, despite their failure to curb the worsening insecurity.\n\nDeputy Chief Whip, Hon. Nkeiruka Onyejeocha (APC Abia), said the country was under siege, adding that as it stands, no one knows the next community that may be attacked.\n\nOrtom: FG Turning a Blind Eye to Killing of Nigerians\n\nOrtom spoke yesterday in Makurdi during an interview with reporters at the Benue Peoples House, following the attack on two communities in the state where more than 23 persons were killed in their sleep by militia Fulani herdsmen.\u201d He said, \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\n\nSuspected Fulani herdsmen had invaded and killed eight persons in Mbadwem in Guma local government and 16 in Tiortyu, a sprawling settlement in Tarka local government, along Makurdi-Gboko road.\n\nOrtom described the attacks as \u201cunfortunate and the height of impunity.\u201d\n\nHe accused Buhari\u2019s APC government of turning a blind eye and paying lip service to the cries of the Benue people, \u201cAs the herdsmen continue to invade our communities and kill innocent people.\u201d\n\nThe governor recalled how he had alerted Nigerians and the federal government on the murderous activities of the Fulani terrorists for many years, \u201cYet they didn\u2019t believe me. Now, they are gradually taking over every space in the country. We are now sharing our sovereignty with terrorists.\u201d\n\nOrtom alleged that the plan of the herdsmen and their sponsors was to send the people away from their ancestral homes, take over the lands, and cause confusion in the country so that the forthcoming elections would not hold.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI suspect that very soon, some states will be completely taken over by these Fulani men called bandits. I suspect that very soon, even the Presidential Villa will be handed over to them. I suspect strongly that this is their plan and so nobody should deceive me.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he was old enough to understand the agenda of the terrorists Fulani against Nigeria because, as he put it, \u201cit is a plan to hand over to these Fulani men who are called bandits so there will be no election.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to good spirited Fulani men and those who had the ears of the president to persuade him to stop the evil going on in the country.\n\nOrtom warned that if nothing was done, the people would resort to self-help, which would throw the country into anarchy.\n\nPresidency: Call for Buhari\u2019s Resignation, Ploy by Desperate Politicians to Get Power\n\nA statement yesterday by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said resignation of the president would not solve the country\u2019s woes. It stressed that all stakeholders, including the opposition, needed to work with government to change the situation for the better.\n\nThe statement said the Buhari government was doing everything required to end the reign of violence, which it alleged had snowballed in the current crisis as a result of years of neglect of the early indicators.\n\nThe presidency stated, \u201cThe presidency does not wish to be drawn into the high-decibel show in the media, taking the nation by the storm from the Northern Elders Forum.\n\n\u201cPublicity is the oxygen for politicians who have failed to connect with voters in a democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is enough to say from our part, that resignation call on the president is not a solution to the security problems facing the country, something that has built up to a worrisome level following decades of neglect.\n\n\u201cIt is more important that citizens know what their government is doing to deal with this situation and for politicians to come to terms with the fact the it is beneficial to all that they help to preserve the state so that when it is their turn, they will have a place that they will manage.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to destroy what is there in a desperate quest to get power.\u201d\n\nThe statement assured Nigerians that the administration was doing what was required of it to refocus the fight against terrorism and other forms of criminality across the country, saying new massive equipment are being assembled to aid the campaigns.\n\nAccording to the presidency, \u201cIn response to the recent spike in terrorist activity, particularly in the Kaduna and Niger states axis, the defense establishment, in response to presidential directives, has realigned and reorganised the on-going operation in the areas, as well as that going on in the Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cThe new operations structures are being reinforced with land-based assets to increase the efficiency of the troops and intelligence is equally being reinforced.\n\n\u201cThe air defense system is being reinforced with newly-acquired jets and drones which assemblage and training for operators have been hastened to meet the current exigencies.\n\n\u201cThe country is equally getting assurances of early delivery of equipment on order from manufacturers and the effort is on-going to conclude other major procurements still in process.\n\n\u201cOnly this morning, the government at a meeting of the cabinet, approved the procurement of the largest ever single procurement of military vehicles.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, similar major operations are going in the South-east and the South-south where the economic life wire of the nation and electricity transmission lines are currently being secured from saboteurs.\u201d\n\nIt also noted that more than just the coordinated assaults of terrorists on the country, there were other elements who had in recent times engaged in acts of sabotage against critical national assets, like those in the power sector, with the singular purpose of making the Buhari government seem as failing in its duties.\n\nThe presidency, however, assured the citizens that the outcome of government efforts to stabilise the country would soon become visible.\n\nThe presidency statement alleged, \u201cWhat the sponsored saboteurs aim to show is that the government cannot provide power, sabotaging equipment at switches and other vital points. They will not succeed. The public knows who is who, and who has done what in our country\u2019s governance.\n\n\u201cMassive gains being made will shortly be manifesting. Large number of arrests have equally been made.\n\n\u201cNigerians are assured that the government will keep its promise to the nation and threats to security will be handled with the firmness they call for. And government will remain firm in securing the country\u2019s unity and progress.\u201d\n\nInsecurity: 11, 536 Schools Have Been Closed Since 2020, UNICEF Reveals\n\nOn the eighth anniversary of the abduction of 276 students of Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, in Borno State, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) called for action to make schools safe for more girls to enrol in and complete their education.\n\nThe international agency also revealed that in Nigeria, a total of 11, 536 schools were closed since December 2020 due to abductions and security issues.\n\nIn commemoration of the abduction of 276 school girls in Chibok, UNICEF called on the authorities in Nigeria to make schools safe and provide a secure learning environment for every child in Nigeria, especially for girls, to increase girls\u2019 enrolment, retention, and completion of education.\n\nIn a statement, UNICEF\u2019s representative in Nigeria, Peter Hawkins, said unsafe schools, occasioned by attacks and abduction of students, were reprehensible, describing it as a brutal violation of the rights of the victims to education, and totally unacceptable.\n\nHawkins reiterated that girls had particularly been targeted, exacerbating the figures of out-of-school children in Nigeria.\n\nHe lamented that this had become a trajectory, which must be halted, adding that every hand in Nigeria must be on deck to ensure that learning in Nigeria is not a dangerous enterprise for any child, particularly for girls.\n\nHe added that since December 2020, 1,436 school children and 17 teachers had been abducted from schools, and 16 school children lost their lives.\n\nUNICEF stated, \u201cToday marks eight years since the first known attack on a learning institution in Nigeria on 14 April 2014, in which 276 students at Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, in North-east Nigeria were abducted by a Non-State Armed Group.\n\n\u201cSince then, a spate of attacks on schools and abductions of students, sometimes resulting in their deaths, has become recurrent in the last two years, especially in the North-west and North-central regions of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUnsafe schools, occasioned by attacks on schools and abduction of students, are reprehensible, a brutal violation of the rights of the victims to education, and totally unacceptable. Their occurrences cut short the futures and dreams of the affected students.\n\n\u201cAttacks on learning institutions render the learning environment insecure and discourage parents and caregivers from sending their wards to schools, while the learners themselves become fearful of the legitimate pursuit of learning.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, a total of 11, 536 schools were closed since December 2020 due to abductions and security issues.\n\n\u201cThese school closures have impacted the education of approximately 1.3 million children in the 2020/21 academic year.\n\n\u201cThis interruption of their learning contributes to gaps in children\u2019s knowledge and skills and may lead to the loss of approximately $3.4 billion in these children\u2019s lifetime earnings.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Union demands scrapping of NITDA over UTAS\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\n\n\nAs concerns mount over continued closure of government-owned universities nationwide as a result of the strike embarked upon the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has urged the federal government to immediately set up a committee whose target would be to address grievances of the university workers with a view to ending the 59-day old strike.\n\nArising from a meeting with the unions in the universities in Abuja, the NLC said it\u2019s concern was the litany of agreements that government had failed to implement.\n\nIn the communiqu\u00e9 jointly signed by NLC president, Ayuba Wabba and General Secretary, Emma Ugboaja, the congress stated: \u201cIn the light of the foregoing concerns, the meeting resolved to call on the federal government to immediately set up a high-powered panel constituted of members with requisite mandates to resolve within 21 days the foregoing issues militating against industrial harmony in Nigeria\u2019s university system.\n\n\u201cPursuant to the foregoing resolution, the NLC would be convening a special meeting of the Central Working Committee (CWC) of all the affiliate unions of the congress to decide on the next line of action.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, non-teaching staff of universities have resolved to extend their ongoing warning strike, by another two weeks.\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, the chairman of the Joint Action Committee of the non-academic staff of universities, Mr. Adeyemi Peters said the unions were displeased by the government\u2019s inaction concerning the workers\u2019 demands despite several reminders.\n\nHe listed a catalogue of grievances bothering on the welfare and funding of the universities, including the arrears of earned allowances,\n\n\u201cIt was at the end of all these reminders with no acknowledgement by the government that we were left with no other resort but to embark on a two weeks warning strike.\n\n\u201cPrior to the strike, due process was duly followed and the notice were issued in line with the extant laws. Shamefully and painfully, there was no attempt by the government to intercept or even invite the unions to a meeting.\n\n\u201cThis aloof and contemptuous attitude of government further incensed our members who resolved that following the failure of government to even invite the leaderships for a meeting, the strike should be extended by another two weeks before an indefinite and total strike is declared.\n\n\u201cAs at today, the two weeks extension is getting to the middle and with no response in sight from government, we may be left with no resort but to embark on an indefinite and total strike. This is gradually becoming unavoidable and inevitable,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the unions were being left with no choice than to call on well-meaning Nigerians and stakeholders in the university system to prevail on government to honour the agreement it freely entered into with the Joint Action Committee of Non Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU) and Senior Staff Union of Universities (SSANU) in order to avoid a total breakdown of industrial harmony in the Nigeria Universities and Inter-University Centres.\n\nSome of the grievances for which the workers have proceeded on strike include: Non-Payment of Earned Allowances;\n\nNon-Payment of Arrears of national minimum Wage and its Consequential adjustment; Poor funding of state universities;\n\ndelay in renegotiation of the 2009 Agreements; non release of White Papers of Visitation panels; among others.\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has called on the federal government to scrap the National Information Development Agency (NITDA) over its failure to implement the union\u2019s University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS).\n\nThe Sokoto Zonal Coordinator of ASUU, Jamilu Shehu, while addressing journalists in Katsina yesterday, said the agency should be disbanded with immediate effect.\n\nThe Sokoto Zonal office of ASUU comprises Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua University, Katsina; Usmanu Danfodio University, Sokoto; Kebbi State University of Science and Technology, Aliero; Sokoto State University, Sokoto, and Federal University, Dutsinma.\n\nHe reiterated that NITDA had violated its basic mandate of seeing to the birth of the union\u2019s homegrown software and its deployment in the nation\u2019s public universities.\n\nHe added that the failure of the federal government\u2019s agency to accept UTAS revealed that it lacks capacity and drive to deliver its mandate, \u201cand is incapable of promoting homegrown solutions.\u201d\n\nShehu said: \u201cIt also shows that the agency\u2019s usefulness cannot be ascertained and ASUU calls on the federal government to scrap it with immediate effect or in the least reconstitute it with more clear and cogent mandates.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, for UTAS to score 99.3 per cent during the test run assessment, was good enough to warrant an issuance of certificate of compliance.\n\nThe ASUU zonal coordinator urged Nigerians to disregard what he described as unjustifiable propaganda by NITDA on the status of UTAS integrity test.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Approves N1.4bn for TCN projects\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu has linked the ongoing crisis facing the nation\u2019s power sector to acts of sabotage being perpetrated by certain criminally minded Nigerians.\n\nBriefing newsmen at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, Aliyu said several recent incidences, including fatal attacks and abduction of foreign workers, who were working on various power projects, had stalled progress in achieving completion on some projects, while other attacks on installations had led to major power cuts.\n\nWhile stressing that the acts of sabotage had been robbing Nigeria of investors and development, Aliyu appealed to Nigerians to join the federal government in combating the war on sabotage, which he said was actually a war for all citizens to wage.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou\u2019re all aware this country is facing a lot of challenges. It\u2019s not only in the power sector alone, you have just heard about the insecurity. The railway and the communities are being attacked, oil pipelines. They\u2019re all similar things, including the power sector.\n\n\u201cYou can call it a sabotage because how can somebody go and pull down 330 (megawatt) tower to cause this havoc to the whole country. What do you call that?\n\n\u201cNot quite long, on January 4, the project that we had announced that we\u2019re going to commission, the Zungeru, 700 megawatts hydro, which is at present over 92 per cent completion, we\u2019re just doing little touches to commission the project. There was an attack on January 4 this year and they abducted the Chinese workers and up till now they\u2019re still with the captives. The Chinese cannot return to work until they get their brothers out.\n\n\u201cSo, they are working minimally, we have like three sites on the whole project; the main dam, which on the 28th of March we have commissioned one of the turbines and passed it, we did the tests and it has passed, it was celebrated. They are working there in the main hydro.\n\n\u201cThen there is a line of over 30 kilometers to a switch yard. So, they\u2019re not working on the switch yard on the line and if they don\u2019t finish these two, you cannot evacuate. Even the turbine that we have commissioned and tested is just a dry testing, you cannot take electricity out because of the line and the tripping point, that\u2019s where the switch yard is and this was where they attacked and killed some people, took away some of them, the foreign workers, about three.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to also work together as a nation to support the leadership, to support the government, to face these challenges together. Any support you can give, give that support.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, corroborated the submission of his Power counterpart stressing that all Nigerians suffer for any act of sabotage affecting public facilities.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhat the Minister of Power is saying is that it\u2019s not really about inefficiency or not caring on the part of the government, but that citizens also have a role to play in this. I don\u2019t know anywhere in the world where people will go and vandalise power stations or they go to the roads and take the railings from the road to go and smelt and make into spoons and aluminum.\n\n\u201cSo really, we must understand that this, whether they are bandits or vandals, they\u2019re not the enemies of just this administration, they are the enemies of Nigeria because they are depriving all of us of power, they are depriving us of peace, they are depriving us of security and I think we all need to look inwards and ask ourselves, are we all So contributing to making Nigerian ungovernable in one way or the other.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big challenge, I think we should carry this thing to our people. Ask yourselves, the guy who goes at night to go and dig up telecoms cables to go and resell, is that political? That\u2019s sabotage.\n\n\u201cOr the guy that goes out at night to go and remove the transmission lines. Now, we\u2019ll all live to suffer the consequences of such actions\u201d, he said.\n\nThe FEC meeting also approved N1.4 billion for the supply of more equipment for the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), in order to boost power supply in the country.\n\nAliyu, said he presented two memos from the ministry of power for the Transmission Company of Nigeria.\n\nThe first one, he said, was variation of the sum of a contract for 132/33 KV substation at Kafanchan, Kaduna State with a KV line base extension at Jos substation, in Plateau State in the sum of N132,705, 861.42.\n\nAccording to him, the second approval was for the supply of handling equipment and operational vehicles also for the Transmission Company of Nigeria at the cost of N1.3 billion.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe second memo was for the supply of handling equipment, haulage and operational vehicles for the TCN at N1,338,159,080. 88. They are heavy lifting equipment that the TCN requires for doing its work in the store and on the field, while changing equipment and moving transformers and the council graciously approved.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has again made fresh submissions before the London Commercial Court, where Nigeria is suing JP Morgan Chase Bank and established that former Attorney-General, Mohammed Bello Adoke, was complicit in the controversial sale of the OPL 245 oil bloc licence to Shell and Eni, despite the firm having no formal connection to the deal.\n\nIn its final written submission to the court, the Nigerian government referenced an interview granted by former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, where he emphatically denied knowledge of the much touted 2006 deal referenced by Adoke in supporting the out-of-court settlement between Malabu and Federal Government.\n\nOlusegun Obasanjo\n\nIn 2006, Malabu lost a case instituted by the company to have the OPL245 license withdrawn by the government return to it.\n\nThat was all the country needed to take full control of the license after the earlier revocation via executive fiat.\n\nThis revocation and court decision by the Federal High Court was the position throughout the period ex-President, Umar Yar'adua, was in office but suddenly changed after Jonathan assumed office and Adoke appointed as Justice Minister.\n\nThe ministry under Adoke entered into a settlement agreement to return a licence lost through the court to Malabu, even without an appeal challenging the High Court decision delivered against Malabu.

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, the Nigerian arm of Africa\u2019s largest telecom, today received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nWith this approval, MTN Nigeria can provide virtually all the services offered by conventional commercial banks with the exception of granting credit and processing foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThis announcement follows a previous approval in principle granted in November 2021, to Airtel Africa Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc to operate a payment service bank in the country. The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "There is a growing vote of no confidence among Nigerians for the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) as experts insist that the exercise has struggled to meet its objectives given the high rate of out-of-school children in the country.\n\nLaunched in 2016 by the Federal Government, the scheme aimed to tackle the social challenges, malnutrition and poverty among Nigerian children and its attendant consequences on education.\n\nDuring the week, the Federal government admitted it spent N12 billion on the feeding scheme monthly under the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development (MHADMSD).\n\nBut, six years later, there are mixed feelings among stakeholders if the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme instituted by the Federal Government under the National Social Investment Programmes (NSIP) has really achieved its objective, given the high rate of out-of-school children in the country.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the problem is beyond a white elephant feeding project. We are facing one of the highest levels of insecurity and poverty in our political history,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, an economist and former director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a private sector advocacy group.\n\nThe United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) in its report revealed that Nigeria has the world\u2019s highest rate of out-of-school children with 10.5 million children out of school.\n\nThe UNICEF Representative in Nigeria, Peter Hawkins, who stated this in a statement while commemorating the International Day of Education on Jan 24, noted: \u201can estimated 35 percent of Nigerian children who attend primary school do not go on to attend secondary school, while half of all Nigerian children did not attend secondary school in 2021.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that millions of Nigerian children have never set foot in a classroom, raising concerns over the crisis of low funding of education by the government, and the problem of COVID-19 pandemic on the education sector.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a holistic approach in terms of funding,\u201d Yusuf noted.\n\nRead also: Over 11, 000 schools shut down in Nigeria since 2020 \u2013 UNICEF\n\nFaced with the problem of poor funding, it will be recalled that the Federal Government in its N17 trillion 2022 budget, 7.2 percent was allocated to the education sector.\n\nThough it shows an increase from 5.7 percent in 2021, other experts say the education budget is still a long way to go to reach the internationally recommended benchmark that countries spend between 15 and 20 percent of their national budgets on education.\n\n\u201cNigeria is bedeviled by the problem of the high rate of out-of-school children, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, and the challenges of insecurity, as well as what has been described as shoddy implementation of the school feeding programme,\u201d\n\nAccording to the Wisconsin-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), there were 25 different attacks carried out on schools by bandits in 2021; while 1,440 children were abducted; 16 killed and no fewer than 618 schools were closed in six Northern states of Sokoto, Zamfara, Kano, Katsina, Niger, and Yobe over the fear of attack and abduction of pupils and teachers.\n\nACLED data also shows that the bandits killed more than 2,600 civilians in 2021, an increase of over 250percent from 2020. This number dwarfs that of civilian deaths credited to Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province in the same year.\n\nIn the period between December 2020 and August 2021, more than 1,000 students and school staff were abducted. Within the next six months, as many as 343 people were killed, while 830 others were abducted by bandits between July and September 2021 in Kaduna state alone, according to figures from the Kaduna state government.",

          "title": "FG moves to curb Nigerians\u2019 power woes",
          "text": "A Federal Government memo seen by BusinessDay has revealed the actions needed to forestall a repeat of the events that led to a crash in available electricity generation last month following the collapse of the national grid.\n\nIt showed that about 2,800 megawatts (MW) of electricity was lost in March on the back of several challenges that faced the country\u2019s biggest power plant and six others.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a traffic snarl from the Independence tunnel in Maryland backed up 6 kilometres to Ketu, in the heart of the Lagos metropolis. The cause was an electrical spark from a pole that led to a mass of burning cables falling on the expressway.\n\nAround the country, Nigeria\u2019s power infrastructure is wilting under the weight of neglect, underinvestment and sabotage. This is the major theme of the memo.\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, Nigeria has lost more than 3,000MW of power from a combination of several factors including gas pipeline sabotage, poor maintenance of gas pipelines and turbines and lower water levels at hydropower plants due to the dry season.\n\nThis comes at a time when the government is implementing reforms to ensure a fairer cost for power is paid by consumers under the service-based tariff, which took off in November 2020.\n\nThe memo indicates that Nigeria\u2019s power generation lost 2,790MW in March alone.\n\nThere are 24 operational power plants in the country and more often than not, nine of these account for about 80 percent of generation.\n\nDue to its size and availability, Egbin power plant often accounts for the largest share (18 percent) of the total energy output followed by Okpai and Azura power plants, which account for 9.37 percent and 9.14 percent energy share respectively.\n\nThe implication is that the (over) reliance of the grid on the energy supplied by nine power plants may pose a risk to network stability in the event of sudden loss of any of them unless adequate proactive measures such as spinning reserves are put in place, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission said in its second quarter report for 2021.\n\nThis was the reality in March when Okpai and Egbin along with other power plants were affected.\n\nIn the memo, several root causes were identified as well as actions required to avoid a recurrence.\n\nThe report said a lack of firm gas supply agreements was hampering the gas value chain and called for mandatory agreements for power plants deemed critical to keep the grid functional.\n\nHowever, the government has yet to allow a liberal pricing regime in Nigeria despite clamour from operators.\n\nA willing-buyer, willing-seller gas pricing regime binding on power plants will require tariffs that will guarantee commercial returns.\n\nThe Nigerian government has preferred paying subsidies and insisting on supply on credit. Hence, companies have no incentive to fix broken turbines or invest to deepen supply to the local market.\n\nRecent attacks on oil infrastructure has ended up constraining gas production since more than half of the gas produced in Nigeria is developed in search of oil.\n\nOver-reliance on gas to power is causing security of power supply risks, an improved mix is needed of utility scale hydro and solar power generation, the report said.\n\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s grid is dated, overly centralised and has no provision for feed-in-tariff.\n\nPower projects including Zungeru, Mambilla Hydro power plant and the Kashimbila hydro plants have stalled for many years mostly because they have poor investment cases.\n\nRead also: Power Ministry confirms national grid collapse\n\nThe memo called for the designation of gas plants as strategic national gas supply infrastructure and the development of regulation to ensure minimum level of expected performance for licensees and owners.\n\nIt further called for improved rigour on outage planning by the System Operator and the integration of gas supply outages in the outage plan. It called for sanctions against power plants undergoing planned outages without obtaining approval.\n\nOther recommendations include payment discipline and quick settlement of invoices and continued focus on infrastructure improvements to the transmission and distribution networks.\n\nThe memo said, \u201cThe lack of functioning SCADA and numerous Right of Way issues in the states are slowing progress on grid reforms.\n\n\u201cPost privatisation, we have belatedly started to transition funding away from consumption (in the form of subsidies) to infrastructure.\n\n\u201cEfforts to create additional private licensed grid networks to improve redundancy and accelerate infrastructure development should be encouraged.\u201d\n\nAyodele Oni, partner in charge of the Energy Practice Group at Bloomfield LP, in a recent interview with Channels TV, said issues of mismanagement and poor infrastructure maintenance were hampering electricity supply.\n\n\u201cThere is also a problem with the implementation,\u201d he said. \u201cTo make the system work efficiently, every market should have a capacity element, an energy element, and ancillary services such as spinning reserves and others, all these works together to ensure the system works efficiently.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, the country\u2019s power grid suffered another system collapse, the first this month and the third in 24 days, worsening blackout in Lagos and some other parts of the country.\n\nThe Transmission Company of Nigeria announced through its official Twitter handle that a vandalised transmission tower along the Odukpani-Ikot Ekpene 330kV double circuit transmission line was to blame for the latest national grid collapse.\n\nTweeting about the situation, Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power, said the collapse of the grid, which has since been restored, resulted in a loss of about 400MW.\n\n\u201cAs a result, a slew of plants across the country were forced to shut down,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The sudden hike in the price of diesel in Nigeria is taking a toll on private schools as they mostly rely on generators for their power supply and diesel-powered buses to convey their students.\n\nThe price of a litre of diesel, which is deregulated in Nigeria, has jumped from about N288 per litre in January to N650-N700.\n\nOlushola Majiyagbe, a staff member of Graceville Schools, Ikeja in Lagos State, told BusinessDay that the school resolved to cut down by 50 percent the number of hours they run on generators.\n\n\u201cWe run the generator for four hours per day as against 8-10 hours. Besides, we have installed solar energy to take care of the nights,\u201d he said. \u201cAt night, we ask the students to switch off air conditioners and make use of fans while on solar. That way, we have been able to navigate our ways around the disturbing development.\u201d\n\nHe said the school did not in any way increase the tuition fees, considering the economic challenges facing many parents and guardians.\n\nAn insider in City Pride Schools said the school had reduced its usage of generators to two hours per day from the usual 4-5 hours.\n\nHowever, he explained that the students did not welcome the new development because it is making learning less effective.\n\n\u201cThe students complain of heat bitterly, and this causes distraction,\u201d he said.\n\nGlory Akinsola, a teacher in a mission school, said her school was considering online classes because the cost of running the school buses and generator had surpassed the bills given to parents at the beginning of the term.\n\n\u201cAccording to my boss, she was contemplating having three days of physical classes and two days of online classes in order to minimise the cost,\u201d she said.\n\nFor one of the administrators of Study Habit Schools, Okota-Lagos, the burden of running generators for 24 hours a day is unsustainable.\n\nRead also: High diesel cost: JAMB hikes mock exam service charge\n\nThe source said, \u201cStudy Habit Schools run an e-learning system that makes it compulsory to have the generator on until the school hours are over.\n\n\u201cElectricity service providers are not helping matters because of the problem with the national grid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope that the federal government will intervene to save the private school owners from the economic burden of running education centres under this ugly situation.\u201d\n\nSome of the parents who spoke with BusinessDay disclosed that they had received letters from their children\u2019s schools showing an increment in fees.\n\nOne of the parents lamented the increase, wondering how he was going to pay an almost 70 percent increase in fees for his three children in the school.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable; how on earth will a school do almost 70 percent increase in school fees without proper consultation with the parents?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnother parent said the school fees were increased by 25 percent as a result of the diesel hike to enable the school to cope with the general overhead cost of maintaining the school buses and generators.\n\nWith the national power grid collapsing frequently in recent months, worsening the already poor power supply, many businesses, including private schools, have had to rely more on generators.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, commissioned 68 housing units, under the National Housing Programme (NHP) Phase 1, in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\nObaseki, at the unveiling of the units, called for increased collaboration between the state and federal governments, as well as other stakeholders to address the housing deficit in the country.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cAs the National Bureau of Statistics has shown, we have over twenty million housing deficit in Nigeria, which means that very many Nigerians are living without proper shelter. The World Bank recommends at least a million homes annually to bridge this gap.\n\n\u201cBut due to limited resources and economic challenges, it is difficult for us to attain this goal. It is very important to encourage all partners, particularly the federal government, that collaboration is very key. While we congratulate them and appreciate what they have done, we are saying that the road ahead is very long.\n\n\u201cThe pace at which we are going is very slow. We need to change the strategy; 65 units of housing after nine years of construction will not solve our problems. We need to do more, and as a state, we are going to collaborate with the federal government to achieve the desired goals.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile considering the gains of this project, it\u2019s pertinent to note and underscore the need to develop other aspects of the housing industry that will help us move at a much faster pace and one of them is mortgages. Unless we introduce a virile, realistic, and affordable mortgage arrangement we will not be able to develop housing as we want to.\n\n\u201cFor us in Edo, we are very committed to housing projects. As we speak, we have about four projects which we are working on already.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWe are prepared to work with all partners including the federal government and communities to make sure that we take the issue of housing development very seriously. We would like to collaborate with the federal government. We hope that the next phase will not be developed the way this one has been developed.\n\n\u201cWe have more land, so we shouldn\u2019t be doing housing like this on four hectares. We have more land to give to you; we also understand some of the challenges you faced, but those challenges can be overcome. We need to collaborate closely.\n\n\u201cI believe that the dream of the federal government to tackle her housing deficit will be best accomplished with a closer working collaboration with states so that we can jointly build houses for Nigerians at the rate which we need to build. If we go on at this rate, half of us will be on the street.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, President Buhari, who was represented by Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, commended the state government for providing the land and the host community for their cooperation in ensuring the project is completed.\n\n\u201cThis is a benefit of inter-government collaboration despite the political divide. This is one of the first phases of the several phases of the Federal Government Housing projects since 2016.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Senate, on Thursday, at plenary approved President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request for adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework.\n\nThe approval followed the consideration of a report by the Senate Committee on Finance.\n\nThe report was laid and presented by the Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Olamilekan Adeola.(APC \u2013 Lagos).\n\nSenate accordingly approved the $73 dollars per barrel proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari, including approving oil production volume of 1.600 million per day;\n\nA Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy of N4 trillion; and a cut in the provision for Federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion from N352.80.\n\nWhile approving an increase in the Federal Government Independent Revenue of N400 billion, Senate gave its approval for an additional provision of N182.4 billion to cater to the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt approved debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nA breakdown of the net reductions are as follows: NDDC, by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion; NEDC, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; and UBEC, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion.\n\nOthers are Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion.\n\nThe chamber also approved a fiscal deficit of N7.35 trillion.\n\nIn his presentation, Adeola said that the total budget deficit was projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAccording to him, the incremental deficit would be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\n\nLawmakers, who made contributions on the report for the review of the 2022 fiscal framework, attributed the Nigeria\u2019s economic downturn to crude oil theft.\n\nSen. Olubunmi Adetunmbi (APC \u2013 Ekiti), said the federal government and security agencies owed it a duty to stop the stealing of our common wealth.\n\nHe decried that at a time when most countries of the world were reaping hugely from the increase in crude oil prices caused by the Russia-Ukrainian crisis, Nigeria was left out for its inability to meet its OPEC quota.\n\nThe Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, said the country should be in a state of mourning over its current experience, attributing the failure of security agencies to protect oil assets as a major reason for the decline of the economy.\n\nHe expressed concern over rising cases of oil theft despite huge resources allocated to the military, police and other security agencies.\n\nOther Senators, like Gabriel Suswam (PDP Benue ), Betty Apiafi (PDP Rivers), urged the Senate not to hastily approve the President\u2019s request to adjust the 2022 fiscal framework until certain questions were answered.\n\nWhile Suswam raised concerns on the widening gap in budget deficit and the federal government\u2019s decision to resort to funding from the Capital Market, Apiafi, demanded answers from the NNPC and relevant agencies on solutions to curb crude oil theft.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his concluding remarks, called on the Federal Government to take \u201cradical\u201d steps towards stopping the theft of crude oil by economic saboteurs.\n\nHe also called for a stop to the importation of refined petroleum products into the country, so as to cut down on expenditures incurred in the process, as well as to maximize profits from crude oil sales.\n\n\u201cThis (crude theft) is not something to play politics with, and I don\u2019t think the answers are going to be easy to come by.\n\n\u201cRadical decisions would have to be taken, but before we find answers we have to live with this, though we have to be as fast as possible in looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI had a session with the Chief of Defence Staff about a month ago, and my discussions with him were on the oil theft and the efforts of our security agencies to combat this menace.\n\n\u201cAnd like we know, our security agencies are doing their best, but we have people \u2013 our people \u2013 who are sabotaging the oil industry, because oil theft is not perpetrated by somebody else but by people who are citizens.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to continue to support the security agencies in whatever way possible so that they are able to deal with this.\n\n\u201cI also believe that, whether there is oil theft or not, until we stop the importation of refined products to Nigeria, we will never get the best out of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cWe should, therefore, work to ensure that we produce our refined products locally, because that is one way of cutting our expenditure on importation.\n\n\u201cI also think that diversification of the economy is key, because we depend so much on this oil and gas industry, the slightest issues that affects it internationally affects us seriously in our country,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I prayed for her and prayed again.\n\n\u201cWhen the symptoms did not abate, I counselled that they went to the hospital to help us know exactly what we were dealing with and they asked if I could help them facilitate that process. I called our head of medical team, Dr Osang, who is a consultant paediatrician with the Federal Medical Centre, Keffi (Nasarawa State) to assist to handle their situation.\n\n\u201cHe called the FMC, Jabi (Abuja), where they attended to her. On seeing her, they ordered some examinations and investigations and that including CT scan. That was done, and from what the doctors saw, they felt there was the need for further investigation either at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital or the National Hospital, Abuja. I called the doctor at the UATH, Dr Akoh Alexander, and told him the situation.\n\nThe Pastor said the late artiste was later admitted and was responding to treatment before he heard about her death.\n\nThe Pastor further said, \u201cNow if there was domestic violence that led to or coincided with those symptoms she came with two-and-a-half to three months ago, there is no way I would know. If there had been perennial domestic violence, there is no way I would have known.\n\n\u201cThe things we are hearing after her passing were very strange to my hearing. Then, I began to ask questions. Then, I asked the twin sister, \u2018Were you aware that your sister passed through all these things?\u2019 She said yes, that she knew some of them, but that the majority of them she heard only from those she (Osinachi) confided in.\n\n\u201cI asked her, \u2018If you knew, why didn\u2019t you let us know?\u2019 and she said, she (Osinachi) always begged her not to tell the pastor or the church that the man would change and asked for prayers.

We hope that the election will be free and credible because there are expectations within and outside this country over the forthcoming election in this State.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that the election should be fair and credible. We partner with Nigeria to ensure free and credible elections. We are meeting with you as the first citizen of the state and our officials will also meet security officials, civil societies and other stakeholders. We will be in the State for the next couple of months and we are ready to work with you for free and credible election in 2022 in this State.\u201d\n\nResponding, Governor Oyetola assured that Osun State election would set the pace for the general election in 2023.\n\nHe boasted that APC remains the party to beat, just as he remains the candidate to beat during the 2022 governorship election in the State.\n\nHe said, \u201cI remember in 2018 we received delegation from the US that wanted to know the programme we had for the people ahead of election and we were able to meet the expectations of the US and other missions that are interested in our democracy.\n\n\u201cI want to tell you that we are looking forward to a credible election in Osun state. We are the party to beat, I am the candidate to beat anytime any day. The fact speaks for itself.\n\n\u201cSo far so good, we make policies to make Osun the best in the country. We have done very well in the area of health, infrastructure, economy, education, youth empowerment and mining.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to change the narrative of the state from a civil service state. We are looking at the area of Agriculture, Tourism and Mining. Although we have challenges in the area of mining because of environmental degradation, we are encouraging institutional miners from Australia, Canada and America too. We are naturally endowed in the area of mineral resources and we are looking for responsible partners.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve cared so much about the welfare of the people and ensuring their security. We pay salaries regularly. We pay pensions, we have fixed a number of roads and we revitalised 332 PHCs across the wards in the State. We have done peaceful congress and primary elections in the State. So, APC remains the party to beat anytime any day.\u201d\n\nThe US government delegates includes Janine Lewis, Sterling Roop, James Svor, Arnold Abulvine and Halima Abubakar.",

Preliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attacks show that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and the dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the North-east.\n\n\u201cI can tell you very confidently that the federal government is on top of this matter,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts to release abductees\n\nOn efforts to rescue the kidnapped victims, Minister of Defence Bashir Magashi, who was at the briefing, also said the government was on top of the situation.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think the security chiefs are working hard to unveil those that are involved, and we will tell you very soon those that are carrying out these attacks.\n\n\u201cBoth Jos and Kaduna, we will come and explain to the public what is really going on and our efforts to ensure that all these activities are stopped once and for all. We are really on top of the situation. We are planning hard and we will get it out as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe revelation by the information minister about the collaboration between the two terrorist groups appears to contradict the position of one of the kingpins of banditry in the North-west region.\n\nNotorious kingpin, Bello Turji, had in an interview with Daily Trust newspaper recently, said he had no connection with ISWAP and Boko Haram members.\n\nTurji said he did not need to have any links with ISWAP and Boko Haram because he had no political agenda or looking to establish his own territory.\n\n\u201cWe are not interested in establishing any religious organisation. We are not aspiring to have a territory of our own, and we don\u2019t have any political aspirations.\n\n\u201cWe took up arms to protect the lives of our people that are being killed, it is not just because we are merciless or we are unconscious of Allah who created us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Turji said the Muhammadu Buhari-led government cannot curb the illegal firearms in circulation and access to communication in the country.\n\nAfter months of foot-dragging, the federal government, in January, designated the bandits as terrorists.",

          "text": "Favourites Barcelona were dumped out of the Europa League by Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals on Thursday, while West Ham United and Rangers joined RB Leipzig in qualifying for the last four.\n\nSerbian international Filip Kostic scored twice either side of a Rafael Santos Borre strike at the Camp Nou for Frankfurt, who survived a late fightback to win 3-2 on the night and 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nSergio Busquets scored a late consolation before Memphis Depay\u2019s even later penalty for Barcelona but Eintracht held on, to the delight of the estimated 30,000 German supporters who travelled for the game.\n\nREAD ALSO: NFF Appoints Coaches For CHAN, U-20, U-17 Male National Teams\n\nThey go through to their second Europa League semi-final in four seasons, having lost on penalties to Chelsea at the same stage in 2019.\n\n\u201cI am speechless. Nobody expected this, if you are honest. Everyone expected us to suffer,\u201d said Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp.\n\nBarcelona\u2019s recent revival under Xavi Hernandez has been remarkable but this defeat means they have won just once at home all season in Europe, and their campaign is now set to end without silverware.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hammer blow for us. They deserved to go through,\u201d admitted Xavi.\n\nAfter conceding three penalties in their weekend win over Levante, Barca fell behind to another spot-kick inside four minutes against Eintracht, as Kostic converted after a foul by Eric Garcia to the delight of the enormous away support.\n\nThe visitors scored again in the 36th minute as Colombian forward Borre fired high into the net from range, and Kostic\u2019s low finish into the far corner made it 3-0 midway through the second half.\n\nBusquets had a late goal disallowed for offside before he found the net with a fantastic strike from 20 metres in the first minute of injury time.\n\nThe game carried on into an 11th added minute when Depay netted a penalty after Evan Ndicka was sent off, receiving a second caution for a foul on Luuk de Jong.\n\nWest Ham outclass Lyon\n\nYet Eintracht maintained their record of not having lost to Spanish opposition since the 1960 European Cup final against Real Madrid, and they will face West Ham in the semi-finals.\n\nThe English side are through to their first European semi-final since losing the 1976 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final to Anderlecht after they outclassed Lyon in France, winning 3-0 on the night and 4-1 on aggregate.\n\nThe Hammers took the lead in the 38th minute of the return when Craig Dawson headed in a Pablo Fornals corner.\n\nCaptain Declan Rice slotted in their second just before the break, his sidefoot effort from the edge of the area beating Lyon goalkeeper Julian Pollersbeck with the aid of a deflection.\n\nThe outcome was put beyond doubt when West Ham scored again three minutes after the restart as Fornals sent Jarrod Bowen away to make it 3-0.\n\n\u201cThe journey in two years, we were talking about relegation, and now we\u2019re talking about getting to the semi-final of a European tournament. It\u2019s fabulous, and we\u2019re all going to look forward to it,\u201d said West Ham manager David Moyes.\n\nRangers through in extra time\n\nThere was drama in Glasgow as Rangers were taken to extra time by Braga before winning 3-1 on the night and 3-2 on aggregate as the Portuguese side finished the game with nine men.\n\nJames Tavernier gave Rangers a second-minute lead to level the tie on aggregate, and they had another goal disallowed and then hit the woodwork before winning a penalty just before the interval.\n\nVitor Tormena was sent off for a foul on Kemar Roofe, and Tavernier netted from the spot.\n\nDavid Carmo\u2019s 83rd-minute header took the tie to extra time, but Roofe\u2019s 101st-minute finish put Rangers back in front on aggregate and Braga then had Iuri Medeiros dismissed.\n\nRangers will now face Leipzig in their first European semi-final since reaching the 2008 UEFA Cup final.\n\nFrench international Christopher Nkunku scored both goals as Leipzig beat Atalanta 2-0 in Italy to win their last-eight tie 3-1 on aggregate.\n\nNkunku opened the scoring in the 18th minute in Bergamo and then added a late penalty, his 30th goal of the season in all competitions.",

          "text": "Agricultural workers in the east and Horn of Africa are preparing for their most severe drought in 40 years, as authorities warn that higher temperatures and less than normal rainfall was recorded by weather agencies in March and April this year.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Authority on Development said rains will likely fail for a fourth consecutive year, triggering fears of increased cases of malnutrition, threats to livelihoods and severe risks for 29 million people in the region. Meteorologists are linking the unfolding drought to human-caused climate change which is leading to increased warming in the Indian Ocean, causing more frequent cyclones.\n\nLike most of Africa, the east and the Horn\u2019s economic mainstay is agriculture, which is rain-fed, making it vulnerable to extreme weather events. Mama Charity Kimaru, who practices mixed farming by rearing livestock and planting cereals and vegetables in her 30-acre farm in Nyandarua, some 80 miles (126 kilometers) north of Nairobi, is among the farmers who are preparing for the worst outcomes. Kimaru says that increased temperatures recorded over the past few months have denied her livestock pasture and the crops she had planted in anticipation of the long rains season have failed.\n\nThe weather agency previously said in February that the region should prepare for a \u201cwetter than average\u201d long rains season, which normally pours from March to May, but the agency revised its previous forecasts this week.\n\n\u201cThe March, April, May rains are crucial for the region and, sadly, we are looking at not just three, but potentially four consecutive failed seasons,\u201d Workneh Gebeyehu, the executive secretary of the intergovernmental agency, said. \u201cThis, coupled with other stress factors such as conflicts in both our region and Europe, the impact of COVID-19, and macro-economic challenges, has led to acute levels of food insecurity across the greater Horn of Africa.\u201d\n\nBelow average rainfall for 2022 are likely to prolong the already extremely dry conditions which have not been experienced to this degree since 1981. Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia \u2014 which will be severely impacted by the reduced rains \u2014 are already in the midst of a dire famine.\n\nLack of rainfall during the short rains season late last year and the ongoing drought during the current long rains season has already led to crop failures and livestock deaths, causing high food prices and intercommunal conflicts over scarce pasture and dwindling water resources.\n\n\u201cWhenever we have intense cyclones in the Southwest Indian Ocean, we always prepare for a long drought season in eastern and the Horn regions,\u201d Evans Mukolwe, the former science director at the U.N., said. \u201cThis is because the cyclones suck much of the moisture depriving the region of the much-needed precipitation. It has been the pattern for decades.\u201d\n\nAid organizations are already concerned about how worsening climate change impacts will affect the region in future decades.\n\n\u201cThis is not the Horn\u2019s first drought, nor is it likely to be its last,\u201d said Sean Granville-Ross, the regional director for Africa for the aid agency Mercy Corps. \u201cAs the climate emergency worsens, droughts will become more frequent and severe. People affected by climate change cannot wait for one crisis to end before preparing for the next.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe international response must prioritize immediate needs while allocating additional resources to long-term, smart interventions that will result in long-term change and assist communities in becoming more drought-resistant.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. humanitarian office warned last week that the current drought \u201crisks becoming one of the worst climate induced emergencies in recent history in the Horn of Africa.\u201d It also said that the $1.5 billion drought response appeal required to assist some 5.5 million people in Somali remains seriously underfunded.",
