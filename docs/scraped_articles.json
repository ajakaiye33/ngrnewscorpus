          "text": "THE International Police has launched a manhunt for the over 120 fleeing inmates of the Medium Security Correctional Centre, Kabba, Kogi State, who escaped during an attack on the facility on Sunday.\n\nIt was gathered that Interpol would concentrate its search on neighbouring countries, including Benin, Ghana, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, where many of the fleeing Kogi prison inmates might be hiding.\n\nSpeaking to our correspondent on Thursday on the manhunt, the spokesman, Nigerian Correctional Service, Francis Enobore, said the NCoS would not rest until all the escaped inmates were apprehended and brought back to custody.\n\nHe confirmed that Interpol would be focusing attention on neighbouring countries which may be the destination choice of the fugitives.\n\n\u201cJust as directed by the honourable minister, Interpol will be looking at the neighbouring countries for the escaped inmates.\n\n\u201cWe are firing from all cylinders now; we want to activate every possible means to ensure that these guys are smoked out from wherever they are and those who refused to turn themselves in will remain uncomfortable for the rest of their lives.\n\n\u201cWe are activating various measures but it is too early in the day for me to disclose the measures. We have been having various engagements and they are continuing.\u201d\n\nThe NCoS spokesman revealed that investigation into the attack was going on, adding that the mastermind had yet to be identified.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are going to get to the root of the incident and track down the sponsors; but at that level, it would go to higher authorities to process it. Our focus now is to ensure that every inmate is rearrested.\n\n\u201cThe Deputy Controller-General in charge of Operations, Mohammed Tukur, is overseeing the situation. The police, DSS, military and the NCoS are involved in the operation and at the end of the day, they will have a meeting point where the findings would be harmonised and proper action taken.\u201d\n\nRecall that 240 inmates escaped from custody, while 114 were back in prison as of Tuesday.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nNigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS), yesterday, flayed the Presidency for linking its ongoing one million march opposite the United Nations (UN) Headquarters, New York, with activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe group, comprising Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) for Yorubaland), Lower Niger Congress (LNC) for South East and South South and Middle-Belt Rennaissance Movement (MBRM) for the Middle Belt, in a statement, yesterday, warned the Presidency against creating frictions between the Yoruba and Igbo. It, however, said the one million march in New York had nothing whatsoever to do with IPOB.\n\nIts chairman, Prof Banji Akintoye, made the clarification in his response to allegation by presidential spokesperson, Garba Garba Shehu, that it was shocking that Yoruba nation advocates were throwing their lot in with IPOB, a designated terrorist organisation, and that they would be judged by the company they kept.\n\nAkintoye, in a statement by his communications manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye replied: \u201cWe want to put it on record that IPOB is not in any way involved in the ongoing March in New York. The IPOB banner you saw was obviously planted by agents of the Nigerian government, masquerading as members of NINAS for photo shots which we have since unraveled and checkmated.\n\n\u201cWe say to the presidency that the unintelligent attempt to cause frictions and divisions between the Yoruba people in the West and the Igbo in the East is dead on arrival. We shall continue to collaborate peacefully for the salvation of our people\u2026\n\n\u201cWe shall resume the March on September 24, opposite the United Nations Headquarters to tell President Muhammad Buhari to his face that his Miyyetii Allah people are the enemy number one of the people of South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria and they are the authentic terrorists.\u201d\n\nAkintoye stated that the peaceful demonstration has succeeded in exposing to the world, the perceived ongoing genocide and fraud being perpetrated by the Fulani-controlled Nigerian government against the peoples of the South and Middle-Belt Regions of the country, through the imposed 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe renowned historian said rather than losing sleep and temper over the march, \u201cthe Nigerian government should, without further delay, declare Miyyetii Allah a terrorist organisation as being demanded by NINAS, saying, \u201cthe real terrorists in Nigeria are operating under Miyyetii Allah. Our demand remains conduct of a referendum so that the Indigenous people of the South and Middle-Belt of Nigeria can lawfully and legally decide on their nationhood and sovereignty. We demand for the immediate abolition of the imposed 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe demand an end to the genocide, being perpetrated by Miyyetii Allah against our people. Miyyetii Allah is a terrorist group and it should be declared such by the United Nations. The invasion of our land in the name of grazing is enough. What is happening in our territories today is state-sponsored terrorism and land grabbing not cow grazing.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "They are the high- flyers, the winners of The Sun Awards, 2020. These exceptional Nigerians hugged the broad landscape of excellence, resilience and doggedness with flourish. Like Eagles, they are far from the madding crowd. The best thrill and drama come in the rebound from the throes of incipient defeat to the glitter ring of impetuosity of the gallant. From the alluring world of excellence, they stirred a rude awakening to resilience. And from the doggedness of their tour de force, a lease of hope is implanted.\n\nFrom politics, governance, philanthropy, investments, business, hospitality, long service, entertainment, creativity, the nation harvested men and women of distinction, who pasted sunny smiles on a darkling patch of the otiose republic. Iconic governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, a never- say- die political broker, took the highway of belligerence in astute defiance of popular values. He crushed and flushed out the ravages of CO- VID-19 in his state. With astonishing speed, he was firm, bold, courageous, determined, productive, progressive and unwavering as he rallied the odds in the treasure base of the nation where he rules in situ. He typifies the daring, all action leader and earned the sobriquet \u201cMr Project\u201d even in the grim times. He affected the news and lives for good or ill. Take Mele Kyary and dissect. In addition to the record breaking N287 billion profits posted for 2020, the best since inception 44 years ago, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) which he heads published the audited financial statements (AFS). It was trailblazing and a whiff of good fortune in a beleaguered entity and time. Examine Yahaya Bello, a young Turk and governor of Kogi State. Under the sun, he seized the imagination, carved out a panorama, built a niche in a troubled time. His dubiety, skepticism and non- conformist posture to the existence of the rampaging Coronavirus disease raised storms and tantrums. His head was unbowed. He held the state aloft from the malady and sallied to a berth. In this thread are stimulating samplers that form a rare ingathering of strides in his governance of the state. What he has done to make his state safe is a study in strategy and determination. When you talk of the governor of Kano, the lines of doggedness fall in pleasant places. In a season of turmoil, his reforms, bold initiatives and economic engineering engendered a talismanic view of a state burdened with poverty. And with him, the view that ICONs are made in heaven becomes inviolable. With measured steps, Yobe State governor and caretake chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mai Mala Buni, holds and strikes the gavel in an undulating, back- breaking political terrain, snaking and winding around the labyrinthine to stay the party on the path. It was resilience in the age of stupid. It was the myth of resilience unbound. On the unfurling scroll, but in no way less deserving, are other doers and climbers whose dints affronted the dowdy layers of commonness and lack of motion. The likes of irrepressible Betty Akeredolu nee Anyanwu, who, as the lead lady in Ondo State, headlined a flush of spousal support, philanthropy and activism rolled into one. Like the legendary Joan of Arc, she rode the storms and undid ties in a close interethnic marriage of three decades on and more. Barrister Allen Onyema and Dr. Adedeji Adeleke double down the road of philanthropy. Ideally dubbed the patriot with the air of peace, the former, amidst a coterie of acts of big heart, cut the edge in bounteous airlift of Nigerians stranded in the wake of the xenophobic attacks in South Africa. The latter, a champion of dignified charity giving, belongs to the pantheon of informal angels. For littering the space with investments, Prince Chris Igwe and High Chief Frank Okafor are adorned with the robe of honour. Seplat\u2019s ABC Orjiakor and Slot\u2019s Nnamdi Ezeigbo take their slots for their groundbreaking entrepreneurship. And then comes Mustapha Ado, Ebuka Onunkwo, Mohammed Buba Marwa, Shuiab Ibrahim, Obinna iyiego (Obi Cubana) and Kanayo O kanayo. They represent a bellowing tendency in industrialization, public service, hospitality and the revered Nollywood. And when the bugle for long service and sports sound, Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, Moses Ekpo, George Obiozor and Philip Shaibu\u2019s names ring with the sound. Here\u2019s a time of reckoning, a page of honour, a momento to hold, and a light to illuminate the greasy void that pulsates the nation. These are the winners of The Sun Awards 2020.",

          "text": "\u2022Gas transportation code attracts $1bn investment\n\n\u2022Regulator calls for industry collaboration on PIA\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nBuoyed by an impressive revenue performance, which has seen it generating 70 per cent of its initial target of N3.2 trillion, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has raised the bar and now targets N5 trillion income by year-end\n\nThe oil and gas industry regulator noted that the recently launched gas transportation network code had already generated over $1 billion in investments. It called for industry synergy to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s vision for the sector was realised.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to the Abuja head office of Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Dr. Bello Gusau, Executive Secretary of DPR, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, explained that as of the end of August, over 70 per cent of the initial N3.2 trillion revenue target had been realised, making the organisation to set a new N5 trillion target.\n\nAuwalu said he was at the PTDF headquarters as part of efforts to strengthen collaboration with other agencies in the oil and gas sector, stating that as a capacity building organisation, PTDF and DPR have a lot in common. He said plans were already in place to pursue the new revenue target, hinting that parties in the years between 2005 and 2007 oil bid rounds have started paying part of their signature bonuses to halt the activation of the \u201cno work programme\u201d bond.\n\nThe DPR executive secretary explained, \u201cLast year, we exceeded our revenue target. We were given N1.5 trillion, but we were able to generate N2.7 trillion for government and this year, our revenue budget was N3.2 trillion and as of August, we had generated up to 70 per cent. So, it is obvious that this year, we are going to exceed the target.\n\n\u201cWe are targeting N5 trillion for government, but as it is now, the N3.2 trillion as of 30 August, we had generated 70 per cent. So, with September to December, it is obvious the 30 per cent will be a walkover.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the fiscal part of the PIA and there are the 2005, 2006, 2007 bid rounds, which bonds were attached to the PSC blocks, but were not activated. They were based on work programmes. So, if you don\u2019t do work programme, we will activate the bond for you to pay and the bond is handsome. We have budgeted it in our revenue.\u201d\n\nAuwalu pointed out that because some of the bid block owners did not want the clause used, they had started writing to the DPR to pay certain percentages of their signature bonuses, so that they would retain the assets and delay activation of the clause.\n\n\u201cThey feel that if they retain the block, they will enter into the new fiscal terms and that has immensely generated serious revenue to the signature bonus account,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nWhile calling on the PTDF to be part of the work programme scheme, which will give them a full view of all the programmes in the industry, Auwalu said it was high time the industry started exporting skills to neighbouring countries that were just discovering oil. He stressed that with the recognition of seven new basins, including Sokoto, Upper Benue, Chad, Anambra, Dahomey, and the traditional Niger Delta basins, the PTDF had to fully work with sister organisations for new skills in the sector.\n\nHe stated that the leadership of the steering committee for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was clear-headed enough to deliver on its mandate and ensure that the right thing was done.\n\nAuwalu stated that with the national oil and gas excellence centre working with the PIA implementation committee, there was a lot of untapped potential to be explored, adding that the centre now has the capacity to see every reservoir with the latest hardware and software.\n\nAccording to Auwalu, \u201cWe have 7,100 discovered reservoirs in Nigeria, but we are producing from 1,331. We have producing reservoirs of 1,700, but we are not producing from all these oil and gas reservoirs. We have 18 billion barrels of oil in P3 reserves and in P2 areas.\n\n\u201cWe have 68 TCF of gas in P2 areas and 70 per cent of this can be produced, giving us capacity to migrate and increase our reserve base as a nation and that was achieved after the establishment of NOGEC centre.\u201d\n\nAuwalu said with the help of the gas transportation network code that had registered shippers, aggregators, and gas producers in the network, investment generation exceeding $1 billion had been achieved.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to push until we are satisfied that history has been made and the country is de-risked and there\u2019s more investment coming into the country,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn his remarks, Gusau stated that the managements of both organisations were sorting out all the issues raised during the PTDF\u2019s earlier visit to the DPR. He expressed appreciation to Auwalu for the collaboration.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How BFree is improving trust in the lending space",
          "text": "A few months ago, Udoma Nseobong took a \u20a630,000 ($60) loan from CashLion Credit. He repaid the weekly interest consistently for six weeks until his final payment.\n\nUnfortunately, he defaulted on his final payment by a day due to unforeseen circumstances. This short period was enough time for Nseobong to be declared by CashLion credit as a fraudster on the run with his entire family to his contacts (OP: ICIR Nigeria).\n\nThis incident is one out of many which indicate that digital lenders will go the extra mile, sometimes using unethical methods, to get their loans back.\n\nNotably, despite the criticism against unethical practices by lenders, some still justify this method of debt collection.\n\n\u201cThere is no defamation of character involved when we trust people we\u2019ve never seen by giving them money and when it\u2019s time to pay they don\u2019t pay,\u201d Titilayo Adetonya, a customer representative for digital lender CashLion told The ICIR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lawful to send those messages to their contacts because we warn them before we send those messages to their contacts and that\u2019s how we get our money,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter many years of unending complaints, on August 17, the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), slammed Soko Loan Company Limited, a Nigerian digital lending platform, with a fine of \u20a610 million for privacy invasion. Soko Loan was found guilty of unilaterally sending privacy-invading messages to the loan defaulters\u2019 contacts.\n\nThis sanction, although a mere warning shot, is the first public attempt by NITDA to address this prevalent issue. The sanction served as a clarion call for digital lenders to use ethical alternative methods to collect loans.\n\nBut what does an ethical alternative look like and how effective is it?\n\nAn alternative approach\n\nJulian Flosbach knows what it\u2019s like to look for better alternatives, as he experienced it first hand when he was the general manager at FairMoney, a Nigeria-based digital lender turned digital bank. He helped grow the company from 8 employees to over 120 employees; and in that same period, Julian also supervised doling out loans to over a million customers.\n\n\u201cIn the early days when giving out a few loans, it\u2019s easy to have a team of five in charge of collections but as things scale up and you have to manage over one million borrowers you start reconsidering a few things,\u201d Julian said. \u201cWhen you have 100,000 defaulters [10% default rate], you have to ask yourself, \u2018Do I want to be a fintech lender or do I want to be a collection company?\u2019\n\nAt one point, FairMoney had as many as 80 employees managing collections in-house; but it quickly became clear that running in-house collections moved the company\u2019s focus away from its business model: giving out loans.\n\nSo the company decided to search for an external solution, and found themselves with the best available option at that time: business process outsourcing (BPO) firms who do customer service for big banks and telcos. But it didn\u2019t take long to see that there were some cracks in the collection process.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do collections with operational excellence then just calling customers actually doesn\u2019t always work. These BPOs don\u2019t have customised computer systems for collections, rather they have generic customer relationship management tools (CRMs) or predictive dialers. So for instance they call customers once a week, instead of when the customer actually should or wants to be called. It\u2019s not very efficient.\u201d\n\nThis harrowing experience led him to team up with Moses Nmor (Chief Product Officer), and Chukwudi Enyi (Chief Operations Officer) to start BFree, Africa\u2019s first digital credit collection company. All three co-founders worked together at FairMoney.\n\nThe company saw an opportunity to be one of the less than ten digital credit collection companies grappling for a slice of a $14.4b credit collection market in emerging markets. In emerging markets, BFree\u2019s competitors are India\u2019s Credgenics (recently raised $25m Series A) and CreditMate (backed by Paytm), FLOW in Singapore and Blu365 in Brazil.\n\nIn the space of over a year since it launched, BFree has grown to nearly 460,000 active customers from over 20 lenders in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nWhat does Ethical credit management look like?\n\nLooking away from the approach of other debt collection solutions, most of which thrive on humiliating customers, BFree focuses on ethics and technology in debt recovery.\n\nBFree helps lenders collect loans from their borrowers for a fee. The company charges a commission on the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size and quality amongst other factors.\n\nBFree\u2019s ethical approach to loan recovery is guided by a data-backed belief that the majority of customers take a loan with the intention to repay. Of course, with the exception of isolated cases of fraudsters and fraud victims.\n\nThis approach is validated by the fact that the average 90 days default rate of Nigeria\u2019s top digital lending companies is 10% \u2014 FairMoney (10%), Carbon (11%), Branch (<10%). This means that only about 10% of Nigerians (there\u2019s no central register, but Flosbach estimates about 10-15 million people) default on loans.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the customers (70-75%) fall into the category of folks that want to pay but cannot repay. This is usually due to loss of income \u2014 loss of job or the business went bad or there was an emergency that took away the money.\u201d\n\nThis is a common case in a country like Nigeria where people live from hand to mouth. Without insurance, anything can topple their sustainability.\n\nAt BFree customers are appraised based on two factors: willingness and capability to pay.\n\n\u201cWhen a lender like Branch or FairMoney gives us a portfolio, we assess and underwrite the loan. We take their behavioural data and build two things: collectability score and use case. Then we move these into a collection funnel.\u201d\n\nThis debt collection process basically starts as a self-service platform where customers can log in and see their own repayment plans. At this phase, customers get SMS messages and perform loan repayment activities themselves. This way BFree reduces the number of man-hours spent on making calls and customers aren\u2019t forced to deal with unexpected phone calls during working hours.\n\nIn the case where a customer defaults, BFree reaches out to the borrower to find out why and to also get a promised date of payment (verbal agreement). This simply involves reaching out and asking them for when they\u2019ll be able to make a payment. Based on the agreed dates, automated reminders are put in place.\n\nBFree operates call centres with about 200 agents who are responsible for reaching out to customers. BFree\u2019s goal is to make the process of debt recovery 95% automated in the next few years.\n\n\u201cThe story of collections has gotten bad press with BPOs taking data and threatening customers. Automating this process helps remove the risk of this happening because a bot will never threaten a customer.\u201c\n\nWhat happens when customers default\n\nFlosbach acknowledges that one of the inherent risks of lending is that you have to accept that there\u2019s always going to be default. He believes that the way out here is to accept that some customers won\u2019t repay, and assist customers that will repay as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no portfolio in the world that doesn\u2019t have default. In this case, you have to assess whether it\u2019s a natural default or an operational default.\u201d\n\nIn a natural default, the customers don\u2019t repay because of an unexpected occurrence like a health emergency. When this happens the best case is to re-assess the customer status and agree on a different repayment plan.\n\n\u201cWe should normalize the fact that customers have financial emergencies, the same way nobody blames people for going to the doctor when they fall unexpectedly sick.\u201c\n\nIn an operational default customers don\u2019t repay because of a flaw in the loan collection process. For example, customers don\u2019t get the right repayment plan or they\u2019re not aware of how to make the repayment i.e they don\u2019t know which bank account to pay to.\n\nBFree\u2019s process helps to ensure that operational default decreases as much as possible. So far 95% of customers have rated their experience with BFree as good or satisfactory, a hint that the company\u2019s approach is effective.\n\nAs lending expands beyond an activity being performed by only traditional banks and digital lenders to one that almost every company can, BFree\u2019s value proposition remains relevant.\n\nFlosbach believes that BFree\u2019s ultimate goal is to increase trust in the African lending space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasing trust in the financial retail market by decreasing risk and giving businesses a better margin.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

According to Crunchbase, the startup has so far raised $156.7 million in funding.\n\nIn over five years of operation, Jumo claims to have enabled the disbursement of more than $3 billion in loans and reached over 18 million customers and small businesses. It has a client base that includes Uber, Barclays Bank, Ecobank, Tigo, Airtel, and now MTN and MANSA Bank.\n\n\u201cJumo is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for large banks to deploy capital to new market segments,\u201d said Buhle Goslar, Jumo\u2019s Africa CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about bringing our proven business model to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and working with our partners to create positive outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe partnership with MANSA and MTN is the first of its kind for Jumo in Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into last year.

The result is that access to the internet has become ubiquitous in many of the densely populated areas across the enormous country.\n\nCitizens in Sudan \u201crely heavily on mobile data as the primary means to keep its populace connected to the rest of the world,\u201d says the report.\n\nAlgeria is second-cheapest at $0.51, while Somalia takes the third-cheapest slot on the continent, at $0.60 per 1GB of mobile data.\n\nConsumer telecoms analyst at Cable, Dan Howdle, said countries with the cheapest rates of mobile data have excellent mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure, making it easier for service providers in those markets to be able to offer large amounts of data, which brings down the price per gigabyte.\n\n\u201cOthers with less advanced broadband networks are heavily reliant on mobile data and the economy dictates that prices must be low, as that\u2019s what people can afford,\u201d said Howdle in the report.\n\nSudan, with a population of more than 45 million and at least 13 million internet subscribers is at par with Italy ($0.27), but trails Israel ($0.05), Kyrgyzstan ($0.15) and Fiji ($0.19), in the global ranking.\n\nPhoto by Kojo Kwarteng on Unsplash\n\nInternet data costs per region in Africa\n\nOther African countries that charge mobile internet subscribers less than $1 to browse the web and run mobile apps are Ghana ($0.66), Libya ($0.74), Tanzania ($0.75), Mauritius ($0.75), Nigeria ($0.88), Cameroon ($0.90) and Senegal ($0.94).\n\nThe report, which featured more than 230 countries across 12 regions and compared the cost of 1GB from over 6,000 mobile data plans, also pointed out that North Africa (at an average of $1.53) has the cheapest data plans in the world.\n\nAlgeria (16), Libya (30) and Morocco (45) are in the World\u2019s top 50 while Egypt (55) Tunisia (59) and Mauritania feature in the top 100 global list.\n\nHowever, Egypt ($1.04), Tunisia ($1.09) and Mauritania ($5.56) charge more than $1 for 1GB of data.\n\nKenya and South Africa, with advanced mobile infrastructure and high internet traffic, fall far behind the top 100 list, with charges of $2.25 and $2.67 per gigabyte of data respectively\n\nThe cost of data in these two countries, however, is cheaper than the global average of $4.07. According to the report, South Africa and Kenya are considered competitive mobile markets with the prices of these \u2018wealthy nations\u2019 not necessarily considered expensive by customers.\n\n\u201cMany countries in the middle of the list have good infrastructure and competitive mobile markets, and while their prices aren\u2019t among the cheapest in the world they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be considered expensive by its consumers,\u201d says the report.\n\nSouth Africa and Kenya have rolled out commercial 5G networks in their markets.

          "title": "Why mortgage banks still struggle despite N29bn intervention",
          "text": "Notwithstanding their recapitalisation and consolidation plus the intervention of the Nigerian Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC), Nigeria\u2019s primary mortgage banks (PMBs) are still struggling with liquidity issues.\n\nThe recapitalisation and consolidation, which saw the capital base of the PMBs move from N100 million to N5 billion for national operation and N2.5 billion for regional operation, also dragged down the number of the banks from about 83 to below 40.\n\nExperts say these exercises were expected to serve as launch pads for the growth of the banks. The setting up of NMRC, they add, raised that expectation, but it all seems to be a dashed dream.\n\nAs a private sector-led mortgage refinancing company, NMRC has the public purpose of promoting homeownership for Nigerians while deepening liquidity in the mortgage market by raising long-term funds from the capital market.\n\nAccess to affordable housing finance is still a huge problem to many Nigerians who would rather buy, but have resorted to renting their accommodation. As a result, the rental market has become a \u201ckilling field\u201d where renters are at the mercy of landlords. BusinessDay findings reveal that, as a result of rising costs, especially those of building materials, rents have gone up by over 50 percent in the last 24 months and, according to Bismarck Rewane, CEO, Financial Derivatives Company, rents will still go up in the months ahead, citing poor economic condition that has left more Nigerians poorer.\n\nIn most of the South Western cities, rental homes are getting more and more expensive as professionals and young families struggle to pay exorbitant rents demanded by landlords. This is driven largely by shortage in affordable homes and lack of a functional system that guarantees affordable mortgages for home buyers.\n\nMany professionals struggle with the high cost of living close to their offices, except high-income earners who can afford expensive rents in the city centres. While most families still earn the same salary before and after COVID-19 pandemic, cost of living including food and house prices keep sky-rocketing.\n\nRead also: Nigerian banks grow profit by most in 7yrs despite limited cash\n\nNMRC had raised a total of N19 billion from the capital market to refinance mortgage loans provided by partnering mortgage and commercial banks. It raised N8 billion in July 2015 and N11 billion in June 2018. That was expected to bring vibrancy to the illiquid PMBs who were to on-lend their refinanced mortgages to loan applicants for home purchases. But that remains to be seen.\n\nA mortgage bank operator, who does not want to be named, explains to BusinessDay that many of his colleagues either do not qualify or cannot access the NMRC refinancing due to the interest rate, which is not much different from the open market rate.\n\n\u201cThe original intention of NMRC is to increase liquidity in the mortgage market by raising long-term funds and dragging down interest rate to single digits; but that is yet to happen,\u201d the operator notes, corroborating Charles Inyangete, NMRC\u2019s former CEO\u2019s view that the market was still not mature for single-digit interest rate.\n\nNMRC has just raised fresh funds totalling N10 billion from the capital market, and this plus the earlier raised equal to N29 billion. Kehinde Ogundimu, the company\u2019s CEO, hopes that \u201cthe proceeds of the new fund would be used to refinance existing and conforming mortgage loans.\n\n\u201cThis issuance demonstrates NMRC\u2019s commitment to the provision of affordable liquidity to the mortgage market by attracting long-term funding into the housing finance industry from the capital markets.\u201d\n\nHe also hopes that the new interest rate regime would reduce the rate at which the primary mortgage institutions on-lend to their customers and, in the long-term, substantially drive reduction in mortgage interest rates as well as translate to cost reductions in housing construction finance.\n\nBut worried about the deepening crisis in the housing sector, BusinessDay asks questions as to whether the PMBs are truly deploying their finances they got from NMRC.\n\nAdeniyi Akinlusi, former president of Mortgage Bankers Association of Nigeria (MBAN) and also former CEO of Trustbond Mortgage Bank, says they are. \u201cYes, we are. We are creating mortgages,\u201d he affirms.\n\nMortgages are loans, meaning that they come with interest rates. Typical mortgage interest rates in Nigeria range between 6-10 percent for the National Housing Fund (NHF) and between 15-25 percent for commercial mortgage institutions.\n\nBesides the interest payable, the potential loan seeker must also have a certain percentage of the total amount needed for home purchase readily available. This amount is known as equity and should range between 20-30 percent of the total cost of the home.\n\nSo, in Nigeria, if a home buyer takes a mortgage loan of N25 million at 15 percent per annum interest rate, he would have paid N37.9 million in interest-only over the 15-year period. This is more than the principal itself.\n\nThe trick here is that at 15 percent interest rate, it takes a lender approximately seven years to recover the N25 million he lends out. That becomes about six years if the interest rate is 20 percent.\n\nThis is why, with that sort of interest rate, industry experts argue if there is anyone who can honestly afford a mortgage loan on a steady salary. This also explains why, at 0.6 percent mortgages to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate, Nigeria lags Ghana\u2019s 2 percent, South Africa\u2019s 30 percent, the US and UK rate at 60 percent and 70 percent, respectively.",

          "text": "Nigerian authorities will on September 17 and 20, 2021 hold virtual meetings with potential investors for the proposed $3bn Eurobond issuance, according to the Debt Management Office (DMO).\n\nThrough the issuance, Nigeria, currently rated B2 (Negative) by Moody\u2019s, B- (Stable) by S&P and, B (Stable) by Fitch, hopes to raise up to USD$3 billion but not more than USD$6.2 billion.\n\n\u201cThis means that after meeting with investors on September 17 and 20, we could issue on 21 if market conditions are good,\u201d a top official told BusinessDay.\n\nThe last time Nigeria accessed the International Capital Market (ICM) was in November 2018, but had been keenly planning a return to the market as revenues shrink amid bloated budget deficits.\n\nIn order to avail local investors the opportunity to invest in the Eurobonds, meetings will also be held with local investors.\n\nThis is the first time local investors will be included in the Roadshows, and for this reason, a Nigerian Bookrunner (Chapel Hill Denham Advisory Services Ltd) was appointed as one of the Transaction Advisers.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria Redeems $500mn Eurobond\n\nOther advisers include: JP Morgan, Citigroup Global Markets Limited as International Bookrunners; Standard Chartered Bank and Goldman Sachs are the Joint Lead Managers; . FSDH Merchant Bank Ltd was selected as the Financial Adviser; White & Case LLP as International Legal Adviser ; and Banwo & Ighodalo, as Nigerian Legal Adviser.\n\nSince the ICM debut in 2011, Nigerian investors have always participated in the biding process, including banks, insurance companies and PFAs.\n\n\u201cBut the advantage now of having a Nigerian book runner is to allow us to be able to talk to our own local investors here since they continue to show interest. For free marketing, they will also be making inquiries just like the foreign investors,\u201d Oniha had told BusinessDay in a chat.\n\nThe fresh issuance for which all statutory approvals have been received, is for the purpose of implementing the New External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nProceeds are for the financing of various projects in the Act, the DMO said.\n\nIn addition to providing funding to part-finance the deficit in the 2021 Appropriation Act, the issuance of Eurobonds by Nigeria benefits the country in many other strategic ways.\n\nOther benefits include amongst others: to enable an inflow of foreign exchange, leading to an increase in External Reserves, which then help support the Naira Exchange Rate, and Nigeria\u2019s sovereign rating.\n\nAlso when Nigeria raises funds externally, through Eurobonds, it frees up space in the domestic market for private sector and sub-national borrowers. In effect, it helps the sovereign not to crowd out other borrowers in the domestic market.\n\nThe issuance of Eurobonds by Nigeria has opened up opportunities for Nigeria\u2019s corporate sector notably banks, to issue Eurobonds to raise capital in the ICM. By so doing, their capital base has been strengthened to provide banking services whilst also meeting regulatory requirements. Meanwhile, Nigeria has a sovereign yield curve in the ICM, extending up to 30 years.\n\nAlso, the local listing of Nigeria\u2019s Eurobonds on the Nigerian Exchange Ltd. and the FMDQ Securities Exchange Ltd., have increased the range of products on these two (2) exchanges and their respective market capitalization.\n\nOverall, Eurobond issuances by Nigeria and the investor meetings that precede the pricing, have provided a strong global platform for Nigeria to tell its own story and opportunities available in Nigeria for investors.",

          "text": "The Nigerian film industry, Nollywood, produced its highest movies in five years in the second quarter (Q2) of 2021, but piracy is crimping the industry\u2019s profitability.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nollywood produced 635 movies in Q2\u2019 2021 compared with 626 movies produced in the same period last year. Its growth in Q2\u2019 2021 is the highest compared with the same period in the last five years.\n\n\u201cPiracy tops the list of the film industry\u2019s many challenges fuelled by weak enforcement of Nigeria\u2019s copyright law,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest note.\n\n\u201cIn the digital era of today, piracy has morphed into illegal download and distribution of movies without paying for them. Other challenges include lack of financing, poor infrastructure, and inadequate capacity,\u201d the analysts say.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, for every legitimate copy (of a Nigerian film) sold, nine others are pirated. As at 2014, an estimated N82 billion was reported to have been lost by Nollywood alone to piracy. There are currently few legal channels for exporting movies; little or no returns go to the film makers.\n\nChallenges such as lack of financing and poor infrastructure also hinder Nollywood\u2019s full potential.\n\nNollywood is the second largest film producer globally in terms of value, the number of annual films, revenue, and popularity, second only to India\u2019s Bollywood.\n\nThe industry\u2019s radical growth in movie production occurred in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and cinemas were shut.\n\nFilm producers took advantage of the pandemic-fuelled video streaming trend on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and other indigenous digital platforms, a movie producer told BusinessDay.\n\nRead also: Abuja to overtake Lagos as Nigeria\u2019s movie production up by 53%\n\nNetflix, for instance, recorded an additional 37 million paid memberships last year.\n\nThe Nigerian entertainment sector was identified as one of the priority sectors in the 2017-2020 Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) because it represents a potential growth driver for the economy.\n\nNollywood is a significant part of the Arts, Entertainment and Recreation Sector that contributed 2.3 percent to Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2016, but its contribution declined to 1.22 percent in Q2\u2019 2021.\n\nDespite its huge economic potentials for transforming Nigeria\u2019s economic status, its continued growth hinges on the sector\u2019s ability to address certain challenges.\n\nHowever, the key to unlocking Nollywood\u2019s full potential is in addressing these challenges, according to experts.\n\nPwC, a leading consulting firm, has projected that Nigeria\u2019s Entertainment and Media (E&M) industry\u2019s revenue will rise from $7.68 billion in 2021 to $14.82 billion in 2025.\n\nAnalysts at FBNQuest recommend that given the recent popularity of video streaming, the industry must also take advantage of improving internet penetration to expand the reach of its offerings.\n\nAlso, collaborations and co-productions with global film producers are encouraged to increase the industry\u2019s exportable content and improve its visibility outside of Africa.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nFounder, Igbo Youth Movement (IYM) and Secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko has commended Igbo national assembly members for making effort to find solution to ongoing security challenge in the Southeast, but warned that lasting peace will continue to elude the country until there is power devolution.\n\nUko who is also Deputy Secretary of Igbo leaders of Thought, in a statement on Thursday, however, noted that the steps taken by the Igbo national assembly members, \u201cto engage the agitators and seek political solution to the agitation, is very commendable.\u201d\n\nRecall that National Assembly members comprising senators and members of the House of Representatives from Southeast Nigeria under the umbrella of Southeast National Assembly Caucus, had in a communique after their meeting in Abuja yesterday, condemned the destruction of lives and property in the zone by hoodlums enforcing a sit-at-home order issued by the Indigenous People of Nigeria (IPOB), even when the separatist group had cancelled the order, noting that it has set up a committee to interface with the federal government and other stakeholders to check the menace.\n\nThe lawmakers had also resolved to intervene on the detention of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the IPOB, whose arrest and detention by the federal government prompted the sit-at-home protests and violence that has followed.\n\nReacting to the intervention of the lawmakers, Uko said they have done well and therefore should be supported.\n\nHe noted that, \u201cIgnoring the agitation, staying aloof and shying away from reality, will never resolve the crisis.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow that they have stood up to be counted, it is imperative they go the whole hog, and initiate talks with the central government.\n\n\u201cIt may be time to partner with other regions and articulate the grievances driving the agitation, bring stakeholders together, and sincerely search for a mutual meeting point with the federal authorities.\n\n\u201cThe delay in doing this over the years, actually hurt early reconciliation and resolution. Rekindling the search for resolution, peace,harmony and closure, is the way to go.\u201d\n\nUko called on all stakeholders to join hands with the lawmakers and other Igbo leaders with a view to finding solutions to the challenges in the region, but noted that true solution lies in the ending the suffocating unitary structure of the Nigerian federation, which according to him, is responsible for the agitations.\n\nHe said, \u201cI therefore call on all and sundry, to join hands and assist in any way they can in the duty of restoring sanity to our land.\n\n\u201cIt may be important to remind our politicos, that search for a resolution of the matter under the current unitary system is an insincere and unhelpful gambit, as the choking and suffocating unitary structure, is actually at the root of the frustrations fuelling the agitation.\n\n\u201cAny search for resolution, that doesn\u2019t include the reconstruction of the polity, may not resolve the loss of faith driving the agitation.\n\n\u201cSincerely facing the truth and commitedly working with others to seek an all encompassing roadmap agreeable to all, should be their guiding compass.\n\n\u201cToo much time had been wasted already, many avoidable mistakes made. The lack of appreciation of the truth, that was responsible for the mishandling of the earlier peace process four years ago, must not be repeated.\n\n\u201cI also call on the agitators to humbly cooperate with the peace process. I disagree with those suggesting that the legislators are not sincere.\n\n\u201cI believe the legislators are sincere because I know they don\u2019t know an alternative route of escape from the crisis.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no alternative. There\u2019s no better alternative to engagement, dialogue, peaceful agreement and closure.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, I commend the Southern Governors Forum for their sagacity and their newfound dedication to the truth and dynamism. The people are with them and are very proud of their steps so far. Nigeria needs an overhaul, struggling to avoid the needful overhauling is unintelligent and dangerous.\u201d",

          "title": "How To Dethrone Buhari Before 2023, By SKC Ogbonnia",
          "text": "\u201cFellow countrymen and women\u2026You are all living witnesses to the great economic predicament and uncertainty, which an inept and corrupt leadership has imposed on our beloved nation for the past four years. I am referring to the harsh, intolerable conditions under which we are now living. Our economy has been hopelessly mismanaged. We have become a debtor and beggar nation.\u201d\n\nFellow Nigerians, the above quotation is culled from the coup speech which Major-General Muhammadu Buhari and his military colleagues used to overthrow a democratically elected government in 1984.\n\nTODAY, the current situation in our country is far worse than what were referred to as \u201cintolerable condition\u201d in 1984. We are no longer talking about the condition of the economy which has since gone comatose under President Buhari. The battle cry is no longer about corruption, where many surveys find Nigeria as the worst offender. The current situation is so intolerable that no one is talking about the condition where a sitting president and his family brandish ostentatious wealth looted from public treasury while the moping masses continue wallow in abject poverty and despair. Nobody is even talking about the fact that the country has become the poverty capital of the world under the same man.\n\nToday, the \u201cintolerable condition\u201d is about something far more consequential: Insecurity. It is about human life. It is about the fact that nobody and nowhere is safe.\n\nToday, \u201cforeign\u201d Fulani Herdsmen are maiming and killing the people of the Middle Belt and Southern Nigeria with impunity. The situation in Buhari\u2019s region of the core North is even worse: While Boko Haram terrorism reigns in the Northeast, bandits and brigands have continued to terrorize the Northwest with reckless abandon, as citizens flee to the neighboring countries in fear of their dear lives. What is more? The President and Commander-in-Chief of Nigerian Armed Forces is known to be aiding and abetting these terrorist acts against his own people. Worse still, critics with mass appeal are commonly hounded and incarcerated.\n\nFellow Countrymen and women,\n\nEnough is enough! We must not wait forever before demonstrating serious consequences for Buhari\u2019s history of treasonable felony, including his ongoing reign of terror. Where there are no consequences for bad behavior, the bad behavior is bound to worsen. The gist is that President Muhammadu Buhari has ruined Nigeria down to its lowest ebb and any failure to dethrone him before 2023 is to set a very dangerous precedent for the country.\n\nThe delay to dethrone the dictator is because the Nigerian Legislature has failed to act in line with the Constitution. The reason for this failure is plain: The federal lawmakers and the president are partners in crime. They are united by a common bond of state corruption anchored with pagan impunity. These leaders also assume immunity to the incessant terrorism, as their families and estates are fully guarded by state security network.\n\nYet, a common excuse being bandied in the land is that the lawmakers from Northern Nigeria will not be in haste to impeach Buhari since his deputy, Yemi Osinbajo, a southerner, would automatically inherit the presidency. The proponents claim it is better to allow the president to serve out his two terms so that the process of power rotation can be preserved.\n\nBut such reasons are pure baloney. In fact, common sense is clear on this matter: Dictators who commit the level of atrocities being witnessed under General Muhammadu Buhari would never hand over power through a true democratic process. Even if such dictators would entertain any form of transition, they are bound to handpick clones of themselves who can deepen their evil policies.\n\nMoreover, the Buhari leadership crisis knows no boundaries. Thus, the Nigerian masses\u2014north and south\u2014now care less about the tribe, religion, or the political shade of Buhari\u2019s successor insofar the Nigeria\u2019s worst president in history becomes history. Put it this way: the dethronement of Muhammadu Buhari is no longer a question of WHY; it is now a question of HOW.\n\nThe first order of business is for the suffering masses to recognize their true enemies. Instead of Muhammadu Buhari, who is shamelessly irredeemable, the resentment should be directed towards the legislators who have the constitutional obligation to remove the dreadful leader from office.\n\nThis is where a sincere opposition matters most. The opposition leaders are making efforts vocalizing the crisis, quite alright, but they are not leading. Effective leadership demands uniting people towards a common purpose.\n\nAs the Minority Leader in the Senate, Senator Eyinnaya Abaribe should\u2014without further delay\u2014craft step-by-step action plans for the dethronement of Muhammadu Buhari, including any of the regime\u2019s henchmen, who may constitute an impediment to the success of post-impeachment power play.\n\nAn objective approach is a combination of geographic and political incrementalism, where broad support at the National Assembly is attained in segments, staking both political and regional interests. Importantly, the names of the lawmakers who oppose the impeachment must be made public.\n\nThe lobbying should start from the caucus of South-East and South-South zones in the National Assembly. Impeaching Buhari is a \u2018Christmas in June\u2019 for the people of this region. This is the stronghold of the opposition by virtue of political affiliation. Further, the region is the ground zero of Buhari\u2019s vendetta politics.\n\nThe next is the Southwest caucus. Any motion seeking the dethronement of a dictator will always sail through in this zone. Besides being the natural bastion of opposition movement in the country, Western Nigeria boasts of the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of pro-democracy activists, the media, and a balanced civil society.\n\nIn short, the whole South is certain. The bipartisan unity among the Southern governors to oppose Buhari\u2019s open grazing policy is a profound testimony.\n\nEnter the North. Demonstrate that the region is not monolithic, after all.\n\nThe Middle Belt is a huge opening. This zone is the epicenter of the state-sponsored terrorism. There is no better opportunity to test the much-touted Southern Nigeria-Middle Belt alliance than through the impeachment of the terrorist leader.\n\nCracking the core North is actually not as difficult as being bandied. Stake social, as well as political interests. Highlight the fact that the people of Northwest and Northeast are the worst victims of the Buhari policies. Target the Fulani elites whose brand has been badly damaged worldwide because of the foolishness of one man. Follow with the fact that Buhari\u2019s reign of terror has become the biggest threat to the very idea of \u201cone Nigeria\u201d, which the North now holds so dear.\n\nThe order above is futile without sustained pressure by the masses. Nigerians can take a page from the various revolutionary scripts General Buhari promoted before he gained power in 2015. Of particular attention is when he challenged fellow citizens to emulate the Arab Spring where \u201ca series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions\u201d were used to dethrone corrupt regimes in North Africa. However, instead of \u201carmed rebellions\u201d as then advanced by citizen Buhari, it is imperative that the Nigerian model is peaceful.\n\nYet, a major factor in the success of the Arab Spring is that it embodied serious consequences against politicians opposed to the sweeping changes. The Nigerian legislators cannot continue to hide behind the Buhari baggage to absolve blame. Therefore, rather than gathering at public squares, where armed security can easily disperse them, the protesters should target the various country homes in the different constituencies of the specific legislators who oppose the impeachment of Buhari.\n\nAgain, the protests should be nonviolent, but it must be sufficiently far-reaching to alert these legislators that it is no longer business as usual. This thinking mirrors an admonition from Buhari\u2019s Minister of Transport, Chubuike Amaechi, that Nigerian politicians have continued to misbehave because the followers do not \u201cstone\u201d them. The Nigerian armed forces should equally refuse \u201cto be used to attack the forces of change\u201d in line with Buhari\u2019s directive as stated in one of his various calls for revolution during the Jonathan era.\n\nTo reclaim our country from the terrorist regime requires active participation of every patriot, no matter the religion, political party, tribe, or the location in the globe. The Nigerians in the Diaspora, most of whom are victims of the gross injustice at home, have important role to play. They have every reason to harken to Buhari\u2019s very idea of Arab Spring by maximizing their influence at every opportunity, including the ongoing protests at the United Nations in New York, to garner the desired support from foreign governments. There is also the need to heighten the current efforts to ensure that the foreign land is no longer a safe haven for the corrupt leaders from the homeland.\n\nDr. SKC Ogbonnia, 2019 APC Presidential Aspirant, writes from New York, New York.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nDisclaimer: Views expressed in the opinion section are those of the authors and don\u2019t reflect the editorial policy of this newspaper.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has tasked the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) other agencies and stakeholders in identity management to intensify efforts to achieve a complete and sustainable national database for Nigeria to help in policy formulation for the country.\n\nThe President gave the task while delivering his address during events to commemorate the 3rd National Identity Day 2021, organised by NIMC, which held at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Thursday.\n\nDescribing the theme of the event \u201cIdentity, a Tool for Sustainable Digital Economy and National Security,\u201d as apt, the President, who was represented by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ibrahim Pantami, noted that the enrolment of National Identification Number (NIN), which is being undertaken by NIMC was key to addressing most of the nation\u2019s problems.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe stressed that digital identity would make for easy planning and would assist in critical decision making in sectors such as health, education, agriculture, women and youth development and as well in tackling unemployment.\n\n\u201cNIMC and the National Population Commission (NPC) must join hands to establish a complete database,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cdigital identity is prerequisite to success of the national economy and getting the national security right.\u201d\n\nNIMC has in the last couple of months captured over 63 million Nigerians in the National Identity Database (NIDB) in the ongoing integration process of NIN and Subscriber Identification Module (SIM). This got a boost on September 2, 2021, when the commission received N25 billion approved by President Buhari for improved condition of service, salary upgrade as well a upgrade and replacement of the NIMC Identity Infrastructure.\n\nThe President on Thursday also launched NIMC\u2019s New Identity Solution Products namely; NIMC MobileID App, Tokenization and Contactless Enrolment Solution and presented plagues to Front-End Partners (FEPs).\n\nPantami in his speech delivered by the Permanent Secretary in the Communication Ministry, Bitrus Nabasu Bako, noted that the event was to raise awareness and sensitise the citizenry about the pivotal role of digital identification in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur enthusiasm to build a local digital economy, curb widespread economic and social exclusion is hinged on the necessity to assign every Nigerian and legal resident with a unique identity,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Director General/Chief Executive Officer of NIMC, Aliyu Abubakar Aziz, in his progress report of the commission said with the support of President Buhari and the Minister, the commission has made tremendous achievements.\n\nHe added that without proper identity, people are excluded from basic services that provide foundation for support.\n\n\u201cA nation cannot truly be a sovereign state if it does not know its people or have a unique way to identify them. Government\u2019s knowledge of its people (citizens and residents) is fundamental to planning, governance, fiscal management, accountability, security, etc.\n\n\u201cEstablishing a foundational ID is the first step to empowering people & facilitating access to basic government services, civil registration & vital statistics system and the National Identity Management System have been designated as the foundational IDs in Nigeria,\u201d Aziz stated.",

And we must offer sincere gratitude to God and all who worked to make this happen.\n\n\u201cIt is the guiding principle of this management to work quietly to achieve the vision and mission of our hospital and reposition her appropriately in the comity of tertiary health institutions in Nigeria. We have driven this agenda by focusing steadily on the 3R mantra and refusing to be distracted.\u201d\n\nExplaining how the feat was achieved, the CMD said said,h \u201cthe MOU for Open Heart Surgery Missions was signed with the VOOM Foundation sometime in 2015/16.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThings went quiet until the MOU was reviewed with the Foundation in July/August 2019 and UCTH made a commitment to actualize the programme & domesticate open heart surgery in our hospital.

The group was also said to have been behind a deadly attack on US troops in Niger in 2017.\n\nThe Sahel\u2019s porous borders are often exploited by drug runners, people smugglers and militants such as the ISGS.\n\nJihadist attacks also spill into neighbouring Nigeria.\n\nFrench forces have been hunting jihadist cells in the region for years. In 2013, France intervened to prevent an al-Qaeda affiliate from taking over the Malian capital Bamako.\n\nThere are now two concurrent missions running in the Sahel \u2013 a UN peacekeeping mission, comprising 56 nations and 14,000 troops, and the French-led counter-terrorism mission Operation Barkhane, which is backed by US intelligence.\n\nIn June, Mr Macron announced that Operation Barkhane would end in its current form, and that French troops would be cut in the region over the course of several years. Last month, Chad announced it was halving its counter-terrorism force in the region.\n\nAfter announcing Sahrawi\u2019s death, Mr Macron added in a tweet: \u201cThe nation is thinking this evening of all its heroes who died for France in the Sahel in the Serval and Barkhane operations, of the bereaved families, of all its wounded.\n\n\u201cTheir sacrifice is not in vain. With our African, European and American partners, we will continue this fight.\u201d",

There was a huge Eritrean army presence there,\u201d Getachew Reda told the Reuters news agency. \u201cIf there were vigilante groups acting in the heat of the moment I cannot rule that out.\u201d\n\nInternational investigators were welcome to visit the area, he said.\n\nPrior to the Tigray conflict, Ethiopia hosted around 150,000 Eritrean refugees, fleeing poverty and an authoritarian government.\n\nMuch of the report focused on two camps \u2013 Shimelba and Hitsats \u2013 destroyed during the fighting. HRW cited UN refugee agency UNHCR figures that 7,643 out of 20,000 refugees then living in Hitsats and Shimelba camps are still missing.\n\nUNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, said it was \u201cappalled\u201d at the reports of \u201cimmense suffering\u201d in refugee camps, which it was unable to access from November to March.\n\nAlthough Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a brutal border war in 1998-2000 that left tens of thousands dead, President Abiy Ahmed initiated a rapprochement with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, and Asmara has lent him military backing in Tigray.\n\nEritrean forces arrived in the northern town of Hitsats on November 19, killed residents, and pillaged and occupied the refugee camp, HRW said. Some refugees helped direct looters, one resident told HRW.\n\n\u201cIn every house, people were killed,\u201d one resident told HRW.\n\nFour days later, Tigrayan fighters attacked an area near Hitsats camp\u2019s Ethiopian Orthodox church, killing nine refugees and injuring 17, HRW reported.\n\n\u201cMy husband had our four-year-old on his back and our six-year-old in his arms. As he came back to help me enter the church, they shot him,\u201d one refugee told Human Rights Watch.\n\nTwo dozen residents in Hitsats town were reportedly killed in clashes that day, HRW reported.\n\nThe report said that HRW had been unable to determine the extent that Tigray\u2019s formal forces directly commanded local Tigray militias operating around Hitsats.\n\nShortly after, Eritrean soldiers detained 24 refugees, who were never seen again, HRW said. They also took the 17 injured refugees back to Eritrea.\n\nEritrean forces withdrew from Hitsats camp in early December. Tigrayan forces returned on December 5, sending refugees fleeing under attack.\n\nRefugees around the villages of Zelasle and Ziban Gedena, northwest of Hitsats, reported being shot at and attacked with grenades. Tigrayan forces marched fleeing refugees back to Hitsats, shooting some stragglers, refugees reported to HRW.\n\nSome women also said they were raped by Tigrayan fighters as they fled. One 27-year-old woman said Tigrayan fighters raped her along with her 17-year-old sister.\n\nTigrayan forces withdrew from Hitsats on January 4, HRW said. The Eritrean forces returned, ordered remaining refugees to leave, then destroyed the camp.\n\nIn the northernmost camp, Shimelba, Eritrean forces killed at least one refugee, raped at least four others and killed local residents, HRW said.\n\nThe violence and severe food shortages forced some refugees to return to Eritrea. Others fled south to two other camps, Adi Harush and Mai Aini. Tigrayan forces took over those camps in June and refugees have reported killings and looting.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely worried about the current situation of over 20,000 Eritrean refugees living in Mai Aini and Adi Harush camp in southern Tigray,\u201d UNHCR told Reuters on Wednesday, saying there were severe food and water shortages and healthcare was unavailable.",

According to the FBI, one of those officials was fired last week.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray apologised profusely to those present for the \u201creprehensible conduct\u201d and \u201cfundamental errors\u201d detailed in the July report.\n\nMr Wray only took the agency\u2019s top job in 2017, but pledged to prevent a repeat of the mishandled case under his leadership.\n\nHe pointed to last week\u2019s removal of the supervising official involved, while noting the other official \u2013 who led the field office in Indianapolis \u2013 had retired long before he could be disciplined.\n\nHe acknowledged the work of both agents had \u201cviolated the FBI\u2019s long-standing code of conduct\u201d but was \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the vast majority of his team.\n\nAt a news conference later on Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the president \u201csupports\u201d the recommended steps outlined for the FBI in the Department of Justice report.\n\nBut both lawmakers and witnesses called out the department for being a \u201cno-show\u201d at the hearing despite being invited. Speaking after the hearing, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal noted the department must still answer more questions.",
