          "text": "The family of Justice Mofoye Oyetunde of Ile Aremo, Ogbomoso has described the alleged exclusion of Dr Oyebode Oyetunde from contesting to become the next Soun of Ogbomoso as unfair.\n\nDr Usman Akano, who described himself as Oyetunde\u2019s cousin, said the 45-year-old prince, who is an Executive Director of the African Development Bank is qualified to succeed Oba Oladunni Oyewumi, who died on December 12, 2021 at the age of 95 after reigning for almost 48 years.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with our correspondent on Sunday, Akano called on Governor Seyi Makinde and the local government authority to ensure that the law guiding the selection of new Soun is followed and none of the qualified princes should be excluded.\n\nAkano said the governor should order that a fresh selection should be done and should ensure that the law is strictly followed to avoid rancour.\n\nHe said, \u201cDr Oyebode Oyetunde is a prince from the Ile Aremo which is a ruling family in the Laoye Ruling House. But he was prevented from contesting despite that it is the turn of Ile Aremo to produce the next Soun of Ogbomoso.\n\n\u201cBy the time Dr Oyebode Oyetunde asked for the form, they told him it was over. That is unfair.\u201d\n\nHe said the Head of Laoye Ruling House, Alhaji Wahab Oyetunde, told the AfDB director that the forms have been exhausted but alleged that the same forms were sold to some contestants who applied after him.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe Redeemed Christian of God Pastor, Ghandi, is not even from Ile Aremo whose turn it is to produce the next Soun.\n\n\u201cWhat we are contesting now is the improper way the selection has been done. They (the family and the kingmakers) did not follow what the law says.\n\n\u201cWhat the law says is that just one name should be sent by the ruling house to the kingmakers but that is not what they did.\n\n\u201cAlthough, we are not interested in court case, we don\u2019t want it to get to that. We want to resolve it internally.\n\n\u201cThe local government and the state government must ensure that the law is followed and nobody should be excluded.\u201d\n\nAnother relative supporting the AfDB boss, Dr Aliu Akano, also faulted the selection process, saying the law was not followed and Oyetunde should not be excluded.\n\nHe said the Chiefs Law, 1957 of the Customary Law regulating the selection to the Soun Chieftaincy states that one candidate should be sent to the kingmakers at a time for screening and if the candidate is rejected, another will be sent until the kingmakers find a suitable candidate.\n\nQuoting the law, he said, \u201cThe kingmakers shall call on the family whose turn it is to produce a candidate; if the candidate is suitable they install him by native custom.\n\n\u201cIf the candidate is not suitable, they send back to the family to produce another candidate and so on until a suitable candidate is produced.\n\n\u201cIn case of dispute among the kingmakers, decision shall be made by majority of votes and in case of a tie, the chairman shall have a casting vote.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Osa Mbonu-Amadi,\n\nArts Editor\n\nThe exceptional talents of Oluwole Omofemi, the Ibadan-brought up visual artists whose signature is painting African women with afro hairstyle, has taken him to faraway Barcelona, Spain, where Sorella Acosta\u2019s Out of Africa Contemporary Arts Gallery is showing his works titled \u2018A Woman\u2019s Worth\u2019.\n\nIn an industry in which figurative portraiture has dominated and become the modus operandi for most artists across the African diaspora, few artists are able to cut through the noise, and have their work stand out, enchant and inspire audiences quite like Omofemi has. Coupled by the socio-political themes that his work unpacks, his modern, yet old master sensibility, style and medium of choice, and the undeniable quality, beauty and boldness of his portraits, the artist has increasingly established himself as a master amongst a field of apprentices, and quite frankly, a cut above the rest.\n\nAccording to Raphael Dapaah, Art writer & Art Consultant OOA Gallery, Born in 1988, Omofemi hails from the inner streets of South Ibadan, Nigeria. His humble beginnings and steep ascent to the pinnacle of the contemporary African art scene is nothing short of inspirational. Readily identified by his neighbours and community as a promising artist from his early childhood, Omofemi would later use the proceeds he would gain from hawking beer, as part of the everyday grind of living in Ibadan, to buy sketch books and art materials to facilitate and incubate his passion.\n\nIt was his grandfather\u2019s wisdom and guidance that impressed upon the young artist the importance of the preservation of culture, heritage and ancient customs, and instilled in the artist an appreciation for self-love, pride, and determination, which today he captures and translates on his canvas through his endearing and masterful portraits.\n\n\u201cThe man who has confidence in himself gains the confidence of others. You attract what you are, not what you want. If you want great, then be great,\u201d Omofemi says.\n\nThe art exhibition spans from April-May, 2022.",

          "text": "Sunday Ige, an ex-policeman who was retrenched by the Nigeria Police Force after a ghastly accident rendered him bedridden, has sent out a passionate plea for assistance from the government and police authorities over the Federal Ministry of Housing\u2019s plan to evict him from his apartment.\n\nIge, a native of Idoani in the Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State, was involved in an accident in Lagos State in 2001 while on special duty as a mobile police officer.\n\nHe suffered a spinal cord injury and had one of his legs amputated due to the accident.\n\nThe 57-year-old explained that he was relieved of his duty as a Corporal in the Nigeria Police Force in 2006, and that he was paid N225,000 in gratuity as a result of his retrenchment due to the accident.\n\nIn a teary-eyed, Ige said that he was allotted an apartment in Shagari Estate, Akure, Ondo State capital in 1993, and that he was able to make the initial ten percent payment of N125,000 out of the N1.250 million, and that he was expected to pay for the apartment\u2019s acquisition.\n\nHe added that he was unable to work or raise money to pay for the house after spending several million on his health as a result of the injury while on duty.\n\n\n\nIn March 2022, the former police officer received an eviction letter from the presidency, along with a two-week deadline to vacate the apartment, an ultimatum that will lapse this week.\n\nWhile lamenting about his predicament, the ex-corporal said his health had made it difficult for him to raise the balance of N1.125 million after paying the initial deposit of N125,000 out of a total of N1.250 million for the purchase of the house from the Federal Ministry of Housing.\n\n\u201cI was recruited into the Nigeria Police Force on September 1st, 1991, and I passed out of the training school, Iperu in 1992,\u201d the ex-corporal, who had been bedridden for approximately 21 years, stated.\n\n\u201cI was assigned to Ijero-Ekiti, Ekiti State, after the training. I was mobilized to the Nigeria Mobile Force, Akure, in 1993. On January 16, 2001, I was assigned to Itire Police Station in Lagos for special duty, where I was struck by a vehicle while on duty.\n\n\u201cI was rushed to General Hospital, Ikeja, after the accident, and afterwards transferred to a private hospital. When both general and private hospitals were unable to treat me, I was transferred to the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, OAUTH, in Ile-Ife.\n\n\u201cMy leg was amputated at Ife. Following the amputation of my leg, it was later discovered that I had a spinal cord injury, making movement difficult for me.\n\n\u201cIn November 2001, I was discharged from OAUTH. Then there were the medical bills, which totaled over N1 million. The police did not help me pay even a single kobo of my medical fees. I paid with what little money I had and with the help of my family. As a result of the circumstances, my parents died\n\n\u201cI was retrenched as a corporal from the Nigeria Police on December 31st, 2006, and my salary was instantly halted,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn 2009, the police authority paid me N225,000 in gratuity with a monthly pension of N5000; later, it was raised to N8000, but with the new minimum wage, I now receive N16,000 in monthly pension.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe residence was allocated to me in 1993. In 2007, Federal Housing announced that it wanted to sell the house for N1.250 million, and we were told that we had to pay ten percent first. Since I\u2019ve been living there, I\u2019ve developed interest and paid the ten percent down payment.\n\n\u201cBecause of my illness, I haven\u2019t been able to pay the balance since then. Last Monday, the government brought an eviction notice, instructing me to vacate the premises.\n\n\u201cDue to my condition, if I\u2019m evicted from this house, I\u2019ll have nowhere to go. I don\u2019t have a wife because I hadn\u2019t yet married when the accident occurred.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m begging the government and well-meaning individuals to help me since I have nowhere else to go and no where to raise the money in my current situation.\u201d",

The situation has caused frustration and untold hardship. About four of our members have died while some of them are in the hospital, yet government has refused to pay.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that his company, Sikak firm Nigeria Ltd, constructed the entire drainage placement of the Ring road project, that is still in use, adding that it\u2019s indebted to the tune of N18m representing the amount that was sourced from bank to execute the project.\n\n\u201cWe did the drainage placement to a far distance. To my surprise, payment ceased since 2019. Later we heard that the mother company\u2019s (Quemecs) contract was revoked and we expected that the severance packages should be paid, we are not interested in who carries on the project, but what we are saying is that government should pay the outstanding balance\u201d he said\n\nHe said they have written several letters to both Quemecs, adding that efforts to get the attention of the relevant ministry and parastatals have proved abortive\n\nHowever, when DAILY POST contacted the project manager, Quemecs Nigeria Limited, Engr Stephen Oluyemi, lamented that the state government has yet to pay the company the outstanding balance of N596.48m which will enable them to pay the suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nHe said, \u201dthe truth is that we owed the indigenes, subcontractors and suppliers huge amounts of money. They have been writing to us but the issue is that we have not been paid the money by the state government.\n\n\u201cThe work from three years ago was about 70% done until Covid-19 came and the government did not pay and since then we\u2019ve been expecting payment. On February 2021, what rather came was letter of termination and they re awarded the contract to another company, since then we\u2019ve not received our outstanding balance\n\nEfforts to speak with the state Commissioner of Works and Fire Service, Prof. Eno Ibanga, was not successful as at the time of filing this report as he could not pick his calls and did not respond to text message send to his phone",

Why Kaduna?\n\nQuestion 2. Who is trying to isolate Kaduna?\n\nQuestion 3. Why?\n\nQuestion 4. After Kaduna, where next?\n\nOn 2023 general elections he said: \u201cSome of you are killing yourselves about 2023; some of you Christians, you don\u2019t even know may be the rapture may have come before the end of this year.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t the rapture come before then? We are talking of Kaduna, today. That is one point, prayer point for my (prayer) partners, take note.\u201d\n\nOn oil and gas, he said: \u201cIt is in the news, nobody has denied it that as of now, more than 80 per cent of the oil we are producing has been stolen, or you didn\u2019t read that in the news?\n\n\u201cMore than 80 per cent of all the oil we are producing has been stolen. Nobody had denied it, it came from the government. That leads me to several questions.\n\nQuestion 1. Who is the one stealing the oil?\n\nQuestion 2. Where is the money going? 80 per cent of what should have been the income of a Nation, is going to the hands of some people, that\u2019s a lot of money!\n\nQuestion 3. What do they want to do with the money?\n\nQuestion 4. Who are the foreign nations buying this stolen oil?\n\nQuestion 5. How many of these nations of the world are your friends?\n\n\u201cSo, you can see the reason why I am not thinking of 2023. Maybe that is why God has not spoken to me about that because there is a lot to deal with now,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nVillages and towns in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), have come under intense attacks from cultists, bandits and other hoodlums in the last few weeks, forcing residents to flee their homes.\n\nAbuja\u2019s largest suburban town, Kubwa in Bwari Area Council, Daily Sun has gathered, has come under increasing attacks. There are fears that the soft attacks could snowball into full banditry in the foreseeable future.\n\nFor instance, in the last ten days, several parts of the district, have been attacked by a group of boys numbering over 20 and using motorbikes.\n\nResidents said the group of young men, rob residents. There is another group of young boys who are said to be cultists and who have reportedly held residents hostage.\n\nAn eyewitness said on March 21, 2022, robbers numbering about eight attempted, without success, the invasion of a neighbourhood in Kubwa.\n\nThe eyewitness said: \u201cArmed robbers totalling about 8 in number raided our street yesterday night about 3:00am. They attempted to enter through the Pekolyn gate, but then they were chased by the dog users guards.\n\n\u201cThey then came through the Green estate gate, which they overpowered the guard at the gate and entered the street. As they started to lynch him, then the dog users guard that have been chasing them got to them. They then ran away through the cost cutter supermarket gate.\u201d\n\nOn March 23, 2022, another resident raised the alarm over activities of some boys believed to be cultists.\n\nIn a WhatsApp group, a resident noted: \u201cAdmin, pls kindly investigate the emergence of a cult group that comes to attack our security on the middle gate. I witnessed it live with the chairman last week and today again. It\u2019s bloody, vicious.\n\n\u201cI learnt that this cult war has been raging since December last year and it is taking another dimension like the incident that happened 2 nights ago. Let\u2019s urgently do something about it.\u201d\n\nAnother resident in the area said: \u201cI witnessed it as I was driving in around 8.00pm. I think the executive and everybody must wake up. I suggested two months ago that we must increase the number of security guys on the extreme sides.\n\n\u201cIf there is need to increase our monthly rate or ask for donations from neighbors I don\u2019t see anything bad in that. I can categorically say security situations in Nigeria will begin to get worse any movement from now whether we believe or not. The signs are there for anybody to see.\u201d\n\nOn the 25th, robbers also attempted to invade the same area. One of the neighbours who did not want his name published for fear of a possible attack, narrated the incident to newsmen.\n\nHe said: \u201cThieves came to check whether the Neighborhood security is still in force or not. There can\u2019t be good security without funding, the thieves came into the Neighborhood around 3am this morning. Let us imagine if there was no resistance from our guards the effect is better imagined than experienced. The guards made a lot of sacrifices while some neighbours abuse this sacrifices through non payment of security levy as and when due.\u201d\n\nAgain, on March 30, the hoodlums invaded the Pipeline Extension area of Kubwa where they robbed several residents.\n\nWhile invaded the area around 2am, they operated unchallenged for over an hour having already wounded the local vigilance team.\n\nOn Thursday, Hassan Shamidozhi, a traditional ruler in Bukpe community, Kwali was kidnapped by gunmen. The gunmen were said to have invaded the palace on Wednesday night, shot randomly to frighten locals before taking the ruler away.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, residents blocked the Gwagwalada- Kuje road in protest over an early morning raid on their homes by kidnappers, suspended to be bandits\n\nThe AK-47 wielding kidnappers numbering over 20, were said to have invaded Chukuku community in Kuje area council in the early hours and began to shoot sporadically.\n\nThree persons were reportedly abducted by the kidnappers. The protesting residents who decried the absence of Police checkpoint along the Chukuku-Kwali road, said the road has been serving as an entry point for the kidnappers who have been terrorising the community since January.\n\nThey also urged government to commission the already constructed Police station in Chukuku.",

You may also recall that the train manifest contained 362 validated passengers aboard the train.\u201d\n\nThe NRC boss hinted that the corporation, in continuation of its concerted effort through repeated calls, has been able to confirm the safety of \u201c170 passengers, while 21 passengers are reported missing by the relatives who made calls to us,\u201d Okhiria said.\n\nHe further said that the corporation is seriously collaborating with the security agencies who had already swung into action, in line with the directive of President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything possible to rescue all those that are still missing.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe corporation is also not resting on its oars as she has heavily moved human and material resources to the accident site to make sure that train services resumed without further delays in order to reduce the stress that our passengers are currently going through.\n\n\u201cIn practical terms, a high powered restoration team, led by directors have been working round the clock to re-rail the coaches affected by the bomb blast.\n\n\u201cThere is a co-ordinated two-pronged simultaneous restoration approach. While Loco 2702 with re-railment and restoration materials departed Idu Station, Abuja to the bomb blast site, another team with Loco 2502 departed Rigasa Station, Kaduna with re-railment and restoration materials to the same site.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform you that as at the close of work on the 1st of April 2022, Coaches SP00004, SP00009, SP00012, SP00013 have all been re-railed and safely taken to our Rigasa Station in Kaduna. Restoration of track for full resumption of normal train services will continue today 2nd April 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said further in the statement, \u201cGentlemen of the press, it may also interest you to know that arrangements have equally been put in place for increased security along the track and on board the train to prevent the recurrence of the unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cOnce again, our hearts go out to the families of those that lost their loved ones and that of those that are still missing.\u201d\n\nHe however assured Nigerians that the corporation is with the general public in this challenging time.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Gov. Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State on Friday in Abuja updated President Muhammadu Buhari on security developments in his state following the Monday night\u2019s terror attack on Abuja-Kaduna bound train.\n\nThe governor, who was sober about recent happenings in his state, told State House correspondents that the president had reassured him that drastic measures were being taken to check the activities of terrorists and bandits in Kaduna state and beyond.\n\nAccording to him, security agencies have been making frantic efforts to rescue victims of Monday night\u2019s attack on a Kaduna bound train, from the hands of their abductors.\n\nHe disclosed that the president had reassured him that drastic measures were being taken to check the activities of terrorists and bandits in the state and beyond.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i, who spoke in Hausa language, disclosed that the attack on the train was carried out by Boko Haram iinsurgents in collaboration with some bandits operating in Kaduna, Zamfara, Niger, Sokoto and Kebbi States.\n\n\u201cThe President assured me that necessary steps would be taken on the matter and this thing will be brought to an end in few months, and security agents are already carrying out surveillance around where these criminals are and, by the grace of God, they will be rounded up.\n\n\u201cBut as you know, the government will always take precautionary measures to safeguard the lives of citizens, therefore, except the victims are rescued unhurt, the airforce and ground troops will not be able to confront the criminals. So to avoid any colossal damage, the captives have to be freed first,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor confirmed that the gunmen had contacted families of their captives, but yet to request for ransom.\n\n\u201cWell, the families of those kidnapped have been contacted while some of the captives themselves have called their loved ones, saying they are doing well and they are being taken care of. But the gunmen have not shown any sign of collecting ransom,\u201d he added..\n\nEl-Rufai emphasised that the gunmen are not kidnappers but members of the Boko Haram terrorists group working in collaboration with bandits.\n\n\u201cThese ones are not the usual kidnappers but members of Boko who are collaborating with bandits.\n\n\u201dSo we were thinking they will ask for a huge ransom from the state government, not the families of their victims.\n\n\u201dSo far, they have asked for ransom from just one of the families that were contacted.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Kaduna state government is concerned, we have not changed our stand on payment of ransom, so, even if they seek for that from us, we will not pay because we are not ready to do so,\u201d he maintained.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i revealed that the state government had received intelligence report that the gunmen were going to strike on the rail line and had intimated the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) on the matter, but no action was taken.\n\n\u201cWe think this thing happened because we have written twice to the NRC, advising that trains on the Kaduna route should not embark on night trips because we have reports that Boko Haram were in town and they plan to attack the train at night using explosive devices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed the need for massive bombing of all bandit-infected enclaves including forest areas in the North West and North Central parts of the country.\n\nNAN recalls that the Kaduna-bound train, which left Abuja at 6 p.m. on Monday, was attacked by suspected terrorists at about 7.45 p.m., just about 15 minutes\u2019 drive before Kaduna.\n\nEight persons had been officially confirmed dead, 46 hospitalised and several others kidnapped following the attack.

          "text": "The Dowen College Parents\u2019 Forum in Lagos State has demanded an overhaul of the school management and hostel teachers as well as the installation of Closed Circuit Television cameras in the school as the death of 12-year-old student, Sylvester Oromoni, continues to gain prominence nationwide.\n\nThe parents\u2019 forum, which condemned the death of the student, said a candle light procession would be held for him on Wednesday.\n\nIn a release obtained by SaharaReporters on Tuesday and signed by Aituaz Kola-Oladejo, Waheed Adeoye, Oluwaseun Bolanle Ajila and Kingsley Kema Agu, the parents stated that what happened to Sylvester \u201ccould have happened to any other child in the school.\u201d\n\nThe forum said, \u201cDowen College Parents are startled and deeply saddened by the unfortunate incident that led to the death of Sylvester Oromoni. Our hearts go out to the family of the deceased and pray that God gives them the strength to bear the irreparable loss.\n\n\u201cAs parents of Dowen college students, we are still in shock and could not come to terms with this incident and the accounts so far provided by the school,students, and the media.\n\n\u201cWe urge the school management team and other stakeholders (students and parents directly or indirectly mentioned) to fully cooperate with the authority in the ongoing investigation. While we would have loved to bring Sylvester back if humanly possible, unravelling the cause of Sylvester\u2019s death and bringing whoever was responsible or might have contributed in whatever way to book,will not only bring this unfortunate incident to a closure for the family, but this will also serve as a deterrent to others in all schools in Nigeria. See Also Education Father Of 12-Year-Old Boy Allegedly Killed By Colleagues Says Dowen College Hasn't Called Since Son's Death\n\n\u201cWe therefore say justice for Sylvester, is justice for all. On our part as parents, we will work more closely with the school (management/board), to ensure necessary measures are put in place to prevent a reoccurrence of this unfortunate incident and stamp out bulling in any form from the school.\n\n\u201cWe therefore earnesly ask for a resolution that will bring some relief to the bereaved family, other parents, students of Dowen College and the public.\n\n\u201cThese should include a change of the school management and hostel teachers, installation of CCTV cameras in all strategic places and overhauling of the school security system.\n\n\u201cThe Parents' Forum is organising a Candle Light event. Details of which are as follow: Wednesday, December 8, 6pm; Dowen College. The lighting of candles is to pay tribute to a life 'passed' and keeping the light burning signifies that the memory still lives on and burns bright.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters earlier today reported that the Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, revealed that three students of the college were currently being investigated over the death of Sylvester.\n\nAlthough Odumosu did not give the identities of those in custody, but had insisted that they were the main suspects.\n\nSaharaReporters also reported that the Oromoni family had hired the firm of human rights lawyer and activist, Femi Falana, SAN, to prosecute its case against the institution over the death of their son.\n\nThe human rights lawyer\u2019s chambers had written to the office of Lagos State\u2019s Chief Coroner, requesting an inquest into the circumstances leading to the death of his client\u2019s child.

          "text": "A review of the Oyo State Open Contracting portal done by Dataphyte has shown that secondary school notebook contracts worth N998 million and awarded between August 2019 and December 2020 have been subject to contract inflation, fraudulent contract bidding and contract ambiguity.\n\n\n\nThe contract, awarded in three batches, is to supply customised notebooks to secondary schools in the state. The first set of 12 contracts totalling N456.504 million was awarded on August 28, 2019.\n\n\n\nThe second set was awarded in June 2020, with a total value of N94.196 million and described as \u201cproduction of second batch exercise books for students of public secondary schools in the state\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe third set awarded in December 2020 at N446.370 million was for the supply of 212,505 copies of 60 leaves\u2019 notebooks. The description stated that the notebooks are meant for the 2020/2021 session of public secondary schools in the state.\n\n\n\nThe December 2020 contract raises concerns as to why it will cost N446.370 million to supply 212,505 copies of 60 leaves notebooks. On the open contracting portal announcing the award of the contract, the description for the award says, \u201cProduction of 212,505 copies of 60 leaves customised exercise books for students of public secondary schools for the 2020/2021 academic session\u201d.\n\nIt added that the books would be supplied at the contract value of N446,370,480.\n\n\n\nBy this budget, each copy of the 60 leaves notebook cost the state N2,100 to print.\n\n\n\nBut should one customised sixty leaves notebook cost N2,100?\n\n\n\nChecks by Dataphyte show that a non-customised 60 leaves notebook in Mokola, Ibadan, costs one hundred naira (N100).\n\n\n\nDataphyte sought quotations for a similar description of goods from printing presses and the quotes put each copy of the customised notebook at between N200 and N230, one printing press offered N158 per copy for 60 leaves of the customised notebook.\n\nAlso, the higher the number of copies, the lesser the price for each copy. At the maximum cost of 230,212,505 copies should cost around N48,876,150.\n\n\n\nThe quoted price by the state government appears exaggerated even if other services like delivery of the notebooks to each school and design of the customised pages were factored into the cost.\n\n\n\nIn the case of the supply of 60 leaves of the notebook for N2100 each in December 2020, the Public Procurement Act states that \u201cThe Bureau may refuse to issue a certificate of No Objection to Contract Award on grounds that the price is excessive.\u201d\n\nProject Awarded to Contract Splitting Companies\n\n\n\nAside from the inflated cost of contracts, Dataphyte\u2019s investigation shows that three of the four companies awarded contracts on December 17, 2020, are owned by the same person.\n\n\n\nOf the four contractors who won the contracts, three, Jeda Global Ventures, Insider Multipurpose Ventures and Sure Etiquette Media Plus Limited, are owned by Mr Oriyomi Hamzat Abdulrahman.\n\n\n\nMr Oriyomi Hamzat is a renowned broadcaster who recently founded Agidigbo FM in Ibadan, the capital city of Oyo.\n\nMr Oriyomi is known for social justice activism but was arrested in 2018 by the Department of State Services (DSS) before he was released after spending 15 days in detention.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Governor Seyi Makinde commended Hamzat for establishing Agidigbo FM, noting that the government was willing to support the station to thrive.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Oriyomi registered two companies on the same day. Jeda Global Ventures and Insider Multipurpose Ventures were registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission on the same day, September 8, 2020.\n\n\n\nAnd two months after registration, these companies won a contract from the state government.\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peace Itimi: From Nigeria to the UK in search of peace",
          "text": "Peace Itimi has spent 9 months away from Nigeria but doesn\u2019t miss the country. She misses her cleaner and cook, though, because, in London, she doesn\u2019t have a cleaner and cook. But she at least has peace of mind.\n\nWhen Itimi started working remotely from Nigeria, she promised herself she would stay in Nigeria, until the Lekki toll gate killing\u2014where tens of #EndSARS protesters, who were protesting against police brutality, were killed\u2014scared her out of her wits. \u201cI felt unsafe,\u201d she recalled. It was then she started to reconsider her stance on immigration and realised money won\u2019t shield her from how unsafe Nigeria was increasingly becoming.\n\nA friend gave her the nudge to leave the country, recommending that she go through the Tech Nation Visa\u2014a visa that allows tech talent across the world to live and work in the UK\u2014because, he felt, she was a good fit. In 2021, she started researching the programme, and even though she felt the requirements were scary, she realised that everything she had done up until that point made her a perfect fit.\n\nFinding different loves\n\nItimi grew up in Benin City, Edo state, and studied medical biochemistry at Delta State University. She fell in love with digital marketing while in university. She said university had been one of the most definitive phases of her life because it was where she found God, found herself, and digital marketing.\n\nWhen she became a Google Student Ambassador, she started training other students in digital marketing in school. Fresh from school, she launched a digital marketing agency with a friend in 2016.\n\nShe moved to Lagos in February 2017 to begin her national service year at digital marketing agency, Webcoupers, and that was where she officially launched her career. In 2018, she joined Wild Fusion, another digital marketing agency, where she trained people on digital marketing, branding, Google Ads, and SEO. She, in that same year, also organised training on behalf of Facebook, Orange Academy, and the British Council.\n\nDuring one of her travels for digital marketing training in Accra, she realised that even though she loved travelling, her physical reach was limited. \u201cI can\u2019t train people in Accra except when I travel to Accra. So, I started thinking that a way to break that divide was to start training people online and that means I can reach anybody anywhere, so long as they can find my content.\u201d\n\nSo, Itimi started a YouTube channel in December 2018 where she initially shared marketing tips and random lessons about life, before launching a now-popular segment called Founders Connect, where she has interviewed about 40 African founders, including Odun Eweniyi of Piggyvest, Atsu Davoh of Bitsika, and Ezra Olubi of Paystack.\n\nIn 2019, she entered the Nigerian tech ecosystem after landing a role as the Head of Marketing at fintech company, Korapay, before moving to Venture Capital (VC) firm, Seedstars in 2020.\n\nFirst comes loneliness\n\nIn the first few months after Itimi arrived in the UK last June, she felt lonely. She had never been so far away from home before; the farthest she had travelled had been within the continent, to Cape Verde, in 2019.\n\nEverything was new to her in the UK. For example, the summer was warm yet she still felt cold. She couldn\u2019t see clearly and had migraines when she went outside without sunshades. It also took her a while to adjust to the predominant use of contactless payment in London.\n\nAs an introvert, making friends was initially difficult for her, even though she didn\u2019t face this difficulty back home. In Lagos, she was mildly popular so people started conversations with her at events. Now in the UK, she decided to become more intentional about making friends and connecting with people by starting conversations. When she sees someone on social media she wants to connect with, she reaches out and asks them to have a coffee or jump on an informal call with her. \u201cI am learning that a new environment and country requires an improved me. I have to do extra work,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what this means for her is that she has to move past her introverted nature and social anxiety because to live the life she wants she must connect with people, build a network, and make impact in this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nIn the months that followed, she made more friends when she joined a cycling community of about 20 other immigrants and her friends for whom she had reviewed the Tech Nation Visa applications joined her in the UK. On top of that, on the back of her YouTube video where she shared her experience with the visa application, at least 20 people have reached out to tell her they had got the visa.\n\nLondon, the good and the bad\n\nShe currently works remotely as Head of Growth for offline fintech app, Stax and admits that her productivity has increased since she moved. \u201cI don\u2019t apologise for bad internet anymore. I don\u2019t have to worry about electricity, either. I can afford to leave my laptop unplugged.\u201d\n\nItimi is excited about the travelling opportunities London presents; she feels more confident applying for visas for different countries now than she ever was in Nigeria. London has the most connected flights anywhere in the world and they are relatively cheaper.\n\n\u201cWhen I travelled to Kenya from London, in February, my flight cost less than a flight from Lagos to Kenya.\u201d\n\nOne thing Itimi likes about London is its diversity\u2014in people, food, and even the hobbies she can choose from. She is also in love with its efficient transport infrastructure: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exceed the time I estimate to get to my destination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this exposure to working infrastructure and this level of diversity is doing something to my mind that I will be grateful for in a couple of years because of how I would have grown as a person.\u201d\n\nShe also loves the feeling of freedom in the city, which allows people to be themselves. \u201cFor instance, I feel like my confidence in the way I dress has increased a lot since I moved to London, compared to when I was in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t like the weather. During the winter, she rarely left her house, and when she did, her multiple layers of clothing didn\u2019t stop the cold from getting to her and the wind from threatening to blow her over. She looks forward to the summer, which she prefers.\n\nMaybe higher up on the list of things she doesn\u2019t like are taxes, because there are a lot of them. \u201cI feel like if I thought too much about my taxes I probably would not have moved when I did; I would have waited a bit longer to save more money in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "Two years on, what has #YouTubeBlack Voices done for African creators?",
          "text": "When TNC Africa, a Nigerian television production company, wanted to launch long-form video content that tells original African stories to the world, it chose YouTube as its medium. It was evident that YouTube could provide a platform that would connect it to the world and provide sufficient data for analytics on its audience. \u201cBeing an early-stage startup where data is super important, and one that does a lot of data analytics, we needed a platform where we could get access to that data, and YouTube offered that, \u201c Olawale Adetula, co-founder of TNC Africa said.\n\nAdetula explained that YouTube has the largest share of the video-watching audience it is targeting in Africa, such that even android phones have the app pre-installed.\n\nWhile YouTube aims to provide a platform for creators globally to explore their creativity, in 2020, it shined a special focus on Africa when it launched the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund. The $100 million Fund\u2014created by YouTube as a response to the racial injustice that characterised 2020\u2014is a 3-year initiative dedicated to spotlighting and growing black creators on YouTube, from across the world, by providing them with funding, resources, and mentorship that will help them thrive on the platform.\n\nThe Fund, in the past 2 years, has worked closely with African content creators, musical artists, and, recently, producers and songwriters, offering them seed funding to develop their channels, training focused on upgrading their production, community engagement and wellbeing skills as well as workshops and networking programmes to help them grow their channels.\n\nAdetula\u2019s biggest takeaway from the Fund is the opportunity to network with and form relationships with over 135 other top creators around the world. The Fund\u2019s structure, which encourages every creator to work with another creator, plays a role in ensuring that these relationships are formed; and has translated into upcoming collaborations for TNC Africa, too.\n\nTNC Africa\u2019s target audience has also broadened beyond Africa as a result of the programme. \u201cWe were creating content and targeting viewers within Africa or with African interest because we never thought our content could be appealing to non-Africans. Today, the number of viewers we are getting from the UK, US, Ireland, and South America is steadily increasing since we implemented some of the things we learnt from the YouTube Black Voices Fund.\u201d More people outside Nigeria are getting interested in content created by Nigerian YouTubers.According to data made available to TechCabal by YouTube, over 75% of watch time on content produced by channels in Nigeria comes from outside Nigeria.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s inaugural cohort last year featured a Creator Class of 20 content creators, from Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. Its Artist Class featured 3 African artists: Kenya\u2019s Sauti Sol, South Africa\u2019s Soma Jozi, and Nigeria\u2019s Fireboy\u2014who have gone on to use the platform to connect with their fans.\n\nFireboy\u2019s \u201cPeru\u201d remix with pop star, Ed Sheeran, has gone global, with the song topping music charts across the world. During his time on the programme, on YouTube, he performed a live stream concert to over 83,000 fans who watched the virtual performance, to celebrate Africa Month.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices helped award-winning Kenyan Afro-pop group Sauti Sol become the first Kenyan act to be included on a Times Square billboard in New York.\n\nKenyan Afro-pop band, Sauti Sol, perform their Midnight Train album in a virtual concert that has raked over a million views on YouTube. Addy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa, YouTube, spoke about Sauti Sol\u2019s excitement when the Fund put their pictures on billboards in New York, Los Angeles and London. \u201cIt was a great Kenya-to-the-world story. They were already celebrated in Kenya; it was amazing to be a part of their success and help them break out of Kenya.\u201d\n\nAccording to figures made available to TechCabal by YouTube, in Kenya, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in Kenyan shillings) has increased by over 60%, year over year. While over 400 channels have at least 100 thousand subscribers\u2014an increase of over 70%, year over year\u20146 channels have over 1 million subscribers; and 1 channel has over 1 billion views. Over 45% of watch time on content produced by channels in Kenya comes from outside of Kenya.\n\nWhile the inaugural class had 20 creators and 3 artists from Africa, for the 2022 class, YouTube increased the number to 26 content creators and 4 artists; while creating a new class, for producers and songwriters, a development the Fund said demonstrates its continued support for artists on the platform.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices placed Nigerian artist CKay on a billboard in Los Angeles\n\nA member of the newly-created songwriters and producers class is Nigeria\u2019s brilliant 20-year-old producer, P.Priime, who has produced hits for some of the biggest names in Nigeria\u2019s music industry, including Wizkid, Fireboy, and Olamide. He further blew up this year after it became known that he produced Nigerian artist Asa\u2019s album (except for one song).\n\nP.Priime had heard about the Artist Class but originally didn\u2019t know there was going to be a category for producers, so he was excited when he heard about the newly introduced class. \u201cI was excited that people were starting to recognise the work producers do. I feel we are finally getting our flowers, and people are starting to see our importance beyond working with artists,\u201d P.Priime told TechCabal.\n\nWhen P.Priime joined the programme, they helped him organise his channel, and he started sharing his process\u2014with his video where he took his fans through the making of Nigerian artist Reekado Bank\u2019s hit \u201cOzumba Mbadiwe\u201d raking 63,000 views.\n\nThe Fund helped him get new equipment and has provided him with an opportunity to connect with artists across the world. Although his YouTube channel is monetised, he said he is not all about the money: \u201cIt is giving a piece of P.Priime to my audience, documenting my work process and using the opportunity to reach new audiences even when I am not dropping new music.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the challenges that African YouTubers face, Awofisayo blamed the late delivery of Personal Identification Numbers (PIN)\u2014which allows them to monetise their YouTube channel\u2014on African YouTube creators\u2019 countries\u2019 bad postal services. Awofisayo further explained that the reason YouTube sends the PIN via postal service is to prevent identity theft and circumvent fraud.\n\nAwofisayo said that the #YouTubeBlackVoices Fund was created to encourage black creators and artists to get on YouTube, amplify their voices, and create an opportunity for them to be successful on the platform. But she revealed that beneficiaries of the Fund do not get preferential treatment or get prioritised on the platform.\n\nAwofisayo revealed that the selection of newer and early-stage creators\u2014creators that have been on the platform for a few years\u2014is a shift from last year when most beneficiaries were established content creators. Awofisayo said YouTube wants to also empower more creators like Nigeria\u2019s Mark Angel, who has built a production company out of his YouTube channel. \u201cIn the long run, we want to make sure that black creators, not just those in the fund, are able to be successful on our platform, and that our platform is an enabler to their creative success,\u201d she said.\n\nNigerian content creator, Tomike Adeoye, a member of the 2022 class of creators made an Instagram post where she expressed gratitude to YouTube for its support and the BlackVoices Fund for providing funds. \u201cThank you for #YouTubeBlack. Thank you for being a great source of income! Just seeing us and doing what we love, we see the dollars flow in our account monthly,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn Nigeria, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in naira) is also up by over 60%, year over year, with over 650 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 50%, year over year. Still in Nigeria, 35 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of 50%, year over year.\n\nIn South Africa, the percentage of YouTube channels making 6 figures or more in revenue (in rands) is up over 40%, year over year, with over 300 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 60%, year over year. Still, in South Africa, 25 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of over 30%, year over year. Over 65% of watch time on content produced by channels in South Africa comes from outside of South Africa.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor African football fans, the weekend is not just a time to take a break from the hustle; it is also time for battle. They watch TV screens intently, fuming, cheering, and cajoling as their teams in the various European leagues battle on the pitch.\n\nHowever, some fans now look forward to the footballing weekend for more than just the love of their teams. The love for the game is now shared with the passion for fantasy football or football betting.\n\nFantasy sports in Africa isn\u2019t much of a thing. Sports betting, however, is quite popular. In a survey conducted by GeoPoll in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, 72% of respondents had participated in betting, 53% of which was football betting.\n\nWhile fantasy sports in Africa might be a fantasy (pun intended), compared to sports betting, it is big in other regions. And though they might appear similar because they involve gambling, they are done differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of betting on real-life football teams, fantasy football involves gambling on virtual teams created by the player-manager. The teams created will include virtual forms of real-life footballers.\n\nThe virtual team manager earns points in the game based on the actual performances of their players.\n\nIn the English Premier League\u2019s Fantasy Football League (FPL), the managers get \u00a3100 million ($130.8 million) to buy 15 players from different clubs. They are only allowed to buy three players from a single club. As in real-life, players differ in price based on their performances.\n\nSome other European leagues have a fantasy version of their leagues, with the Fantasy Liga and Fantasy Bundesliga owned by the Spanish and German leagues, respectively.\n\nAccording to football magazine FourFourTwo, FPL has eight million players globally who compete to be the Jose Mourinho of fantasy football.\n\n$3 million to make fantasy football mainstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eksab team. Source: Supplied\n\nOn Monday, March 28, 2022, Eksab, an Egyptian fantasy football startup, announced that it had raised $3 million from investors to scale its platform. The round was led by 4DX Ventures, with participation from Golden Palm Investments, Darwazah Capital, P1 Ventures, and angel investors.\n\nFounded in 2018, the startup\u2019s first offering is a prediction game where users create a fantasy lineup with a leaderboard showing their progress. Users who predict correctly are eligible for prizes.\n\nWith over 700,000 users on its platform, the startup reports that its paying users have increased 60% month on month. Although the startup\u2019s current focus is on football, it plans to get into other sports soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiving betting companies a run for their money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the world, startups are capitalising on the almost religious following that sports enjoys with fantasy football offerings. Investors are also not holding back, as seen in French startup, Sorare\u2019s $680 million Series B round.\n\nIn Africa, though, betting companies are capitalising on the following that sports, particularly football, enjoys on the continent. According to Business Day, Africa\u2019s most populous country, Nigeria, spends \u20a62 billion ($4.9 million) on sports betting daily.\n\nIntervals between games are frequently littered with ads from betting companies. And some of the biggest platforms have signed up former players as ambassadors in Nigeria. However, Eksab\u2019s raise could be the beginning of fierce competition between sports betting companies and fantasy football platforms.\n\nA few factors have contributed to fantasy sports\u2019 growth. The first is that players compete against each other rather than against the bookie. Consequently, a player\u2019s result largely depends on their skill level. On the face of it, this looks positive, but it also means that unskilled players do not stand a chance against top players.\n\nThe second is the low entry barrier. Most fantasy sports sites do not require players to pay before playing. On the other hand, users need money to participate in sports betting. As a result, more people can easily join fantasy sports platforms.\n\nWhile fantasy sports seems like an evenly matched competitor for sports betting platforms, the market share of betting companies could see them add fantasy sports to their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nIt\u2019s Friday, a new month, and I hope you\u2019ve had a productive and satisfying week. This week has been a mixed one for Nigerians, especially for residents of Kaduna. First, terrorists attacked the state\u2019s lone airport; then, a train carrying over 900 passengers was attacked, with some passengers killed or kidnapped.\n\nThe Super Eagles, Nigeria\u2019s men\u2019s team, drew a World Cup qualifying game in the same week, ensuring that the country will be absent when football\u2019s biggest tournament kicks off in November.\n\nFortunately, it wasn\u2019t all sad. 18 of the 24 countries that made up Y Combinator\u2019s W22 batch are based in Nigeria, proving that investors and founders see massive potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were appearances from countries like Sudan, Namibia, and Uganda, and we discussed all that on the Techpoint Africa podcast. You can listen using your preferred podcast providers.\n\nToday\u2019s Techpoint Digest discusses waste management in Africa, Tushop\u2019s pre-seed, Khazna\u2019s Series A, and Techpoint Pitch Friday. We also have a roundup of opportunities in African tech.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\nManaging waste with tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, while on a work break, I went to get some food with Ogheneruemu. Like many eateries in Nigeria, our food was packed in plastic plates. After eating, she remarked, \u201cthese guys need a recycling plan ASAP.\u201d\n\nWaste landfills are a common sight in many African countries, but you would also find waste dumped into gutters and canals. About 2.1 billion tonnes of waste is produced each year globally, with reports stating Africa had about 125 million tonnes in 2012 and is expected to grow to 244 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nShe spoke to Damilola Kadiri, Founder of Wura, and Victor Boyle-Komolafe, GIVO\u2019s Founder, about their experiences building businesses that tackle waste management in Africa using tech.\n\nMeet two Nigerian companies using technology to change how we reuse waste\n\nGrocery shopping with the community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is one of the most common explanations for human motivation. At the lowest level are physiological needs, including food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood is probably the most critical physiological need in Africa, and not just because we need it to stay alive. Its importance can be seen during elections when politicians frequently share food during campaigns.\n\nAs food costs rise worldwide, Africa is one of the hardest-hit regions with high food inflation, meaning that its residents spend as much as 40% of their income on food alone. That figure is 56.65% in Nigeria, while Kenyans spend 36% of their income on food.\n\nWhile the best way to mitigate these problems would be to produce and preserve more food, that requires significant investments. However, Kenyan startup, Tushop, uses community group buying to help Kenyans save on food.\n\nHow does community group buying work? Someone \u2014 usually called a community leader \u2014 aggregates orders from individuals who live close to each other. It is then relayed to the vendor, farmer, or distributor, after which it is delivered to the community leader. This community leader then unpacks the orders and delivers them to those who made them.\n\nMost Africans are familiar with this, and some offices in Nigeria even operate a similar model where they buy groceries for the Christmas holidays. Now, Tushop wants to use technology to make this available to more people and has announced a $3 million pre-seed round.\n\nAided by the coronavirus pandemic, group buying has grown in popularity in China and India. In this round, Tushop has received backing from 4DX Ventures, JAM Fund, Breyer Capital, Chandaria Capital, TO Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, FirstCheck Africa, DFS Lab, Wasoko. Other investors include Raja Kaul, President Sundial Group; Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO; Eli Pollak, Apollo Agriculture CEO; and Ida Mannoh, Director of Growth, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funds raised to grow its team, improve its tech while expanding across Nairobi with its sights set on expanding to other Kenyan cities. Last week on the Techpoint Africa Podcast, we spoke about white founders in Kenya, so it\u2019s interesting to see a black female founder from Kenya today.\n\nKhazna\u2019s plans for financial inclusion in Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve come across an African fintech startup, I would have enough to take three months off and watch my favourite football team play. I promise I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m not.\n\nSo who\u2019s in the news today? Khazna, an Egyptian super app. The Cairo-based startup has announced a $38 million Series A split between debt and equity.\n\nSome of the investors involved in this round include Speedinvest, Algebra Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, Disruptech, Khawarizmi Ventures, and Nclude \u2014 the VC fund launched by some Egyptian banks. By the way, I\u2019ve observed that many African startups are increasingly favouring debt financing.\n\nWhat does Khazna do? Putting Khazna in a box might be difficult. While the startup offers financial services, it also has other non-financial services.\n\nHowever, the startup launched with Khazna HR, a salary-on-demand service that enables partner employers to offer partial discounts to their employees before payday.\n\nThe startup is not the only one playing in that field, with Earnipay and Cadana as some of its competitors in the African market. While these startups offer it as a standalone service, it is just one of several services that Khazna offers.\n\nThe startup also offers a buy now, pay later service, available in 1,000 merchant stores in Egypt. With 150,000 users, the startup is dreaming big and plans to increase that number to 1 million by the end of 2022.\n\nApril\u2019s Techpoint Pitch Friday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.\n\nThe quote above attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson suggests that the man with a better product will always have the most customers.\n\nHowever, with numerous (identical) brands competing for our attention, it\u2019s not enough to have a good product.

          "text": "The new limit placed on bank customers\u2019 dollar spending through their naira-denominated cards is taking a toll on manufacturers in Nigeria, BusinessDay has learnt.\n\nSome banks recently announced the reduction of the monthly spending limit on the naira debit cards to $20 from $100, while some temporarily suspended the usage of the cards for international transactions.\n\nManufacturers in need of dollars to import raw materials have been patronising the unofficial foreign exchange market or the black market at a high cost.\n\n\u201cI believe this development is based on CBN\u2019s directive, which seems to be focusing on the demand side of foreign exchange management,\u201d Taiwo Oyedele, head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC, said.\n\nHe said the restriction would push more legitimate demands into the black market, thereby pushing up the rate and widening the gap compared to the official rate.\n\n\u201cGiven that even manufacturers source a significant percentage of their foreign exchange needs from the parallel market, this could further squeeze their margins while fuelling inflation,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nThe cost of the dollar is currently at N587/$ at the parallel market, while at the official market, known as the Investors and Exporters (I&E) forex window, the naira remained unchanged at N417/$ on Wednesday.\n\nA manufacturer told BusinessDay that some manufacturers had been forced to reduce the costs of production by reducing the quality and the quantity of goods produced.\n\n\u201cIt is devastating. People are clamoring to get more dollars and you are cutting down. We go to the black market to source dollars to import, and it is expensive. It affects the cost of our production. It is cheaper when we source dollars from the banks. Like I said, it is devastating. It affects our turnover,\u201d said Michael Iweka, CEO of Mackingdom Industries Co. Limited.\n\nRead also: From $4,000 to zero: Banks cut dollar spend on naira card\n\nMore banks are notifying their customers of the downward review of the monthly spending limit on naira-denominated cards.\n\n\u201cDue to current market realities on foreign exchange, we\u2019ve reviewed cross-border transaction limits for the Naira Mastercard, Naira Credit Card, our virtual card and Visa Prepaid Naira card further to $20 monthly. This will take effect on 1 April 2022,\u201d FirstBank of Nigeria said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAlso, international ATM withdrawals will not be allowed with our naira cards at this time. For increased transaction limits, please use your Visa Debit Multicurrency Card, Visa Prepaid (USD) Card and Visa Gold Credit Card to enjoy transaction limits up to $10,000 and other exciting benefits,\u201d the bank said in a note to its customers.\n\nOther banks that have also informed their customers of a reduction in monthly spending limit or temporal suspension of naira debit cards include Ecobank, Zenith Bank, GTBank, and UBA.\n\nWith the suspension by some banks of the usage of naira-denominated debit cards for international transactions, the monthly spending limit for customers has dropped to zero from over $4,000 seven years ago.\n\nIn April 2015, the spending limit on naira-denominated cards for international transactions was $50,000 per person per annum or $4,166.7 per month.\n\nLower oil production below the budgeted benchmark despite high crude oil price led to limited foreign currency inflows needed to boost the country\u2019s external reserves, FSDH Research said in a report.",

          "text": "The rise in Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate in the first quarter of 2022 was mainly shaped by the impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, and there may be yet more pain to come for households and businesses in the country.\n\nDriven by soaring energy and food prices, February\u2019s price growth (inflation) outstripped the expectations of analysts as it came in at 15.70 percent against the 15.60 percent witnessed in January.\n\nWhile the Central Bank of Nigeria has stuck to its guns so far by keeping interest rates unchanged, despite the pressure from accelerating inflation and rising global interest rates, there are growing signs of a possible hike at some point this year.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, BusinessDay highlights five themes that shaped inflation in the first quarter.\n\nDiesel and petrol prices more than doubled\n\nFrom a January average of N288($.70) per litre, diesel now sells for over N700 ($1.69) per litre in Nigeria, thus causing widespread anxiety for businesses that rely on the product to power generators that make up for historically unstable power supply.\n\nPetrol prices, on the other hand, soared more than a 100 percent as the scarcity sent the prices soaring from the officiate price range of N162-N165 per litre to about N400 per litre in some filling stations and N450-N500 per litre at black market outlets.\n\nThe rise in the price of diesel has been linked to the rise in the price of crude oil in the international market, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis, and the fall in the value of the naira.\n\nMost businesses, including large ones as well as micro, small and medium enterprises, use generators because of the perennial power supply problem in the country. For example, some Lagos-based radio stations that used to broadcast for 24 hours have had to reduce the number of hours they operate. Manufacturers have also lamented the impact of the cost of diesel on their business.\n\nExperts have raised concerns on the effect that these would have on the economy.\n\nAs a result of the increase in the prices of petroleum products, especially diesel, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria said Nigerians should expect a higher inflation rate and a surge in the prices of goods and services.\n\nDomestic airline fares jumped over 100%\n\nBefore now, the economy class fares hovered between N23,300 and N31,000, although rates rose to as much as N60,000 during the last festive season.\n\nHowever, late last month, most domestic airlines pegged their minimum fare at N50,000.\n\nThe airline operators under the aegis of Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), in a statement issued last month, listed some of the operational challenges causing flight delays and cancellations including unavailability of aviation fuel (Jet A1), the ever-rising cost of aviation fuel and unavailability of foreign exchange for spare parts and maintenance.\n\nThe statement indicated that passengers were no longer going to receive discounts, even if they booked weeks ahead as it used to happen.\n\nThis development elicited reactions from Nigerians as they complained about the insecurity bedevilling the roads and the rail lines as well as the harsh conditions accompanying these other modes of transport.\n\nThey further complained that the increment did not put into consideration the income capacity of the average man.\n\nRead also: Reinforcing coin usage unlikely to counter price Inflation- Experts\n\nAfeez Ogundare, an Abuja civil servant, expressed his displeasure with the development, saying the abrupt nature of the announcement was a disservice to the general populace.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a little inconsiderate to drop a piece of big news like that on Nigerians without any prior notice. It seemed as though the aviation authorities do not have any form of consideration for their customers; all they are about is their pockets and that is not healthy for long-run business relationships.\n\n\u201cThe ripple effect from this decision would result in increased insecurity on our roads and rails once these terrorists become aware that we have been backed to a corner.\u201d\n\nThe huge increase in airfares was, however, a development that was expected following the recent hike in the price of aviation fuel and the slide in the foreign exchange rate as a result of the current crisis between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIncreased electricity tariff\n\nWhile most Nigerians were not aware of this development, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) declared in March that subsidy on power amounting to about N600bn during some period had been stopped by the Federal Government.\n\nThe commission also revealed that electricity tariffs were raised in February this year, and was quick to, however, state that the tariffs payable by some customers in the franchise area of one of the distribution companies was reduced.\n\nThis came as power generation companies condemned the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), saying that NBET was failing in its obligations in terms of payment for power generated by the generation companies.\n\nLast August, NERC had directed the distribution companies (DisCos) to commence the collection of service-based tariffs from the following month. This was targeted at increasing the cost of electricity by over 50 percent, in order to enable the government to end subsidy in the electricity sector. But shortly after the statement went public, a top government official said the statement was issued in error and there was a stoppage on the directive.\n\nAlthough the DisCos have not officially announced a hike in their tariffs, customers have complained that the energy distributors had devised a way of reducing the units of electricity for the same amount.\n\nYet, stakeholders in the sector maintained that the increase in some quarters may have confirmed the suspicion that the service-based tariff may be implemented in phases without drawing the attention of the end-users to it.\n\nThe government, however, has denied any recent increase in electricity tariff as the moratorium on its investment is to serve as a buffer against any increase on the side of the consumers.\n\nStakeholders have argued that allowing market operators to determine the course of action simply means that Nigerians are to pay the full commercial price for power as determined by the generation and distribution companies.\n\nSoaring bread prices\n\nTrue to their threat, bread producers have consistently jerked up the prices of bread and other confectionaries across the country since last year.\n\nThis is coming for the second time since last year. The first price review was done last year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted economic activities.\n\nThis year, a 50 percent increase or more is expected on the back of the ripple effects of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nThe Premium Bread-Makers Association of Nigeria, indicated last week that the harsh business environment, which had forced several bakers to shut down operations, would automatically trigger an increase in the price of the commodity this month. They described the present situation as worrisome and imminently crippling for operators in the bread-making businesses segment.\n\nThough the development has been attributed to incessant increases in prices of baking materials, which have made it difficult for the bakers to break even, there are fears that the new development will further aggravate the hardship in the country, especially for lovers of bread.\n\nThe price of a big-sized bread has increased to N600 from N300.00. The increase cuts across all categories of sizes.\n\nCore inflation rose to its highest level in four years\n\nThe ripple effects of the war in Ukraine reflected in the last inflation figures as core inflation also rose to its highest level in over four years at 14.01 percent.\n\nThe \u2018all items less farm produce\u2019 or core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce, stood at 14.01 percent in February 2022, up by 0.14 percent when compared to the 13.87 percent recorded in January.\n\nThis is the highest core inflation rate recorded since April 2017, largely attributed to the significant increase in price of petroleum products.\n\nAccording to the report, the highest increases were recorded in the prices of gas, liquid fuel, wine, tobacco, spirit, narcotics, and solid fuels, among others.\n\nThe scary detail about these statistics is that the last time Nigeria witnessed a core inflation increase of this magnitude was the year Nigeria was battling recession and was also the year Nigeria witnessed its highest inflation rate in the last decade.\n\n\u201cOur prayer is that Nigeria does not witness a repeat of what was experienced that year,\u201d said Emeka Ucheaga, CEO of EUA Intelligence.",

          "text": "The federal government through its Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) managed by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) says it has so far spent some N157bn on the Second Niger Bridge which is now confirmed will be ready for opening by October this year.\n\nZainah Ahmed, the finance minister, confirmed the funding and the completion date on Saturday during an inspection tour of the bridge, to ascertain the level of work at the construction site. Ahmed was accompanied by Farouk Gomel, the NSIA board chairman; Uche Orji, the managing director; as well as Onyeka Ibezim, the new deputy governor of Anambra State among other dignitaries.\n\nThe visit came barely three weeks after Ibrahim Gambari, chief of staff to the president equally toured the construction site to ascertain the extent of work on that bridge.\n\nAccording to the Finance Minister, the bridge when completed will not only ease the traffic gridlock usually experienced in the area but will enhance commercial and other business activities within the communities.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the very important projects in the country at about N206bn and we have been able to fund this project to the tune of N157bn.\n\nRead also: Second Niger bridge to be ready by April \u2013 FG\n\n\u201cI have come to see where this money is going. Also, the significance of today is that the two ends of the bridge are being linked together, which is the final phase of the work,\u201d she said.\n\nShe expressed satisfaction with the level and standard of the construction under Julius Berger Nig Limited, and that she can now report to President Buhari about her findings on the bridge, which according to her \u201cis very dear to the President.\u201d\n\n\u201cTechnically, I can report to Mr President that I have seen where all the N157bn has gone to. This is a project that is very dear to the President and it is designed to uplift the lives and livelihood of the people of the South-East and other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cWe hope that when this project comes on stream, it will ease traffic, enhance commercial activities and improve the lives of the people of the state.\n\n\u201cI am happy to see the ladies I am seeing at the construction site, not all men. Julius Berger has brought some very unique innovations in the construction of this project and I want to, on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria applaud the skills of the construction workers that have been working on this site.\u201d\n\nAccording to her the project which links the Eastern part to the other parts of the country is designed to ease movement on that axis, ease the strain on the existing Niger Bridge, enhance commercial activities, trade and also improve the lives of the citizens in the South East and South-South states.\n\nAhmed further commended Julius Berger for utilizing over fifty percent of the workforce from the communities around, thereby creating about 20,000 jobs so far.\n\nThe 2nd Niger Bridge is being funded by the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) created by President Buhari to accelerate the completion of key infrastructure projects, including the Lagos Ibadan Expressway and the Abuja Kaduna, Kano road.\n\nOn the nature of the project as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement, she said that apart from the federal government seed funds through budgetary allocations, the recovery made from Abacha loot, as part of the PIDF, the NSIA is also expected to bring in other private capital which is expected to be recouped, with of course returns.\n\nRead also: Second Niger Bridge: Enhancing social integration and regional connectivity\n\nCommenting on the project, Farouk Gumel expressed the board\u2019s satisfaction with the quality and pace of work.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the 2nd Niger Bridge is a vital piece of national infrastructure. At completion, we expect that it will serve as an enabler to cross-regional economic activities and stimulate growth on a national scale,\u201d Gumel said.\n\nOrji also commended the extent and quality of work and spoke on the issue of compensation to the affected people and communities, which he said quite some amount has been spent on and was still ongoing, as government tidies up assessment of the remaining areas.\n\nHe assured that everybody that is supposed to be compensated will eventually be paid.\n\n\u201cThe directive we have from the president and from the minister was to ensure that adequate compensation is paid to everyone who is affected\u201d.\n\nIbezim commended the federal government for the project but appealed that the October completion date should be maintained.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s presidency has accused the country\u2019s main opposition party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) of playing politics of hate and division, just as it alleged that the party looted $20bn from the NNPC.\n\nThis is in response to the position of PDP governors forum that the All Progressives Congress (APC) government destroyed the country and is therefore unfit to participate in the 2023 general election.\n\nRecall that PDP governors had after their regular meeting at the Umuobiakwa country home of its Vice-chairman and Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, on March 23, passed a vote of no confidence on the APC-led regime of Muhammadu Buhari, saying that the governing party has become \u201cuncaring and a menace to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe Forum also expressed shock that \u201cin the face of these statistics of complete failure in all ramifications and areas, the APC still wants to be on the ballot in 2023\u201d.\n\nIt, therefore, advised Nigerians to reject the APC if it dares to appear in the 2023 polls saying \u201cIt is impossible for a party so disorganised to offer good governance to the people of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nBut the presidency which in response, levelled the allegations in a statement on Sunday by Mallam Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, accused the main opposition party\u2019s politicians of \u201craiding the NNPC,\u201d consistently failing to pay into the Federation Account and, \u201cin the last year of PDP misrule, $20bn was simply found missing.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThese people, who play politics of division and hate, create communal disturbances, need to change\u2026check the facts and leave the politics: What does the country get with this kind of gimmick?\u201d\n\nIn the statement titled \u2018Issues from the PDP fantasy communique from Umuahia,\u2019 the presidency accused the main opposition of trying to \u201ccover up the serial and criminal failures of its long and damaging period in office, which the Muhammadu Buhari regime and All Progressives Congress have strived these past seven years to repair.\u201d\n\nReminiscing the PDP years, it said \u201cWe cannot forget under PDP, the nation had an army full of phantom soldiers whose pay went to PDP politicians\u2019 pockets while our under-resourced real soldiers died in the fight against terrorist insurgents and our international allies refused to supply Nigeria kit and military aid.\n\n\u201cWe cannot ignore how PDP politicians sought\u2014and continue to seek\u2014to inflame ethnic and religious tensions by refusing to even proffer a solution to the herder-farmer clashes which became most prevalent under their misrule.\n\n\u201cWe will always remember how PDP politicians intentionally encouraged and exploited the black market in currency exchange to convert ill-gotten gains to foreign currency and undermine our national currency, then spirited their funds abroad in their billions and into foreign bank accounts.\u201d\n\nContrastingly, the Presidency argued that the Army, under the APC is well resourced with fighter jets and other armaments; Boko Haram is being driven from every inch of Nigerian territory, and ISWAP\u2019s leader was eliminated in a Nigerian airstrike.\n\n\u201cToday with APC in government, there are ranches on Federal land and in state land where there is the willingness to establish them. Clashes are reduced. Lives are saved, and livelihoods are enriched.\n\n\u201cToday with APC we support our national currency; we have achieved self-sufficiency in rice and fertilizer production; we refuse to allow greedy politicians and businessmen to hide their money overseas, and instead build an economy here in Nigeria for all.\u201d\n\nIt further accused the main opposition of \u201craiding the NNPC,\u201d consistently failing to pay into the Federation Account and, \u201cin the last year of PDP misrule, $20bn was simply found \u2018missing.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Presidency noted that with APC, funds from NNPC are directly and transparently used to fund social and health programmes\u2014such as COVID-19 response, the construction of roads, bridges and rail, and equipping of hospitals to cope with new and existing challenges.\n\nShehu\u2019s statement also knocked the Governors who signed the Communique saying \u201cWho would trust such people with the running of our country? Who can believe a word these people say, as they looked outwardly stylish but harrowed by power-sharing and other troubles inwardly?\n\n\u201cThese people, who play politics of division and hate, create communal disturbances, need to change.

I have never been, I will never be, that is not my calling, I am called to be a pastor. That is what God called me to be, that is why you don\u2019t have me carrying a very big title. He said to me clearly, you\u2019re to be Pastor. So, I am a pastor, I have said it again and again and again, I am not even a prophet, I only hear from Him once in a while and that will come in as I continue in my little talk with you today. Because, I need to get this clear once and for all.\u201d\n\nThe clergy who turned 80 recently, emphasized his calling is to be a pastor and not a politician, noting that his assignment has nothing to do with partisan politics.\n\n\u201cMy assignment is to pray for you, pray for Nations including Nigeria, my assignment has nothing to do with partisan politics, don\u2019t distract my attention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou will bear me out, those of you who are genuine members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, I have never told you, this is the fellow you should vote for, have I ever said that once? Whether in secret or in the open? Never! I have never said: this is the party you should belong to; I have never said it, I will never say it and you know why?\n\n\u201cIn the Redeemed Christian Church of God every party is heavily represented, everyone, APC, PDP, APGA, LABOUR PARTY and some party that you don\u2019t even know their names, the only reason I have never voted is that if I vote for anyone, I will be unjust to the rest of my children, I am the Father of all and I like it that way. All I am saying and I am saying it loud and clear, as a Nigerian, every one of you, you\u2019re all Nigerian, you\u2019re Nigerian before you became a Christian, because nobody is born a Christian, you\u2019re a true Christian after you gave your life to Jesus Christ.

By doing such, it will continue to reduce the challenges Nigerians are facing.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate for someone to wake up in the morning, thinking of what to eat, how to go to the hospital or take their children to school, but this programme has reduced such difficulties for people.\n\n\u201cAnd if a law is enacted and it becomes permanent, no government will come and stop it, and Nigerians will continue to enjoy the programme and it will continue to reduce unemployment,\u201d he said.\n\nGov. Masari assured the beneficiaries of the programme that their message will get to President Buhari and the national assembly.\n\nHe further called on the beneficiaries to also write to their representatives at the national assembly on their demand, so that they can pursue the issue at their levels.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the state\u2019s Coordinator of the SPGFVI, Mr Mustapha Bara\u2019u, said their main objective is to ensure the wellbeing of Nigerians, especially the youths, elderly, physically challenged people, and women and pupils.\n\nAccording to him, that is why they developed an interest in the NSIP programme because it is directly related to one of their major objectives.\n\nHe explained that the rally was earlier held at the ward levels across the state, where their commendation letters were presented to the District heads for further transmission to the President, Vanguard reported.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "General overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has said he is not aware yet if there will be election in Nigeria in 2023, but said he should not be quoted as saying there will be no election.\n\nPastor Adeboye, 80, said God has not revealed to him whether there would an election next year.\n\nHe noted that that God spoke to him about the 2019 elections more than a year to the election but the case has not been so with the 2023 election.\n\nHe noted, however, that God might still speak to him about the 2023 general elections but He has not spoken to him yet.\n\nThe octogenarian preacher said this on Sunday at the monthly Thanksgiving Service of the Church.\n\nAdeboye said the clarification was important amid the criticisms against the church\u2019s creation of a Politics Directorate and the instruction to members to be politically involved in the 2023 electioneering process.\n\n\u201cListen to me carefully and if you are going to quote me, quote me correctly. I am talking to those of you who are my children. Do you want to know the truth? And nothing but the truth? I am talking of myself now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs of now, as I am standing before you, I still don\u2019t know whether or not there would be an election next year. Don\u2019t say that Pastor Adeboye said there would be no election next year; that\u2019s not what I said. Adeboye does not know yet, put the word \u2018yet\u2019.\n\n\u201cHow come you don\u2019t know? Because my father has not talked to me about it yet. The last time we had an election, He (God) spoke to me about the election by June of the previous year and this is April. So, it is not late but He hasn\u2019t told me yet.\u201d\n\nThe octogenarian, according to PUNCH, thereafter threw a challenge to the congregation seated before him. Adeboye said, \u201cHe (God) must have told you \u2013 some of you who are prophets, you are closer to Him (God) but is there anyone of you here who can raise your hand to heaven and say without any doubt, there will be an election in 2023. If you can tell us, stand up and we will clap for a prophet.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. Remember to put the word \u2018yet\u2019,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) Sunday confirmed the safety of 170 passengers aboard the Abuja-Kaduna train attacked by terrorists last Monday.\n\nThe corporation also said 21 others were still missing.\n\nManaging Director NRC Fidet Okhiria said this in a statement issued Sunday, a copy of which was obtained by Blueprint in Abuja.\n\nThe tragic incident occurred March 28 at the Kateri-Rijana area of Kaduna state.\n\nThe corporation also said seven coaches were recovered while efforts were on towards restoring normalcy in its services to the teeming customers.\n\nOkhiria said: \u201cFrom the last release, we confirmed that four Coaches (SP 00004, SP00009, SP00012 and SP00013) out of the 11 Coaches involved in the incident have been re-railed and safely moved to Rigasa Station while work is ongoing on track repairs.\n\n\u201cWe did also state that 170 of the passengers on board the train are safe while 21 other passengers are reported missing.\n\n\u201cAt the end of work on Saturday evening (02/04/2022) the NRC\u2019s restoration team has further re-railed four more Coaches and two of the coaches (SP 00007 and SP 00013) had been safely moved to Idu and Rigasa Stations respectively.\n\n\u201cThe other two coaches are still at the site due to damaged tracks. This brings the total coaches so far re-railed to 7, but only 5 successfully moved to the stations.\n\n\u201cHowever, efforts are on to link the track, at the moment, a total of 80 meters of the affected section has been fixed including replacement of affected sleepers and twisted rails.\u201d\n\nOkhira condoles with relations of those who lost their loved ones and prayed for the repose of their souls.\n\nSimilarly, the management sympathised \u201cwith the injured passengers and indeed everyone on board the AK9 train of Monday 28, for the trauma this unfortunate incident had caused them.\u201d\n\nHe was full of gratitude to the security agencies, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air Force, Police, and NSCDC, among others, for their support and cooperation.\n\nSpecifically, he lauded Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Baba Alkali for his support and visit to the accident site, which he said, boosted their morale.\n\nOkhiria assured of the corporation\u2019s readiness to keep Nigerians abreast of development to guide against misleading information and falsehood.\n\nKebbi captives\n\nIn a related development, the people of Udaci village in Kanya district of Danko/Wasagu local government area of Zuru Emirate in Kebbi state have cried out over the non-release of their loved ones by bandits despite paying a N10milllion ransom.\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint in a telephone interview, spokesperson of the Udaci community, Malam Garba Indi Udaci, said although the security situation in the area had improved, but those held captive by the bandits were yet to be freed.\n\n\u201cAll what I will tell you is what I saw happening live with my two eyes opened and in a broad day light. We just saw these bandits numbering about two hundred on motorcycles and ordered everybody to gather at the town centre, including women and children.\n\n\u201cThey said we should declare anything, money or any valuable item including jewelleries, animals and food items, yet after the ransacked us, they matched away with over 25 people, including pregnant and breast-feeding mothers,\u201d he said.\n\nGarba further added that a day after the kidnap, the bandits called the community demanding N25million as ransom to secure the release of their people.\n\nHe said the community was left with no option than to raise the little they could and finally bargained for N10million which was paid to the bandits.\n\n\u201cSo they collected this whopping sum from us and still refused to let those in captivity go while demanding for additional ten million naira and two hundred thousand naira recharge card, we are financially broke and had nothing to offer again,\u201d he lamented.\n\nGarba said two of his younger brothers were amongst those kidnapped.\n\nIn a reaction, spokesman of the Kebbi state Police Command, SP Nafiu Abubakar, said the command was not aware of such development and asked the community to hold the middle man responsible.\n\nACF tasks FG\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has called on the federal government and security agencies to go all out in total war against terror and all forms of insecurity to rid the country of threats to lives and properties.\n\nAccording to the pan-northern socio-cultural organisation, the spate of insecurity, bandits\u2019 attacks on airport, train, roads and in various northern communities had made it imperative to rid the country of all forms of terror and ensure lasting solution to security challenges across the country, hence the need to deploy full military might to crush the terrorists.\n\nACF Secretary General Malam Murtala Aliyu (Matawallen Gombe) said this in a statement on Sunday.\n\nAliyu said: \u201cThe new dimension of the terror attacks, in the country, both on human and infrastructure calls for total war. The authorities may look at the possibility of utilising volunteers, such as the ex-servicemen and women, the civilian task forces, hunters and whatever is available to make every inch of Nigeria habitable and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe must appreciate the responsibility bestowed on us by providence as the largest black nation and as a leader on our continent must do everything within our powers to keep Nigeria stable and strong. The security of the country rests on the central government and calls for cursory, calm, implementable and lasting solution. It emphasised that invitation of foreign forces or mercenaries to fight our course must be treated with utmost caution.\n\n\u201cOn the proposition to escort trains from Abuja to Kaduna, Ibadan to Lagos or the Itakpe routes, by the Nigerian Airforce, the Forum calls on the security agency to redesign their operations and instead deploy their machinery and manpower in launching attacks on the bandits and terrorists enclaves. Dedicating such operations to only railway lines, shall make air and road users more vulnerable to such attacks.\n\n\u201cThe Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, calls on the entire Muslims, Christians and all religions, to embark on prayers towards the sustainance of peace and tranquility in the North and the country in general. The Forum wishes the various religions utilise the entire holy month of Ramadhan and the Easter period, in addition to, at least all Sundays and Fridays of the months of April and May, as sober period to atone our sins and pray for mercy from our Creator.\n\n\u201cNigeria, most especially the Northern states, could not be said to be in the state of tranquillity that warrants development. The entire country cries of peace. This calls for sober reflection and absolute return to our Creator for repentance.\n\n\u201cThe ACF calls on the leadership of our political parties to structure their manifestos to address our challenges and refocus our psyche towards the peaceful growth and development of the country and not the current race for the sake of power or material gains. The holistic submission on the failure of governance, as attested by our governors, is an indication that all is not well in the nooks and corners of the territory call Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have no other territory than this, so also a country but Nigeria.

This was the highest national case count since the early days of the pandemic in February 2020.\n\nChina is also battling a large outbreak in the northeastern province of Jilin.\n\nSent to Shanghai by the central government, Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan urged the city on Saturday to \u201cmake resolute and swift moves\u201d to curb the pandemic.\n\nGROWING ANGER\n\nStories of how Shanghai separates COVID-positive children from their parents have gone viral in the country and triggered widespread public anger. read more\n\nSome have also demanded clarity over the testing regime, after a recorded phone call, reportedly between a Shanghai health official and a resident, was widely shared on Chinese social media.\n\nShanghai health officials said on Saturday they were investigating the case, in which the resident said his father had tested negative, according to his personal health app, but was told he was positive and had to be centrally quarantined.\n\nIn a rare instance of grassroots lobbying, several residents reposted a statement on the WeChat and Weibo social media platforms saying they wanted asymptomatic or mild cases to be allowed to isolate at home, after reports of unsanitary and crowded conditions at quarantine facilities.\n\nJane Polubotko, a Ukrainian marketing manager quarantining at the Shanghai New International Expo Center, told Reuters there were no showers at the facility and she had only seen people with light symptoms, such as sneezes and coughs.\n\nSupply chains and businesses are also being tested.\n\nRiver congestion for containers and oil tankers off Shanghai has been easing since Thursday, but the number of bulkers queuing in outer Yangtze estuary anchorage jumped to nearly 90, the most since early October, Refinitiv data showed.\n\nNearby ports, such as Ningbo in Zhejiang province, are experiencing an acute surge in waiting vessels waiting, as companies divert cargos to avoid prolonged logistics turnarounds.\n\nStill\uff0csome are hoping that lockdowns could start to ease soon.\n\nTesla Inc (TSLA.O) hopes to resume production at its Shanghai factory on Monday, two people familiar with the matter said, as it expects to see its first batch of workers released from lockdown.",

This vital and abundant resource can also be made cleaner and environment-friendly using appropriate technology. \u201cThat notwithstanding, Nigeria still aims at reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2030 through anti-gas flaring regulations and working closely with oil and gas companies,\u201d the minister said.\n\nOn his part, Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe, stressed that Nigeria stands to add 800,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the implementation of some important upstream projects that have been stalled due to insufficient funding.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Soyinka: Omisore\u2019s Election as APC National Secretary Has Crippled Probe of Bola Ige\u2019s Murder",
          "text": "Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, on Saturday faulted the decision of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to elect Senator Iyiola Omisore, as its National Secretary.\n\nSoyinka described Omisore as \u201cone of the prime suspects\u201d in the murder of a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Chief Bola Ige.\n\nIn a statement released Saturday, the Nobel laureate said Omisore\u2019s election has \u201chamstrung\u201d the investigation into Ige\u2019s death.\n\nThe Nobel laureate wondered why President Muhammadu Buhari anointed Omisore as the party\u2019s scribe after he (the president) responded to his demand to re-open Ige\u2019s unresolved murder at the 20th anniversary of the tragic incident.\n\nHe raised diverse questions on Buhari\u2019s commitment to resolving the murder case after he had ordered the Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Baba to re-open the case files and resume the investigation.\n\nIge, also a former governor of old Oyo State, was gruesomely murdered on December 23, 2001, by yet-to-be-identified assailants in his Solemilia Court located at No 8, Akinlabi Sanda Close, Bodija in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHis murder triggered the sudden death of his wife, Justice Atinuke Ige.\n\nOmisore, the then Deputy Governor of Osun State, was fingered in the murder of the late AGF as the prime suspect, having been entangled in the protracted internal crisis that plagued the defunct Alliance for Democracy (AD).\n\nIge, Omisore and his former principal, Chief Bisi Akande, were deeply involved in the party\u2019s crisis.\n\nIge\u2019s assassination was linked to an altercation that happened at the palace of Ooni of Ife, the late Oba Sijuwade Okunade during the conferment of chieftaincy title on some personalities.\n\nIn December 2002, Omisore was impeached as the Deputy Governor of Osun State over breach of oath of office and other offences.\n\nAfter his impeachment, Omisore was arrested and detained over Ige\u2019s murder but he repeatedly denied any involvement.\n\nHe was however, discharged and acquitted in June 2004 by an Ibadan High Court, which cited \u201ccontradictions and inconsistencies\u201d as well as insufficient evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case.\n\nOmisore, a former senator, was adopted as the APC National Secretary at the party\u2019s last national convention in Abuja.\n\nLamenting what he described as an unusual turn of events, Soyinka, in his statement yesterday, said these events had raised questions because the ruling party had just elected as its National Secretary one of the prime suspects of the most notorious of the nation\u2019s unsolved murders.\n\nHe said: \u201cNot for a moment does one suggest that mere accusation, even trial, presumes guilt. More than a mere verdict is involved in any trial, however.\n\n\u201cThe process of arriving at that ultimate destination \u2013 justice \u2013 is integral to the very concept of democracy and equality under the law. That process is one of the structures of civic education.\n\n\u201cUnresolved till today were quite some untidy, even suspect aspects of the investigation, prosecution and trials, aspects, which revealed improper cell co-habitation by suspects under custody.\n\n\u201cThat this led necessarily to recantations of earlier depositions is not thereby proven, but the fact remains that such U-turns did take place. One was so brazen that it induced a heart attack that proved fatal to the victim\u2019s wife, another Justice \u2013 Mrs Atinuke Ige.\n\n\u201cThat the prime suspect was privileged in some improper ways went beyond mere allegation. Political interventions, including pressure on the judiciary during bail hearings, cannot be denied. A judge under such pressure kept a diary with accusations, pages of which he consigned to friends for safekeeping.\u201d\n\nExplaining what Omisore\u2019s emergence means to re-opening Ige\u2019s murder case, Soyinka said the resumption of an investigation into the murder case was already hamstrung and disrobed of credibility with the emergence of a prime suspect in the case as the National Secretary of the ruling APC.\n\nWith Omisore\u2019s emergence as the APC National Secretary, Soyinka rhetorically asked: \u201cIs the Inspector-General of Police equipped to confront political obstacles in a resumption of investigation?\n\n\u201cIs there any guarantee that the result will see the light of day? How suspect, ab initio, will be the conclusions, given the present political ordering? To this layman, that investigative revisit is already hamstrung and disrobed of credibility.\n\n\u201cI think the nation should simply relieve President Buhari of his pledge. I am certain the Inspector-General of Police will be equally relieved and can now turn his mind and energy to the national accustomed posture \u2013 business as usual.\u201d\n\nSoyinka wondered what happened to Buhari\u2019s pledge to re-open an enquiry into the country\u2019s spate of political murders in response to his demand at the 20th anniversary of Ige\u2019s murder.\n\nHe lamented that barely three months had passed since the 20th anniversary of Ige\u2019s murder \u2013 an occasion, which according to him, was used to remind the president of a subsisting election pledge.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat pledge was to re-open the files on the spate of unsolved political assassinations that had plagued the nation in recent decades. Prominent among those cases was that of the Minister of Justice, murdered on his way to take up a prestigious position with the United Nations.\n\n\u201cPresidential response was swift. Buhari ordered the Inspector-General of Police to re-open those files and resume investigations. The nation has patiently awaited even a hint of work in progress.\n\n\u201cMost, I am certain, expect no less than a revaluation of prior investigative efforts. None, to my knowledge, has attempted to rush the Chief of Police and his team into judgment.\n\n\u201cWe all take solace in the knowledge that the wheels of justice grind slowly, but they arrive. Eventually,\u201d Soyinka said in his statement doubting the president\u2019s pledge to resolve Ige\u2019s murder.\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",
