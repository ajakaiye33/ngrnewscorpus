Bala Muhammad of Bauchi state have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger state.\n\nThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.\n\nThe correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday 20th April, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting; and, unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\nThe team further agreed that Sen. Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything. The proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm of the same day was aborted unilaterally by Sen. Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, 21st, 2022, same Sen Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday, Gov. Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working. This is the reason Gov. Tambuwal was absent at today\u2019s (Friday) meeting in Minna. As a result, therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Gov. Tambuwal, who had earlier on informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\nMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not a consensus candidate.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Gov Tambuwal has submitted his Presidential nomination forms and now that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four has clearly collapsed, will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primaries.\n\nThis is in consonance with his acclaimed outlook as a pan-Nigerian candidate, with pedigree of national service as the Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, life member of the Body of Benchers and now in his second and final term as Governor of Sokoto state.",

The most central and significant of them, according to Aror, is the free Internet access to schools in Lagos and Oyo States.\n\nImportantly, Aror emphasized ipNX readiness to extend such services to other parts of the country, particularly in schools, because of the importance of ICT to educational development.\n\nResponding to the ipNX delegation, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, who was represented by the Commission\u2019s Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management (ECSM), Adeleke Adewolu, thanked ipNX for the visit and for the testimony about how NCC\u2019s regulatory activities have caused growth in leaps and bounds in the fortunes of the telecom ecosystem.\n\nAdewolu declared that NCC is particularly gratified by the remarkable and quantifiable impact of Commission\u2019s activities on the economy, including increase in the sectoral contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Adewolu promised that the encouraging words of ipNX\u2019s delegation will spur the Commission to put in more efforts towards achieving its mandate.\n\nPutting in context the trajectory of landmarks in the telecom sector, Adeleke recalled the history of the evolution of the telecom industry in Nigeria, declaring that Decree 75 of 1992 which established the Commission, was a great feat. The NCC Executive Commissioner also said the courageous deregulation and liberalisation of the telecom sector by the Federal Government in the year 2000 was a masterstroke.\n\nAdewolu said that action triggered uncommon liberalization that caused a rare leap in the democratisation of access to telephone services, from a few hundred hitherto existing fixed lines in 1992 to over two hundred million subscriptions today.\n\nNudging ipNX to offer its best to the growth of the telecom sector, the ECSM stated that the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and the capacity of the Nigerian economy to survive the contagion have demonstrated the importance of the telecom sector because most social and economic activities simply migrated to online platforms. \u201cSo we are delighted about your interest in expanding broadband infrastructure\u201d, Adewolu said to underscore the importance and contribution of broadband infrastructure to human survival at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ECSM also informed the visitors that the Commission, with the supervision of the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, is ready and willing to partner with stakeholders to accomplish the objectives of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030; and the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025.\n\nAdewolu, reckoning the correlation between increase in broadband infrastructure and GDP of economies, asserted that the Management of NCC is all out to work with all stakeholders, including its licensed Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos), to expand broadband access, especially to the unserved and underserved areas of the country.\n\nAt the reception of ipNX delegation were other Management staff of the Commission including Usman Mamman, Deputy Director, Licensing and Authorisation; Afure Iloka, Special Assistant on Legal Matters to the EVC; Dr. Omoniyi Ibietan, Head Online Media, who represented Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, Director Public Affairs; Abubakar Kurfi, Assistant Director, Licensing and Authorisation; and Quassim Odunmbaku, the Special Assistant to the ECSM.\n\nAror, was accompanied on the visit to the Commission by the Group Executive Director, Commercials, ipNX, Bimpe Olaleye; Divisional CEO, ipNX Infrastructure Division, Uche Nnakenyi; and Tunde Olorunyomi, Financial Controller, ipNX.",

We will finish it 28 and 29. But if I die, dead persons don\u2019t contest elections.\n\n\u201cBut I know that God has promised me that I won\u2019t die. There is nothing that will make me withdraw from it.\n\n\u201cIt is what I want to do for my country. Before I came out I told my wife and she asked me to go. If I didn\u2019t tell my wife and she became angry and asked me not to go then I would obey\u201d.\n\nWike said he would not step down for any consensus candidate, saying consensus should be done with equity, fairness and justice.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur constitution in PDP section 7 subsection 3 recommended rotations and elections. If the consensus they want to do is to gang up against one or two persons, why will I join such consensus?\n\n\u201cThese people talking about consensus, are their hands clean? Their hands are not clean. It is the more you look, the less you see. Those running elections are the ones that should be talking consensus, not the party.\n\n\u201cThe presidential aspirants from the North said they wanted to do consensus among themselves. Later they wanted it to be everybody but I said no.\u201d\n\nWike insisted that he had more experience in governance and better capacity to fly the PDP flag than former President Atiku Abubakar and other PDP aspirants.\n\nOn why he didn\u2019t visit the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, when he went to Edo to woo delegates, Wike said: \u201cNobody will force me to visit anybody. Is there any law that says if I go to a place I must visit somebody?\u201d\n\nHe said the work he did for Obaseki\u2019s reelection was for the PDP to enable the party win the election insisting that he didn\u2019t do it for Obaseki.\n\n\u201cWhat am I dragging with him? Are we boyfriends and girlfriends? He is the governor of Edo while I am the governor of Rivers. I went there to look for delegates and nobody should tell me how to look for delegates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know while people will be worried that I went to look for delegates without passing through the governor. It is not a law,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Lawrence Enyoghasu\n\nAjegunle, a community on the outskirts of Lagos was thrown into mourning in the early hours of yesterday when a tanker carrying 45,000 litres of premium motor spirit (PMS) fell along the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway.\n\nIt was gathered that when it fell close to the buffer zone, the content flowed into the drainage towards the boundary of the Lagos and Ogun states. Baba Tukur, a gateman with Modus Motors, and an eyewitness told Saturday Sun: \u201cThe fuel was smelling. I was watching to make sure that people don\u2019t come outside or use fire. I was with lighter but I threw it away. When I saw that some people where flashing torch from far away. I was trying to get close to them when I heard a loud sound from behind me. But the fire came from front. I was confused. I stood to think. But that was when I got caught in the fire,\u201d\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nTukur who had bandages on his hand and patches on his face including his mouth, had a stick of lit cigarette which he struggled to inhale, revealed that six of his friends are currently in the hospital taking treatment. \u201cThey were not as lucky as I am because they were sleeping and I was awake. I didn\u2019t bother to wake them up because the content was pouring inside gutter and I thought it was safe then.\u201d\n\nMr. Ibrahim Farinloye, Zonal Coordinator, South-West, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) confirmed the story adding that one person, Oluwatobi Lawal, was killed in the fire incident.\n\nHe said while giving an update: \u201cThe incident started at about 2:06 this morning, around Ajegunle Bus Stop. The spilt content continued to flow down up to Toll Gate. Lagos State Fire Service handled it from the Lagos end while Ogun State Fire Service did from their own end. Unfortunately, a male adult casualty was recovered. The buffer zone between the road and residential houses saved the residential houses from being affected. The teenager affected was preparing to write JAMB/UTME and WAEC exams next month.\n\n\u201cAbout 42 makeshift shops were consumed in the inferno, However, some of the injured victims were taken to a nearby hospital, and Ota General Hospital, while the corpse had been deposited at Ifo General Hospital in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nMohamadu Sodiq, a middle age shop owner, recounted his order. According to him, he was sleeping inside the shop when the fire started. His shop was partially burnt. The colour of the container shop was red but the heavy smoke coming from the fire turned it into black. He spoke as sympathizers continued to mill around him around him and Tukur. You could see that they were sad that they were injured but glad that they came out of it alive.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nPointing to Tukur, he said: \u201cIt was Baba that came to wake me up with injuries all over his body. He smelt like meat. I even asked if he wanted to eat fasting food at this time of the day. Baba saved most of us. Right now, I have lost all I have.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nBut when compared with Emmanuel Michael, a phone merchant and repairer who lost all his wares to the inferno, Sodiq is probably better off. According to him, he had about 15 laptops for sale and uncountable phones.\n\nHe shared the sad story of his losses with Saturday Sun: \u201cI had just taken delivery of 12 I-Phones and the lowest of them was I-Phone X. Where should I start?\u201d, he asked agitatedly. \u201cWhen I heard that the fire was at Sango, I didn\u2019t know that it would get to us. It is a sad thing,\u201d he stated. Asked to estimate his loss, he claimed that his goods are worth about N30m.\n\nAnother person who lost all was Miracle Aleriwa, a disc jockey. He was surrounded by most of the youths in the area. But a little drama took place when the distraught youth sighted a car passing on the other side of the lane. They quickly rushed at the car which was having on it a flag of the running party, armed with sand and burnt materials. Sensing danger, the driver quickly sped away.\n\nAleriwa told his heart-rending story thus: \u201cI have about N45m worth of equipment. Ordinary hand-beat is about N2m not to talk about mixer and others. I have about six controllers and speakers each.\u201d Another victim, Sunday, said to be a moneylender was seen being revived by some sympathizers. But he could hardly bring himself to stand up. Narrating Sunday\u2019s ordeal, Adura said that his shop was completely razed.\n\nHe also narrated how Lawal, a teenager, was killed. \u201cHe was selling wares for his mother till around 12am before he begged to have some sleep. It was not long after he went to sleep that the fire started. His mother woke him up to help her pack her wares but the boy, still struggling with sleep, jumped into the fire.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of Ojokoro Local Community Development Area, Hammed Idowu Tijani, who visited the scene, promised to bring succour to the victims. The second phase of the fire was said to have started when the emergency team tried to lift the detached trunk with its content pouring out. It was while people rushed to scoop its content that something ignited the volatile fuel and the truck got razed for the second time.\n\nDifferent and contradictory accounts exist as to the cause of the first and second phases of the fire outbreak. While Aleriwa claimed that the network station at Sango-Ota sparked the fire, Adura said it was a woman who had innocently woken up to start preparing her fasting breakfast that started the fire.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nAhead of political parties\u2019 primaries for the 2023 general elections, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has disclosed that it would next week commence screening for a consensus aspirant to be supported for the Presidency from the South East.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the body, Chief Alex Ogbonnia who disclosed this a chat with Saturday Sun, said the apex Igbo socio-cultural body had delayed action on the issue because people were still purchasing the expression of interest and nomination forms of their various parties.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nOgbonnia said Ohanaeze would not allow its sons and daughters take suicidal actions in the primaries of the political parties by fielding several aspirants.\n\nFour of the presidential aspirants from the zone on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), namely: Anyim Pius Anyim, Peter Obi, Sam Ohuabunwa, Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze, had in a surprise move in Abuja on April 9, agreed to fight as a bloc for the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nAfter their meeting, the quartet agreed to fight as a team and throw their weight behind any of them that is eventually best favoured.\n\nGiving indications on the plans and efforts of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in actualizing a President of Igbo origin next year, Ogbonnia said: \u201cBy next week we will begin to look into the issue of consensus. Having a consensus will not be a problem because the people we are going to screen are all Igbo sons and daughters, so we already know them. We have their track records.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t allow a cocoon of three or four Igbo contesting against one person from the north in a political party because that will be suicidal.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nOhanaeze, he said, was waiting for the aspirants to conclude buying forms so that they would be able to know who the actual aspirants are and the political parties they intend to pursue their ambition.\n\n\u201cWe have not zeroed in on consensus because people are still buying forms. Just the other day we learnt that Chris Ngige and Ken Nnamani have joined the race in the APC and we are happy with that.\n\n\u201cRecall that Ohanaeze had urged more political chieftains from the South East to throw their hats into the ring for the Presidency of Nigeria because it is our turn. So, we are going to prune down the number and settle for certain qualities we are looking for,\u201d the Ohanaeze spokesman said.\n\nSpeakers at the civic reception organized by the Imo State Government for the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor, urged him (Obiozor) to, as a matter of urgency, convene a meeting of the Ime Obi Ohanaeze, so that they would give him the mandate to pronounce the position of Ndigbo on the 2023 Presidency.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe host, Governor Hope Uzodimma stated that beyond the merriments, the occasion provided opportunity for the Igbo to talk about their position in Nigeria, do a quick review and commence the process of self-rediscovery.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWhat cannot be taken away is that for too long Igbo have cried out profusely over their plight. This plight is comparable to the plight of the South-West over the annulment of the June 12 elections.\n\n\u201cFollowing that annulment, the South-West felt short-changed. They cried out for justice. While some groups did so responsibly, others resorted to violence. The instructive thing here is that at a point, the patriotic zeal in the political class in Nigeria was touched and they rose in unison to acknowledge that the Yoruba had cried enough and that it was time to wipe their tears.\n\n\u201cIt is now obvious from every indication that Ndigbo have also cried enough about their marginalization. It should also be clear to the political class that the time has come to wipe these historical tears of Ndigbo. What is more, most of the patriots who engineered the plan that made the South-West produce the presidential candidates for the two major political parties in 1999 are still alive and active in politics.\n\n\u201cThat same undying love for the country that inspired them to do what they did for the South-West in 1999, should inspire them to do the same for the South-East in 2023.\u201d\n\nNoting that Ndigbo had paid enough price in Nigeria, elder statesman, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu said the outcome of the 2023 elections as it relates to the Igbo, would determine the future of Nigeria.\n\nIn the same manner, immediate past President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo told Obiozor that \u201cWe have those who can fight this war; you\u2019re at a moment in history, exercise your mandate.\u201d\n\nOn the Nigerian question, Obiozor said that the diversity of the country has been grossly mismanaged, noting that the upcoming presidential election provides an excellent opportunity to redress any sense of exclusion or marginalization felt by people of South East zone over the years.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that I call on all political parties in the country, to zone the Presidency to the South East,\u201d he counselled.\n\nMeanwhile, regarding Ohanaeze reaching out to people from other zones, Ogbonnia said: \u201cWe have done that but that is not enough, we will continue the lobbying next week, reaching out to other regions. They have the moral burden of supporting of demand.\u201d",

This will apparently exclude the youth, women and average Nigerians who have clamoured to improve opportunities to exercise their rights to declare their interests and contest in the elections.\u201d\n\nMusa also noted that the cost of the forms have defeated the essence of the Not Too Young Act, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari on May 31, 2018.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi said only dishonest politicians can afford the high cost of nomination and expression of interest forms of both the APC and the PDP.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis administration signed the Not Too Young to Run Act to give youths a chance at participating in the political process.

Paying N50 million to N100 million is just a first step, the aspirant will still go to campaign, so we are talking about the cost of electioneering going into billions. Which honest Nigerian can get that kind of money? It shows this administration is being dishonest.\u201d\n\nPresident of Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima, said the action amounts to a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise the younger generation.\n\nHe said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a younger person who can muster the courage to buy the form for presidency at such a huge cost.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said the pegging of the presidential nomination form at such a high price could be a plot to scare away qualified Nigerians who would not be able to afford the fee.\n\n\u201cThe APC is saying that politics is not for the poor but for the rich. It also means that anybody who gets into office after such a huge nomination fee will have to recoup his money, thereby encouraging corruption in public offices. They have devalued and destroyed the naira and they still want to destroy its further,\u201d he said.\n\nExecutive Director, Centre for anti Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL), Debo Adeniran, said the high cost of the forms will discourage honest politicians from the electioneering process.\n\nHe noted that there is no way an honest hard-working Nigerian could muster such a huge amount to invest in politics, even as those who honestly have such money will not want to come out as the EFCC Act empowers the anti-graft commission to thoroughly investigate anyone suspected to be living above his means.\n\nAccording to him, the two major parties have by their action, excluded honest Nigerians from the 2023 electioneering process.\n\nAlso speaking, the Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU) described the move by the APC and PDP as outrageous and undemocratic.\n\nSpokesman of SOKAPU, Mr. Binniyat Luka told Saturday Sun that \u201cthe action of the APC has left SOKAPU in no doubt that the government in power has concluded arrangements whereby only those in the corridors of power, whose hands are dripping with the outright loot of corruption and their children and friends can take a shot at power in Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cOnly a privilege few who are most likely in power, or are making money in curious ways from government patronage, can afford to stake that kind of money and feel nothing if they don\u2019t win.\u201d",

Bala Muhammad of Bauchi state have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger state.\n\n\u201cThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.The correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday 20th April, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting; and, unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\n\u201cThe team further agreed that Sen. Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything. The proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm of the same day was aborted unilaterally by Sen. Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Thursday, 21st, 2022, same Sen Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday, Gov. Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working. This is the reason Gov. Tambuwal was absent at today\u2019s (Friday) meeting in Minna. As a result therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Gov. Tambuwal, who had earlier on informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not consensus candidates.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Gov Tambuwal has submitted his Presidential nomination forms and now that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four has clearly collapsed, will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cThis is in consonance with his acclaimed outlook as a pan-Nigerian candidate, with pedigree of national service as the Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, life member of the Body of Benchers and now in his second and final term as Governor of Sokoto state.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Fears situation may linger except citizens offer information*Orders release of kidnapped Kaduna train passengers\n\n*IG justifies police presence in South-east, says attacks on officers no longer tolerated\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIn a clear indictment, a disappointed President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, told the security agencies that they were not doing enough to end the security challenges in the country, despite enormous logistics provided by his administration.\n\nBuhari frowned on the fact that his previous directives to the military to end insecurity in the country had not yielded much results.\n\nHe directed all the operational and intelligence agencies to rescue unhurt, all persons kidnapped by terrorists, including those in the recent Kaduna-bound train.\n\nThat was as the the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, explained the basis for heavy security presence in the South-east, saying the police would no longer tolerate attacks on their men.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), expressed the president\u2019s reservation while speaking with newsmen yesterday after a three-and-a-half hour meeting of the National Security Council at the State House, Abuja, presided by Buhari.\n\nMonguno said there was no way the president would be happy, when people were being killed on a daily basis. He said the last straw was the recent attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, which led to the death of some passengers, with scores kidnapped.\n\nThe NSA added that the president was of the belief that enough was not being done by the security agencies, despite the logistics being provided.\n\nMonguno stated, \u201cWe\u2019ve just concluded a sitting of the National Security Council, a three-and-a-half hour meeting, which was presided over by the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. This meeting is the first for 2022 and the meeting deliberated on several issues, at the strategic and operational levels, as well as other issues that are broader.\n\n\u201cIn his opening remarks, he (Buhari) spoke about his sadness in respect of the recent developments in the country, the recent security challenges we\u2019ve had, in particular, the incident in which several Nigerians lost their lives and many more have been taken into captivity by criminals and bandits.\n\n\u201cIf ten times something happens, ten times (we) will be unhappy and as the leader of this country, the father of the nation, he has to express his displeasure. You know, he is just at the managerial level, he gives us instructions.\n\n\u201cAnd his displeasure is probably, because he feels enough is not being done. So, we can\u2019t put this thing on his shoulders completely. He\u2019s at the strategic level, he takes the decisions. But when these things become endless, he has to express concern. And that\u2019s just what he did.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed all the operational and intelligence elements to rescue these innocent people immediately and unhurt. This is the basis, which other issues were discussed. Obviously, the Chief of Defense Staff, and the service chiefs, as well as the Inspector-General of Police, all briefed the President on the occurrences in their respective organisations.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed that the president alone could not be blamed for the insecurity in the country, saying his part is to make strategic decisions, which the NSA said he has been doing even though he said that the military has secured the nation\u2019s maritime domain.\n\nMonguno said, \u201cI submitted a memo to council and my recommendations are being looked into by the president. My recommendations are wide ranging and they touch on all aspects of security, starting with the level of security of our land borders, as well as within the country itself.\n\n\u201cIn terms of securing the nation, we\u2019ve recorded a lot of successes in the maritime domain and obviously, the problem now has shifted to our borders from outside. As a result of that, there\u2019s a need for us to configure how we\u2019re going to make our borders more secure because of the threats coming from outside the borders.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the surrendering of Boko Haram elements, especially in the North-east, had not engendered the desired result in stemming insurgency in the country, as the threat had shifted to the Northwest and North Central.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow, the issue in the North-east, there\u2019s been a lot of improvement and that has been attested to by the governor of Borno State during our last National Council of State meeting. But, nevertheless, the fact that the North-east is becoming much more stable, more and more people from the terrorists have started surrendering to government, has not really brought to an end the way we would want the situation in the country, because the threat is now shifted from the North-east, to the North-west and to the North-central, and this threat has to be contained.\n\n\u201cIt has to be contained collectively by both the armed forces as well as the constabulary forces: the Nigeria Police, Civil Defense, but the intelligence agencies also have been directed to enhance the acquisition of intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed the imperative of intelligence from ordinary citizens as he noted that unless the wider society was willing to provide the necessary intelligence, the problem of insecurity would linger beyond the time frame intended to end menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe present situation in the country calls for collective effort by all, not just those that have been charged with the responsibility of physically securing the country, the most important thing for now is acquisition of intelligence and the type of intelligence that is needed is human intelligence and I need to make it very clear.\n\n\u201cI have to be very honest; unless the wider society, right down to the local governments, are willing to give the type of information that is needed to block the activities of these criminals, this situation will continue to linger beyond whatever timeframe we\u2019re looking at, towards ending this great problem.\n\n\u201cA lot of lives are being lost, the president is not happy about this situation, he\u2019s made it very clear. The first assignment he\u2019s given to the security agencies, especially, the armed forces and the police is to rescue those that are in captivity, not just those that were captured during the last train incident, but those that have been in captivity in other parts of the country. That is the first thing that has to be done.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, my memo dwells on the prevailing situation within the security outfits; their needs, their challenges and the President has decided to look into these things and might as well call for another meeting in the near future.\u201d\n\nOn why the country had not deplored technology to tackle the menace of terrorism and banditry, Monguno said effort was being made to deploy technology to tackle insecurity but submitted that the required technology was expensive and would take time to acquire.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe first question has to do with, why is it so difficult to deploy technology. One, technology is expensive. Technology takes time to acquire these things, since inherently we do not produce these very, very delicate equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the government is not making any effort to acquire but we need to know who to acquire this technology from, where, when and there are certain processes. For now, I know we have, but the plight is that they are inadequate, so, to the government, it\u2019s a continuous process. That\u2019s what I can say about the issue of deploying technology.\u201d\n\nOn alleged sabotage within the military in the fight against terrorism, Monguno said the possibility of having rogue elements could not be ruled out.\n\nAsked whether he would draw a correlation between the threats from the border and the level of insecurity in the country and whether there was any suggestion that foreigners might have been responsible for the insecurity in the country, he said, \u201cObviously, we have very extensive borders, and I\u2019m not going to deceive anyone.\n\n\u201cAll of us know that we have problems of infiltration by virtue of the fact that we have a very large economy. It attracts a lot of people from outside and they come in illegally, not just through the land borders, but also through the maritime waters.\n\n\u201cOf course, in the case of the maritime borders, most of things have been done in the last one year, to secure the maritime domain up to the point that the International Maritime Bureau has acknowledged the fact that in 27 years, our maritime borders have not been as secure and peaceful as they were in the last one year.\n\n\u201cThat is a fact; it\u2019s not a conjecture. I didn\u2019t cook up this thing. So, we want to see how we can replicate that type of efforts to put in the maritime domain on our land borders. That is something that counsel is looking into.\u201d\n\nThe IGP addressed the question of massive police presence in South-east. Baba said, \u201cI think the question is about deployment. Deployment is being determined by a lot of issues or yardsticks.\n\n\u201cJust like two states may have different number of local governments, so also there can be different number of formations in that state or in that formation. We have formations, we have commands, we have zonal commands and so forth. So, deployment should not be based on either size or number of persons or threat assessment tool in that place.\n\n\u201cIt is all about how you police a particular place based on the number of people you have, based also on your ability to gather that manpower. If your command, for instance, Kaduna command has, let\u2019s say 3000 personnel.

          "text": "\n\n*Says ruling party can\u2019t afford to joke around *Osinbajo popular enough to pool donations to raise N100m, supporters insist *Ebri: prohibitive cost vitiate very principles upon which party rose to power *Ayu tackles APC over outrageous nomination forms Ozekhome: Buhari, APC corrupting democracy\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nFollowing public outrage over the high cost of nomination forms for aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC), the ruling party yesterday explained that the fee was pegged at the rate needed to lock out unserious contenders.\n\nAPC\u2019s defence of the price of its nominations forms, which was announced Wednesday, came as Chairman of The Progressive Project (TPP) and senator for Kano South, Senator Kabiru Gaya, expressed confidence in Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s candidacy. Gaya said, unlike the moneybags, Osinbajo\u2019s popularity would facilitate the pooling of his supporters\u2019 token donations to raise the N100 million nomination fee for his presidential bid.\n\nHowever, National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, and former Governor of Cross River State, Chief Clement Ebri, condemned the high nomination cost for elective offices announced by APC.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, also criticised APC for \u201ccorrupting democracy\u201d with the high nomination fee, saying the N100 million fixed for its presidential nomination form \u201crightly sent shock waves of righteous indignation across the country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indications emerged yesterday that President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, was under intense pressure from a section of the northern elite to run for president in 2023.\n\nThe ruling party had during its 11th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Abuja pegged its presidential nomination form at N100 million, governorship at N50 million, Senate at N20 million, House of Representatives at N10 million, and House of Assembly at N2 million.\n\nAPC National Women Leader, Beta Edu, featuring on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Arise News Channel, yesterday, said the high rate of the ruling party\u2019s nomination forms was to curtail the activities of persons with jokey ambitions. Edu said the APC National Working Committee (NWC) had consciously fixed the rate as part of a mechanism to ensure only serious aspirants were on the ballot.\n\nShe said the ruling party could not afford to waste time, especially considering the fact that it was working in line with the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nEdu stated, \u201cEverywhere around the world, running for elections has never been cheap and the party must be able to have means to guard several other issues that may arise. You find people who are not interested in running for elections just standing up, picking up forms and just waiting to constitute a kind of barrier or put a stud in the entire process as it goes on.\n\n\u201cThese are not things that we want to see as a party. We are the ruling party, the largest party in Africa, a party where if you pick their nomination form and you are the candidate, the probability of you becoming the elected person for that position is almost hundred per cent.\n\n\u201cSo, we cannot afford to dabble or joke around or gamble around. We want only serious people who are interested in running and representing different persons to run.\u201d\n\nEdu claimed the cost of forms for House of Assembly was fair.\n\nShe stated, \u201cFor all we care, N1.5 million for a House of Assembly nomination form is fair to the general population. It\u2019s very fair and for women it\u2019s free, for the disabled, it is free; for young people, it is 40 per cent off, that\u2019s really very fair.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, going for the other positions, we know what it was before and what it is now and we are trying to prevent certain persons who sometimes are not the members of the party. They just get their way in or they\u2019re being used as syndicate to pick up forms at the beginning to constitute a kind of stud in the way of the whole electoral process and they pull the party backwards.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain her definition of fairness with regard to the ruling party\u2019s high nomination fee in a country where over 98 per cent of the population did not have N500, 000 in their bank accounts, the APC women leader stated that running for elective office was not an all-comers affair.\n\nEdu said, \u201cLet me say this and very clearly, coming to run for a governorship election is not an all-comers affair. Governorship election is serious business, for you to run through all the local governments, consult people, reach out to people and, indeed, be able to campaign through the local governments requires some good amount of resources. And when you make up your mind that you want to run, you should be able to prepare adequately for that race.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, there are many ways for young people to generate funding for elections. It must not be your money and they are not paying the same amount others are paying.\u201d\n\nOn rising disunity within the party, Edu said as part of the reconciliation committee, headed by Senator Abdullahi Adamu, she believed his view that most of the crises in the states were fuelled by ego clash between serving and former governors.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe went through all the states in Nigeria and we understood the issues and concerns about unity or some disagreements among members of the party and, of course, like the chairman clearly stated yesterday (Wednesday), if we work together, we can to overcome it soon.\u201d\n\nShe said, as the party moved closer to the elections, more aggrieved members would be reconciled.\n\nOsinbajo Popular Enough to Pool Donations to Raise N100m, Supporters Insist\n\n\n\nGaya said Osinbajo was popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations to raise the N100 million nomination fee with ease.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, Gaya said consultations by members of various support groups, eminent political leaders, and citizens, too numerous to mention, culminated in his decision to lead the Osinbajo supporters\u2019 group.\n\nHe noted that for the vice president, the race was not about personal ambition, but a positive response to a popular call from a citizen-driven mobilisation that began without input from him or his office. The lawmaker stressed that people from other parties and even millions of non-partisan citizens, who did not belong to any political party, had strong interest and involvement with the campaign for Osinbajo\u2019s candidature.\n\nGaya stressed that his specific assignment here was to lead a process of recalibration of all pro-Osinbajo forces towards electoral victory on the platform of APC. He said without doubt, all knowledgeable people in the country could attest to the qualities and competence of Osinbajo.\n\nGaya noted that his chosen method redefined presidential declarations in Nigeria, adding that the vice president clearly signalled that noble citizens had no need to descend into gutters. No touts were hired by anyone and his message effectively reverberated across the entire country and the Diaspora, he stated.\n\nAccording to Gaya, \u201cEven an internal issue of the price of our party\u2019s nomination form is being deliberately misinterpreted in some circles, when we feel confident that, unlike moneybags, our truly populist candidate is popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations and raise such money with ease.\n\n\u201cJust one youth group with TPP, the Progressive Group alone, says that they can raise N100 million with rough voluntary contributions of N10, 000 each by 10, 000 of their supporters, who are keen about seeing a better future.\n\n\u201cOur populist mathematics is flawless and very strong; moneybags within or outside APC will only lose their dollars in any contest against the people\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Gaya said, unlike other political parties, records show that neither the APC presidential ticket nor its vice president\u2019s slot had ever been won by throwing money around, but by populist endorsements from the north and south.\n\nHe said the TPP noted the fear of the people\u2019s genuine power had made some elements to resort to heightened propaganda in the past few days.\n\nGaya added, \u201cWe will not descend low to play gutter politics and we have continued to warn our supporters against involvement in insults and vilification. We are democrats, we believe in uniting people and in submitting ourselves and competing ideas to the people\u2019s evaluation and decisions through the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe APC chieftain emphasised that the popular forces behind Osinbajo feared no foe and hated no one, saying they are focused without compromise on the unity, progress and development of Nigeria and would not descend into gutter fights with any person or group.\n\nLawan Under Pressure to Join Presidential Race\n\n\n\nIndications emerged yesterday that the senate president was under intense pressure to contest for president in 2023. The ruling party released the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 elections, but maintained sealed lips on the issue of zoning.\n\nAlthough, following the emergence of Adamu as National Chairman of the party at the March 26 convention, observers believed it was an indication that the ruling party would zone its presidency to the south.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, had said that the party was yet to take any decision on the zoning of the presidency to the south.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that some elements within the northern elite were mounting pressure on Lawan to join the presidential race.\n\nThe source said, \u201cYes, he is under intense pressure to run for president. Some northern leaders are making the moves, asking him to run. It\u2019s so serious. But it is not certain yet. It\u2019s an option he\u2019s still considering.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, two businessmen from Igbere, Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, have promised to obtain presidential nomination forms for Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Kalu, and Lawan. The businessmen disclosed this in a statement issued yesterday and signed by Mr. Ukaegbu James and Mr. Nnanna Kalu.\n\nThey said they were convinced that with their track record, managerial skills, experience, and leadership acumen, both Kalu and Lawan had the competence to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari to drive the economy. James and Kalu were of the opinion that APC needed a unifier with deep knowledge of the country\u2019s multi-ethnic, lingual and religious settings.\n\nAyu Tackles APC over Outrageous Nomination Fee, Extends Sale, Submission of Forms to Accommodate Defectors\n\n\n\nPDP extended the sale of its nominations forms to Friday, to accommodate some APC defectors, like Senator Babba Kaita and his supporters. This was to enable them purchase any form of their choice for the 2023 general election.\n\nCommenting on the high price of the APC nomination forms, Ayu, in a statement by his media aide, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said, \u201cNigerians can all see what the APC is: a fragmented alliance put together to capture power and inflict maximum pain on Nigerians, including their own members.\u201d\n\nAyu urged Nigerians to recall how in 2014, President Muhammadu Buhari and leader of APC had told Nigerians then that he borrowed N27 million to buy his nomination form.\n\n\u201cThe same man, as leader of his party, has now sanctioned the sale of the same forms at N100 million! I am told that\u2019s an increase of 370 per cent,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nHe added, \u201cBut in 2014, the PDP was in power and the economy was still booming. The incompetent APC presidency has now run the economy aground, making Nigeria the \u2018Poverty Capital of the World.\u2019\n\n\u201cHow then can impoverished APC aspirants buy nominations at such prohibitively high costs? And yet, only recently he preached \u2018Equal Opportunity\u2019 to them.\u201d\n\nThe national chairman of PDP said, \u201cBy this latest insensitive action, the APC has disenfranchised thousands of her youths, and dashed the hopes of millions of Nigerian youths who applauded President Buhari when he signed the Not Too Young To Run Bill into law in 2018. It is most insensitive, and mind-boggling. In fact, all those buying the N100 million and N50 million nomination forms should be investigated for fraud.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed, \u201cWe, the PDP, are different. We are a mass movement for the Nigerian people. This is why our nomination fees are soft and democratic. When you compare us with the APC, the difference is clear. This is why we must return to power to save Nigerians from this insensitive government.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a former governor of Cross River State, Clement Ebri, condemned the high cost of forms for Expression of Interest and nomination for elective offices announced by the ruling party. Ebri said it vitiated the principles upon which APC campaigned and was voted into power.\n\nHe called on the NWC of the party to rethink the party\u2019s position on the matter.\n\nEbri, in a statement issued yesterday, said some people might have argued that the reason for the exorbitant cost of nomination forms was simply to prune the number of contenders, or to delineate the pretenders from the contenders, saying, \u201cThen I think that argument is flawed.\u201d\n\nThe former governor said true party men and women should be concerned that the party, which was founded on the values and ideals of progressive philosophy, would make pre-qualification for elective offices \u2013 at state and national level \u2013 the exclusive preserve of party members with either great personal wealth or that have unlimited access to other sources of funding.\n\nEbri added, \u201cWith reference to the recent announcement by the APC concerning the cost of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for various elective positions, the APC owes it to itself and the teeming numbers of Nigerians who voted it into power for two consecutive terms, to remain a party of true progressives and a true party of progressives.\n\n\u201cThe current party position on the cost of forms for Expression of Interest and Nomination for elective offices appears to vitiate the very principles upon which the party campaigned and was voted into power.\n\n\u201cThe danger this poses to the party is that many prospective and otherwise eminently qualified office seekers that do not possess enormous personal wealth will in every practical sense, be precluded from seeking party nomination, regardless of the depth and breadth of their popular support.\u201d\n\nEbri said there were ample objective and progressive criteria, such as integrity, experience, character, political antecedents, empathy, intelligence, goodwill, etc, which could be employed to enable the emergence of genuinely qualified candidates.\n\nHe said it was a known fact that personal wealth was not the yardstick of assessment that enabled Buhari to emerge as standard-bearer of the party in 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe party chieftain noted that a comparative analysis of the cost of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms in APC and that of the main opposition PDP showed that a member of APC with governorship aspiration would not only be spending more than twice what his/her counterparts in the opposition are, but would also be spending more to vie for governorship office than the opposition candidates vying for the office of president.\n\nEbri stressed that as laudable as the concession of 50 per cent reduction for youths might seem, it was worthy of note that the youth in the APC that were vying for governorship would still be paying more than their opposition counterparts.\n\nHe added that youths vying for the presidential ticket would be paying more than what the opposition presidential aspirants were paying for nomination. The party chieftain wondered if APC had inadvertently been made a party of the wealthy by the wealthy for the wealthy.\n\nMeanwhile, in an apparent move to accommodate defectors from APC, PDP extended the sale and submission of its nomination forms for the 2023 general election.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said, \u201cAfter a thorough consideration of various issues and concerns in the party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has further adjusted its Timetable and Schedule of Activities to extend the closing dates for the purchase of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for the 2023 general elections to Friday, April 22, 2022.\n\n\u201cUnder the reviewed timetable, the last day for the submission of already completed Forms has been extended to Monday, April 25, 2022\n\n\u201cConsequently, the following new dates have been fixed for the screening as well as Appeals arising from the screening of aspirants for various positions:\n\n\u201cState House of Assembly and National Assembly: Wednesday, April 27, 2022; Governorship: Thursday, April 28, 2022; Presidential: Friday, April 29, 2022. Appeals on all screening exercised: Monday, May 2, 2022.\n\n\u201cUnder the updated timetable, the three-man Ad Hoc Ward Congress has been fixed for Saturday, April 30, 2022 while the Local Government Area National Delegates Congresses will now hold on Thursday, May 5, 2022.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cAll dates for primary election into various positions remain the same. Please, note that all duly completed State Assembly Forms are to be submitted at the various states secretariat of the party.\n\n\u201cAll aspirants, critical stakeholders and party members should be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nOzekhome: Buhari, APC Corrupting Democracy\n\n\n\nOzekhome accused the president and the ruling party of debasing democracy in a statement yesterday titled, \u201cPresident Buhari and the APC are corrupting democracy.\u201d\n\nThe statement was in response to Wednesday\u2019s announcement by the ruling party fixing various high fees for its nomination forms, which had outraged many Nigerians.\n\nOzekhome stated, \u201cThe staggering sum of N100 million fixed by the APC NEC for its presidential nomination form has rightly sent shock waves of righteous indignation across the country. The APC had fixed N30 million for the \u2018expression of interest form\u2019 and N70 million for the \u2018nomination form\u2019, making a total of N100 million.\n\n\u201cThe party hopes to rake in N1.5 billion from the 15 aspirants that have so far declared interest in the presidential race. By this singular act, the APC has shown a shocking insatiable bacchanalian propensity to corrupt democracy, democratic ethos, and also scam the entire country.\n\n\u201cThe vulgarity of this exercise lies not just in the abominable fee prescribed, but more in the party\u2019s pretentious mantra of fighting corruption, using a well orchestrated and carefully oiled Hitler\u2019s Goebel\u2019s propagandist machinery of dubious pedigree. It is the more abhorrent when we realise that this is miles apart from (indeed more than double) the price fixed by the party\u2019s whipping child, the opposition PDP, which has fixed its at N40million (N5 million) for the expression of interest; and N35 million for the nomination form. The N100m is also over 100 per cent of the N40 million fixed by the same APC for the 2018, presidential nomination form.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammed Buhari and the APC have, by this singular act, exhibited a very odious and unpleasant example of how not to fight corruption. They have managed to convince Nigerians that politics is, indeed, the art of grand deception, double-dealing, duplicity, beguilement, sham and self-contradiction. They have justified the clich\u00e9 that diplomacy is the clever art of telling a person to go to hell in such a way that he actually eagerly looks forward to the journey.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Says it\u2019s determined next national polls must hold *Declares timetable, schedule of activities fixed\n\n*Advises parties to plan properly, insists PVC doesn\u2019t expire *NSA: We\u2019ll protect electoral body, Nigerians during voting\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, said it would require about one million electoral officials \u2013 a combination of permanent, temporary and ad hoc staff \u2013 to be deployed to man the 176,846 polling units in 8,809 wards and 774 local government areas across the country, for the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC, which claimed it was determined to make sure the 2023 elections hold, however, said the dates for all activities in the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 polls were already fixed, and therefore advised all stakeholders, particularly the political parties, to take that fact into consideration in planning their activities.\n\nSpeaking at the presentation of INEC 2022 to 2026 strategic Plan and 2023 Election Project Plan, National Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, also reiterated that claims doing the rounds that the Permanent Voter\u2019s Card could expire was misleading, because there was no such thing.\n\nAt the same time, the National Security Adviser, Major-General Babagana Munguno, has assured INEC and Nigerians in general of adequate protections during the elections.\n\nWhile explaining that double registration by any voter remained an electoral offence, Yakubu said, \u201cAs you may be aware, the election will be conducted for 1,491 constituencies nationwide, made up of one presidential constituency, 109 senatorial districts, 360 federal constituencies, 28 governorship elections and 993 state constituencies.\n\n\u201cThe election will involve an estimated one million electoral officials (both permanent and temporary or ad hoc staff) deployed to 176,846 polling units in 8,809 Wards and 774 Local Government Areas across the country.\n\n\u201cThe election will be governed by a new Electoral Act 2022, which contains many progressive provisions that, will enhance the capacity of the Commission to conduct elections and manage the electoral process better,\u201d he explained.\n\nTo this end, the INEC chairman said, \u201cLet\u2019s once again reiterate that the dates for all activities in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election are firm and fixed and all stakeholders are advised to take this into consideration in planning their activities.\u201d\n\nHe said the ongoing Continuous Voter registration (CVR) exercise would end on June 30, 2022, while all eligible voters that were yet to register should do so on or before that date if they intended to vote.\n\nStressing that the PVCs of validly registered voters from the first and second quarters were ready and available for collection at designated centres nationwide, Yakubu said, \u201cI would like to appeal to all Nigerians, who registered between June and December 2021 to collect their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) in person as no PVCs will be collected by proxy.\n\n\u201cLet me also reassure those who registered between January and March 2022 as well as those who are doing so until the end of the exercise that their PVCs will be ready for collection long before the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, the Commission once again reiterates that PVCs have no expiry dates. We want to assure all registered voters that PVCs issued by the Commission remain valid for all elections.\n\n\u201cWe have encouraged those whose lost their voters cards or whose cards are damaged to approach any of the registration centres to apply for replacement. Similarly, voters who had issues with their accreditation in previous elections have been encouraged to revalidate and update their information.\n\n\u201cIn addition, those who wish to transfer their registration from one location to another within a particular state or to relocate entirely to another state of the federation can do so at any of the registration centres nationwide. These steps are in compliance with the law in order to serve Nigerians better.\n\n\u201cThe claim that PVCs expire is misleading. Citizens are, therefore, advised not to register more than once as multiple registration is an offence under the Electoral Act. Anyone engaged in the act of double or multiple registration is liable to prosecution. No citizen should engage in it or encourage others to violate the law,\u201d the INEC chairman warned.\n\nAccording to him, INEC relied on three key elements to reach its strategic plan for the 2022 and 2026 Election Project, adding that, \u201cFirst is the knowledge and experience gathered from the conduct of previous elections. Second is the use of innovations to enhance electoral integrity and improve voter experience. Third is the institutionalisation of the culture of planning.\n\n\u201cThese elements have guided the Commission through three successive general and several off-cycle and bye-elections. Consequently, our elections are getting better, electoral outcomes less contentious, and voter experience of the electoral system increasingly more participatory and inclusive.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the Strategic Plan 2022-2026 and the 2023 Election Project Plan, drew lessons from, and thoroughly reviewed, the level of implementation of the last plans.\n\nHis words: \u201cThey build on the successes of the preceding plans, especially, in the planning and conduct of the 2019 General Election as well as off-cycle and bye-elections. Against the backdrop of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the current security situation in the country, both plans had to prioritise the institutionalisation of the Commission\u2019s processes for the effective delivery of its mandate by focusing on capacity-building.\u201d\n\nThis, he added, included, \u201cThe promotion of professionalism, encouraging greater synergy among departments, improving efficient utilisation of resources, increased deployment of technology as well as greater sensitivity to threats to the electoral process as well as election personnel and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThese concerns, he posited were reflected in the Plan\u2019s five strategic objectives, each of which identified several key actions, key activities and key outcomes that constituted a broad guide to the vision of the Commission to provide electoral operations, systems and infrastructure to support the delivery of free, fair, credible and inclusive elections.\n\nHe noted also that, the plan further formed the basis for the Election Project Plan, which focused on five key objectives identified by the Commission as critical for the successful conduct of the 2023 General Election.\n\nThe INEC chairman, therefore, posited that, \u201cBy next week, the Commission will conclude the revision of the Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections to comply with the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\u201cWork has also commenced on the review of the manuals for the training of election duty personnel. With the planning processes virtually completed, the Commission will now focus its attention on election technology and election administration.\n\n\u201cWe have carefully listened to the demand of Nigerians for seamless processes, particularly, with regard to enhanced voter education, better distribution of voters to polling units, quality training of election personnel, functionality of electronic devices, improved logistics, prompt commencement of polls, availability of assistive devices for persons with disability at polling units and greater transparency in result management. We are also aware of the security challenges and their impact on the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage early and intensely with the security agencies to ensure the safety of our personnel and materials, accredited observers and the media and, above all, the voters. Clearly, these are challenging times but we are determined that election must hold in 2023.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is a shared responsibility. INEC plays a critical role but the Commission alone cannot deliver the elections we all desire. I, therefore, appeal to all Nigerians to joins hands with us in ensuring that we make a success of the process.\u201d\n\nIn his comments, Sanusi Galadima, who represented the NSA, assured INEC and Nigerians of adequate protections during the general elections, even as he commended the commission for deepening democracy in Nigeria through technology.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the Inter Party advisory Council, Sani Yagbaji, called on the judiciary to avoid a situation, where it would render ridiculous judgements as was the case in the Imo State governorship election, where the Supreme Court judgement did not reflect the decision of voters on ground.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Mohammed Bello Koko, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) bought a house worth \u00a31,750,000 in the United Kingdom in 2015, a document seen by SaharaReporters has revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Kebbi state-born banker was the Zenith Bank accounts officer to Rivers state government when Rotimi Amaechi was governor.\n\nMohammed Bello Koko\n\nHe had worked in the banking circles in Rivers for a long time, rising to become deputy regional manager at Zenith Bank Plc.\n\nIn 2016, the 53-year-old Bello-Koko was appointed executive Director of NPA after he proceeded on a leave of absence from the bank in 2015.\n\nHe was in charge of finance and admin under the sacked MD, Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nThe document seen by SaharaReporters showed that the mansion located at 2A Beech Hill, Barnet, Greater London, EN4 0JP was bought by Bello-Koko on November 06, 2015, at \u00a31,750,000.\n\nThe 7-bedroom freehold detached house is currently ranked as the 11th most expensive property in EN4 0JP, with a valuation of \u00a32,274,000.\n\n\u201cSince it last sold in November 2015 for \u00a31,750,000, its value has increased by \u00a3524,000,\u201d an estate developer website, The Move Market said.\n\n\u201c2A Beech Hill, Barnet has 3 transactions recorded with HM Land Registry - its market value today is \u00a32,274,000.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Ports Authority\u2019s Managing Director, Koko Exposed By Anti-graft Agency, EFCC For Receiving N829million As Kickbacks, Engaging In Money Laundering\n\n\u201cThe current owner bought the property in November 2015 for \u00a31,750,000 and has lived here for 5 years.

The property turned out to be a really good investment for the previous owner.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: How Nigerian Ports Authority Managing Director, Koko Bought \u00a31.75Million Mansion In London While \u2018S... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nAnti-corruption Group Speaks\n\nMeanwhile, an anti-corruption group, 'Say No To Corruption In Nigeria' has asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to extend its searchlight on Bello-Koko and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no more a secret that Bello-Koko was Amaechi\u2019s account officer for years. He has been a crony for Amaechi\u2019s corrupt practices,\u201d the coordinator of the group, Ahmed Abubakar said.\n\n\u201cHow will it be that in 2015, Bello-Koko acquired a property worth \u00a31,750,000 in the United Kingdom, a few months after Amaechi left office as governor and him being his account officer?\n\n\u201cHis last position in Zenith Bank before he went on leave was deputy regional manager, how was he able to afford a house of that amount in 2015? These are questions begging for answers.\n\n\u201cThis man was in charge of finance and admin under Bala-Usman in NPA then. Under normal circumstances, he should be the primary target for the probe that sacked the woman. After all, the allegations investigated fell directly under his department.\u201d\n\nAbubakar added, \u201cAs Nigerians prepare for the elections, it is critical that the world pays significant attention to the ongoing campaigns to determine who becomes the President of Nigeria come May 2023. While many candidates appear to have the right pedigree to be seeking this exalted office, Rotimi Amaechi stands out as too decidedly corrupt and morally bankrupt to be doing so.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmaechi served as Speaker of Rivers State (an oil-rich state in Southern Nigeria) for 8 years and went on to serve as governor of the state for another 8 years. For the past 7 years, he has been Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Transportation.\n\n\u201cDuring these 23 years, Amaechi has become a master of awarding dubious contracts to phoney companies, for non-existent jobs, often to political cronies, who it appears, served as his own purses for the proceeds of these contracts.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmaechi\u2019s pattern of corruption reared its head recently in the wake of the unfortunate attack on a train travelling between Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city, and Kaduna, a critical metropolis in the Northwest of the country. During his inspection of the damage, he blamed the current government, of which he is a member of the Executive, for moving too slowly to award the contract he had pushed for securing the rail lines.\n\n\u201cThe very next day, minutes from that Executive Council Meeting were released to show that Mr. Amaechi had intended to award the contract worth N3.7 billion (about $8.5 million) to a company that was registered only two years ago with no prior record of security jobs, and a turnover of less than $190,000. It is on the basis of these questionable details that the proposal was denied.\n\n\n\n\u201cSad as this episode might be for Nigerians given the loss of lives on that train attack and the continuing hostage of many of the passengers on that train, this pattern of fictitious contracting is one that Mr. Amaechi appears to have unfortunately mastered to perfection. And it is one that Nigerians should be aware of and as such, not reward him with the highest office in their country.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring his term as governor of Rivers State, Amaechi routinely broke his own procurement laws and awarded contracts involving large sums of money to many questionable causes and invisible services. Using several personal and corporate proxies, hundreds of billions of Rivers State taxpayers' monies were simply siphoned off the state\u2019s coffers by his cronies.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, Amaechi\u2019s government awarded a contract and paid a company named Magnum and Hunter Limited received several hundreds of millions from the Rivers State Sport Ministry Account Number 0006786960 in a leading Nigerian Bank. Yet, a search of this company in Nigeria\u2019s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) suggests the company is not registered and has no track record upon which that contract should have been awarded.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, a few weeks after Lemaco Engineering Limited was registered in Port-Harcourt, the State capital, the government awarded it a lucrative contract for which it received almost N850 million from the Rivers State Sports Ministry\u2019s account in the same bank. A search on CAC\u2019s website indicates the current status of this company is now unknown. Unsurprisingly, and in line with Amaechi\u2019s modus operandi, Lemaco Engineering Limited was floated by his close confidant, Victor Giadom, who for several years served as a critical cabinet member in Amaechi\u2019s government.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany other contracts were awarded like Lemaco\u2019s in which the companies are formed hurriedly by apparent cronies, they receive a huge contract, monies are paid upfront, with no discernible goods supplied, services rendered or benefits received for the citizens of the State. Such companies and deals include ones given to Opriala Integrated Services which received N103 million, Faribo Nigeria Limited which got over N920 million, Klear Image Limited, which received N216 million, and Tawfik Engineering Limited which received N143 million from the River State Ministry of Works.\n\n\u201cA search of these companies in CAC\u2019s database indicates they do not exist and may have been Special Purpose Vehicles in a grand scheme of money laundering and corruption. Another pattern of transactions that pervaded his time as Governor were basically huge sums of payments in cash to individuals. These transactions appeared fraudulent because they were not only conducted in cash but with no descriptions whatsoever for their benefits to the taxpayers Mr. Amaechi swore to serve.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, in a single day and for no recorded purpose, a senior official of the Finance Ministry named J. P. Brown made cash withdrawals of N10 million each totalling N950 million from the Rivers State Sub Treasury Pension Account Number 6010944734 in a first-rate commercial bank. At the time of this withdrawal, the main account officer of Rivers State was a gentleman named Mohammed Bello-Koko, who was later arrested and imprisoned by Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency.\n\n\u201cOnce Amaechi became a powerful Minister, he worked out his release and made Mr. Bello-Koko an Executive Director in charge of Finance at the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), an agency under Mr. Amaechi\u2019s Transportation Ministry. As a reward for continued cooperation and connivance for such corrupt deals, Mr. Amaechi recently ensured the promotion of Mr. Bello-Koko to the post of CEO of the NPA. A forthcoming essay will expose such recent deals at the NPA.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilar to the withdrawal above, Amaechi presided over many such cash withdrawals from the state\u2019s treasury by cronies and friends. In August 2012, an individual named Atu Komily received a cash payment of N110 million in tranches of N10 million each from the Deputy Governor\u2019s Overhead Account Number 5030000382 domiciled in a mid-level Nigerian bank. The same individual received N430 million in cash payments from the same bank a few weeks later. Similarly, cash payments of N230 million and N190 million were made from the same account to Kiri Okeanyi and Mabel Worika respectively.\n\n\u201cThese withdrawals were done in tranches of N10 million and N20 million each in July 2012. Also, cash payments in tranches totalling N350 million were made to an individual named Daobu Harry in September 2012 from the Rivers State Sports Ministry Account Number 5030032978 in the same mid-level Nigerian bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a brazen display of corruption, impunity and non-accountability, such transactions became the order of business throughout Mr. Amaechi\u2019s tenure as governor. Similar cash withdrawals, with no description for work done or service rendered, were made to Bright Ezebuola (N180 million), Innocent Amadi (N120 million), Abaate Godson (N110 million), Christopher Quakers (N130 million), Leyira Pyagbara (N280 million) and J.P. Brown (N1.2 billion).\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many other such transactions that were directly ordered by Mr. Amaechi and marked \u201cExecutive Governor\u2019s Office totalling over N98 billion in one bank alone that will be the subject of another essay.\n\n\u201cDespite these and many other well-documented allegations, President Buhari, who otherwise appears not to condone corruption in any guise and from anyone, continues to tolerate Mr. Amaechi, leading many to suspect he may be doing something for the President\u2019s inner circle who are protecting him.\n\n\n\n\u201cRegardless of what the President or anti-graft agencies might do with these verifiable information, it is important that Nigerian voters are aware of Mr. Amaechi\u2019s pattern of governance, which is riddled with opacity, cronyism, and corruption.\u201d\n\n\n\nPandora Papers\n\nMeanwhile, a Pandora Papers in 2021 revealed that Bello-Koko was behind two shell companies incorporated in a tax haven to anonymously invest in the United Kingdom property market.\n\nThis potentially violates Nigeria\u2019s public service code of conduct laws.\n\nPandora Papers also disclosed that he and his wife, Agatha Anne Koko, enlisted the services of financial secrecy seller, Cook Worldwide and Alem\u00e1n, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), an offshore law firm, to register Coulwood Limited (reg. number: 1487897) and Marney Limited (reg. number: 1487944) in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), one of the world\u2019s most commonly used tax havens, in 2008. Both companies were registered on the same day, June 19, 2008.\n\nThough a public servant, Bello-Koko is also a director of the two companies, in violation of Nigeria\u2019s Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act (Sections 5 and 6).\n\nPandora Papers project is led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).",

During his inspection of the damage, he blamed the current government, of which he is a member of the Executive, for moving too slowly to award the contract he had pushed for securing the rail lines.\n\n\u201cThe very next day, minutes from that Executive Council Meeting were released to show that Mr. Amaechi had intended to award the contract worth N3.7 billion (about $8.5 million) to a company that was registered only two years ago with no prior record of security jobs, and a turnover of less than $190,000. It is on the basis of these questionable details that the proposal was denied.\n\n\n\n\u201cSad as this episode might be for Nigerians given the loss of lives on that train attack and the continuing hostage of many of the passengers on that train, this pattern of fictitious contracting is one that Mr. Amaechi appears to have unfortunately mastered to perfection. And it is one that Nigerians should be aware of and as such, not reward him with the highest office in their country.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring his term as governor of Rivers State, Amaechi routinely broke his own procurement laws and awarded contracts involving large sums of money to many questionable causes and invisible services. Using several personal and corporate proxies, hundreds of billions of Rivers State taxpayers' monies were simply siphoned off the state\u2019s coffers by his cronies.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, Amaechi\u2019s government awarded a contract and paid a company named Magnum and Hunter Limited received several hundreds of millions from the Rivers State Sport Ministry Account Number 0006786960 in a leading Nigerian Bank. Yet, a search of this company in Nigeria\u2019s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) suggests the company is not registered and has no track record upon which that contract should have been awarded.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilarly, a few weeks after Lemaco Engineering Limited was registered in Port-Harcourt, the State capital, the government awarded it a lucrative contract for which it received almost N850 million from the Rivers State Sports Ministry\u2019s account in the same bank. A search on CAC\u2019s website indicates the current status of this company is now unknown. Unsurprisingly, and in line with Amaechi\u2019s modus operandi, Lemaco Engineering Limited was floated by his close confidant, Victor Giadom, who for several years served as a critical cabinet member in Amaechi\u2019s government.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany other contracts were awarded like Lemaco\u2019s in which the companies are formed hurriedly by apparent cronies, they receive a huge contract, monies are paid upfront, with no discernible goods supplied, services rendered or benefits received for the citizens of the State. Such companies and deals include ones given to Opriala Integrated Services which received N103 million, Faribo Nigeria Limited which got over N920 million, Klear Image Limited, which received N216 million, and Tawfik Engineering Limited which received N143 million from the River State Ministry of Works.\n\n\u201cA search of these companies in CAC\u2019s database indicates they do not exist and may have been Special Purpose Vehicles in a grand scheme of money laundering and corruption. Another pattern of transactions that pervaded his time as Governor were basically huge sums of payments in cash to individuals. These transactions appeared fraudulent because they were not only conducted in cash but with no descriptions whatsoever for their benefits to the taxpayers Mr. Amaechi swore to serve.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, in a single day and for no recorded purpose, a senior official of the Finance Ministry named J. P. Brown made cash withdrawals of N10 million each totalling N950 million from the Rivers State Sub Treasury Pension Account Number 6010944734 in a first-rate commercial bank. At the time of this withdrawal, the main account officer of Rivers State was a gentleman named Mohammed Bello-Koko, who was later arrested and imprisoned by Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency.\n\n\u201cOnce Amaechi became a powerful Minister, he worked out his release and made Mr. Bello-Koko an Executive Director in charge of Finance at the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), an agency under Mr. Amaechi\u2019s Transportation Ministry. As a reward for continued cooperation and connivance for such corrupt deals, Mr. Amaechi recently ensured the promotion of Mr. Bello-Koko to the post of CEO of the NPA. A forthcoming essay will expose such recent deals at the NPA.\n\n\n\n\u201cSimilar to the withdrawal above, Amaechi presided over many such cash withdrawals from the state\u2019s treasury by cronies and friends. In August 2012, an individual named Atu Komily received a cash payment of N110 million in tranches of N10 million each from the Deputy Governor\u2019s Overhead Account Number 5030000382 domiciled in a mid-level Nigerian bank. The same individual received N430 million in cash payments from the same bank a few weeks later. Similarly, cash payments of N230 million and N190 million were made from the same account to Kiri Okeanyi and Mabel Worika respectively.\n\n\u201cThese withdrawals were done in tranches of N10 million and N20 million each in July 2012. Also, cash payments in tranches totalling N350 million were made to an individual named Daobu Harry in September 2012 from the Rivers State Sports Ministry Account Number 5030032978 in the same mid-level Nigerian bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn a brazen display of corruption, impunity and non-accountability, such transactions became the order of business throughout Mr. Amaechi\u2019s tenure as governor. Similar cash withdrawals, with no description for work done or service rendered, were made to Bright Ezebuola (N180 million), Innocent Amadi (N120 million), Abaate Godson (N110 million), Christopher Quakers (N130 million), Leyira Pyagbara (N280 million) and J.P. Brown (N1.2 billion).\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are many other such transactions that were directly ordered by Mr. Amaechi and marked \u201cExecutive Governor\u2019s Office totalling over N98 billion in one bank alone that will be the subject of another essay.\n\n\u201cDespite these and many other well-documented allegations, President Buhari, who otherwise appears not to condone corruption in any guise and from anyone, continues to tolerate Mr. Amaechi, leading many to suspect he may be doing something for the President\u2019s inner circle who are protecting him.\n\n\n\n\u201cRegardless of what the President or anti-graft agencies might do with these verifiable information, it is important that Nigerian voters are aware of Mr. Amaechi\u2019s pattern of governance, which is riddled with opacity, cronyism, and corruption.\u201d\n\n\n\nPandora Papers\n\nMeanwhile, a Pandora Papers in 2021 revealed that Bello-Koko was behind two shell companies incorporated in a tax haven to anonymously invest in the United Kingdom property market.\n\nThis potentially violates Nigeria\u2019s public service code of conduct laws.\n\nPandora Papers also disclosed that he and his wife, Agatha Anne Koko, enlisted the services of financial secrecy seller, Cook Worldwide and Alem\u00e1n, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), an offshore law firm, to register Coulwood Limited (reg. number: 1487897) and Marney Limited (reg. number: 1487944) in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), one of the world\u2019s most commonly used tax havens, in 2008. Both companies were registered on the same day, June 19, 2008.\n\nThough a public servant, Bello-Koko is also a director of the two companies, in violation of Nigeria\u2019s Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act (Sections 5 and 6).\n\nPandora Papers project is led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).",

          "text": "Mohammed Bello Koko, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) bought a house worth \u00a31,750,000 in the United Kingdom in 2015, a document seen by SaharaReporters has revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Kebbi state-born banker was the Zenith Bank accounts officer to Rivers state government when Rotimi Amaechi was governor.\n\nMohammed Bello Koko\n\nHe had worked in the banking circles in Rivers for a long time, rising to become deputy regional manager at Zenith Bank Plc.\n\nIn 2016, the 53-year-old Bello-Koko was appointed executive Director of NPA after he proceeded on a leave of absence from the bank in 2015.\n\nHe was in charge of finance and admin under the sacked MD, Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nThe document seen by SaharaReporters showed that the mansion located at 2A Beech Hill, Barnet, Greater London, EN4 0JP was bought by Bello-Koko on November 06, 2015, at \u00a31,750,000.\n\nThe 7-bedroom freehold detached house is currently ranked as the 11th most expensive property in EN4 0JP, with a valuation of \u00a32,274,000.\n\n\u201cSince it last sold in November 2015 for \u00a31,750,000, its value has increased by \u00a3524,000,\u201d an estate developer website, The Move Market said.\n\n\u201c2A Beech Hill, Barnet has 3 transactions recorded with HM Land Registry - its market value today is \u00a32,274,000.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Ports Authority\u2019s Managing Director, Koko Exposed By Anti-graft Agency, EFCC For Receiving N829million As Kickbacks, Engaging In Money Laundering\n\n\u201cThe current owner bought the property in November 2015 for \u00a31,750,000 and has lived here for 5 years. Since the current owner purchased the property, its value has increased by \u00a3524,000 (29.9%).\n\n\u201cThe previous owner had the property for 4 years, having purchased it in October 2011 for \u00a31,200,000.\n\n\u201cDuring this time, the price rose by \u00a3550,000 (45.8%), which equates to it increasing in value by 9.7% each year. The property turned out to be a really good investment for the previous owner.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: How Nigerian Ports Authority Managing Director, Koko Bought \u00a31.75Million Mansion In London While \u2018S... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nAnti-corruption Group Speaks\n\nMeanwhile, an anti-corruption group, 'Say No To Corruption In Nigeria' has asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to extend its searchlight on Bello-Koko and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no more a secret that Bello-Koko was Amaechi\u2019s account officer for years. He has been a crony for Amaechi\u2019s corrupt practices,\u201d the coordinator of the group, Ahmed Abubakar said.\n\n\u201cHow will it be that in 2015, Bello-Koko acquired a property worth \u00a31,750,000 in the United Kingdom, a few months after Amaechi left office as governor and him being his account officer?\n\n\u201cHis last position in Zenith Bank before he went on leave was deputy regional manager, how was he able to afford a house of that amount in 2015? These are questions begging for answers.\n\n\u201cThis man was in charge of finance and admin under Bala-Usman in NPA then. Under normal circumstances, he should be the primary target for the probe that sacked the woman. After all, the allegations investigated fell directly under his department.\u201d\n\nAbubakar added, \u201cAs Nigerians prepare for the elections, it is critical that the world pays significant attention to the ongoing campaigns to determine who becomes the President of Nigeria come May 2023. While many candidates appear to have the right pedigree to be seeking this exalted office, Rotimi Amaechi stands out as too decidedly corrupt and morally bankrupt to be doing so.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmaechi served as Speaker of Rivers State (an oil-rich state in Southern Nigeria) for 8 years and went on to serve as governor of the state for another 8 years.

Each of the zonal delegates were allocated two votes to choose the first and second choice making a total of 36 votes overall. The outcome of that consultation was as follows: 7 votes for candidate (A) Aminu Waziri; 10 votes for candidate (B) Bala Muhd; 10 votes for candidate (C) A-B Saraki; 5 votes for candidate (D) M Hayatu-deen,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cOne of the elders deferred his votes on grounds of continuing consultations with traditional rulers and other major stakeholders. Two members did not cast their second ballots bringing the total to 32 votes casted out of 36.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi said the second phase of the exercise involved zonal assessment \u201cbased on regions which was concluded as follows: a. North Central \u2013 (Eight); b. North East- (Seven); c. North West \u2013 (Two); One is still under consultation\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the third phase of the exercise, the consultations involved looking into the past experiences of the PDP in terms of northern candidates.\n\nAbdullahi added that he made recommendations to Babangida, which the latter approved.\n\n\u201cIt was resolved that a leading aspirant from the North Central and one from the North East are to be presented as northern presidential candidates. The two would in turn be required to make further concessions so that in the end one of them would be presented as the consensus candidate, out of the four that presented themselves from the North,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose of this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Gov Bala Mohammed from the North East and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North Central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe successful aspirants are hereby urged to work together to make allowance for further consultations to foster understanding among themselves, and the PDP community to ensure a rancor free primaries in which all eligible candidates would be free to exercise their right.\u201d\n\nBut Tambuwal has rejected the outcome of the exercise, saying that was not the agreement reached at a previous meeting involving the four aspirants.\n\n\u201cThe attention of Tambuwal Campaign Organisation (TCO) has been drawn to a news item that former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Gov. Bala Muhammad of Bauchi state have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger state,\u201d a statement by Nicholas Msheliza, TCO director of mobilisation, reads.\n\n\u201cThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Second, send a shout-out to Ogheneruemu, my copy editor. She does an excellent job with the newsletter.\n\nSo, how did your week go? I hope you\u2019re not working this weekend because I\u2019ve compiled a list of activities you can enjoy alone, with family, or with friends.\n\nIf you live alone and don\u2019t want to bother anyone this weekend, you can go to the gym, start learning a language, continue that hobby, make a bucket list, try out new recipes, write a letter to yourself, or go for evening walks while meditating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn weekends, I write letters to random people and share with them. Last year was crazy; I wrote these letters and left them on people\u2019s doorposts or gates. Haha! That was fun.\n\nAside from watching movies with your friends, you can attend an event, have an at-home spa day, play board or card games, plan a weekend trip, learn a skill online together, or make your own movie together.\n\nFinally, other than having dinner or lunch outside the house \u2013 which is okay \u2013 you can do a lot with your family this weekend. You can, for example, clean the house together, take a lot of pictures and eat home-cooked food, do a puzzle together, go to the beach or picnic together, or have a family movie night.\n\nI hope this helps you have a good time this weekend. Please, let me know if it does. So, today, I\u2019ll be talking about:\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem struggle with tech talents\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem could struggle with tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle announced in 2021 that it would invest $1 billion in Africa over the next five years to ensure access to faster and cheaper Internet. Also, it wants to create useful, local products to support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that support Africa\u2019s economies.\n\nTo accomplish that, on Wednesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the establishment of its first product development centre in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital.\n\nHow does it plan to accomplish that? Over the next two years, Google plans to hire more than 100 people in software engineering, research, and design roles, joining Visa and Microsoft in establishing a presence in Nairobi.\n\nThis is incredible, but there is a catch. According to the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, Africa has 716,000 professional developers as of 2021, up from 700,000 in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare this to, say, California, United States \u2013 which has an estimated 630,000 developers \u2013 you\u2019ll see that this is a problem.\n\nWhile these figures demonstrate the scarcity of tech talent on the continent and Kenya, don\u2019t you think local startups will lose their best team to Google? Who doesn\u2019t want to work with Google? Do you see my point now?\n\nRemember that in 2019, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Centre and the subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best employees to Microsoft.\n\nWhile this launch is a fantastic opportunity for Kenya, I believe it poses a threat to local startups due to the continent\u2019s scarcity of tech talent. What are your thoughts?\n\nBy the way, some Kenyan experts provided their perspectives on this, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy reading. Want to see it? Please check it here: Kenyan entrepreneurs welcome Google\u2019s product development center but could struggle to hold on to talent\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This would also help to prioritise the distribution of original content over reposted content in places like the Reels tab and feed.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the social media giant will be less likely to recommend reposts of existing Reels and content from other social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nAlso, accounts that aggregate and reshare other users\u2019 content will be less likely to be recommended by the company.\n\nWhy? According to Mosseri, the aim is to focus on the concept of originality. \u201cIf you create something from scratch, you should get more credit than if you are resharing something that you found from someone else. We\u2019re going to do more to try and value original content more, particularly compared to reposted content,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how can Instagram determine a post\u2019s originality? The CEO said in a tweet that they \u201ccan\u2019t know for sure\u201d how they can determine the original creator of a post. He did, however, explain that the company creates classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. Also, Instagram considers who is in the video and whether the app has seen the video before.\n\nMoreover, the company has already implemented measures to reduce resharing. In February 2021, the algorithm began devaluing reshared Reels with the TikTok logo. The platform wanted people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels by 2021.\n\nBesides, Instagram announced that it was releasing new best practices on its @creators account to teach Instagram users how to create content that will be seen and shared.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mosseri mentioned two recent product launches: product tagging and enhanced tagging. Users will be able to tag products from businesses set up for Instagram Shopping with product tagging, which was launched this week. This feature is currently unavailable to African users.\n\nHowever, the company claims that the expansion will make it easier for people to discover products from people they follow and for businesses to grow their audience on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, the enhanced tags \u2013 which were introduced earlier in March 2022\u2013 will make it easier for creators to receive credit for their work. According to Instagram, the enhanced tags allow users to share and view a creator\u2019s specific contribution to a photo or video post.\n\nWhile reducing reshared content may initially harm some accounts, it is likely critical for Reels\u2019 long-term viability. Or what\u2019d you think?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "title": "Blockchain-powered insurance: Meet the decentralised insurance protocol, Etherisc, insuring Kenyan farms against bad climate",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of decentralised insurance became a theoretical possibility with the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). Etherisc is bringing this concept to life, helping African farmers insure their crops against bad weather.\n\nWhile DeFi platforms continue to offer borrowing, lending, and staking services, Etherisc, an open-source, decentralised insurance protocol, brings affordable insurance to African farmers away from the complex DeFi protocols.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Michiel Berende, Chief Inclusive Officer at Etherisc, and he revealed how more than 22,000 farmers got access to an insurance plan without the many steps associated with conventional insurance.\n\nFrom traditional insurance to decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc team with Keyan locals\n\nBerende has been in the insurance space since the early 2000s. While he was an underwriter at an insurance company in the Netherlands, he was interested in information technology and eventually made the switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his challenges saw him develop an interest in microfinance and emerging markets.\n\nBerende\u2019s first task was to help an Indian microfinance organisation set up its activities in the country in 2005. He was responsible for setting up the organisation\u2019s financial operations and deploying the software to run those operations, and his ample experience in finance and technology came in handy.\n\n\n\nEven though Berende\u2019s assignment was similar to what he\u2019d taken on in the Netherlands, it was difficult to replicate his success putting financial operations in place in an emerging market because of limited resources and the extra creativity required to offer financial services in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt changed my view on how things are going in the world, and it doesn\u2019t work everywhere in the world the same way it works in the Netherlands. I enjoyed it, and it moved me to go and live in India,\u201d Berende said.\n\nAfter spending one year in India, he became a consultant in 2007, focusing on technologies for microinsurance. And this allowed him to work on projects in other emerging markets such as Africa.\n\nBut Berende soon realised that insurance was not a thing in Africa; interestingly, not much has changed in 2022, 15 years later.\n\nAfrica makes up 16.72% of the world\u2019s population, but it represents less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nAccording to the Africa Insurance Pulse 2022, insurance penetration in Africa stood at 2.78%, a decline from 2.98% in the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEunice Kinungi, a Kenyan Insurance professional and CEO of Griffin Insurance, told New African magazine that \u201cthe continent still lacks flexible, affordable, and tailored policies that will unlock insurance for the African consumer.\u201d\n\nBesides the problem of unaffordability and inflexibility of insurance, Africans view insurance through the lens of superstition. Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nKinungi also believes that insurance doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in Africa. She said, \u201cinsurance, unfortunately, does not have the best reputation, and there is a general distrust of insurance companies perpetuated by poor customer service and unpaid claims.\u201d\n\nBerende agrees with Kinungi and Pedro\u2019s take on why insurance in Africa is not yet a thing, reiterating the need to create products that fit the African market.\n\n\u201cIf you have people with limited resources, the insurance products must be very cheap.\u201d\n\nHow Etherisc is creating cheaper decentralised insurance with blockchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the statistics on insurance in Africa showing that legacy insurance systems cannot increase insurance penetration, Berende dedicated himself to finding technologies that would make insurance affordable and exciting to Africans.\n\nOn his quest, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and came a step closer to his goal.\n\n\u201cWhat I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it makes it easy to transfer small amounts of money from A to B without a middle-man at a low cost. I delved a little more into it and discovered the technology behind it \u2014 blockchain.\u201d\n\nBerende\u2019s blockchain discovery led to another quest to create blockchain-based solutions, most of which revolve around the one thing that has popularised the technology \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, blockchain, which secures crypto transactions with a network of computers that record these transactions simultaneously, has not seen many applications beyond crypto.\n\nHowever, Etherisc started to infuse blockchain solutions beyond crypto in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t long before Berende found the team behind it.\n\nCombining his insurance background with his desire to create inclusive finance with modern technology, Berende was an automatic fit for Etherisc, and he joined the team.\n\nEtherisc created a decentralised open-source insurance platform on the Ethereum blockchain, called the Generic Insurance Framework. This framework allows for the easy digitisation of parametric insurance products.\n\nWhat is parametric insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Etherisc\n\nParametric insurance, according to Berende, is a type of insurance that executes payment based on external parameters.\n\nUsing a flight delay example, he explained that if a person insures their flight ticket against a delay, they get a payout once there\u2019s a delay.\n\nHe gave another example using a farmer. If a farm is insured against heavy rains, the farmer gets indemnified if such rains destroy their farms.\n\nInsurance companies do not dispute or investigate parametric insurance claims because the data that determines the payout is usually publicly available and unalterable.\n\nThis makes automating insurance products easy, and that is where blockchain comes into play.\n\nSmart contracts, a mechanism for carrying out blockchain actions, are a major part of Etherisc\u2019s operations. Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain to run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nA simple analogy to understanding how smart contracts work is automating your bank account to make a payment once you receive a specific delivery.\n\nSay you\u2019re expecting a truckload of yams but don\u2019t want to make payment until you have taken delivery. So you install devices in your warehouse that can tell when a certain number of tubers has been delivered. After which, these devices signal the smart contract, which initiates payment.\n\nHowever, the beauty of smart contracts is that no one \u2014 neither you nor the delivery company \u2014 can alter the predetermined condition.\n\nEtherisc has harnessed the trustless nature of this technology to create an insurance system that can work without many people. The zero delivery cost also means it is cheaper to run.\n\nNote: In this context, \u201ctrustless\u201d means the parties involved do not necessarily need to trust themselves to complete transactions.\n\nInsuring 22,000 farms with decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc partnered with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) Africa, a licensed insurance intermediary that helps farmers reduce agricultural and climate risks, to provide micro-insurance at affordable terms for smallholder farmers.\n\nA blockchain solution to insurance for farmers has to be simple to get any traction; a challenge Etherisc had a simple solution to.\n\nThe product Etherisc provides for the farmers is a weather index insurance that covers farmers when the weather prevents them from having a good harvest.\n\nAccording to Berende, 22,000 farmers in Kenya have accessed this insurance product.\n\nBut how does one distribute significantly advanced tech insurance products that are automated based on climate conditions to farmers?\n\nBerende\u2019s solution is simple. The bags of seeds that farmers buy come with scratch cards. When they send the numbers on these cards via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Etherisc\u2019s Generic Insurance Framework captures their geolocation and receives information about the area\u2019s climatic conditions with satellite data.\n\nHow do farmers pay the premium for decentralised insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACRE Africa\n\nFarmers pay the $0.5 premium when they buy their bags of seeds from ACRE at a lower price that incorporates the insurance cost. Insurance can also be paid with mobile banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to send an insurance surveyor into the field to monitor if something has happened. A process that would naturally cost a lot of money,\u201d Berende said.\n\nIs satellite data accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite\n\nWhile Etherisc\u2019s insurance products reduce dependency on humans, the reliability of the non-human parts of its operation is in question.\n\nAccording to Climate analysis with satellite versus weather station data, a paper published in 2007 by Mendelsohn et al., satellite data performs slightly better than data captured from the ground.\n\nThe paper is based on a study that examines how well satellite and weather station data explain agricultural performance. It concludes that the satellite\u2019s ability to see the entirety of a landscape makes it record more accurate data when measuring temperature.\n\nHowever, satellite data is not as precise as data obtained from the ground when measuring precipitation. While Etherisc\u2019s insurance product can accurately measure droughts, it might not measure rainfall correctly.\n\nA more recent take from the communications team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tilts towards ground thermometers rather than satellites when measuring the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nBerende, however, assures us that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cIn the past two seasons, the satellite data covered 10\u00d710 km. For this year, we\u2019re in the process of increasing the resolution to 5\u00d75 km,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking beyond the limitations of satellite technology, blockchain, the Internet of things (IoT), and other technologies could be a compelling solution to Africa\u2019s low insurance penetration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "\u201cWhat shall we say to these things?\u201d was the theme of the charge given Thursday at the funeral of Chinelo Megafu by Reverend Israel Kristilere, Pastor of the Shepherdhill Church, Obanikoro, the venue of the funeral service.\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Chinelo Megafu lost her life in the terror attack on a Kaduna-bound train from Abuja on March 28, 2022. After she was hit by the terrorists\u2019 bullet, she had reached out via a tweet, requesting prayers on her behalf, the call was met with mean responses and arguments from people that had responded on Twitter.\n\nAs the service peaked amid tears and tributes by family members, relatives, as well as colleagues of the deceased, Kristilere referred to Megafu\u2019s death as avoidable, \u201cif we were in a nation where lives and properties are respected, and things are going the way they should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike many have said, and I agree,\u201d he continued, \u201cit has never been as bad as this security-wise in our land.\u201d\n\nHe expressed sorrow over the lack of arrest since the attack over three weeks ago as of the funeral day.\n\n\u201cHere we gather at this service, conducting her funeral because some bandits decided to attack the train she boarded. What is still paining me today is that, after that attack which will be a month old in the next few days, nobody has been arrested even concerning this very wicked event,\u201d the clergyman said.\n\nKristilere said he had not seen anything tangible the government had done since then, considering that some others are still in the captivity of \u201cthe evil men\u201d. He lamented that trade travelers are not insured against terrorists\u2019 attacks and that some top members of the military just have flowery titles attached to their names without making too much impact against insurgencies as this in the country.\n\nRead also: Train attack: Victims\u2019 families lament neglect by government\n\n\u201cIf these were foreign armies ravaging our land, do we really have an army to defend us?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI heard a doctor from Abuja said he never imagined he\u2019d be writing a tribute, he thought he\u2019d be writing a reference letter.\u201d\n\nIfeanyi Megafu, father of the deceased while talking about his late daughter, trying to hold back tears, explained that he is not a social media person, but had heard of his daughter\u2019s tweet before she passed, and the responses it met.\n\n\u201cAt first, it was that of shock, shock that our humanity is so degraded, and some people could be so demented,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI had pity on those people, and at this stage, I am saying it again that I have forgiven them all; all of them. I have also forgiven the country that enabled all these to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrankly, the past three weeks have been quite traumatic. I did tell a friend that I spoke on the phone the past three weeks more than I did in three years,\u201d Megafu added.\n\nHe said he got calls from all over the world and tried as much as possible to respond to them. He added that of the calls, two were significant, one of which was a call from a serving member of this government.\n\n\u201cHe called ostensibly to commiserate, but the next things he says were completely political. I blanked off. I do not play politics, neither did Chinelo,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an effort to speak some comfort to the bereaved, Kristilere, pastor and friend to the parents of the deceased said, \u201cI remember he (father of the deceased) told me then that their first daughter (deceased) had gone to Israel four years before that time. Now ruminating over some things, I just discovered that Chinelo had a way of becoming first in many areas. She was the first of Engr. Megafu\u2019s children, she was the first to visit the earthly Jerusalem and sadly, the first in the family to see the heavenly Jerusalem.\u201d",

The newly deployed CP takes over from Philip Ogbadu who retired from the force after 35 years of service.\n\nThe governor during the visit, along with the CP, decorated 10 newly promoted police officers.\n\nObaseki said as a result of the increased collaboration with the NPF, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba has deployed a special tactical team to complement the government\u2019s efforts at restoring peace and sanity across Edo communities.\n\nThe governor who described the issue of land grabbing in various communities in the state as worrisome, said the IGP will deploy special squads to assist in restoring sanity to communities across the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI thank the IGP for deploying two police special squads to Edo State. We would soon inspect their accommodation as they will be deployed to the state in the next few weeks. This squad will deal with community issues and issues of land grabbing. We need your support and that of the area command. I have spoken with the AIG who assured us that all land cases that come to the area command will be referred to the Edo Command.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with the issue of land grabbing squarely as it is impeding development in Edo State. We have a land committee in place, which is currently reviewing cases before it. We are making resources available to fight this menace in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki, who urged the new CP to develop a mechanism to forestall electoral violence during the forthcoming Presidential elections, added, \u201cAs we prepare for another set of elections, we want to work with you to design a system that will not allow electoral violence in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe want to tackle electoral violence. We must have a peaceful election; both pre and post-electioneering activities must be peaceful in Edo State. Election is not war and we don\u2019t see reasons why people take up arms during this process.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI have been told that you have been putting in place an action programme to mop up those causing trouble for us, especially at the Ovia axis in the state.\n\n\u201cThe key to our security success in the state is hinged on the synergy and collaboration among security agencies in the state and the police is the apex. Once we have a very cooperative and open CP who is ready to work with other sister agencies in the state, it will help tackle the security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to invest in the security system and security architecture, and also support you in terms of logistics, equipment and operations.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Yaro noted, \u201cI am here to thank you for the top-notch security architecture on the ground which I have noticed with satisfaction and ready to key in to advance the cause of stability and security in Edo State.\u201d\n\nThe Edo CP also thanked the governor for his relentless support to security agencies in the state, pledging to work with the government to sustain peace and security.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBenin City \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Friday, reiterated the need for Nigeria to diversify its economy from crude oil, urging government at all levels to pay critical attention to the tourism sector as it has the potential to improve revenue and facilitate economic development.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he declared open the Edo State Tourism Key Stakeholders Workshop, at the John Odigie-Oyegun Staff Training Centre, in Benin City.\n\nStakeholders at the workshop include the Benin Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (BENCCIMA); Federation of Tourism Association of Nigeria; National Council of Arts; Edo Global Arts Foundation; Cultural Troupes; Directors from Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs); Commissioners, and Permanent Secretaries, among others.\n\nThe governor said that the country has depended on crude oil for the past 40 years of its existence, noting that there was a need to expedite actions to facilitate diversification of the nation\u2019s revenue base to grow the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cCOVID-19 has changed our whole economic structure in the country. We have had to depend on hydro-carbon assets, oil and gas for the last 40 years to drive our economy. This is a mono-economy and we have built our entire system of life and governance around it. Our governance structure in Nigeria relies on crude oil.\u201d\n\nHe noted that what Nigeria gets from its oil assets is not enough to sustain the country as the federal government has, in recent times, struggled to get allocation to share amongst states.\n\nObaseki added, \u201cFor us in Edo, we have come to the end of the road as we are deliberating on developing other sources to help raise revenue to develop the economy of the state.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we need to diversify our economy to a broad base. And one unique asset that we have as a state is tourism. Edo is strategically located and traffic must flow through the state and we must utilize it effectively to generate revenue for the state. Our focus is for the traffic to stop and the travelers to spend their money here in Edo to boost our revenue. We are looking for things to do to attract tourists to spend their money here.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe have a huge ecosystem to support the tourism sector in the state. Tourism is not all about culture, monuments, ecotourism and business but entails much; a whole totality, and having an ecosystem that supports it. Tourism must begin at home; it\u2019s local, and we must have strong tourism that is locally based to attract international tourists into the state.\n\n\u201cWe have so many aspects of tourism in Edo and this workshop should, in my view, enable our stakeholders to think about tourism in a much broader sense and understand the players within that ecosystem.\u201d\n\nObaseki said to boost ecotourism in the state, his administration is working with the National Park Service as it prepares to co-invest in Okomu National Park, noting that the investment will be extended to develop the state\u2019s park in Gelegele.\u201d\n\nA facilitator at the stakeholders\u2019 workshop, Salewa Akomolafe said the focus of the workshop was to facilitate the development of the tourism sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Chairman of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, yesterday assured that the Dangote Refinery would be ready for commissioning before President Muhammadu Buhari leaves office in 2023.\n\nHe disclosed this to State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAsked when the refinery would be ready for operations, Africa richest man said; \u201cBy the grace of God, Mr. President will come and commission it before the end of his tenure.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, when operational, the refinery would create jobs and generate more tax money which would be used by government to develop the country further.\n\n\u201cIn the near future they are expected to see more employment, they are expected to see more prosperity. We keep doing new things and good things and also we keep paying our taxes which will complement the government\u2019s effort in providing education, good health and the rest,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if he was worried about potash scarcity as a result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict, Dangote said there was no need for worry as only 26% of the world\u2019s potash supply comes from the two countries.\n\n\u201cNo, we are not concerned. Well, there are some few other countries that have it, it\u2019s not only Ukraine that has it. Yes, Ukraine and Russia have about 26% of the world\u2019s potash, but it does not mean that you cannot source potash elsewhere. So I\u2019m not really very concerned, the concern is just about price,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on why his team was at the Presidential Villa, he said; \u201cWe came here on a courtesy call and also to thank him for personally coming to commission our fertilizer plant. That was on the 22nd of March, about four weeks ago. So, I\u2019m here with my board of directors just to show gratitude to Mr. President and he received us very well.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari during the visit urged entrepreneurs to channel ideas and resources to areas of the economy that stimulate growth with long-term effect on job creation and poverty reduction, assuring that fixing infrastructure remains government\u2019s top priority.\n\nReceiving Alhaji Aliko Dangote and board members of the Dangote Group at the Presidential Villa, the president in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the challenges in transportation and energy would continue to attract attention for a turnaround, while urging entrepreneurs in the country and foreign investors to focus on areas that would leave lasting legacies of transforming lives.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, Let me again thank you and your board for the courage and foresight that enabled you to embark on these mega investment projects which will have enduring benefits to generations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs such as Alhaji Aliko Dangote are unique gifts to their societies and the institutions they build, and they often become the pillars of stable enduring prosperous economies. I, therefore, urge other Nigerians in the business sector to emulate this iconic entrepreneur by investing in such enterprises that will in time become worthy legacies as national assets which will continue to benefit their people for generation after generation, creating firm anchors of enduring prosperity for their citizens,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari told the delegation that reforms were already going on in the public sector to reposition it into a more effective and result oriented engine room that would encourage more investments.\n\n\u201cI am keenly aware of the many challenges in the business environment and the investment climate despite the sustained efforts by this government to bring about improvements.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you, however, that government will do everything possible to enhance the development in infrastructure, especially in energy and transportation sectors.\n\n\u201cWe will also continue to implement needed reforms in the public service to significantly improve the ease of doing business,\u2019\u2019 the president added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPresident Buhari lauded Alhaji Dangote for always investing in areas that bring the highest benefits to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI recall, with great pleasure, my visit to the Dangote Free Zone just about four weeks ago, to commission the group\u2019s new three million metric tonnes fertilizer plant. Let me once again congratulate you and your board for a very successful commissioning ceremony.\n\n\u201cAs I said at that event, the coming on stream of this plant was a huge opportunity to ramp up the productivity of our agricultural sector. It is, therefore, a most welcome booster to our government\u2019s strategy for achieving food security and reducing poverty.\n\n\u201cGiven recent developments globally, especially the effect of the ongoing war in Europe on world-wide food supply chain, I must commend your foresight for bringing the plant into operation at the time you did.\n\n\u201cI note that market realities will bring pressure to bear on the Dangote Fertilizer Limited in seeking to meet the demands of your export customers.\n\n\u201cHowever, given your group\u2019s well known patriotic vision, I am confident that your board will continue to accord priority to meeting local demands of our farmers,\u2019\u2019 the president noted.\n\nBuhari also commended the Dangote Group for extending investments to other African countries, while highlighting the vision behind the refinery.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, I must specially commend you and your board for the development of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Complex. I had a good view of this incredible city of steel and concrete when my helicopter circled over it during my visit for the commissioning of the fertilizer plant.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn his remarks, Dangote said: \u201cWe seize the opportunity to reiterate our immense gratitude for the sustained effort of your administration through various policy initiatives aimed at progressively improving the business environment and investment climate, despite some unprecedented challenges our economy has been confronted with over the past decade.\n\n\u201cWe are also deeply grateful for your direct interventions at various times when our operations were challenged by some unintended consequences of economic policy positions.\n\n\u201cYour interventions have not only helped to resolve business challenges, but have been a source of great encouragement in our determination to continue to invest in our economy for the benefit of our country and our people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAlhaji Dangote said the board looked forward to the return of President Buhari to commission the oil refineries and petrochemicals project which will transform the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cThrough the outputs of our various businesses, our group is proud to be making significant contributions to the diversification and growth of our nation\u2019s economy, which is second only to the federal government in the size of our workforce,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe leader of the Dangote Group said with more investments in agriculture and oil and gas sectors more impact would be made on the economy.\n\nAlhaji Dangote said the group of industries would always hold on to the president\u2019s mantra on the economy to \u201cproduce what we consume and consume what we produce.\u2019\u2019",

          "title": "2023: Who Emerges Lagos PDP Governorship Flagbearer?",
          "text": "The ambition of members of the Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to produce governor for the state, have been a tall dream and each time the party tried it has always hit a brick wall, in the ruling party in the state because the ruling party has large membership and it has overtime succeeded in endearing itself to the populace through public oriented programmes initiated.\n\nSuffice to say many factors contributed to the poor performance of the PDP in the state. One of the major issues the party has contended with is internal bickering, it has been going from one crisis to the other since 1998 that, the party was established.\n\nWhile some factions in the party see themselves as the authentic owner of the party, new entrants in the party are treated as outcasts.\n\nThe crisis led to the ouster of its foundation chairman Chief Olorunfunmi Bashorun and was succeeded by Alhaji Muritala Ashorobi who also tried to make peace among the party members but things got complicated and getting the party United became a huge challenge.\n\nThe choice of candidate for governorship position has always been an anathema, because most of those that have emerged as governorship candidates in the last two decades and some years are considered to be imposed on the party, either by the party leader in the state Chief Olabode George or the presidency. There is this belief that they never emerge based on their popularity among members of the party.\n\nThis has created disillusion among party members and as such they don\u2019t have confidence in such candidates and they are not prepared to go out and campaign for such candidates. That in essence also contributed to the party\u2019s abysmal performance at the poll.\n\nIn the last 22 years, the only time the party governorship candidates made impressible performance in governorship elections were in 2003 when the party fielded Engineer Funsho Williams as its candidate and 2015 when Jimi Agbaje was its flagbearer\n\nDespite the challenges facing the party, some governorship aspirants believe that their ambition to rule the state could be actualised in the party.\n\nSo far three aspirants have shown interest in the governorship race, while two of them, Dr. Ade Dosunmu and Engineer Deji Doherty are old members and are veteran in the governorship race, the third aspirant Babajide Adediran known as Jandor is new in the party.\n\nDoherty\n\nHe is an engineer by training, he has been a consistent member of the party. He has always shunned entreaties to defect to another party. His interest to govern Lagos State has been constant and his desire to run has never waned. The 2023 attempt would make it the fifth time he would show interest in the race.\n\nHe signified interest to run in 2007 and 2011, 2015,2019 at a time he was the Acting Chairman of the Southwest PDP caretaker Committee, when the Chairman, Chief Ishola Filani, resigned. He relinquished the position when the court ruled that the status quo should be maintained, Filani was returned to his former position.\n\nOut of his commitment to the growth of the party, he was elected the Lagos State chairman of the party, but he did not enjoy his tenure as his administration was subjected to litigation . Again Chief George was averse to his emergence as party chairman. His tenure was truncated by a court ruling that recognised Adegbola Dominic as the party chairman.\n\nHis chances of getting the party ticket is slim as he was said to have teamed up with those who worked against the consensus agreement for the state congress, contravening the earlier agreement which ceded the chairmanship to Fawole. The probability of delegates from the other camp voting for him is low.\n\nDosunmu\n\nHe is former Director General Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) ,he was the party governorship candidate for 2011 governorship election defeating his closest rival at the primary Demola Seriki, former minister of state for defence.\n\nHe did not do well at the general election because he was believed to be Chief Bode George stooge, so those who were of the view that he was imposed on the party worked against him.\n\nThere is the possibility that he suffers the same fate at the party primary because those against George domineering influence in the party may work against his interest.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Aivoji led state executive may also not be disposed to his candidature since his principal is against the emergence of the state exco.\n\nAlso he does not have a structure that cuts across the state, for him to pull a large crowd at the party primary will be a serious challenge. He has always leveraged on Chief George\u2019s political structure which is now decimated due to the crisis in the party, more so it is not certain the faceoff would be resolved before the election.\n\nAdediran (Jandor)\n\nHe is a journalist by training, he worked with Lagos State Television LTV 8 before he set up his own television station Core media. He along with other prominent Lagosians, which included Late Princess Adenrele Ogunsanya started the Lagos4Lagos movement, the objective of the movement is to promote an agenda where indigene of the state will occupy a sensitive position in the governance of the state. The movement enjoys the support of some indigenes of the state and those who believe in their cause.\n\nJandor therefore used the movement to launder his governorship ambition, realising that actualising his dream in the APC would be tough he defected to the PDP, hinging his reason for dumping the party on the fact that his group was excluded from the party congresses from ward level to state level and unpopular candidates who are said to stooges to the leaders of the party are imposed on the party. As far as he is concerned such Exco will only do the bidding of those that put them in office. Though his Group organised a parallel congress, he decided to quit when the party national body failed to attend to the petition they filed.\n\nJide is a young man in his forties and enjoys the support of the young folks in the party.\n\nHis chances of getting the party\u2019s ticket are bright because he is neutral in the crisis going on in the PDP so he may get support from the two aggrieved sides.\n\nHe can\u2019t be said to have a formidable structure but the movement he leads endears him to some who believe in his cause.\n\nWhoever emerges as the PDP flag bearer will have a huge responsibility to sell the party to the electorate because the party in power in the state had ruled the state right from the time of Alliance for Democracy (AD), Action Congress of Nigeria (CAN) and All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe candidate will have to contest against the incumbent governor of the state, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu who had been endorsed by the Governance Advisory Council (GAC), the highest decision making organ of the ruling All Progressives Congress in Lagos State for a second term in office.",

This is perhaps, the largest collection of bankers on the FMBN that I can remember in a long time.\u201d the Minister said.\n\nHe also advised the Board and Management to promptly engage with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and ensure FMBN\u2019s compliance with regulatory stipulations for operating as a Bank.

The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated February 10, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nAccording to Malpass, generalised subsidies have significant negative effects on any system. Thus, he reiterated the need for the country to do away with the multiple exchange rate system, which he said is \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there was a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort.\n\n\u201cThe most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help,\u201d he noted.\n\nMalpass further noted that Nigeria also has trade barriers that continue to distort trade and capital flows. He urged the Nigerian Government to improve to help the country and its people move forward.\n\n\u201cI take note of the complicated situation that they face where there are weapons flowing into northern Africa that find their way into non Nigerians that create violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a very challenging situation that the government faces. I think all over the world, people should have an understanding of the fragility that is facing several parts of the world, but in particular, the Sahel and the Sub-Saharan Africa area where the weapons flow from outside of Africa are putting a great burden on governments around the continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge opportunity because of its natural resources and because of its people, and I think I could see its growth accelerate with improvements in policy,\u201d he added while commenting on the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe World Bank had in November 2021 warned Nigeria not to delay any further in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy.",

          "text": "By Anastacia Eluwa, Asaba\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State on Thursday, said the Agro-Industrial Park being executed by his administration at Aboh-Ogwashi, Aniocha South Local Government Area, would be ready for inauguration in November, 2022.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen shortly after inspecting ongoing works at the park, the governor, who said that the contracting firm had assured on the completion of the project, explained that the project was necessary to enhance development of the state\u2019s agro potential.\n\nHe said that basic infrastructure were being put in place at the park to meet completion target, and lauded the host community for support and cooperation for the project \u201cwhich holds a lot for mutual benefits for the community and investors\u201d.\n\n\u201cLet me appreciate the level of cooperation we have had with the Ogwashi-Uku community because they gave us over 180 hectares of land for the Agro-Industrial Park.\n\n\u201cWe thought the park was necessary because of the need to help develop our agricultural potential in this state and the Park is actually meant for agro-processing and we are using rice mill as the nucleus of the industrial production coming up in this place.\n\n\u201cThe basic infrastructure at the centre is already being put in place not just for the rice mills; you have service quarters, warehouses and many other things that are going to come in, including the source of power.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing about this park is the river which means that we are able to provide irrigation services all year round from that river.\n\n\u201cI have drawn their attention on the need to start the road development in the park because of the rainy season that is about to set in because that\u2019s the only set back they are likely going to have.\n\n\u201cThe contractor has promised to deliver the project towards the end of November which means if they start the road project now, they will still have time during the break in August and in the later part of October to finish with the road project,\u201d Okowa said.\n\nHe pointed out that establishing rice factory in the park would help to encourage out-growers across the state to help feed the rice mill and engender direct positive impact on Deltans.\n\n\u201cThe process of encouraging out-growers and giving them rice seedlings that are very high-yielding and with agricultural extension support services that will be provided to our people, will definitely impact directly on the families that will be engaged in the rice farming.\n\n\u201cThis will help to create jobs and multiply the family income of the communities around Ogwashi-Uku and even across the entire state.\n\n\u201cWe are also expecting that many other agro-processing companies will come in place and that will begin to stir up developments in other areas beyond rice.\n\n\u201cThe park is a community of its own where you have various agro-processing industries co-sharing common facilities for agro-indstrialisation in the state,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn the Kwale Industrial Park, the governor said that it had suffered delay because of COVID-19 but expressed optimism on making it a free trade zone.\n\nHe said that the state government was working with the Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment to designate the park as an Export Processing Zone.\n\n\u201cWe are doing the initial fencing and there is a lot of work ongoing and recently one of the companies in Delta have spoken to us to move to that area and we are working on giving them 20 hectares of land.",

They could each face up to 12 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe charges against Fico and Kali\u00e1k, according to David Lindtner, a lawyer for Fico and Kali\u00e1k, pertain to crimes they allegedly performed as Cabinet members between 2012 and 2018, while Smer anchored successive ruling coalitions. Former President Andrej Kiska and Boris Koll\u00e1r, the current speaker of Slovakia\u2019s parliament, are among those accused of using confidential tax information to run smear campaigns against them.\n\nFico was accused of being the leader of a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that includes former police director Tibor Gap\u00e1r and Slovak oligarch Norbert Bodor, according to the indictment.\n\nHe stood for president in 2014, while serving his second term as Prime Minister of Slovakia, but was defeated by Kiska by nearly 20 percentage points.

          "text": "A Russian general declared on Friday that Moscow wants to seize all of southern and eastern Ukraine, far wider war aims than it had acknowledged as it presses on with a new offensive after its campaign to capture the capital Kyiv collapsed last month.\n\nUkraine said the comments by Rustam Minnekayev, deputy commander of Russia\u2019s central military district, had given the lie to Russia\u2019s previous assertions that it has no territorial ambitions.\n\n\u201cThey stopped hiding it,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry said on Twitter. Russia had \u201cacknowledged that the goal of the \u2018second phase\u2019 of the war is not victory over the mythical Nazis, but simply the occupation of eastern and southern Ukraine. Imperialism as it is.\u201d\n\nMinnekayev was quoted by Russian state news agencies as saying Moscow aimed to seize the entire eastern Donbas region, link up with the Crimea peninsula, and capture Ukraine\u2019s entire south as far as a breakaway, Russian-occupied region of Moldova. That would mean pushing hundreds of miles beyond current lines, past the major Ukrainian cities of Mykolaiv and Odesa.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said Russian forces had increased attacks along the whole frontline in the east and were trying to mount an offensive in the Kharkiv region, north of Russia\u2019s main target, the Donbas.\n\nIn Kharkiv city, Russian shellfire hit the main Barabashovo market. Ambulance services said there had been casualties but no details were available yet. A wedding hall and a residential building were also struck.\n\nIn Geneva, the United Nations human rights office said there was growing evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, including indiscriminate shelling and summary executions, that had caused many civilian casualities. It said Ukraine also appeared to have used weapons with indiscriminate effects.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians.\n\nCOLLECTING BODIES FROM MARIUPOL\n\nRussia said on Thursday it had won the war\u2019s biggest fight \u2013 the battle for the main port of the Donbas, Mariupol \u2013 after a nearly two-month siege. President Vladimir Putin decided not to try to root out thousands of Ukrainian troops still holed up in a huge steel works there.\n\nIn a Russian-held section of the city, the guns had largely fallen silent and dazed looking residents ventured out on streets on Thursday to a background of charred apartment blocks and wrecked cars. Some carried suitcases.\n\nVolunteers in white hazmat suits and masks roved the ruins, collecting bodies from inside apartments and loading them on to a truck marked with the letter \u201cZ\u201d, symbol of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nMaxar, a commercial satelite company, said images from space showed freshly dug mass graves on the city\u2019s outskirts. Ukraine estimates tens of thousands of civilians have died in the city during Russia\u2019s bombardment and siege.\n\nKyiv says 100,000 civilians are still inside the city, and need full evacuation. It says Moscow\u2019s decision not to storm the Azovstal steel works is proof that Russia lacks the forces to defeat the Ukrainian defenders.\n\nThe United Nations and Red Cross say the civilian toll is still unknowable but at least in the thousands. Russia says it has rescued the city from nationalists.\n\nIn Zaporizhzhia, where 79 Mariupol residents arrived in the first convoy of buses permitted by Russia to leave for other parts of Ukraine, Valentyna Andrushenko held back tears as she recalled the ordeal under siege.\n\n\u201cThey (Russians) were bombing us from day one. They are demolishing everything. Just erase it,\u201d she said of the city.\n\nKyiv said no new evacuations were planned for Friday. Moscow says it has taken 140,000 Mariupol residents to Russia; Kyiv says many of those were deported by force in what would be a war crime.\n\nMariupol\u2019s mayor, Vadym Boichenko, who is no longer inside Mariupol, said: \u201cWe need only one thing \u2013 the full evacuation of the population. About 100,000 people remain in Mariupol.\u201d\n\nCONTINUES TO RESIST\n\nWestern countries believe Putin is desperate to demonstrate a victory after the failure of his forces to capture the capital Kyiv.\n\nIn a late-night address, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia was doing all it could \u201cto talk about at least some victories\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey can only postpone the inevitable \u2013 the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory, including from Mariupol, a city that continues to resist Russia regardless of what the occupiers say,\u201d Zelenskiy said.\n\nAbandoning the effort to defeat the last Ukrainian defenders in Mariupol frees up more Russian troops for the main military effort, an assault from several directions on the towns of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk in the Donbas, to cut off the main Ukrainian military force in the east.\n\nMinnekayev, the Russian general, described a much wider goal of linking up with Transdnistria, a Russian-occupied breakaway part of Moldova, which is on Ukraine\u2019s southwestern border.\n\nHe said Russian speakers there were oppressed, the same justification Moscow has given for its interventions in Ukraine since 2014, which Western countries call a baseless pretext.\n\nWhile Russia has withdrawn from northern Ukraine and so far made only limited headway in the east, it still occupies a swathe of southern Ukraine captured in the early days of the invasion. Ukrainian officials fear Moscow might try to organise fake independence votes to try to wrest those areas away.\n\nBritish military intelligence reported heavy fighting in the east as Russian forces tried to advance on settlements, but said the Russians were suffering from losses sustained early in the war and were sending equipment back to Russia for repair.\n\nThe United States authorized another $800 million in military aid for Ukraine on Thursday, including heavy artillery and drones.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Following public outrage over the high cost of nomination forms for aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC), the ruling party on Thursday explained that the fee was pegged at the rate needed to lock out unserious contenders.\n\nAPC\u2019s defence of the price of its nominations forms, which was announced Wednesday, came as Chairman of The Progressive Project (TPP) and senator for Kano South, Senator Kabiru Gaya, expressed confidence in Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s candidacy. Gaya said, unlike the moneybags, Osinbajo\u2019s popularity would facilitate the pooling of his supporters\u2019 token donations to raise the N100 million nomination fee for his presidential bid.\n\nHowever, National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, and former Governor of Cross River State, Chief Clement Ebri, condemned the high nomination cost for elective offices announced by APC.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, also criticised APC for \u201ccorrupting democracy\u201d with the high nomination fee, saying the N100 million fixed for its presidential nomination form \u201crightly sent shock waves of righteous indignation across the country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indications emerged on Thursday that President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, was under intense pressure from a section of the northern elite to run for president in 2023.\n\nThe ruling party had during its 11th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Abuja pegged its presidential nomination form at N100 million, governorship at N50 million, Senate at N20 million, House of Representatives at N10 million, and House of Assembly at N2 million.\n\nAPC National Women Leader, Beta Edu, featuring on \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Arise News Channel said the high rate of the ruling party\u2019s nomination forms was to curtail the activities of persons with jokey ambitions. Edu said the APC National Working Committee (NWC) had consciously fixed the rate as part of a mechanism to ensure only serious aspirants were on the ballot.\n\nShe said the ruling party could not afford to waste time, especially considering the fact that it was working in line with the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nEdu stated, \u201cEverywhere around the world, running for elections has never been cheap and the party must be able to have means to guard several other issues that may arise. You find people who are not interested in running for elections just standing up, picking up forms and just waiting to constitute a kind of barrier or put a stud in the entire process as it goes on.\n\n\u201cThese are not things that we want to see as a party. We are the ruling party, the largest party in Africa, a party where if you pick their nomination form and you are the candidate, the probability of you becoming the elected person for that position is almost hundred per cent.\n\n\u201cSo, we cannot afford to dabble or joke around or gamble around. We want only serious people who are interested in running and representing different persons to run.\u201d\n\nEdu claimed the cost of forms for House of Assembly was fair.\n\nShe stated, \u201cFor all we care, N1.5 million for a House of Assembly nomination form is fair to the general population. It\u2019s very fair and for women it\u2019s free, for the disabled, it is free; for young people, it is 40 per cent off, that\u2019s really very fair.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, going for the other positions, we know what it was before and what it is now and we are trying to prevent certain persons who sometimes are not the members of the party. They just get their way in or they\u2019re being used as syndicate to pick up forms at the beginning to constitute a kind of stud in the way of the whole electoral process and they pull the party backwards.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain her definition of fairness with regard to the ruling party\u2019s high nomination fee in a country where over 98 per cent of the population did not have N500, 000 in their bank accounts, the APC women leader stated that running for elective office was not an all-comers affair.\n\nEdu said, \u201cLet me say this and very clearly, coming to run for a governorship election is not an all-comers affair. Governorship election is serious business, for you to run through all the local governments, consult people, reach out to people and, indeed, be able to campaign through the local governments requires some good amount of resources. And when you make up your mind that you want to run, you should be able to prepare adequately for that race.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, there are many ways for young people to generate funding for elections. It must not be your money and they are not paying the same amount others are paying.\u201d\n\nOn rising disunity within the party, Edu said as part of the reconciliation committee, headed by Senator Abdullahi Adamu, she believed his view that most of the crises in the states were fuelled by ego clash between serving and former governors.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe went through all the states in Nigeria and we understood the issues and concerns about unity or some disagreements among members of the party and, of course, like the chairman clearly stated yesterday (Wednesday), if we work together, we can to overcome it soon.\u201d\n\nShe said, as the party moved closer to the elections, more aggrieved members would be reconciled.\n\nOsinbajo Popular Enough to Pool Donations to Raise N100m, Supporters Insist\n\nMeanwhile, Gaya said Osinbajo was popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations to raise the N100 million nomination fee with ease.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, Gaya said consultations by members of various support groups, eminent political leaders, and citizens, too numerous to mention, culminated in his decision to lead the Osinbajo supporters\u2019 group.\n\nHe noted that for the vice president, the race was not about personal ambition, but a positive response to a popular call from a citizen-driven mobilisation that began without input from him or his office. The lawmaker stressed that people from other parties and even millions of non-partisan citizens, who did not belong to any political party, had strong interest and involvement with the campaign for Osinbajo\u2019s candidature.\n\nGaya stressed that his specific assignment here was to lead a process of recalibration of all pro-Osinbajo forces towards electoral victory on the platform of APC. He said without doubt, all knowledgeable people in the country could attest to the qualities and competence of Osinbajo.\n\nGaya noted that his chosen method redefined presidential declarations in Nigeria, adding that the vice president clearly signalled that noble citizens had no need to descend into gutters. No touts were hired by anyone and his message effectively reverberated across the entire country and the Diaspora, he stated.\n\nAccording to Gaya, \u201cEven an internal issue of the price of our party\u2019s nomination form is being deliberately misinterpreted in some circles, when we feel confident that, unlike moneybags, our truly populist candidate is popular enough to pool supporters\u2019 token donations and raise such money with ease.\n\n\u201cJust one youth group with TPP, the Progressive Group alone, says that they can raise N100 million with rough voluntary contributions of N10, 000 each by 10, 000 of their supporters, who are keen about seeing a better future.\n\n\u201cOur populist mathematics is flawless and very strong; moneybags within or outside APC will only lose their dollars in any contest against the people\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Gaya said, unlike other political parties, records show that neither the APC presidential ticket nor its vice president\u2019s slot had ever been won by throwing money around, but by populist endorsements from the north and south.\n\nHe said the TPP noted the fear of the people\u2019s genuine power had made some elements to resort to heightened propaganda in the past few days.\n\nGaya added, \u201cWe will not descend low to play gutter politics and we have continued to warn our supporters against involvement in insults and vilification. We are democrats, we believe in uniting people and in submitting ourselves and competing ideas to the people\u2019s evaluation and decisions through the ballot box.\u201d\n\nThe APC chieftain emphasised that the popular forces behind Osinbajo feared no foe and hated no one, saying they are focused without compromise on the unity, progress and development of Nigeria and would not descend into gutter fights with any person or group.\n\nLawan Under Pressure to Join Presidential Race\n\nIndications emerged on Thursday that the senate president was under intense pressure to contest for president in 2023. The ruling party released the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 elections, but maintained sealed lips on the issue of zoning.\n\nAlthough, following the emergence of Adamu as National Chairman of the party at the March 26 convention, observers believed it was an indication that the ruling party would zone its presidency to the south.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka, had said that the party was yet to take any decision on the zoning of the presidency to the south.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that some elements within the northern elite were mounting pressure on Lawan to join the presidential race.\n\nThe source said, \u201cYes, he is under intense pressure to run for president. Some northern leaders are making the moves, asking him to run. It\u2019s so serious. But it is not certain yet. It\u2019s an option he\u2019s still considering.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, two businessmen from Igbere, Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, have promised to obtain presidential nomination forms for Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Kalu, and Lawan. The businessmen disclosed this in a statement issued on Thursday and signed by Mr. Ukaegbu James and Mr. Nnanna Kalu.\n\nThey said they were convinced that with their track record, managerial skills, experience, and leadership acumen, both Kalu and Lawan had the competence to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari to drive the economy. James and Kalu were of the opinion that APC needed a unifier with deep knowledge of the country\u2019s multi-ethnic, lingual and religious settings.\n\nAyu Tackles APC over Outrageous Nomination Fee, Extends Sale, Submission of Forms to Accommodate Defectors\n\nPDP extended the sale of its nominations forms to Friday, to accommodate some APC defectors, like Senator Babba Kaita and his supporters. This was to enable them purchase any form of their choice for the 2023 general election.\n\nCommenting on the high price of the APC nomination forms, Ayu, in a statement by his media aide, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said, \u201cNigerians can all see what the APC is: a fragmented alliance put together to capture power and inflict maximum pain on Nigerians, including their own members.\u201d\n\nAyu urged Nigerians to recall how in 2014, President Muhammadu Buhari and leader of APC had told Nigerians then that he borrowed N27 million to buy his nomination form.\n\n\u201cThe same man, as leader of his party, has now sanctioned the sale of the same forms at N100 million! I am told that\u2019s an increase of 370 per cent,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nHe added, \u201cBut in 2014, the PDP was in power and the economy was still booming. The incompetent APC presidency has now run the economy aground, making Nigeria the \u2018Poverty Capital of the World.\u2019\n\n\u201cHow then can impoverished APC aspirants buy nominations at such prohibitively high costs? And yet, only recently he preached \u2018Equal Opportunity\u2019 to them.\u201d\n\nThe national chairman of PDP said, \u201cBy this latest insensitive action, the APC has disenfranchised thousands of her youths, and dashed the hopes of millions of Nigerian youths who applauded President Buhari when he signed the Not Too Young To Run Bill into law in 2018. It is most insensitive, and mind-boggling. In fact, all those buying the N100 million and N50 million nomination forms should be investigated for fraud.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed, \u201cWe, the PDP, are different. We are a mass movement for the Nigerian people. This is why our nomination fees are soft and democratic. When you compare us with the APC, the difference is clear. This is why we must return to power to save Nigerians from this insensitive government.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a former governor of Cross River State, Clement Ebri, condemned the high cost of forms for Expression of Interest and nomination for elective offices announced by the ruling party. Ebri said it vitiated the principles upon which APC campaigned and was voted into power.\n\nHe called on the NWC of the party to rethink the party\u2019s position on the matter.\n\nEbri, in a statement issued yesterday, said some people might have argued that the reason for the exorbitant cost of nomination forms was simply to prune the number of contenders, or to delineate the pretenders from the contenders, saying, \u201cThen I think that argument is flawed.\u201d\n\nThe former governor said true party men and women should be concerned that the party, which was founded on the values and ideals of progressive philosophy, would make pre-qualification for elective offices \u2013 at state and national level \u2013 the exclusive preserve of party members with either great personal wealth or that have unlimited access to other sources of funding.\n\nEbri added, \u201cWith reference to the recent announcement by the APC concerning the cost of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for various elective positions, the APC owes it to itself and the teeming numbers of Nigerians who voted it into power for two consecutive terms, to remain a party of true progressives and a true party of progressives.\n\n\u201cThe current party position on the cost of forms for Expression of Interest and Nomination for elective offices appears to vitiate the very principles upon which the party campaigned and was voted into power.\n\n\u201cThe danger this poses to the party is that many prospective and otherwise eminently qualified office seekers that do not possess enormous personal wealth will in every practical sense, be precluded from seeking party nomination, regardless of the depth and breadth of their popular support.\u201d\n\nEbri said there were ample objective and progressive criteria, such as integrity, experience, character, political antecedents, empathy, intelligence, goodwill, etc, which could be employed to enable the emergence of genuinely qualified candidates.\n\nHe said it was a known fact that personal wealth was not the yardstick of assessment that enabled Buhari to emerge as standard-bearer of the party in 2015 and 2019.\n\nThe party chieftain noted that a comparative analysis of the cost of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms in APC and that of the main opposition PDP showed that a member of APC with governorship aspiration would not only be spending more than twice what his/her counterparts in the opposition are, but would also be spending more to vie for governorship office than the opposition candidates vying for the office of president.\n\nEbri stressed that as laudable as the concession of 50 per cent reduction for youths might seem, it was worthy of note that the youth in the APC that were vying for governorship would still be paying more than their opposition counterparts.\n\nHe added that youths vying for the presidential ticket would be paying more than what the opposition presidential aspirants were paying for nomination. The party chieftain wondered if APC had inadvertently been made a party of the wealthy by the wealthy for the wealthy.\n\nMeanwhile, in an apparent move to accommodate defectors from APC, PDP extended the sale and submission of its nomination forms for the 2023 general election.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said, \u201cAfter a thorough consideration of various issues and concerns in the party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has further adjusted its Timetable and Schedule of Activities to extend the closing dates for the purchase of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for the 2023 general elections to Friday, April 22, 2022.\n\n\u201cUnder the reviewed timetable, the last day for the submission of already completed Forms has been extended to Monday, April 25, 2022\n\n\u201cConsequently, the following new dates have been fixed for the screening as well as Appeals arising from the screening of aspirants for various positions:\n\n\u201cState House of Assembly and National Assembly: Wednesday, April 27, 2022; Governorship: Thursday, April 28, 2022; Presidential: Friday, April 29, 2022. Appeals on all screening exercised: Monday, May 2, 2022.\n\n\u201cUnder the updated timetable, the three-man Ad Hoc Ward Congress has been fixed for Saturday, April 30, 2022 while the Local Government Area National Delegates Congresses will now hold on Thursday, May 5, 2022.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cAll dates for primary election into various positions remain the same. Please, note that all duly completed State Assembly Forms are to be submitted at the various states secretariat of the party.\n\n\u201cAll aspirants, critical stakeholders and party members should be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nOzekhome: Buhari, APC Corrupting Democracy\n\nOzekhome accused the president and the ruling party of debasing democracy in a statement yesterday titled, \u201cPresident Buhari and the APC are corrupting democracy.\u201d\n\nThe statement was in response to Wednesday\u2019s announcement by the ruling party fixing various high fees for its nomination forms, which had outraged many Nigerians.\n\nOzekhome stated, \u201cThe staggering sum of N100 million fixed by the APC NEC for its presidential nomination form has rightly sent shock waves of righteous indignation across the country. The APC had fixed N30 million for the \u2018expression of interest form\u2019 and N70 million for the \u2018nomination form\u2019, making a total of N100 million.\n\n\u201cThe party hopes to rake in N1.5 billion from the 15 aspirants that have so far declared interest in the presidential race. By this singular act, the APC has shown a shocking insatiable bacchanalian propensity to corrupt democracy, democratic ethos, and also scam the entire country.\n\n\u201cThe vulgarity of this exercise lies not just in the abominable fee prescribed, but more in the party\u2019s pretentious mantra of fighting corruption, using a well orchestrated and carefully oiled Hitler\u2019s Goebel\u2019s propagandist machinery of dubious pedigree. It is the more abhorrent when we realise that this is miles apart from (indeed more than double) the price fixed by the party\u2019s whipping child, the opposition PDP, which has fixed its at N40million (N5 million) for the expression of interest; and N35 million for the nomination form. The N100m is also over 100 per cent of the N40 million fixed by the same APC for the 2018, presidential nomination form.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammed Buhari and the APC have, by this singular act, exhibited a very odious and unpleasant example of how not to fight corruption. They have managed to convince Nigerians that politics is, indeed, the art of grand deception, double-dealing, duplicity, beguilement, sham and self-contradiction. They have justified the clich\u00e9 that diplomacy is the clever art of telling a person to go to hell in such a way that he actually eagerly looks forward to the journey.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",
          "summary": "Edu said the APC National Working Committee (NWC) had consciously fixed the rate as part of a mechanism to ensure only serious aspirants were on the ballot.\nShe stated, \u201cFor all we care, N1.5 million for a House of Assembly nomination form is fair to the general population.\nIn fact, all those buying the N100 million and N50 million nomination forms should be investigated for fraud.\u201dHe further stressed, \u201cWe, the PDP, are different.\nThe APC had fixed N30 million for the \u2018expression of interest form\u2019 and N70 million for the \u2018nomination form\u2019, making a total of N100 million.\nThe N100m is also over 100 per cent of the N40 million fixed by the same APC for the 2018, presidential nomination form.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Military Not Doing Enough to End Insecurity Despite Logistics Provided, Buhari Says",
          "text": "In a clear indictment, a disappointed President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, told the security agencies that they were not doing enough to end the security challenges in the country, despite enormous logistics provided by his administration.\n\nBuhari frowned on the fact that his previous directives to the military to end insecurity in the country had not yielded much results.\n\nHe directed all the operational and intelligence agencies to rescue unhurt, all persons kidnapped by terrorists, including those in the recent Kaduna-bound train.\n\nThat was as the the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, explained the basis for heavy security presence in the South-east, saying the police would no longer tolerate attacks on their men.\n\nNational Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), expressed the president\u2019s reservation while speaking with newsmen on Thursday after a three-and-a-half hour meeting of the National Security Council at the State House, Abuja, presided by Buhari.\n\nMonguno said there was no way the president would be happy, when people were being killed on a daily basis. He said the last straw was the recent attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, which led to the death of some passengers, with scores kidnapped.\n\nThe NSA added that the president was of the belief that enough was not being done by the security agencies, despite the logistics being provided.\n\nMonguno stated, \u201cWe\u2019ve just concluded a sitting of the National Security Council, a three-and-a-half hour meeting, which was presided over by the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. This meeting is the first for 2022 and the meeting deliberated on several issues, at the strategic and operational levels, as well as other issues that are broader.\n\n\u201cIn his opening remarks, he (Buhari) spoke about his sadness in respect of the recent developments in the country, the recent security challenges we\u2019ve had, in particular, the incident in which several Nigerians lost their lives and many more have been taken into captivity by criminals and bandits.\n\n\u201cIf ten times something happens, ten times (we) will be unhappy and as the leader of this country, the father of the nation, he has to express his displeasure. You know, he is just at the managerial level, he gives us instructions.\n\n\u201cAnd his displeasure is probably, because he feels enough is not being done. So, we can\u2019t put this thing on his shoulders completely. He\u2019s at the strategic level, he takes the decisions. But when these things become endless, he has to express concern. And that\u2019s just what he did.\n\n\u201cMr. President has directed all the operational and intelligence elements to rescue these innocent people immediately and unhurt. This is the basis, which other issues were discussed. Obviously, the Chief of Defense Staff, and the service chiefs, as well as the Inspector-General of Police, all briefed the President on the occurrences in their respective organisations.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed that the president alone could not be blamed for the insecurity in the country, saying his part is to make strategic decisions, which the NSA said he has been doing even though he said that the military has secured the nation\u2019s maritime domain.\n\nMonguno said, \u201cI submitted a memo to council and my recommendations are being looked into by the president. My recommendations are wide ranging and they touch on all aspects of security, starting with the level of security of our land borders, as well as within the country itself.\n\n\u201cIn terms of securing the nation, we\u2019ve recorded a lot of successes in the maritime domain and obviously, the problem now has shifted to our borders from outside. As a result of that, there\u2019s a need for us to configure how we\u2019re going to make our borders more secure because of the threats coming from outside the borders.\u201d\n\nMonguno said the surrendering of Boko Haram elements, especially in the North-east, had not engendered the desired result in stemming insurgency in the country, as the threat had shifted to the Northwest and North Central.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow, the issue in the North-east, there\u2019s been a lot of improvement and that has been attested to by the governor of Borno State during our last National Council of State meeting. But, nevertheless, the fact that the North-east is becoming much more stable, more and more people from the terrorists have started surrendering to government, has not really brought to an end the way we would want the situation in the country, because the threat is now shifted from the North-east, to the North-west and to the North-central, and this threat has to be contained.\n\n\u201cIt has to be contained collectively by both the armed forces as well as the constabulary forces: the Nigeria Police, Civil Defense, but the intelligence agencies also have been directed to enhance the acquisition of intelligence.\u201d\n\nThe NSA stressed the imperative of intelligence from ordinary citizens as he noted that unless the wider society was willing to provide the necessary intelligence, the problem of insecurity would linger beyond the time frame intended to end menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe present situation in the country calls for collective effort by all, not just those that have been charged with the responsibility of physically securing the country, the most important thing for now is acquisition of intelligence and the type of intelligence that is needed is human intelligence and I need to make it very clear.\n\n\u201cI have to be very honest; unless the wider society, right down to the local governments, are willing to give the type of information that is needed to block the activities of these criminals, this situation will continue to linger beyond whatever timeframe we\u2019re looking at, towards ending this great problem.\n\n\u201cA lot of lives are being lost, the president is not happy about this situation, he\u2019s made it very clear. The first assignment he\u2019s given to the security agencies, especially, the armed forces and the police is to rescue those that are in captivity, not just those that were captured during the last train incident, but those that have been in captivity in other parts of the country. That is the first thing that has to be done.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, my memo dwells on the prevailing situation within the security outfits; their needs, their challenges and the President has decided to look into these things and might as well call for another meeting in the near future.\u201d\n\nOn why the country had not deplored technology to tackle the menace of terrorism and banditry, Monguno said effort was being made to deploy technology to tackle insecurity but submitted that the required technology was expensive and would take time to acquire.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe first question has to do with, why is it so difficult to deploy technology. One, technology is expensive. Technology takes time to acquire these things, since inherently we do not produce these very, very delicate equipment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if the government is not making any effort to acquire but we need to know who to acquire this technology from, where, when and there are certain processes. For now, I know we have, but the plight is that they are inadequate, so, to the government, it\u2019s a continuous process. That\u2019s what I can say about the issue of deploying technology.\u201d\n\nOn alleged sabotage within the military in the fight against terrorism, Monguno said the possibility of having rogue elements could not be ruled out.\n\nAsked whether he would draw a correlation between the threats from the border and the level of insecurity in the country and whether there was any suggestion that foreigners might have been responsible for the insecurity in the country, he said, \u201cObviously, we have very extensive borders, and I\u2019m not going to deceive anyone.\n\n\u201cAll of us know that we have problems of infiltration by virtue of the fact that we have a very large economy. It attracts a lot of people from outside and they come in illegally, not just through the land borders, but also through the maritime waters.\n\n\u201cOf course, in the case of the maritime borders, most of things have been done in the last one year, to secure the maritime domain up to the point that the International Maritime Bureau has acknowledged the fact that in 27 years, our maritime borders have not been as secure and peaceful as they were in the last one year.\n\n\u201cThat is a fact; it\u2019s not a conjecture. I didn\u2019t cook up this thing. So, we want to see how we can replicate that type of efforts to put in the maritime domain on our land borders. That is something that counsel is looking into.\u201d\n\nThe IGP addressed the question of massive police presence in South-east. Baba said, \u201cI think the question is about deployment. Deployment is being determined by a lot of issues or yardsticks.\n\n\u201cJust like two states may have different number of local governments, so also there can be different number of formations in that state or in that formation. We have formations, we have commands, we have zonal commands and so forth. So, deployment should not be based on either size or number of persons or threat assessment tool in that place.\n\n\u201cIt is all about how you police a particular place based on the number of people you have, based also on your ability to gather that manpower. If your command, for instance, Kaduna command has, let\u2019s say 3000 personnel. For now, I know already that 3,000 personnel cannot take care of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWhat we normally do is to deploy from other states to come and complement the efforts of Kaduna by what we are calling, let\u2019s say, special duty. We can take from states, where we feel the threat is not as eminent or as bad as what they have in Kaduna, so that you can complement Kaduna. So, also you can complement Imo, Anambra. It\u2019s based on your threat analysis.\u201d\n\nTo that extent, Baba, has warned that the police high command would no longer tolerate incessant killing of police officers in the country especially, the South-east.\n\nHe condemned the recent spate of attacks on police officers, facilities and other police operational assets across the country.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters, consequently, ordered the immediate deployment of additional operational assets to complement officers and men attached to Operation Restore Peace in the South-east and other operations launched with the aim of flushing out criminal elements, who hide under the guise of aggrieved citizens to perpetrate criminal acts.\n\n\u201cThe IG warned that attacks on police officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under whatever guise as the force holds the lives of its personnel sacrosanct and such unwarranted attacks would be strictly treated in accordance with extant laws,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement also said the IG reiterated the commitment of the force to protection of lives and property, while stressing that it was vital to respect the lives and fundamental rights of police officers and other security operatives, in order to enable them advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",
