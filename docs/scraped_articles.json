          "text": "The Ondo State Government has said a total of 34 persons have died of Lassa fever in the state from January to date.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the state governor on Health, Prof. Francis Faduyile, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Akure on Sunday.\n\nFaduyile said the state recorded 227 confirmed cases in six Local Government Areas during the period.\n\nAccording to him, the local governments are Owo, Ose, Akure South, Akoko South-West, Akure North and Ondo West.\n\nFaduyile said there were three confirmed cases among health workers in the state.\n\n\u201cNone of the health workers died, because they reported early as a result of high index of suspicions and early presentations. They did well and recover quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the prevalent period of the disease was during the dry season, noting that \u201calthough there could still be one or two cases during the rainy season.\u201d\n\n\u201cOndo State, in the last epidemic, was the epicentre of Lassa fever in Nigeria, and the state government looked into the cause and ways to prevent the disease.\n\n\u201cThe first way to prevent Lassa is to stop bush burning, and we have sensitised against this. Besides, don\u2019t put your food where rats have access.\n\n\u201cThere is also \u2018deratification\u2019, that is to kill all the rats which the state government has done and was successful.\n\n\u201cThen we had an index of suspicion so that people can start testing for Lassa early.\n\n\u201cA lot of our health workers have been put on high awareness because those that are positive should have prompt treatment.\n\n\u201cOndo State government has also improved the Infectious Disease Hospital, Akure, to a standard that can take care of Lassa Fever.\n\n\u201cAlso, the Federal Medical Centre in Owo has an area that can treat Lassa. We have also seen that the sanitation of the area is important,\u201d he said.\n\nFaduyile, who explained that the state government was working on the refuse dump site in Owo, said a new dumpsite would be created, while more vehicles would be used to get refuse to the site.\n\nHe also said the area would be treated so that the rodents would not leave their habitats inside the forest for the city.\n\nFaduyile noted that the Lassa Fever cases in the state, in the last couple of weeks, had reduced drastically.\n\n(NAN)",

          "title": "Environmentalist laments declining vulture population",
          "text": ".\n\n\u2026says they are crucial to conservation\n\nBy Esther Onyegbula\n\nRenowned environment conservation and sustainability advocate, Mariam Alonge on Friday in Lagos said cultural beliefs and activities have critically endangered the population of vultures which is crucial to environmental conservation.\n\nMarian who is also the ambassador of the save the Vultures campaign, Nigerian Conservation Foundation spoke during her Book Reading titled: \u201dVultures To The Rescue\u201d, held at the American Corner, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nVultures To The Rescue (the clean crew) is a pictorial children\u2019s storybook that highlights the importance of vultures to our ecosystem and population.\n\nIt also tells stories of the misconceptions around vultures in Africa, especially in Nigeria and encourages children and youths to take action to protect their habitat.\n\nMariam said growing up vultures were birds that you see but as they became adults, across Africa, vulture populations have significantly declined by about 40 per cent over the last 50 years.\n\n\u201dThe main cause of this decline is believed to be indiscriminate poisoning, poaching and their use in traditional beliefs. Some years ago, you could see vultures hovering around the neighbourhood whenever there has been a party or near abattoirs. This is no longer happening.\n\n\u201dVultures play a huge role in the conservation of our environment. I found out that they help to keep the environment clean.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately over the years vultures have become critically endangered because of our cultural beliefs as Nigerians. We see them as evil omen, evil birds most people don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it, so they kill them, and others use them for ritual purposes. These activities combined have a critically endangered population of the vultures.\u201d\n\nMariam explained that the book is a deliberate effort to educate children as well as lend her voice to the save the vulture campaign. I am using my platform to advocate for the protection and conservation of vultures.\n\n\u201dI believe that if you want to change the mindset of people, change their way of thinking. And for a turnaround children must be carried along, adults will not be here forever. Educating the children will help us have well-informed children who grow into adults that make informed decisions for our environment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, the President, of United States Government Exchange Alumni in Nigeria, Mr. Mike Okwoche noted that the emphasis on the vulture is very crucial because a lot of young children have never seen the vulture and it is going extinct.\n\n\u201dVultures are very conservative to our environment especially when it comes to taking away all the crumbs, all the decaying carcasses we see in our environment on daily basis. It is a day to give regard to what the vulture does. and then see how we can create consciousness in young people to ensure that they get to know that the vulture is some animal that contributes to cleaning up our environment.\n\n\u201dif the vultures were around you won\u2019t need any conservationists, because the vultures know what to do. They are scavengers and they help to keep us safe and healthy by taking away all the things that would have caused us sickness and diseases.\n\n\u201cWhen people know better, they do better, we need to take environment conservation to the grassroots. We haven\u2019t made the conversation about our environment a grassroots conversation. Whenever environmental conservation is discussed, it is held outside the country. That in itself creates a division, that makes people think these are matters that affect a certain class of people, this is not our problem. Hence, we must start having environment conservation conversations with everyday people, just like we talk about politics and other issues. When we make it an everyday conversation. We need to spread the message using relatable information that children understand to educate and enlighten them.\u201d\n\nThe highlight of the event was the interactive session which allowed the children to ask questions and share their experiences.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari over the failure to unblock the phone lines of over 72 million telecommunication subscribers barred from making calls on their Subscriber Identity Modules, SIMs.\n\nThe suit followed the recent directive by the Federal Government to telecommunications companies to block outgoing calls on all unlinked lines, as the deadline for the verification expired on March 31.\n\nFollowing the directive, over 72 million subscribers have now been barred from making calls.\n\nIn the suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers, Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, at the Federal High Court in Lagos, the organization asked for; \u201can order setting aside the directive by President Buhari to telecommunications companies to block outgoing calls on all unlinked lines without due process of law, and for being inconsistent with the requirements of legality, necessity and proportionality.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as respondents are: Mr Abubakar Malami(SAN), Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and Mr. Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy.\n\nSERAP also demanded for \u201can order of perpetual injunction restraining President Buhari and the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami from unlawfully directing telecommunications companies to block outgoing calls on all unlinked lines, without due process and in violation of Nigerians\u2019 human rights.\u201d\n\nSERAP further sought \u201can order directing and compelling President Buhari to ensure adequate infrastructure and logistics to allow Nigerians including persons with disabilities, older persons, and persons living in remote areas, to capture their data and conclude registration to obtain National Identity Number (NIN).\u201d\n\nThe organization stressed that, \u201cdirecting and compelling the Federal Government to unblock the phone lines unlawfully barred would be entirely consistent with the Nigerian Constitution 1999 [as amended], and the country\u2019s international obligations to respect, protect, and promote socio-economic rights.\u201d\n\nSERAP also maintained that, \u201cWhere agencies of government are allowed to operate at large and at their whims and caprices in the guise of performing their statutory duties, the end result will be anarchy, and authoritarianism, leading to the loss of the much cherished and constitutionally guaranteed freedom and liberty.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cIt is in the interest of justice to grant this application.\n\n\u201cAccess to telecommunications services is a condition sine qua non for the effective exercise of human rights. Therefore, the decision to block people from making calls is discriminatory, and a travesty.\n\n\u201cThe blocking of phone lines of Nigerians without due process of law has disproportionately affected those on the margins of society.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in the discrimination of marginalized or vulnerable groups.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed read in part: \u201cWhile Nigerian authorities have a legal responsibility to protect, ensure and secure the rights to life and property, any such responsibility ought to be discharged in conformity with human rights standards.\n\n\u201cFundamental rights are regarded as part of human rights and are protected to enhance human dignity and liberty.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnblocking the phone lines unlawfully barred from making calls would improve respect for the rule of law, and ensure people\u2019s right to freedom of expression, and access to information, as well as their right to associate with others.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe blocking of people from making calls constitutes impermissible restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, information, and association.\n\n\u201cThe decision to block the phone lines also appears to be arbitrary, and lacks any legal framework, independent and judicial oversight.\n\n\u201cThis may allow authorities to act in an unfettered and potentially arbitrary or unlawful manner.\n\n\u201cUnder international human rights law, States including Nigeria \u2018shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\u2019\n\n\u201cStates must refrain from cutting off access to telecommunications services.\n\n\u201cMillions of Nigerians including persons with disabilities, elderly citizens, persons living in remote areas have been unable to capture their biometrics, and obtain their NINs due to logistical challenges, administrative and bureaucratic burdens, as well as the persistent collapse of the national grid.\n\n\u201cThe rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and freedom of association, whether offline or online, promote the democratic ideal by allowing citizens to voice their concerns, challenge governmental institutions, and hold the government accountable for its actions.\u201d",

The reason for the procurement of those aircraft according to the military was to aid the fight against insecurity in the northeast and other parts of the country witnessing unending security challenges.\n\nHe said from 2015 to 2022, the security budget was N969 billion, while the budget in 2022 is N2.41trn, which is a 148.7 per cent increase in seven years, adding that despite this budget and spending on security in Nigeria, many parts of the country are not safe because of bandits attack\n\nHe said in January to March 2022, Nigeria recorded a total of 2,968 deaths from violent killings and 1,484 abductions.\n\nHe said the North West region has the highest cases with a total of 1,103, North Central 784, North East 488, South East 181, South West 127 and South-South 85 killings.\n\nHe called on the federal government, and security agencies to beef up security around the 36 states and the FCT, adding that \u201d what is on ground, is not enough to convince Nigerians that they are safe in the hands of present security personnel.\u201d\n\nHe also, suggested that the military hierarchy tell the world the true position, their ability to secure this country, and if on the contrary, allow Nigerians to defend themselves",

          "text": "Stakeholders in the development sector have commended the Benue State House of Assembly for the attention they are giving to the Peace-Building Commission Bill.\n\nThe commendation was given during a peer review meeting of stakeholders in Makurdi, Benue State capital, on Friday.\n\nThe meeting, which had senior development and peacebuilding experts in attendance, was hosted and coordinated by Prof.Magdalyn Dura, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals, NEPAD and Development Cooperation.\n\nThe experts harped on the importance of the Peace-Building Commission Bill which became necessary due to the protracted crises in Benue State and the need for long-term peace structures that would nip future conflicts in the bud.\n\nDue to the incessant conflicts in the state, Governor Samuel Ortom had constituted a team led by Prof Dura who came up with the Peace-Building Commission Bill.\n\nProf. Dura in her comments revealed that the Bill which is already at the state assembly received its first reading on Wednesday and its second reading has already been scheduled for this week.\n\nShe said the committee has pushed for the bill to receive an accelerated hearing so that it can be signed into law by the Governor who is eagerly waiting for it.\n\nSpeaking Mr. Paul Nyulaku, the Country Director of International Alert, appreciated the progress made by the Peace Building Committee.\n\nHe reiterated that when the Bill is passed, stakeholders must meet to discuss key issues like the capacity of manpower and needs assessment of the commission.\n\nHe noted also that sensitization must also be taken to all communities, stressing that the capacity of personnel is key for such a Commission and as a result, capacity building for those in charge must begin in earnest. He pledged that International Alert would always support training and dialogue.\n\nMr. Chukwuma Ume, a National Expert with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said the Commission would have room to look into other conflict issues bedevilling the state. He requested that the committee get a structure to house the Commission.\n\nMr Ume was optimistic that the Commission would record success since stakeholders cut across various divides, noting that there are currently peacebuilding communities at the Local Government level but they do not have a link with those at the State level.\n\nHe said, however, that the Commission would be the needed link, promising to give high recommendations of Benue State to the UNDP and make strong recommendations on the need for humanitarian services in the state. This is as Benue has always been on the map in terms of peacebuilding and development initiatives.\n\nProf. Mrs Dura responded that a situation room is already in place, with GPS and motorbikes, waiting for the Bill to be passed. She added that although the Commission would be a Government institution, it would be granted autonomy in order to ensure only experts head it and it would also be able to source external funding. There would also be a \u2018basket fund\u2019 in place to ensure resources are always available.\n\nMr. Emmanuel Doughdough, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on micro/medium enterprises, insisted that the proposed commission must be vibrant in order not to kill itself. The Commission should also run certificate courses and programs on peacebuilding.\n\nOn recent Fulani attacks, members agreed that the recent crisis in Jato-Aka cries for a commission such as this. As a result, an implementation strategy is very important now so that once the Bill is passed, work can begin earnestly. With the Peace-Building Commission in place, sustainable peace and development will return to Benue State.\n\nThose in attendance amongst others were Prof. Mrs Magdalene Dura, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Sustainable Development Goals, NEPAD and Development Cooperation, Mr Paul Nyulaku, the Country Director for International Alert, Mr Chukwuma Ume, a National Expert with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Emmanuel Doughdough, the PSA to the Governor on micro/medium enterprises, Mr Iorliam Shija, the SSA to the Governor on Archives, Research and Documentation.",

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt; Eric Ikhilae, Abuja and David Adenuga Bauchi\n\nHayatu-Deen joins Tambuwal in rejecting decision\n\nAtiku: \u2018I\u2019m not part of consensus move\u2019\n\nElders\u2019 action not in North\u2019s best interest, say Northern PDP stakeholders\n\nWe \u2018re not involved in consensus talks \u2013 PDP\n\nDifferent interest groups in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have sparked a fresh row in the party over Friday\u2019s endorsement of former Senate President Bukola Saraki and Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed as North\u2019s consensus candidates in next month\u2019s primaries of the party by PDP Northern Elders and former military president Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nOne of the party\u2019s four presidential candidates that mooted the idea of consensus, Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, yesterday joined Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal in rejecting the elders\u2019 decision.\n\nLike Tambuwal, he vowed to forge ahead with his aspiration and test his popularity during the primaries.\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar said he had never been part of the consensus deal while former Jigawa State governor Sule Lamido told the elders off, saying their action was not in the best interest of the generality of Northerners whose cause they claimed to be fighting.\n\nThe Hayatu-Deen Campaign Organisation declared that the process of arriving at a consensus candidate had collapsed in the first place and branded the Professor Ango Abdullahi committee that handled the process as \u2018completely faceless\u2019 and its evaluation criteria \u201ctotally subjective.\u201d\n\nThe Director General of the campaign organisation, Lamis Shehu Dikko, said in a statement that Alhaji Hayatu-Deen had decided that his campaign \u201cwill now be undertaken independently to maintain the sanctity and integrity of the Peoples Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cFor the record, we would like to state that the process of arriving at a consensus candidate had collapsed. The candidates involved could not reach a compromise amongst themselves, resulting in the decision of our principal, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, and Governor Aminu Tambuwal to discontinue the process.\n\n\u201cThe announcement we witnessed yesterday (Friday) was not based on the principles of equity and transparency, which we believe should lead the country and the party into the future.\n\n\u201cThe committee constituted by Prof. Ango Abdullahi is completely faceless and the evaluation criteria are totally subjective.\n\n\u201cIt seems to us that this entire charade was designed to achieve a preconceived outcome.\n\n\u201cThe focus of our candidate, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, is to prove to our great party and Nigerians in general that he is the best man for the job as we proceed towards a truly democratic process at the PDP primaries.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the lack of consensus amongst the Prof. Ango Abdullahi-led effort and the politicking of other candidates should not jeopardise the electoral success of the Peoples Democratic Party or threaten the peace and prosperity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMohammed Hayatu-Deen is a business professional with years of experience leading successful organisations that have provided jobs and opportunities for millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cHe is a man who understands the pains and sufferings of the average Nigerian and has a plan to return our great nation to prosperity.\n\n\u201cMohammed Hayatu-Deen wants to build a Nigeria that works for everybody. He is the best candidate for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nWhy endorsement can\u2019t hold \u2013 Tambuwal\n\nMoments after Prof Abdullahi announced the endorsement of Saraki and Bala Mohammed on Friday, the Tambuwal Campaign Organisation pronounced it dead on arrival as all the four aspirants involved in promoting consensus had agreed 48 hours before the Minna announcement that their plan had hit the rocks.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday, 20th April, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting and unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\n\u201cThe team further agreed that Sen. Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything.\n\n\u201cThe proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm of the same day was aborted unilaterally by Sen. Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Thursday, April 21st, 2022, same Sen. Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday. Gov. Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason Gov. Tambuwal was absent at today\u2019s (Friday) meeting in Minna. As a result, therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Gov. Tambuwal, who had earlier on informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not consensus candidates.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Gov Tambuwal has submitted his presidential nomination forms and now that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four has clearly collapsed, will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primary.\n\n\u201cThis is in consonance with his acclaimed outlook as a pan-Nigerian candidate, with pedigree of national service as the Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, life member of the Body of Benchers and now in his second and final term as Governor of Sokoto State.\u201d\n\nArewa group knocks Tambuwal\n\nHowever, the Northern Democratic Defense League (NDDL) yesterday faulted Tambuwal\u2019s action.\n\nThe group in a statement signed by its Coordinator, Auwal Liti Darazo, claimed that only a few hours before the Minna announcement, Tambuwal had been quoted in many national dailies as commending consensus as a good thing, healthy for the party, and saying \u201cI\u2019m thinking that the consensus will favour me.\u201d\n\nThe group said the Northern Elders were right to come to the conclusion that the North East and North Central should be given a chance this time around because the North West has been having it good since the inception of the Fourth Republic.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe simple fact that the elders have so patriotically submitted that other zones which have not had the opportunity should be considered this time around, speaks volumes about their integrity, selflessness, patriotic love for the North and for country.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore contradictory that Tambuwal who claims the ability to unite the whole country should also be the one fuming over an exercise in inclusivity that tilts towards zones that have previously been deprived of such opportunities.\u201d\n\nAtiku: \u2018I\u2019ve never been part of this consensus\u2019\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar said he was not bound by the decision of the Ango Abdullahi committee as he was never part of the consensus deal.\n\nThe Technical Committee for the Actualisation of Atiku Abubakar\u2019s Presidency said in a statement that it owed it a duty to officially distance Atiku from the exercise after being \u201cinundated with several calls and text messages from concerned party members\u201d.\n\nSpokesman for the group, Dr.Raymond Dokpesi, said: \u201cIt must be stated categorically and equivocally that Waziri Atiku Abubakar MA, GCON Vice President Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999-2007, was NEVER a part of this purported consensus arrangement, neither did he at any time nor in any place subject himself to any purported consensus process.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Waziri Atiku Abubakar is NOT BOUND by any of the recommendations and conclusions of the purported report.\n\n\u201cAs an avowed nationalist, Waziri Atiku Abubakar strongly believes that Nigeria has never been as divided as it is today. He strongly believes that any \u2018consensus\u2019 arrangement premised on any regional, zonal, ethno-religious, and/or sectional gang-up will further deepen and widen this divide, and worsen the wounds that urgently need to be healed.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Vice-President Atiku Abubakar is anxious to implement plans, policies and programmes that will rescue and rebuild Nigeria. This is his unwavering and resolute pledge and commitment.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not involved in consensus talks \u2013 PDP\n\nSimilarly, the leadership of the PDP has distanced itself from the controversial consensus arrangement.\n\nThe party said it was not involved in the talks in the first place and the entire arrangement was initiated by the aspirants themselves.\n\n\u201cThe party leadership is not part of the consensus arrangement even though they were not against it, a source told The Nation in Abuja.\n\n\u201cOf course the party would have loved to have a situation where the 17 aspirants themselves are able to prune their number.\n\n\u201cBut the party has no say in the matter and would be ready to work with whatever the aspirants agree upon. And if at the end of the day all the 17 aspirants want to contest at the primaries, so be it,\u201d another party source told our correspondent yesterday.\n\nWhen our correspondent called to get the reaction from the spokesman for the PDP, Debo Ologunagba, he promised to call back. But he had yet to call as of the time of filing this report.\n\nThere are 17 aspirants in the race for the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nOn the list are Bukola Saraki, Aminu Tambuwal, Atiku Abubakar, Pius Anyim, Peter Obi, Sam Ohuabunwa, Dele Momodu, Bala Mohammed and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen.\n\nOthers are Nyesom Wike, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, Udom Emmanuel, Ayo Fayose, Cosmos Ndukwe, Charles Ugwu, Chikwendu Kalu and Tariele Diana Oliver (the only female among the aspirants).\n\nYou got it wrong, Lamido slams Northern Elders\n\nAlso reacting to the development yesterday, the immediate past governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Sule Lamido, said the Minna deal was nothing more than the \u201cpersonal opinion of those who issued the statement.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cHaving widely consulted party leaders across the 19 northern states and FCT, it is hereby stated to our teeming party members and the general public that what is reported in the media is only the personal opinion of those who issued the statement and not the position of the PDP members in the north.\n\n\u201cDiscussions are ongoing with all the aspirants in our party with a view to having a consensus if possible or at least working towards having a smooth, acrimony-free national convention.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe position of the Northern Elders is not only injurious to the North but equally injurious to the northern aspirants!\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t endorse us, others will, Bala replies Lamido\n\nIn a swift response last night to the statement by Alhaji Sule Lamido, Governor Bala Mohammed said it did not matter if Lamido opted not to support the consensus arrangement.\n\nAddressing journalists at the Bauchi Government House shortly after receiving the management of The Sun newspapers who paid him a courtesy call, he said the elder statesman was entitled to his opinion.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019ve tremendous respect for Alhaji Sule Lamido, a former governor who is leading other former governors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pity if he was not consulted, but certainly, he is not the only person in northern Nigeria, and those that have been contacted have done the job on his behalf. But he is entitled to his opinion.\n\n\u201cEven if he does not endorse us, others will endorse us.\n\n\u201cOf course, we are not taking it that we have been adjudged the best, but we are calling on others who didn\u2019t make it in the consensus to come and join hands with us and our southern compatriots so that we\u2019ll do the primaries with minimum rancour.\u201d\n\nAfenifere knocks Northern Elders over consensus candidate\n\nThe Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, similarly criticised the PDP Northern Elders for their action which it said exposed the quagmire of conscience they found themselves in the critical question of moving Nigeria forward.\n\nIt said the overriding interests of the continued corporate existence of Nigeria required more reflective statesmanship.\n\nSecretary General of Afenifere, Sola Ebiseni, in a statement in Akure said that the Elders inconsistently set aside all their vaunted factors in preference for equity.\n\nEbiseni said: \u201cIn their sermons they settled for aspirants from the North Central and North East against that of the North West only on the ground of adjudged equity that the zone had produced presidential candidates and presidents.\n\n\u201cThey are deliberately oblivious of the indubitable history of Nigeria that the first executive ruler of Nigeria, Prime Minister Tafawa Balewa, August 1957-January 1966, was from the North East and specifically Bauchi State and that most of the Military Heads of the Nigerian State were of the North Central origin.\n\n\u201cIt beats the imagination that the northern elders would fervently seek to execute their northern agenda in the PDP which controls only five of its 19 states. The nation waits in the wings to see the outcome of this gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cThe resolves of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum that the next President of Nigeria, after Buhari\u2019s eight years full term, should be a person of Southern Nigeria origin, in the interest of equity, national sense of belonging and cohesion is the national consensus. No group or section is greater than Nigeria and the compelling interest of its corporate existence.\u201d\n\nBala may withdraw for Saraki\n\nIndications emerged yesterday that the Bauchi Governor may withdraw from the race and support Saraki for the ticket.\n\nA source close to the consensus group confided in The Nation that Mohammed was being persuaded to back down and seek re-election as Bauchi governor.\n\nAccording to the source who did not want to be named, those persuading the governor were of the view that it would be easier for him to win re-election in Bauchi than winning the presidential ticket.\n\nThe party source said: \u201cYes, some stakeholders, including some elders are discussing with the Bauchi governor to pull out of the presidential race and face his governorship re-election.\n\n\u201cThe elders have reasoned that a bird in hand is worth a thousand in the bush. More so, the elders are being made to understand that the Bauchi people have been mounting pressure on their governor to seek re-election to enable him complete the good work he has started in the state.\u201d\n\nThe source however, said the governor was yet to make up his mind on whether or not to drop his presidential bid for a second tenure as Bauchi governor.\n\nGovernor Mohammed, who was elected in 2019 on the platform of the PDP, is currently serving his first tenure in office.\n\nConstitutionally, he is eligible to seek re-election in 2023.\n\nHowever, the timeline for the submission of nomination forms for all elective positions expired last Friday.\n\nIt was gathered that only one aspirant had obtained the governorship nomination form for Bauchi as at the close of nomination.\n\nThe lone aspirant, Ahmadu Ahmed Mu\u2019azu, is the first son of an ex governor of Bauchi State, Alhaji Adamu Mu\u2019azu.\n\nThe PDP Northern Elders in their assessment of the four aspirants had awarded 10 marks each to Saraki and Governor Mohammed.\n\nThe two other contenders in the group; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal and a former banker, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, were awarded seven and five marks respectively.\n\nAn insider account said in arriving at the decision, the committee considered PDP presidential nomination process since 1999.\n\nThe elders were said to have isolated the cumulative 13 years of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo and Dr. Goodluck Jonathan as president from 1999 to 2015 on the platform of the PDP.\n\nIn between the 13 years, the late Umaru Yar\u2019 Adua was elected in 2007 before he died in office in 2010.\n\nYar\u2019 Adua hailed from Katsina State, in the Northwest zone. Tambuwal is also from the Northwest.\n\nThe elders were said to have observed that the Northeast and the North Central have not occupied the presidency since 1999.\n\nThey also observed that the Northeast had taken a shot at the in 1999 on the platform of the PDP with Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as flag bearer.\n\nBauchi State, where Bala Mohammed comes from, is also in the Northeast.\n\nThat leaves the North Central as the only zone among the three zones in the North that has never had the opportunity of taking a shot at the presidency.\n\nKwara State, where Saraki comes from, is in the North Central. This, insiders said, apparently formed the basis of the outcome of NEF\u2019s assessment.\n\nPDP risks extinction if it fails to win presidential poll, Wike tells Anamabra delegates\n\nAlso yesterday, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike said the PDP risked going into extinction should it fail to present an electable candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nWike, who is a PDP presidential aspirant, said winning the 2023 general election was crucial to the survival of the party.\n\nHe said he remained the most electable aspirant capable of defeating the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe governor in a statement by his Special Assistant, Media, Kelvin Ebiri, spoke while wooing Anambra State PDP leaders and delegates to support his presidential ambition in Awka, the capital of Anambra State on Saturday.\n\nHe told the delegates that as a mark of honour, he had to personally visit Awka to formally notify them of his ambition to become the next President.\n\nHe said: \u201cI didn\u2019t send anybody to you, because I have respect for you. We have been in opposition since 2015 and if we don\u2019t win this election in 2023, we can as well forget PDP. And so, everything must be done to win this election.\n\n\u201cNo sentiment should be brought in. And of all the aspirants, whether the person is from Anambra, Sokoto, Imo, look at all of us. Who can withstand APC in this election? It is me.\u201d\n\nPDP NEC meeting holds May 4\n\nThe National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been scheduled for Wednesday, May 4, 2022.\n\nA statement issued on Sunday by the National Secretary of the PDP, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, said the meeting will hold at the PDP national secretariat by 2pm.\n\nAlthough Anyanwu did not state the agenda, sources said the meeting may deliberate on the report of the 27-member Zoning Committee set up by the NEC in March.\n\nThe committee, chaired by Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, had submitted its report to the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP.\n\nThe NWC is expected to submit the report to NEC at the meeting. Controversy had trailed leaked information suggesting that the committee had thrown the race for the PDP presidential ticket open to all contestants.\n\nThere is a sharp division among party stakeholders in the North and South over which region should produce the presidential candidate for the 2023 election.\n\nThe contest for the ticket had led to strong verbal exchange among some of the 17 aspirants and stakeholders in their respective regions over which region should fly the presidential flag.\n\nThe party has fixed its presidential primaries for May 28-29.",

          "text": "Alaafin dreamt of his death two weeks ago, says aide\n\nGet real time updates directly on you device, subscribe now.\n\nBy Toba Adedeji, Osogbo; Yinka Adeniran; Segun Showunmi, Ibadan and Samuel Oamen\n\nThe Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi, joined his ancestors on Friday night only about two weeks after dreaming that his own late father told him that he was due for the final home call.\n\nA female palace aide told reporters yesterday in Oyo that Oba Adeyemi personally told some of his aides about the dream.\n\nThe Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, separately told of his last encounter with Oba Adeyemi only last week while the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, recalled how the deceased sought to reconcile some feuding Yoruba politicians in Ibadan recently.\n\nBut he regretted that the Alaafin could not fulfill his promise to \u201cmake his first visit to me\u201d before death came calling.\n\nA son of the late traditional ruler, Prince Akeem Adeyemi, said his father was able to reconcile with almost everybody he had differences with before his death.\n\nThe palace aide, who did not disclose her name, said: \u201cBaba (Alaafin) told some of us about two weeks ago about a dream he had of his father telling him that his time was up and should come over to the other side.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cMy father has gone to be with his forefathers. Atanda (Alaafin) has gone to dwell with his forefathers. He is not dead.\u201d\n\nAn Oyo son, Adekunle Wakili, said in a separate interview at the palace yesterday that the late Alaafin, while responding to compliments by a prominent Islamic preacher, had said that every man must taste death.\n\nThe Islamic preacher had hailed the late Adeyemi in Yoruba as \u201como Iku ti Iku o gbodo pa; omo arun ti arun ogbodo se\u201d, meaning the son of Death who Death must not kill; the son of Sickness that Sickness must not touch.\u201d\n\nI visited him a week ago \u2014 Oluwo\n\nThe Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, said he visited the late Alaafin in Oyo only a week ago after feeling drawn to him.\n\nHe said: \u201cAlaafin was a worthy father. The rich and truthful pictures of Oba Adeyemi always endeared liberal minds to him.\n\n\u201cDuring the last moment, we had a long talk about traditions. We had jolly talks as usual at our last meeting.\n\n\u201cI told him that I had things in common with him and he was the pillar God used in keeping the traditional institution.\n\n\u201cI enjoyed many things about the Alaafin, and I told him that he represented true traditional institution, always telling the truth and standing by it.\n\n\u201cI said that he was mentally rich and that caused our relationship to be strong. I prayed for him.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi\u2019s vacuum is most likely irreplaceable. His death is no doubt the end of an era. He was a force and a true, responsible father to the Yoruba nation.\n\n\u201cEven at death, I will continue to adore him by promoting his achievements.\u201d\n\nAlaafin\u2019s unfulfilled promise to me \u2014 Ooni\n\nThe Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, said the Alaafin, toward the end of his earthly sojourn, met behind closed doors with some feuding top Yoruba politicians in Ibadan with a view to settling their differences.\n\nHe said that unfortunately, death prevented the Alaafin from fulfilling his promise to pay a visit to the Ooni Palace.\n\nOba Ogunwusi, in a statement through his Director of Media & Public Affairs, Otunba Moses Olafare, described the deceased as \u201ca great icon, a great monarch who saw Oyo through civilization and modern development without jettisoning the cultural sacredness of the throne first occupied by Alaafin Oranmiyan The Great.\n\n\u201cIle Oodua Palace and the Ooni had a great working relationship with the late Alaafin who gave his best in resolving major conflicts in Yoruba land and uniting all sons and daughters of Oduduwa globally among other landmark achievements.\n\n\u201cThe late Alaafin is one of the privileged elders who contributed to the growth of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and also saw the country through military and democratic eras with unquantifiable positive inputs.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to the Yoruba to pray for the deceased\u2019s family and Oyo indigenes at this trying time, adding: \u201cMay the Almighty Olodumare (God) also be with the Oyomesi at this critical time that may challenge the culture and traditions of their ancestors in the process of burial rites and the process of selecting the next Alaafin.\n\n\u201cThe position of Alaafin is too culturally important to be handled in a way that undermines our collective traditions and culture.

He came from the Alowolodu Royal House and was a member of the House of Oranmiyan.\n\nHis father, Raji Adeniran Adeyemi, became the Alaafin in 1945 but was deposed and exiled in 1954, 10 years after, for sympathising with the National Council of Nigerian Citizens (NCNC).\n\nLamidi Adeyemi was chosen by the kingmakers on November 18, 1970, and then moved into the palace after completing the necessary rites under the tutelage of the Oyomesi.\n\nOba Adeyemi succeeded Alaafin Gbadegesin Ladigbolu II in 1970.",

          "text": "By Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nIt was indeed shocking to many people that the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, could join his ancestors without giving them a notice. They had thought the first-class monarch would still live for many years.\n\nOne of the things that marked out Oba Adeyemi from other traditional rulers in Yorubaland is the panegyrics that were usually recited in his favour. The praise singers would say: \u2018Iku de o\u2019 (Death has come). \u2018Omo iku ti iku o gbodo pa\u2019 (A child of death that death cannot kill). \u2018Omo ofo ti ofo o gbodo se\u2019 (The child of losses that can never suffer losses). Omo adanu ti adanu ko gbodo se\u2019 (The child of destruction that cannot be destroyed).\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nBut death brushed aside the panegyrics late in the evening of Friday April 22, and laid its fangs on the monarch and took him away to the great world beyond to join his ancestors.\n\nSunday Sun checks revealed that Oba Adeyemi III was effectively in charge of Oyo Kingdom during his reign that lasted for about 52 years. But for death he would have turned 84 years in less than six months.\n\nPolitical influence\n\nEvery politician of note in Nigeria at one time or the other had visited Alaafin in Oyo to solicit his support to fulfil their ambitions. They knew that he was highly influential. The majority of his people in Oyo town would not dare to disobey his command on the direction that they should go on any particular issue.\n\nThe majority of those that have become president of Nigeria had visited the palace to seek the support of the departed monarch at one time or the other.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nIt was disclosed that there are some chiefs in Oyo Kingdom that were always ready to carry out to the letter directives from Alaafin, either social or political.\n\nPresently, his son, Prince Akeem Adeyemi, is a member of House of Representatives, representing Oyo federal constituency. Currently, he is seeking to return to the Green Chambers in Abuja from 2023 for a record third term.\n\nThe people of Oyo State would not even forget how Oba Adeyemi and some other notable leaders in the state, prevented a former governor of the state, Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala, from re-election in 2011.\n\nAlao-Akala, who also died earlier this year, had dabbled into the traditional institution in the state. Prior to the intervention, Alaafin was the permanent chairman of Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs.\n\nBut Alao-Akala reviewed the headship of the council, and concluded that the chairmanship of the council should be rotated among three paramount rulers in the state. They are Alaafin himself, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, and the Soun of Ogbomosoland. Alaafin opposed the review vehemently.\n\nAt a time, it was alleged that Alao-Akala said a sitting governor has enormous powers to the extent that he can dethrone any king. This reportedly got to Alaafin who resolved that he would not allow dethronement to be a family cause for the Adeyemis, because his father, Oba Adeniran Adeyemi II, was also dethroned by the government of the defunct Western Region under the leadership of Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\nOba Adeyemi III was quoted to have said he would commit suicide if Alao-Akala was re-elected as governor in 2011 because he would have used the instrumentality of office to deal with him.\n\nThe late monarch, however, confirmed this during the last Ramadan lecture organised by the administration of a former governor of the state, the late Senator Abiola Ajimobi, at the Government House Arcade, Agodi, Ibadan in 2018.\n\nHe said that three personalities, including himself actually took it upon themselves that Alao-Akala would not be re-elected.\n\nHe mentioned the late Aare Musulumi of Yorubaland, Alhaji Arisekola Alao, and an Islamic cleric, Sheikh Muideen Bello as the trio.\n\nBut nobody can remove the fact that Oba Adeyemi was very social. He would attend functions in traditional special \u2018Aso Ofi\u2019 and at times in \u2018Damask\u2019 that were well ironed and starched. He was an orator, both in Yoruba and English. He was also an excellent writer.\n\nOba Adeyemi had many wives during his lifetime, many of who belong to the younger generations. One common feature of all his younger wives are that they are all fair in complexion and beautiful.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSome of the people that spoke with Sunday Sun in the palace stated that the late Alaafin took after his father, Oba Adeniran Adeyemj II, who they said had about 200 wives. But he could not surpass the record of his father because he did not have up to 200 wives. He was said to have got married to a new wife some weeks ago.\n\nHow he was feared by mighty and lowly people\n\nOba Adeyemi III was greatly feared by the mighty and lowly people during his lifetime. The fear started before he ascended the throne of his forefathers in the early 1970s.\n\nThe people that opposed his appointment as 45th Alaafin of Oyo then feared that he might be spiritually ruthless like his father, Oba Adeniran Adeyemi II, who was dethroned and banished to exile by the government.\n\nHis father was accused of being spiritually responsible for the death of a young prominent lawyer and politician, Chief Bode Thomas, who died barking like a dog.\n\nThe Alaafin Adeyemi II allegedly commanded him to bark like dog because of an alleged disrespect for the monarch. But no law could actually prove the metaphysical power linked to Adeyemi II.\n\nBased on the fear, another candidate was raised to become the 45th Alaafin. As gathered, he did not have the financial muscles of those that opposed him, and he sought the assistance of a business tycoon known as Ashamu for sponsorship. They approached the then Ooni of Ife, Oba Adesoji Aderemi, and the then Commissioner for Local Government in the then Western Region of Nigeria, Dr. Omololu Olunloyo, who later became governor of old Oyo State in 1983.\n\nAs gathered, it was Olunloyo that helped Alaafin to convince Colonel Adeyinka Adebayo, the then military governor of the region. He was appointed and was crowned about 52 years ago.\n\nIn the political cycle, the fear of Alaafin was the beginning of wisdom.\n\nInvestigations revealed that since the return of democratic governance in Nigeria in 1999, the former governor of Oyo State from 2011 to 2019, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, and the incumbent Governor Seyi Makinde have been the only ones that did not incur the wrath of the monarch.\n\nAlhaji Lam Adesina, who governed the state from 1999 to 2003, had a crush with Alaafin, as well as his successor, Senator Rashidi Ladoja.\n\nThe governor of the state from 2007 to 2011, Adebayo Alao-Akala, also had a fight with Alaafin.\n\nBut none of the three governors that fought with Alaafin returned to power for the second term.\n\nBut Senator Ajimobi, managed his relationship with Alaafin very well and he enjoyed the support of the monarch, which contributed to his electoral victory for second term in office in 2015.\n\nIt was also believed that he had the power of life and death. He was not an ordinary king and his words were usually backed up by the spiritual powers that be for them to come to reality.\n\nThe monarch was born on October 15, 1938, into the Alowolodu Royal House, and as a member of the House of Oranmiyan to Raji Adeniran Adeyemi, who was born 1871, and later became Alaafin in 1945, and Ibironke of Epo-Gingin, who died when he was young.\n\nHis paternal grandfather, according to historians, was Alaafin Adeyemi I Alowolodu, who ruled during the Kiriji War, and was the last independent ruler of the Oyo Empire before British colonialism.\n\nAlaafin, a lover of boxing, was a boxer before ascending the throne of his forefathers, succeeded Alaafin Gbadegesin Ladigbolu II in 1970, during the governorship of Colonel Robert Adeyinka Adebayo, on November 18, 1970.",

          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nNational leader of Ijaw Monitoring Group (IMG), Comrade Joseph Evah is a bold and fearless personality who never dodges any question from any reporter.\n\nHe says things the way he feels about them no matter whose ox is gored.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nIn this encounter with Sunday Sun in Lagos, Evah spoke about the calls for President Muhammadu Buhari to conduct national census, the greatest challenges before the Southeast presidential aspirants, the perceived enemity between Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and his political god-father Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and the danger of not letting the presidency berth in the South in 2023, among other crucial issues. Excerpt;\n\nHow will you react to the calls for President Muhammadu Buhari to conduct national census?\n\nI am shocked that people are coming and calling on President Buhari for census, they want census to be conducted. I watched it on NTA network news and from some other news medium. In fact, I was so angry about it. How can we be talking about census when people are in the forests kidnapped, people are dying in the forests, our mothers are crying and still some people are comfortable coming to Buhari to urge him to conduct census. It is another show of shame. I even expect the president to tell his ADC to prepare cane and flog all those people coming around him to meet him for census. They do not wish him well. How can we be talking about census now when our young women, girls, men and over 100 persons from the Abuja/Kaduna train kidnap attack are still in the custody of bandits? We must know the demons that were used in building Aso Rock because what is happening there is getting all of us dumb-founded, the more you watch, the more you look, the less you see, the more you wonder what is happening. No matter the importance of census, should it be at this time? Is now not ill-timed? Our women and children are suffering in the forest kidnapped and the same Northerners who are heading the Census Commission are coming to talk about census. Can\u2019t the Northern people reprimand or even find a way to flog those idiot people going to Aso Rock, calling for census? Now, if you do the census will you go into the forests to count the bandits and all those they are holding hostage in the forest? Will it even be easy to conduct election in the North in 2023 with what we are witnessing? Ordinary INEC registration, I think in Imo State recently, the place was invaded and some people lost their lives. So where is really safe for census to be conducted? Ask yourself which place is safe in the country today? At a time that we have such a crowd and a number of Nigerians held inside the forests some people still have the guts to talk about census; that\u2019s terrible. Shame to them. You want to allocate billions of Naira to census and share money when the country is at war with itself. We need to do first thing first, arrest the state of insecurity that abound, create a peaceful and conducive atmosphere, put hope back in people, and after that other things will begin to fall in line naturally. Those people calling for census now, if you ask me, should be identified, assembled and properly flogged. For now, you pay attention to priority area first and that should be to ensure we tackle insecurity head-on and see that Nigerians can move about, travel to their destinations through the roads, train, air, go to their farms etc without fear of being killed. Our women, our young girls are being raped, they are suffering in the forest and you are here calling for census, haba, are these people in government not human beings? Are they insensitive that they have lost their humanness?\n\nThere have been different presidential declarations of aspirants from different political zones, in the Southwest, Southeast etc. What has been your observation on the development?\n\nWell, we want to see people who are serious, people who are putting their houses in order. This is because some people are declaring so as to go for settlement later. One of the assignments I want to give people from the East is that this time we expect them to come out in full commitment for the race so that other people can reason with them, but sadly, the type of insecurity news coming out from the Southeast, especially the case of sit-at-home is destroying their economy. Why should they succumb to such self-destruction? It is disheartening. The only state in Nigeria, the only zone that deals strictly on business, it is in their DNA, it is in their blood is the Southeast, but schools are closed, the economy is dying what are the presidential aspirants from the Southeast doing about this? I repeat, schools are not going on, the economy is dying, so what are the Igbo Presidential aspirants from the Southeast doing about this? I expected the presidential aspirants from that area to be sitting down with the IPOB leaders, Mazi Kanu boys (Nnamdi Kanu) and any of those other groups and be discussing on what should be done, discussing on the way forward. The most significant symbol of the Igbo man is in industry, now industry is being killed in their own land. So, what are the presidential aspirants really doing? The Igbo are flourishing outside of the Igbo land, so why should they be destroying their home land? I found the entire thing funny or is it strange? Ndigbo must put their house in order; nobody will do it for them. The Igbo relies so much on industrialisation, on manufacturing, on buying and selling, on solid trade, on business, so why are they doing what they are doing? They need to caution themselves and do the right thing because others are watching them and perhaps, some wanting them to fail so as to have an excuse. There must be a think-tank in Igbo land that must genuinely point the way forward for their people. Igbo people have businesses in all parts of the world, so why are they destroying their businesses? Calling for sit-at-home every Monday, watching the spate of insecurity increase alarmingly in the region? Why are they watching and allowing their region to be destroyed? I had expected them to be wiser.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe excuse some give is that what is being witnessed in the Southeast zone, the destruction, the rising insecurity is orchestrated from outside Igbo land, the unknown gun men and all of that?\n\nCan anybody, can any serious mind take such excuse seriously? You cannot come to my home land and cause trouble and escape freely without our people getting you down, without them catching you, exposing who you are, it is not possible. If I say that unknown people are coming to my place and destroying my land and we cannot fish them out, people will laugh at me. You can\u2019t come to my place from the outside to cause trouble, to maim and kill people and you think you can go free with your head on your neck. What is the internal security in my place doing? Where are our men? Where are our boys? Where will they be for you to come in and kill my people and they will not apprehend you? Those unknown gun men as you chose to call them are not spirits or are they?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nYes, they are not spirits?\n\nSo far they are not spirits they can be apprehended? What are their local, community security groups doing? What is the Eastern Security Network (ESN) doing? It is the reason the Southwest created Amotekun. What it means is that ESN is not flourishing like Amotekun. We have been shouting: when will the Southeast Security Network take off, nobody answers. We want them to make the Southeast Security Network to flourish.\n\nThey need to go back to the drawing board. Let all the governors of the Southeast ensure they make their security network to flourish like the case of Amotekun. The security of life and property should be uppermost in the agenda, I do not want to buy the excuse of outsiders coming to Igbo land, outsiders cannot come to Igbo land to destroy the place and the people are watching it like a drama and refused to do nothing. Outsiders cannot come to my family to destabilise my family and I will fold hands and watch; no, it cannot happen, we must apprehend the person, we must get the person down and deal with the person or persons, so that others contemplating such evil motive will know that the place is a no-go-area because you are not likely going to go back alive. If I tell somebody that an outsider is coming to destroy my place they will laugh at me, yes, they will laugh at me. You should not tolerate an outsider that has come to destroy you. The people must unite and fight that common enemy. Look, let me tell you the truth: Some of the aspirants (presidential aspirants) from the Southeast are just roaming about. They should go home and put their base in order if they should be taken seriously and if they know they have leadership capacity. We commend them for their efforts to fight for Mazi Kanu, that is one way forward, but the economy of their region (Southeast) is being destroyed and they must rise up to the challenge, ensure they arrest the situation. It is the first thing they need to do. The Igbo are known for their industry, their entrepreneurship, business etc, they must identify with it, it\u2019s their symbol, and ensure nobody destroys it for them, either within their home or from the outside. Eyes are on them, so they must not fail the test, they must do the needful, put their home in order, and create an environment that will stimulate business. They should put their home in order and come out with the best of their candidates let us see whether they mean business to contest the 2023 election.\n\nAre you still in support of the presidency coming to the South?\n\nPresident Buhari should not hand over to a Northerner. Those who are jostling for the presidential position from the North must have a re-think when the trouble starts, they will not be around to quell the storm. Zoning is another name for federal character and for peace to reign, for equity; fairness and justice the position should go to the South. It is the most reasonable thing to do; it is something that should not generate any logic, any skewed argument.\n\nWhat are the characteristics Nigerians should look out for in the 2023 presidential election?\n\nAt the right time, when the political parties have done their primaries and presidential candidates emerge, we will embark on that aggressive campaign of letting the people know the right person, given their credentials, their antecedents etc. We will find a way to embarrass those that have been taking us for a ride over the years. I think several meeting are still going on among the political class and their parties. It is when the presidential candidates emerge, we will now know who and who are in the race and how to handle them. It is no longer time that they will come and rabble-rouse us with their sweet-coated tongue, no, we will go beyond that and will be ready to embarrass those that have manifested as enemies of the people.And we know them. Look at the presidential aspirants from the North, if they want to go to their villages they have to carry battalion of soldiers, so who is fooling who? They are there in Abuja parading themselves, they can\u2019t go home, it\u2019s a shame.\n\nWhat is your take on what is playing out politically between the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo and his political god-father, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu since the declaration of interest to run for president by the VP?\n\nMake no mistake to think that they are enemies. Politicians remain specie you cannot predict. You will be cracking and killing yourself for them, unknown to you they are inside together at night popping Champaign, drinking wine and pepper-soup. Let nobody carry headache in their case because they can decide to settle today or have you forgotten the word \u201cconsensus\u201d? When there is conflict of interest among them (politicians), they have their own way of settling it and you that have been killing yourself, fighting and arguing to defend them will look stupid in the end. Politicians, at least Nigerian politicians, will always reconcile to guide and guard their interest. So, do not be deceived, Osinbajo and Tinubu are not enemies.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n*Denounce Babangida-backed Ango Abdullahi\u2019s report *PDP summons NEC meeting Wednesday *Tinubu, Umahi, others hosted by Aisha Buhari at Iftar\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye in Abuja and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Dutse\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar; Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal; former Governor of Jigawa State, Mr. Sule Lamido; and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, have rejected the emergence of a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed as the consensus presidential candidates for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the North.\n\nAtiku, Tambuwal, Lamido, and Hayatu-Deen, who are all PDP presidential aspirants, have also denounced the report of Prof. Ango Abdullahi, which endorsed Saraki and Mohammed as the North\u2019s consensus presidential candidates with the backing of a former military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (rtd).\n\nAs the controversy over the northern PDP presidential candidate deepens, the wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, last night held Iftar dinner with presidential aspirants across political divide at the Old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.\n\nThis is coming as the PDP yesterday summoned a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting for Wednesday this week.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, \u201call members of the National Executive Committee of our great party are invited to the 96th NEC meeting\u201d scheduled to hold at the NEC Hall PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja, at 2p.m.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the NEC meeting, which would take a final decision on the report of the 37-man committee on the zoning of presidential ticket of the party, was shifted from Thursday last week to Wednesday this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, last night held Iftar dinner with presidential aspirants across political parties divides at the Old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe First Lady invited all presidential aspirants of all political parties, to the Ramadan Iftar, where he also hosted elected officials of the political parties.\n\nPresidential aspirants in attendance were: National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State (APC), and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nOther dignitaries include: Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; one-time National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Barnabas Gemade; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara; and oil and gas mogul, Tein Jack-Rich.\n\nOn the issue of the northern PDP presidential candidate, Abdullahi, a former Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, had in a report said that Babangida had directed him to conduct a consensus exercise for four northern presidential aspirants \u2013 Saraki, Mohammed, Tambuwal, and Hayatu-Deen.\n\nThe report, which shortlisted Saraki and Governor Mohammed as the two northern presidential consensus candidates, urged Tambuwal and the investment banker and economist, Hayatu-Deen to drop their presidential ambition.\n\nThe report signed by Abdullahi said: \u201cFor this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Governor Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\u201d\n\nThe report also recommended that: \u201cThe two would, in turn, be required to make further concessions so that in the end, one of them would be presented as the consensus candidate, out of the four that presented themselves from the North.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi noted in the report that the four northern aspirants had visited Babangida and gave him the mandate to lead the process for a consensus and also agreed to abide by the outcome of the decision.\n\n\u201cThe former president encouraged the aspirants to have a resolution within themselves and come up with one candidate, which they reported back to him after some days and asked him to go ahead and pick one out of the four, General Babangida on his part opted for inclusion, through wider consultation and assigned me to design criteria and carry out the necessary consultations with elders and leaders across the three geopolitical zones of the North.\n\n\u201cThe process was conducted in the following three stages. In the first phase, the opinions of six distinguished persons each from the three geopolitical zones were sought with regards to each of the four aspirants, Each of the zonal delegates was allocated two votes to choose the first and second choice making a total of 36 votes overall. The outcome of that consultation was as follows:\n\n\u201c7 votes for the candidate (A) Aminu Waziri; 10 votes for the candidate (B) Bala Mohammed; 10 votes for the candidate (C) A-B Saraki; and five votes for the candidate (D), M Hayatu-Deen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, one of the elders deferred his votes on grounds of continuing consultations with traditional rulers and other major stakeholders.\n\nThe report also stated that two members did not cast their second ballots bringing the total to 32 votes cast out of 36.\n\nIn its recommendation, which was approved by Babangida, the report endorsed Saraki and the Bauchi State governor.\n\nThe report also thanked all the aspirants and \u201cformer President Ibrahim Babangida for entrusting them with the conduct of this exercise and in the hope that all parties involved would continue with mutual consultations aimed at the overall success of the party.\n\n\u201cFor this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Governor Bala Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\n\n\u201cThe successful aspirants are hereby urged to work together to make allowance for further consultations to foster understanding among themselves, and the PDP community to ensure a rancour-free primary election in which all eligible candidates would be free to exercise their rights.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely commend the sportsmanship and statesmanship exhibited throughout the exercise by all those involved and urge continuous cooperation and teamwork to ensure victory for the party,\u201d the report explained.\n\nBut in a swift response, the Technical Committee for the Actualisation of Atiku Abubakar\u2019s Presidency in 2023, has dissociated the former vice president from the consensus arrangement. Atiku\u2019s Technical Committee, in its statement, noted that: \u201cThe report clearly stated that the aspirants who presented themselves for the exercise are: Governor Tambuwal, Governor Mohammed, Saraki, and Hayatu-Deen.\u201d\n\nThe statement insisted that Atiku was never a part of the purported consensus arrangement and did not subject himself to this process.\n\n\u201cTherefore, he is not bound by any of the recommendations and conclusions of the purported report. Waziri Atiku Abubakar as a nationalist strongly believes that Nigeria has never been so divided as it is today, and any regional, zonal, ethnoreligious gang-up or consensus-driven in this manner will further deepen and widen the wounds that urgently require to be healed,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAlso reacting in a statement issued yesterday, the Director of Organisation and Mobilisation for Tambuwal Campaign Organisation, Nicholas Msheliza has also stated that the Sokoto State governor was not part of the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe attention of Tambuwal Campaign Organisation (TCO) has been drawn to a news item that former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger State.\n\n\u201cThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.\n\nThe correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday, April 20, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s Lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting; and unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\n\u201cThe team further agreed that Senator Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything. The proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm on the same day was aborted unilaterally by Senator Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Thursday, April 21, 2022, the same Senator Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday. Governor Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working. This is the reason Governor Tambuwal was absent at the Friday meeting in Minna. As a result, therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Governor Tambuwal, who had earlier informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not consensus candidates,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe statement added that Tambuwal had submitted his Presidential nomination forms, adding that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four had collapsed.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Sokoto State governor will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primary.\n\nAlso denouncing the controversial consensus report, former Jigawa State Governor, Lamido called on all members of the party in the northern states to ignore it.\n\nLamido, in a statement issued yesterday, argued that the report does not represent the opinions of members of the party in the 19 northern states.\n\n\u201cThe attention of key stakeholders of the PDP in the northern states is drawn to reports in the media that some northern elders have shortlisted two of our prominent and deserving aspirants as consensus PDP presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cHaving widely consulted party leaders across the 19 northern states and FCT, it is hereby stated to our teeming party members and the general public that what Is reported in the media is only the personal opinion of those who issued the statement and not the position of the PDP members in the North!\n\n\u201cDiscussions are ongoing with all the aspirants in our party to have a national consensus if possible or at least working towards having smooth acrimony-free National Convention. The position of the northern elders is not only injurious to the North but equally injurious to the northern aspirants,\u201d Lamido explained.\n\nIn his reaction, Hayatu-Deen, in a statement by his campaign office, also stated that the process of arriving at a consensus candidate had collapsed.\n\n\u201cThe candidates involved could not reach a compromise amongst themselves, resulting in the decision of our principal, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, and Governor Aminu Tambuwal to discontinue the process,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIt described the committee constituted by Abdullahi as completely faceless and the evaluation criteria subjective.\n\n\u201cIt seems to us that this entire charade was designed to achieve a preconceived outcome,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Femi Gbajabiamila has also mourned the death of the Oyo monarch.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement issued yesterday by his Media Adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, stressed that the Alaafin of Oyo\u2019s 52 years of rule was remarkable in many ways, most significant was the emphasis he placed on human development, thereby encouraging learning as a culture and formal education as a necessity while promoting values of peace and stability.\n\n\n\nAs a highly revered traditional ruler, President Buhari noted the late monarch\u2019s numerous involvements in national meetings and conferences to shape the future of the country, and the living words of wisdom he shared at every opportunity on unity and people-focused governance.\n\nIn his letter of condolence sent to Makinde, Obasanjo said Oba Adeyemi died \u201cat a crucial stage in our nation\u2019s history when his wise counsel and rich experience are greatly needed.\u201d\n\nA copy of the letter was made available to journalists yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by Obasanjo\u2019s Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Kehinde Akinyemi.\n\n\n\nThe former president described the monarch as a symbol of a nation\u2019s epic struggle for self-discovery and self-actualisation. He said the late Alaafin was a patriotic and highly respected traditional ruler who had immeasurable love for his people and great faith in a united Nigeria.\n\nObasanjo said: \u201cHe stood out as a voice of forthrightness in national affairs and he was as well a fervent promoter of mutual tolerance and understanding, not only among the diverse people who live in his domain but also across the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nObasanjo prayed that God would grant the family, the people of Oyo land, and the entire Oyo State the grace to bear the heavy loss of the monarch\u2019s death.\n\nOn his part, Jonathan has also commiserated with the government and people of Oyo State over the death of the Alaafin of Oyo, describing the late traditional ruler as a great leader who recorded considerable achievements during his long and glorious reign.\n\n\n\nIn a condolence letter to Makinde, Jonathan noted that the late Alaafin was a skilled custodian of the tradition and culture of his people who had an eventful and epoch-making reign.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi\u2019s voyage on earth was full of notable achievements and epoch-making reign as a highly revered royal father. He was a great leader, bridge builder, and a skilled custodian of the tradition and culture of his people,\u201d the former president said in a statement issued by his spokesman, Mr. Ikechukwu Eze.\n\nAtiku has also reacted to the news of the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo, describing it as a great loss for Nigeria and African culture at large.\n\n\n\nAPC\u2019s presidential aspirant and National Leader of the party, Tinubu, has also expressed sadness over the death of the late Alaafin Lamidi Adeyemi, describing the demise of the revered monarch as the fall of a big Iroko tree.\n\nTinubu in a personally signed statement, said the Alaafin brought prosperity and development to the ancient Oyo Kingdom having ascended the throne of his forebears at a young age.\n\n\u201cAfter ascending to the royal throne at the age of 31, Alaafin became one of the most influential, greatly respected traditional rulers in Yorubaland, Nigeria and indeed Africa and beyond.\u201d\n\nEkiti State Governor, Fayemi, has also extolled the virtues of the late Alaafin of Oyo\n\nFayemi, on his part, said the departure of the revered monarch has created a big vacuum in the traditional institution in Oyo State in particular and Yoruba land in general.\n\nThe governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, said the late Oba Adeyemi was a bridge builder, a patriot, and a courageous leader, who contributed to the unity of Nigeria in his lifetime.\n\nHe noted that the late Oba Adeyemi was an authority in history and blessed with a sharp memory that added value and class to his royal duties and day-to-day interaction with people from different walks of life.\n\nOsun State governor, Oyetola, also described the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo, as shocking, saying it signified the end of an era.\n\n\n\nOyetola also commiserated with his Oyo State counterpart, Makinde, and the entire Yoruba race over the demise of the late monarch.\n\nHe described Alaafin\u2019s transition as a personal loss because, according to him, the late monarch was \u201ca good friend of Osun who was always ready to identify with our government and celebrate our humble accomplishments and achievements.\u201d\n\nIn his message, Governor Akeredolu of Ondo State described the death of the Alaafin of Oyo as the fall of a great Iroko.\n\nAkeredolu who is the Chairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum, said the Oba\u2019s death was a rude shock.\n\nThis is contained in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Richard Olatunde in Akure.\n\nAkeredolu described the transition of the Oba to the world beyond as a big blow to the Oyo Kingdom, Yoruba race, and the country at large.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have lost a quintessential traditional ruler and custodian of the Yoruba culture. His contributions to the development and advancement of the country and Yoruba Land, in particular, are unquantifiable,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor of Benue State, Ortom also yesterday commiserated with the government and people of Oyo State over the transition to the great beyond of the Alaafin of Oyo.\n\nIn a condolence message to his Oyo State counterpart, Makinde, issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur, the governor described the late Oyo monarch as a courageous king who did everything possible to preserve the culture and tradition of his people.\n\nSimilarly, the Governor of Edo State, Obaseki, also described the late monarch as, \u201ca great ruler, who displayed kindness and compassion to his people, espousing the virtues of hard work, diligence, and love for humanity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Obaseki said: \u201cBrave and cheerful, Oba Adeyemi embodied the ideals of the Yoruba nation, promoting the rich culture and heritage of the Yorubas and providing wise counsel to those who sought guidance from the throne.\u201d\n\n\n\nDelta State Governor, Okowa, commiserated with Makinde, the Government, and the people of Oyo State over the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Olisa Ifeajika, in Asaba, the governor noted that the late octogenarian monarch was an influential leader who was committed to the development of his kingdom and beyond.\n\n\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gbajabiamila has described the passing away of the Alaafin of Oyo, as a sad development that touched him personally.\n\nOn his part, Governor Abiodun of Ogun State mourned the late Alaafin\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, the governor described the monarch\u2019s death as tragic and occurred when least expected.\n\n\u201cI commiserate with the Oyomesi, the wives and children of the late monarch, and the entire Adeyemi family over this irreplaceable loss. I pray for their comfort and peace at the trying times.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Kabiyesi had to take his leave of us, at this period, when we need his wisdom the most, as we approach the 2023 general election, a critical period in our political landmarks,\u201d Somorin quoted the governor as saying.\n\n\n\nGbajabiamila said the death of the paramount Yoruba ruler came to him as a rude shock, describing the late Alaafin, who had been like a father to him, as a very intelligent father with a sound grasp of traditional, social, political, and international history.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was recently appointed the Aare Baasofin of Yoruba Land by the late Alaafin, said the death of the traditional ruler has created a void too difficult to fill.\n\nIn his reaction, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, Alli Okunmade II, described the death of Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, as the end of a remarkable and glorious era.\n\nBalogun made the assertions in a statement he signed yesterday in Ibadan, following the announcement of the death of the great Oba.\n\nThe Olubadan, who expressed shock at the news of the death of the Oyo traditional ruler, described the late traditional ruler as \u201ca royal father per excellence, who projected Yoruba culture and civilisation with awe and dignity\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Emir of Ilorin and Chairman Kwara State Council of Chiefs, Mai-Martaba Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari has also described the demise of Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III as a colossal loss to traditional institutions in the country.\n\nAlhaji Sulu-Gambari noted that the 52 years reign of Oba Adeyemi III witnessed a tremendous display of royalty, excellence, peace, and harmony among inhabitants of the ancient town of Oyo and Oyo State in general.\n\nIn a statement issued by his media aide, Alhaji AbdulAzeez Arowona, the monarch stated, \u201cOba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi\u2019s death marks the end of another era, the world will surely miss the exit of a bridge-builder\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\u2018I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring; the political process is ongoing\u2019\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan yesterday in Abuja came under intense pressure from his supporters, urging him to contest for president in 2023 and he did not disappoint, telling them that \u201cthe political process is ongoing; just watch out. just watch out.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe supporters, comprising largely women and youths, stormed the Jonathan Foundation\u2019s Abuja office, chanting his name, forcing him to come out to address them.\n\n\n\nThe former president acknowledged that youths wanted him to contest for President in 2023, but told the supporters that he could not, for now, tell Nigerians whether he would be contesting and that his final decision would manifest very soon.\n\n\n\nJonathan said: \u201cI cannot declare because some processes are still ongoing. Yes, you are calling me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring, the political process is ongoing. Just watch out. The key thing you must do is to pray that Nigeria gets somebody that carries young people along, somebody that can also work very hard to see that some of the problems raised are tackled.\n\n\n\n\u201cI sincerely appreciate the youths of Nigeria. For you to come this morning in this manner shows clearly that the youth are interested in politics.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have always wanted the youth to get involved in politics. And luckily, the Not Too Young to Run Act has made it very clear that young people can contest almost every position in the country. So, we continue to encourage you to get involved in the political process.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan noted that the country was facing challenges, saying that some of the challenges started a long time ago, stressing that he believed in the interest of young people and that the challenges would be dealt with.\n\nThe supporters, who demanded the return of Jonathan as President in 2023, arrived in four buses and displayed placards at Jonathan\u2019s Taraba Close, Maitama office.\n\n\n\nSome of the placards read, \u201cGoodluck declare now\u201d; \u201cWe are sorry, Goodluck don\u2019t abandon us, come back\u201d; \u201cGoodluck please come\u201d; and \u201cGoodluck we love you\u201d, among others.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the supporters, Mayor Samuel, who is also the convener of the Youth Compatriots of Nigeria, said, \u201cWe were deceived and brainwashed by those who claimed they could do it in 2015.\n\n\u201cNow, we know better, under Jonathan the minimum wage could buy one or two bags of rice. What do we have today? We are begging President Jonathan to forgive us, we have realised our mistakes, we want him back to complete what he started.\u201d\n\n\n\nSamuel admitted that they were deceived to believe that the administration of Jonathan was bad and that they were out in their numbers to seek Jonathan\u2019s forgiveness.\n\n\n\nHe noted that they had realised their mistake and that the \u201csaboteurs\u201d that came after him were empty.\n\nSamuel adds: \u201cWe are here to say sir, forgive us, come and lead us again. We are calling on you to come and take the mantle of leadership in 2023. Nigeria is in comatose. Please answer this call, the youth are here, the women are here, the children are here, pregnant women are here, please hear their cry.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are here to call on our former president.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Document Exposes How Wema Bank Officials Offered Policeman Bribe To Stop Investigation On N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud",
          "text": "A report by the Nigeria Police Force has exposed how Wema Bank Plc offered bribe to the police officer investigating the N1.7billion illegally moved to account number 0122367964 domiciled in the financial institution and operated by one Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God by top officials of the bank.\n\nThe Wema Bank staff members fingered in the fraudulent activities are the bank's Executive Director, Wole Akinleye; Head of Cooperate Banking, Emmanuel Edah, and Head of Oil and Gas, Kingsley Ananwude.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura, said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted. The officials spent time begging and persuading the inestigating officers to drop the case. The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with he investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters read.\n\nMeanwhile, the police has charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\n\u201cThat you Ojo Oladipupo \u201cM\u201d and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district did intentionally attempt to offer the station officer A/P No: 143699 ASP Jonathan Egwemi monetary reward in order to reframe him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of your organization i.e WEMA Bank Nigeria Plc and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 64 of the criminal laws of Lagos State of Nigeria,\u201d one of the charges read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7billion were fraudulently moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the fraud said Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, approached the bank in 2018 for a loan to boost his oil trading business using his neighbour\u2019s assets as collateral.\n\nGranting the loan to the pastor, the financial institution opened an account for him where the money was paid.\n\nThe account was, however, used to illegally move N1.7billion from the bank in 2021 to multiple accounts operated by top staff members and their proxies.\n\n\u201cHe used his neighbour\u2019s house for collateral of the loan which was granted to him and promised to return it within six months. But three years after, the man approached him for his house document, that was when he told him of the fraudulent act. He said the bank paid N1.7billion into the account using different multinational companies like Dana Airlines, Caverton Helicopter and two others, one N300million, one N270million, one N600million and like that, it\u2019s only one of the transactions that they didn\u2019t put a name there,\u201d a policeman involved in the case had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Wema Bank Top Officials Used Redeemed Church Pastor\u2019s Account For N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud\n\n\u201cGuess what they do after, they now moved that N1.7billion from Adewole\u2019s account into different bank accounts in tranches. Like the one I told you \u2014N600million, they immediately put it in another account in form of N150million, N100million, N100million, N90million. The pastor\u2019s account is known as Shibawells Energy Limited. The one for Dana that they moved N160million to, that was how they did it too, they immediately sent it to another account in smaller units as well.\n\n\u201cSo the pastor approached the bank instead of the police. The top management staff involved called him and asked him what he wanted, they now ended with an agreement that the bank would give him an extra loan of N1.5billion and he agreed. Remember I told you this man is the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, a company that does supply aviation fuel. So we realised it was well planned and the names of Dana, Caverton and others were intentionally used to cover up the fraud so people won\u2019t notice. We also realised in our investigation that this money was given to the banks by the CBN and these top officials had to use an account to move it out and use it for something else.\n\n\u201cHe has a partner, we called him and realised he wasn\u2019t aware of the transaction. He was shocked, he realised the statement presented to him was forged to hide the fraudulent transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021 via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction. It will be wrong for me to share our bank statement with you but such a transaction wasn\u2019t authorised by us,\u201d a source at Dana Air told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in such a deal, only the bank management can tell you why they use Dana\u2019s name for the transaction. Go to the bank tomorrow and send money to anyone and use Dana as the sender they won\u2019t stop you from doing that. Jokes apart, if we have that kind of amount, my brother, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d the source added.\n\nIn January 2022, a group, Transparency Nigeria Group, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of Wema Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of the bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds.\u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta has received billions of naira from the Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.",

          "text": "The Federal High Court in the Abuja Judicial Division has issued subpoenas to the offices of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Head of Nigeria's Inspector-General of Police Monitoring Unit, Office of the Inspector General of Police, to give evidence as requested by the Chairman of Human & Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre), Olanrewaju Suraju regarding the lingering OPL 245 saga.\n\nThis followed the OPL 245 saga between Suraju and a former Minister of Justice/ Attorney General of the Federation, Mohammed Bello Adoke, who was accused of corruption in the case among others.\n\nOthers in the copy of the subpoenas are Mr. Simon Loyd, formerly, Executive Director, J. P. Morgan, EMEA AML and Sanctions Compliance, London, who is currently the Senior Vice President/Head of FCC Central Oversight, PMO & Regulatory Deliverables at Danske Bank; the Minister of Justice/ Attorney general of the Federation, Abubakar Malami; Adoke himself; Public Prosecutor's Office at the Court in Milan- Italy and Osolake Bayo, Global Head of Financial Institutions Trade Product Sales Specialist at J.P Morgan, London.\n\nIn suit no FHC/ABJ/CR/370/2021 between the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Complainant) and Olanrewaju Suraju (Defendant), the Nigerian government will be expected to present its case and evidence to prosecute the charges against the defendants, having withdrawn 2 of the 4 preferred charges at the last sitting of the court when the case resumes on May 10, 2022.\n\nThe court in its Subpoena Duces Tecum Et Ad Testificandum (A court summons ordering the recipient to appear before the court and produce documents or other tangible evidence for use at a hearing or trial) ordered the Public Prosecutor's office at the court of Milan, Italy, to bring the official copy of the European investigation order sent to the UK Authorities in respect of the Malabu Oil Matter and the UK authorities response to the European investigation order.\n\nThe EFCC is expected to come with the official copy of the investigation report of alleged forgery and impersonation resulting in cyber criminality, financial crime and economic sabotage against Nigeria as it relates to the email sent by Adoke on 21 June 2011 to JP Morgan Chase bank using the email address [email protected]\n\nAlso, Mr. Osolake Bayo is meant to come along with the e-mail dated June 21, 2011, from his email address <[email protected]> with the Subject: FW: BLOCK 245 Malabu Resolution Agreement which he sent to Adewuyi Tosin [email protected] together with the document attached to the mail.\n\nWhile Loyd was asked to bring the official copy of the email dated June 24, 2011, which he sent to Lyall, Ian; White, Daniel UK; and Speers Camel with the title: \u201cFGN SUMMARY OF FACTS\u201d as well as documents shared and any other relevant document with respect to the subject.\n\nRecall that in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CR/370/21, Suraju was charged with cyberstalking for allegedly circulating the fake audio of a phone interview said to have been planted to implicate Mohammed Bello Adoke, in the OPL 245 saga.\n\nHowbeit, the Nigerian government has submitted before the London court in its civil case against JP Morgan it is withdrawing the forgery trial of the anti-corruption activist- Suraju, claiming the action was erroneously filed by both the police and some officials of the Ministry of Justice, ignorant of its implications for the London lawsuit against J.P Morgan Chase Bank in a UK court.\n\nNigeria is seeking the award against the bank for allegedly failing in its duty when it transferred $810 million to Malabu Oil & Gas Limited from the sale of OPL 245 to Shell and Eni in 2011.\n\nIn the same submission, the Nigerian government reaffirmed Adoke as the author of the allegedly forged email and also the interviewee in the audiotape allegedly referred to as fake in the charges against Suraju.\n\nThe government argued that the bank ought to have known that it was \u201ca corrupt and fraudulent scheme\u201d and should have withheld the payment.\n\nJP Morgan denied the liability claims, maintaining that the government has not yet proved allegations of corruption in any court of law over 10 years when the payments were made.\n\nThe government specifically accused Adoke, the attorney-general when the OPL 245 resolutions were reached in 2011, of corruption, and subsequently filed charges in 3 different courts against him and other co-defendants.\n\nHowever, the charges around forgery of email against Suraju were dropped after Nigeria\u2019s lawyers pointed out to the attorney-general that it could jeopardise the case against J.P Morgan since the government was relying on the same email.\n\nSuraju was eventually arraigned over the charges around the allegedly stage-managed interview alone, but the lawyers have now informed the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales Commercial Court that the case against the activist will be halted.\n\nThe Malabu scandal involved the transfer of about $1.1 billion by Shell and ENI through the Nigerian government to accounts controlled by a former Nigerian Petroleum Minister, Dan Etete.\n\nFrom accounts controlled by Etete, about half the money ($520 million) went to accounts of companies controlled by Aliyu Abubakar, popularly known in Nigeria as the owner of AA oil.\n\nAnti-corruption investigators and activists suspect he fronted for top officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration as well as officials of Shell and ENI.\n\nThe transaction was authorised in 2011 by ex-president Jonathan through some of his cabinet ministers and the money was payment for OPL 245, one of Nigeria\u2019s richest oil blocks.\n\nThe oil resources of the OPL 245 licence have remained undeveloped since the controversies began.\n\nOne of those being prosecuted by the Nigerian government is Adoke.\n\nHe is facing trial over the alleged role he played in the \u201cfraudulent\u201d transfer of ownership of an oil bloc, OPL 245, regarded as one of the biggest in Africa.\n\nOther defendants include Aliyu Abubakar, Rasky Gbinigie and four companies- Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited, Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited.",

And to its right is a comfy sofa easily proving useful when pulling an all-nighter becomes the only way to beat deadlines. A few strides ahead of her desk is a mini workstation suited for use during teamwork requiring physical presence. Her studio isn\u2019t bereft of exquisite artwork too, several of them stacked away in a corner and others hanging on the wall.\n\nOnyenwe founded Raconteur Productions, releasing over 20 films, documentaries, web series, podcasts, & theatre.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving studied Economics, run an MSc in Management at Imperial College London, and undertaken film courses from the Met Film School, the producer leverages her interdisciplinary training to create works across mediums.\n\nOnyenwe\u2019s first feature film \u20188 Bars & A Clef\u2019 was nominated for the 2016 Africa Movie Academy Awards (AMAA). She started the August Meeting Movement, a stage production taking the story of Aba Women\u2019s Riot on a tour.\n\nShe made \u201823419\u2019, a One Word Media-nominated documentary widely extolled as Nigeria\u2019s first true-crime podcast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnyenwe has done a seven-year stretch with the Africa International Film Festival (AFRIFF) where she was a film programmer and then artistic director all between 2014 and 2021, gleaning intelligence on how the industry works.\n\nA Creative Producer Indaba fellow, her forthcoming project about a dormitory hallway ghost in urban legend was among 10 African works unveiled and selected for funding by the American streamer Topic and Statement Films.\n\nOnyenwe, in our conversation, points out that her works lie in the intersection of culture, history, and identity.\n\n\u201cAFRIFF was a school for me, like Nwa Boi. The exposure to African cinema was a revelation. The big picture for me is not just in creating projects but in building out [a business chain in the industry],\u201d the filmmaker explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow would you deconstruct your outset in filmmaking?\n\nI always knew I wanted to be a storyteller. Filmmaking wasn\u2019t something I was fixated on initially. You know that thing when you\u2019re young and you\u2019re told to study Law because you talk a lot. It was that for me. I started reading as early as age 3 and storytelling had always been my thing. It started to crystalize when I was in UNILAG studying Economics. I would go to people\u2019s sets and work as a production assistant, the first of which was for a documentary. I worked in a student fellowship where things go on and on. On stage, you\u2019re made to bring your creativity to bear.\n\nIt was around 2004-2005. Then I volunteered for another set, finishing my programme in 2008. I decided I wanted to do another degree in film. My final-year project was about Nollywood where I wrote about revenue generation and how Nollywood can contribute to the GDP, looking at it as a macro industry. I\u2019d gone to Alaba where I met a lot of industry guys for research, including the marketers at the time. In 2010, I would do my master\u2019s in management.\n\nBefore then, I shot a web series \u2018Goddammit It\u2019s Monday\u2019 where I adapted Woma Efetie\u2019s blog of the same name. It was during my master\u2019s I edited it and started to take weekend courses from the London Film Academy. I saved my allowance to take some courses. After my master\u2019s, I did a two-month course at the MET Film School. That was in 2011-2012. I was in the UK for an additional year and returned to Nigeria to work at UNN. In the UK, I worked at the alumni office at Imperial College. I met UNN\u2019s VC and he said at the time he wanted to set up an alumni office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI went to Nsukka to set it up and lasted for a year (giggles). It taught me patience. I built it from scratch and played the politics of it. I\u2019d worked in investment banking. In 2013, I decided on going into film full-time. I met Chioma Udeh. I wanted to make a feature film, so I volunteered with AFRIFF to meet with industry people and learn how the system works. At the first AFRIFF I went to, the opening film was \u2018Of Good Report\u2019 by Jahmil Qubeka. It blew my mind. I\u2019d done film school but my diet was western. I wasn\u2019t exposed as much to African cinema because, to be honest, there was nowhere to find it. You could hardly see what filmmakers in Kenya and South Africa were up to.\n\nNow you can use Netflix but then there was nowhere to see them. I still made \u20188 Bars & A Cleff\u2019, which was my first film, in 2014. The Jonathan government was doing a \u20a63 billion injection for Nollywood, \u20a6300,000 for capacity building, \u20a6700,000 for production, and \u20a62 billion for distribution. I got funding from the finance ministry to finish my film, which took two years. It was a nightmare. In hindsight, there are things I see I could have done differently. My approach to it had me producing, directing, and doing everything by myself. I was even shooting in my house.\n\nThe film came out in 2015 and earned me an AMAA nomination. It came out in the cinema and didn\u2019t do well at all.\n\nIt was about a dyslexic artist finding his voice. I\u2019ve not done a feature film since then. I\u2019m not in any sort of recovery (laughs). But I decided to take my time and learn, seeing what filmmakers on the continent were doing. So I started doing more work with AFRIFF. I did another course in film production. In-between, with my production company, I did documentaries. I\u2019ve done theatre. Once I knew the story, I then determine what was the best medium to tell it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I did \u2018August Meeting\u2019, about the Aba women riot, I knew it had to be on stage. Documentaries kept the lights on and, with that, came more commissioned work. With the festival, I started with programme and later became an artistic director for a couple of years. Now, I\u2019m focusing on film and TV. I\u2019m currently in development for a couple of projects, bearing in mind the importance of collaboration. There\u2019s one I\u2019m working on with Melissa Adeyemo, the producer of the film \u2018Eyinmofe\u2019. We\u2019re working on the \u2018Madam Koi-Koi\u2019 series with Statement Films in the US.\n\nBefore that, I did the Creative Producer Indaba fellowship in 2020. We had producers across Africa in a full mentorship sorting out how to get international funding and market films internationally. We explored that international route to market. From the festival space, we see that African films go to international festivals and people still don\u2019t know them. You have Nollywood which has such an audience but is not following the festival route to market. For me, it\u2019s finding balance. I don\u2019t want to lose this local audience and make films they can\u2019t relate to.\n\nBeyond marketing, how else did you leverage your field of study in the filmmaking context?\n\nEconomics is broad enough that you can apply it in any industry. Being in AFRIFF was me trying to find structure.\n\nI haven\u2019t cracked it but, when I opted for film, my father\u2019s question was about how that makes money. He didn\u2019t see sustainability in it. Filmmaking is wide. There\u2019s the music videos, the commercials, documentaries, the Nollywood. It\u2019s an industry and one has to find ways to fit in. Breaking it down further to the support services, you have the big players like Jungle providing equipment. How many more of those can we have? We have companies for subtitling.\n\nAt the macro level, we have the training and the need to package skills for sale, as Andela did for the tech space. An animation school perhaps, although the setup is expensive. It\u2019s in making sense of the industry\u2019s multiple aspects as well as how to think of filmmaking as a business that the knowledge proves useful. It\u2019s not about just doing projects and turning around. It\u2019s only when we get to a point where Nollywood has its ecosystem fully built out that we have an industry. There\u2019s the economics to thinking about that. The big picture for me is not just in creating projects but in building out. You have to think about what you can export eventually because everyone is competing globally.\n\nYou once said structure deficiency in Nollywood informed your foray into filmmaking. How much of that opinion do you still hold, given the level to which movie production has evolved in Nigeria?\n\nI think it still is for me. The supervisor who oversaw my final-year project back in university initially kicked me out and remarked that I was unserious because I left macroeconomic policy to focus on the film industry. But I could see that the creative industry was the next frontier. Everyone wanted to do a master\u2019s in Oil & Gas or Petroleum Economics. Today, what I saw in the entertainment space is now apparent. Whatever happened in music came first.\n\nI see so much potential. Nollywood will take longer because it needs more practitioners to be excellent across lines.\n\nIn my first film, the sound guy left the set with my storage card. On returning, I figured I\u2019d lost one day of sound. It was one person\u2019s mess that affected the rest of the film. We look at the film as a top-to-down thing due to the bossy nature of some executives but it\u2019s about every one of the crew members knowing what they\u2019re doing. That way, you don\u2019t have to micromanage anyone and have a director who is expected to be all-knowing. If costume or foley guys know what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019ll be the ones giving you options as the creatives they are. It makes the work easier.\n\nSo we\u2019re not there yet. There\u2019s a skill gap that is still present and there\u2019s also the infrastructure and support system.\n\nI don\u2019t know (sighs). I guess we\u2019re better than we were before. It just takes time and we\u2019ve come a long way, to be fair. I feel like we haven\u2019t still sorted sound in Nollywood because the music video guys don\u2019t need sound (giggles). When you think about it, cinematography changes with [affordability]. Imagine an artiste is paying \u20a65 million to make a music video in one day and that\u2019s the money you need to make a film in one week. They\u2019ve built the skills.\n\nEditing is choppy because they\u2019re also coming from the music video space. Everything becomes about fast cuts. It\u2019s not cutting corners. It\u2019s just style because he\u2019s used to editing music which is about change. But with film, you have to sit and let the story influence the edits. So it\u2019s in learning. These are the areas where there\u2019s still work to be done.\n\nOne readily wonders what your creative process would look like, as a filmmaker.\n\nReading is really where I start. I did a podcast called \u201823419\u2019 and it was a true-crime audio documentary. It took two years. I took my time collating all data. There were cases in Switzerland, Nigeria, and the US. I was able to amass a 500-page research document. I always want to drill down. While I was making \u2018August Meeting\u2019 as well, I wanted to be as true to history as possible, even if it was a case of these events inspiring the project. So I like researching and reading about that intersection between history, culture, and identity. For projects I\u2019m doing now, I\u2019m adapting.\n\nI try to find collaborators if it\u2019s based on something real. For \u2018August Meeting\u2019, I found Emeka Keazor, a historian. I get across to others I do back-and-forth with. What\u2019s tough is knowing a thing isn\u2019t working but not knowing why.\n\nThen you\u2019re stuck. You go back to the drawing board and maybe readjust the POV with the writer. It might also be staffing. Sometimes, people are really great writers but they\u2019re not great for that project. There\u2019s nothing you can do about that. For me, it\u2019s really getting it right from the script stage, even when there\u2019s pressure to move. I had a play last year and I had to \u2018abduct\u2019 my writer for three days. Once there\u2019s a deadline and things have to be done, we come together and share ideas. But it starts with working with the right people. And some other ideas hit you much later.\n\nHow about Raconteur Productions? What\u2019s it like running a production firm in Nigeria?\n\nI registered it in 2012, so I\u2019ve had it for some time while working with AFRIFF, which is one main event that took only four months of my year, you know, programming and planning. With Raconteaur I\u2019ve done events and stage. Raconteur means storytelling, which is really the mantra. Most of the work is project-based. You staff up when you have a project, which is why I started acting so I can have more of a business. When you\u2019re doing project-based work, it\u2019s almost like freelancing but the goal is to scale it. For me, it\u2019s about thinking of building out businesses.\n\nBriefly, what key insight about Africa\u2019s movie industry did you amass working with AFRIFF?\n\nAFRIFF was a school for me, like Nwa Boi. I worked with AFRIFF for seven years. It made me realise we Nigerians are like Americans in the sense that we think we\u2019re the only ones. The exposure to African cinema was a revelation and it made sense because I sought to push for more pan-African collaborations. East Africa, for example, is good with documentaries. There\u2019s so much happening across regions. It also opened me up to how the business works.\n\nOne is developing a movie but, while at that, one wants to get into the market and tell the world about the coming project. People think, especially with festivals, that they\u2019d just submit a film and it\u2019ll show at Cannes. For that to happen, it has to be a French producer, co-producer, or distributor. There are so many directors doing great and Cannes wants to show the best. They\u2019re really following what directors are doing before you even start submitting.\n\nThere\u2019s the politics of film that working with AFRIFF exposes one to. And there\u2019s a network because you\u2019re meeting filmmakers, distributors, and sales agents. There\u2019s the education for me which was basically seeing a range of films.\n\nWe have an influx of foreign players like Netflix, Paramount, and Amazon seeking to deepen ties with filmmakers in Nigeria. How does this affect the kind of stories we tell or how they\u2019re told?\n\nThere\u2019s more funding and it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. With COVID, people weren\u2019t going to the cinemas anymore. Netflix expanded during that time to create content. There was an influx of funding. It meant we had to upskill at an accelerated rate. We had firms paying for production and there\u2019s licensing. There\u2019s the upside to that.\n\nBut it\u2019s tricky. There\u2019s the local-for-local, where they buy content to build their local base. So they\u2019re either buying stuff already here or creating for a local market because they\u2019re trying to build their subscriber base in this market.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the local-for-global like \u2018Squid Game\u2019 which, perhaps, wasn\u2019t intended as a global hit; \u2018Blood & Water\u2019 from South Africa with the originals when you think in terms of Netflix. These firms are not trying to be saviours. They\u2019re testing out a business model because they have ownership of the content. So it makes sense to hedge bets.\n\nI just don\u2019t want us to get to a point where we\u2019re only creating for those platforms. We need to be able to tell stories in our own way and have ownership. But we need the luxury. You get to tell certain kinds of stories independently of the demands and stipulations of the streamers. They\u2019re good but we just have to be aware they\u2019re doing business.\n\nThey\u2019re not saviours. Once their business model suits investing in an industry, they will. If it doesn\u2019t, they won\u2019t.\n\nThe banking system in Nigeria doesn\u2019t exactly fund films since they aren\u2019t predictable commercial products. Talk to me about the general economics with films and the place of financial institutions.\n\nTo be fair, films are not designed to give you ROI in one year. Film globally is a lifetime revenue earner. More times than not, films don\u2019t make their money back in the cinema during the first run. But now, there\u2019s the streamers and TV. So what happens when, normally, you get a sales agent? They chop it up. They sell to different regions. If it\u2019s a film that can open in cinemas globally, then that\u2019s great. But more times than not, you may be stuck in one market.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re able to manage your cost outlay, then you can be sure to amass revenue for a film over 20 to 30 years.\n\nMaybe, not consistently but it depends. I was talking about \u2018Friends\u2019. That\u2019s a TV show Netflix paid $100 million to extend its licensing by an extra year. And you never know what happens in the future. I mean, there was no Netflix 20 years ago. Different mediums are opening and they keep coming. It gives you a way to earn revenue. Here, it\u2019s still internal. People get a lot of private investors. Do they know you and can they vouch for you? I guess that\u2019s how everyone raises money here. Of course, our rich cousins in music have their own direct route to the source (laughs).\n\nAs for bank funding, I don\u2019t know if bank funding works here. There was the Bank of Industry (BOI) which tried to do a Nollyfund. I\u2019m not sure how successful that was in terms of getting ROI. It\u2019s really hard. Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve not made another film. Even when the film makes money in the cinema, as a producer, you\u2019re getting 30 percent. Does that cover the cost? Have you made money? You earned \u20a6200 million but invested \u20a6100 million to make it.\n\nThere\u2019s a cost-revenue outlay. That\u2019s why people are still fine with TV. At least, African Magic will fund it and you\u2019ll know you\u2019re earning a salary for a year. It\u2019s still a very risky endeavour and we don\u2019t yet have that institutionalised funding. It\u2019s why the streamers are so attractive. Whether it\u2019s a licensing deal or an original, you\u2019re seeing money.\n\nThere\u2019s been talk about copyright protection in Nollywood and underpaid writers. I\u2019d imagine you have strong takes on this, given your legal struggle over \u2018Okafor\u2019s Law\u2019. I want you to speak on this.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d advise anybody to go to court (giggles). I mean, it\u2019s been two years and a lot of stress. It\u2019s a very expensive process that\u2019s demanding in terms of time and effort. I think we have to test the system and that\u2019s what things like that do. It\u2019s a Nigerian thing. There will always be oppression. On the one hand, people need to start to ask for what they deserve but also earn it. To be fair with writers, you have to sign contracts and stipulate credits.\n\nBut there\u2019s signing a contract and there\u2019s having it upheld in the first place. It\u2019s also about protecting yourself by working with those you\u2019d vouch for. You have to protect yourself because, I\u2019m sorry, the system won\u2019t protect you.\n\nProvide value so you\u2019re not replaceable. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s just A-listers that deserve to get what they\u2019re worth. But there\u2019s a reason they can negotiate for things like backend. If you bring value, it\u2019s a much easier place to negotiate from. On the malpractice thing, it\u2019s good that people are speaking up. Just don\u2019t be afraid to walk away if it doesn\u2019t serve you. Get things in writing. Even if it\u2019s a verbal discourse, send an email after. Build a network. There are these things that can protect you so you don\u2019t have to deal with it as much because the court system would be what it is.\n\nHow did that case end? I know there were indications you were set to appeal the court judgment.\n\nWhat people didn\u2019t realise is there were two cases. And that case, in a sense, is still in court. They just haven\u2019t been coming to court, something for which they owe me money. It\u2019s the type of thing that took so much out of me. It was a very interesting process. I mean, we lost the case and there\u2019s been talk about an appeal. I didn\u2019t know if I had that energy. Is it worth it? At the time, the first thing we asked for was an apology and actual credits. But I don\u2019t really want to rehash it all. There was so much told about it and it\u2019s not something I want to define me moving forward.\n\nIt\u2019s good that it happened when it did. I think it was good for the industry and it served its purpose. On the appeal, I haven\u2019t given it much thought because I don\u2019t know what more can be gained. It\u2019s not about money. Beyond what was due to us, why I don\u2019t regret it is that it served a higher purpose. It wasn\u2019t personal. It was about a thing being wrong. There was the protection that came out of it and hope for writers to know that contracts should be signed.\n\nAs for the corporates, they\u2019d now be more careful and do things right. The thing about law is you just have to do the right thing, whether you like it or not. The case definitely served its purpose if it made more people do things right.\n\nFilming in Nigeria is predominantly location-based, where actors work extreme hours of the day. How far off are we from having state-of-the-art studios in which quality visual effects can be done?\n\nWe don\u2019t have a studio system that much, so it\u2019s been about finding the right location that serves that. I know Kunle Afolayan is building a film village so I guess he\u2019s doing that. Niyi Akinmolayan talks about building sets. We might get there but it might not be Lagos because I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s space. It\u2019s a huge investment. We\u2019ll grow into it.\n\nYou\u2019re the one to casts your net across mediums, doing a thing in theatre, TV, film, documentary, online content, and even podcasting. What\u2019s the deal and how do you choose what medium is best?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t feel like doing different things. It just feels like telling a story, which then picks the medium. The podcast had a TV element but I felt it works as a podcast too which is also a good way to show proof of pitch, just in case we want to take it to television. For theatre, it was about a call to action that was urgent. For documentaries, it could be a number of things, including a social issue case. I\u2019m currently working on an immigration documentary. There are different elements. The different one is art because I curate art, something I started during the lockdown in 2020.\n\nAnd diving into art? Damn!\n\n(Giggles) I was pensive at the time, so I rubbed minds with my siblings. Before the lockdown, I was in Kenya and wanted to go to the art market. I wanted to get a painting and they started locking down. I had to return to Lagos when they were closing the air space. I never got to pick up that art piece. Sometime around June as well, I went to the art market here in Lekki and it was empty as they weren\u2019t even opening market. I thought to set up a platform where you can sell your art internationally. Because of my film leanings, I was able to reach out to set decorators and people who I knew would likely need African art apart from regular collectors and Nigerians in the diaspora.\n\nThat\u2019s how ArtDey started and we\u2019re almost two years old now. We had art in \u2018Bell-Air\u2019, so they got a lot of pieces from Nigerian artists in the show. It\u2019s business, straightforward buying, and selling. I\u2019m back to my Nnewi route.\n\nSo what are you up to when not making films?\n\nAh, a lot o! I\u2019m a deep-sea diver. I work out. I drink, like everyone else. For me, it\u2019s important to enjoy the journey.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Second, send a shout-out to Ogheneruemu, my copy editor. She does an excellent job with the newsletter.\n\nSo, how did your week go? I hope you\u2019re not working this weekend because I\u2019ve compiled a list of activities you can enjoy alone, with family, or with friends.\n\nIf you live alone and don\u2019t want to bother anyone this weekend, you can go to the gym, start learning a language, continue that hobby, make a bucket list, try out new recipes, write a letter to yourself, or go for evening walks while meditating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn weekends, I write letters to random people and share with them. Last year was crazy; I wrote these letters and left them on people\u2019s doorposts or gates. Haha! That was fun.\n\nAside from watching movies with your friends, you can attend an event, have an at-home spa day, play board or card games, plan a weekend trip, learn a skill online together, or make your own movie together.\n\nFinally, other than having dinner or lunch outside the house \u2013 which is okay \u2013 you can do a lot with your family this weekend. You can, for example, clean the house together, take a lot of pictures and eat home-cooked food, do a puzzle together, go to the beach or picnic together, or have a family movie night.\n\nI hope this helps you have a good time this weekend. Please, let me know if it does. So, today, I\u2019ll be talking about:\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem struggle with tech talents\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem could struggle with tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle announced in 2021 that it would invest $1 billion in Africa over the next five years to ensure access to faster and cheaper Internet. Also, it wants to create useful, local products to support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that support Africa\u2019s economies.\n\nTo accomplish that, on Wednesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the establishment of its first product development centre in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital.\n\nHow does it plan to accomplish that? Over the next two years, Google plans to hire more than 100 people in software engineering, research, and design roles, joining Visa and Microsoft in establishing a presence in Nairobi.\n\nThis is incredible, but there is a catch. According to the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, Africa has 716,000 professional developers as of 2021, up from 700,000 in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare this to, say, California, United States \u2013 which has an estimated 630,000 developers \u2013 you\u2019ll see that this is a problem.\n\nWhile these figures demonstrate the scarcity of tech talent on the continent and Kenya, don\u2019t you think local startups will lose their best team to Google? Who doesn\u2019t want to work with Google? Do you see my point now?\n\nRemember that in 2019, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Centre and the subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best employees to Microsoft.\n\nWhile this launch is a fantastic opportunity for Kenya, I believe it poses a threat to local startups due to the continent\u2019s scarcity of tech talent. What are your thoughts?\n\nBy the way, some Kenyan experts provided their perspectives on this, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy reading. Want to see it? Please check it here: Kenyan entrepreneurs welcome Google\u2019s product development center but could struggle to hold on to talent\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

Register for TABS Web3 Hackathon here.\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdam Mosseri, Instagram CEO, announced on Wednesday, April 20, 2022, that the company will change its ranking algorithm to emphasise original content more prominently on its platform. This would also help to prioritise the distribution of original content over reposted content in places like the Reels tab and feed.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the social media giant will be less likely to recommend reposts of existing Reels and content from other social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nAlso, accounts that aggregate and reshare other users\u2019 content will be less likely to be recommended by the company.\n\nWhy? According to Mosseri, the aim is to focus on the concept of originality. \u201cIf you create something from scratch, you should get more credit than if you are resharing something that you found from someone else. We\u2019re going to do more to try and value original content more, particularly compared to reposted content,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how can Instagram determine a post\u2019s originality? The CEO said in a tweet that they \u201ccan\u2019t know for sure\u201d how they can determine the original creator of a post. He did, however, explain that the company creates classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. Also, Instagram considers who is in the video and whether the app has seen the video before.\n\nMoreover, the company has already implemented measures to reduce resharing. In February 2021, the algorithm began devaluing reshared Reels with the TikTok logo. The platform wanted people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels by 2021.\n\nBesides, Instagram announced that it was releasing new best practices on its @creators account to teach Instagram users how to create content that will be seen and shared.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mosseri mentioned two recent product launches: product tagging and enhanced tagging. Users will be able to tag products from businesses set up for Instagram Shopping with product tagging, which was launched this week. This feature is currently unavailable to African users.\n\nHowever, the company claims that the expansion will make it easier for people to discover products from people they follow and for businesses to grow their audience on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, the enhanced tags \u2013 which were introduced earlier in March 2022\u2013 will make it easier for creators to receive credit for their work. According to Instagram, the enhanced tags allow users to share and view a creator\u2019s specific contribution to a photo or video post.\n\nWhile reducing reshared content may initially harm some accounts, it is likely critical for Reels\u2019 long-term viability. Or what\u2019d you think?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

          "title": "What you need to know as Google\u2019s Equiano cable lands In Nigeria",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "title": "Blockchain-powered insurance: Meet the decentralised insurance protocol, Etherisc, insuring Kenyan farms against bad climate",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of decentralised insurance became a theoretical possibility with the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). Etherisc is bringing this concept to life, helping African farmers insure their crops against bad weather.\n\nWhile DeFi platforms continue to offer borrowing, lending, and staking services, Etherisc, an open-source, decentralised insurance protocol, brings affordable insurance to African farmers away from the complex DeFi protocols.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Michiel Berende, Chief Inclusive Officer at Etherisc, and he revealed how more than 22,000 farmers got access to an insurance plan without the many steps associated with conventional insurance.\n\nFrom traditional insurance to decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc team with Keyan locals\n\nBerende has been in the insurance space since the early 2000s. While he was an underwriter at an insurance company in the Netherlands, he was interested in information technology and eventually made the switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his challenges saw him develop an interest in microfinance and emerging markets.\n\nBerende\u2019s first task was to help an Indian microfinance organisation set up its activities in the country in 2005. He was responsible for setting up the organisation\u2019s financial operations and deploying the software to run those operations, and his ample experience in finance and technology came in handy.\n\n\n\nEven though Berende\u2019s assignment was similar to what he\u2019d taken on in the Netherlands, it was difficult to replicate his success putting financial operations in place in an emerging market because of limited resources and the extra creativity required to offer financial services in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt changed my view on how things are going in the world, and it doesn\u2019t work everywhere in the world the same way it works in the Netherlands. I enjoyed it, and it moved me to go and live in India,\u201d Berende said.\n\nAfter spending one year in India, he became a consultant in 2007, focusing on technologies for microinsurance. And this allowed him to work on projects in other emerging markets such as Africa.\n\nBut Berende soon realised that insurance was not a thing in Africa; interestingly, not much has changed in 2022, 15 years later.\n\nAfrica makes up 16.72% of the world\u2019s population, but it represents less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nAccording to the Africa Insurance Pulse 2022, insurance penetration in Africa stood at 2.78%, a decline from 2.98% in the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEunice Kinungi, a Kenyan Insurance professional and CEO of Griffin Insurance, told New African magazine that \u201cthe continent still lacks flexible, affordable, and tailored policies that will unlock insurance for the African consumer.\u201d\n\nBesides the problem of unaffordability and inflexibility of insurance, Africans view insurance through the lens of superstition. Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nKinungi also believes that insurance doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in Africa. She said, \u201cinsurance, unfortunately, does not have the best reputation, and there is a general distrust of insurance companies perpetuated by poor customer service and unpaid claims.\u201d\n\nBerende agrees with Kinungi and Pedro\u2019s take on why insurance in Africa is not yet a thing, reiterating the need to create products that fit the African market.\n\n\u201cIf you have people with limited resources, the insurance products must be very cheap.\u201d\n\nHow Etherisc is creating cheaper decentralised insurance with blockchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the statistics on insurance in Africa showing that legacy insurance systems cannot increase insurance penetration, Berende dedicated himself to finding technologies that would make insurance affordable and exciting to Africans.\n\nOn his quest, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and came a step closer to his goal.\n\n\u201cWhat I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it makes it easy to transfer small amounts of money from A to B without a middle-man at a low cost. I delved a little more into it and discovered the technology behind it \u2014 blockchain.\u201d\n\nBerende\u2019s blockchain discovery led to another quest to create blockchain-based solutions, most of which revolve around the one thing that has popularised the technology \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, blockchain, which secures crypto transactions with a network of computers that record these transactions simultaneously, has not seen many applications beyond crypto.\n\nHowever, Etherisc started to infuse blockchain solutions beyond crypto in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t long before Berende found the team behind it.\n\nCombining his insurance background with his desire to create inclusive finance with modern technology, Berende was an automatic fit for Etherisc, and he joined the team.\n\nEtherisc created a decentralised open-source insurance platform on the Ethereum blockchain, called the Generic Insurance Framework. This framework allows for the easy digitisation of parametric insurance products.\n\nWhat is parametric insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Etherisc\n\nParametric insurance, according to Berende, is a type of insurance that executes payment based on external parameters.\n\nUsing a flight delay example, he explained that if a person insures their flight ticket against a delay, they get a payout once there\u2019s a delay.\n\nHe gave another example using a farmer. If a farm is insured against heavy rains, the farmer gets indemnified if such rains destroy their farms.\n\nInsurance companies do not dispute or investigate parametric insurance claims because the data that determines the payout is usually publicly available and unalterable.\n\nThis makes automating insurance products easy, and that is where blockchain comes into play.\n\nSmart contracts, a mechanism for carrying out blockchain actions, are a major part of Etherisc\u2019s operations. Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain to run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nA simple analogy to understanding how smart contracts work is automating your bank account to make a payment once you receive a specific delivery.\n\nSay you\u2019re expecting a truckload of yams but don\u2019t want to make payment until you have taken delivery. So you install devices in your warehouse that can tell when a certain number of tubers has been delivered. After which, these devices signal the smart contract, which initiates payment.\n\nHowever, the beauty of smart contracts is that no one \u2014 neither you nor the delivery company \u2014 can alter the predetermined condition.\n\nEtherisc has harnessed the trustless nature of this technology to create an insurance system that can work without many people. The zero delivery cost also means it is cheaper to run.\n\nNote: In this context, \u201ctrustless\u201d means the parties involved do not necessarily need to trust themselves to complete transactions.\n\nInsuring 22,000 farms with decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc partnered with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) Africa, a licensed insurance intermediary that helps farmers reduce agricultural and climate risks, to provide micro-insurance at affordable terms for smallholder farmers.\n\nA blockchain solution to insurance for farmers has to be simple to get any traction; a challenge Etherisc had a simple solution to.\n\nThe product Etherisc provides for the farmers is a weather index insurance that covers farmers when the weather prevents them from having a good harvest.\n\nAccording to Berende, 22,000 farmers in Kenya have accessed this insurance product.\n\nBut how does one distribute significantly advanced tech insurance products that are automated based on climate conditions to farmers?\n\nBerende\u2019s solution is simple. The bags of seeds that farmers buy come with scratch cards. When they send the numbers on these cards via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Etherisc\u2019s Generic Insurance Framework captures their geolocation and receives information about the area\u2019s climatic conditions with satellite data.\n\nHow do farmers pay the premium for decentralised insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACRE Africa\n\nFarmers pay the $0.5 premium when they buy their bags of seeds from ACRE at a lower price that incorporates the insurance cost. Insurance can also be paid with mobile banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to send an insurance surveyor into the field to monitor if something has happened. A process that would naturally cost a lot of money,\u201d Berende said.\n\nIs satellite data accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite\n\nWhile Etherisc\u2019s insurance products reduce dependency on humans, the reliability of the non-human parts of its operation is in question.\n\nAccording to Climate analysis with satellite versus weather station data, a paper published in 2007 by Mendelsohn et al., satellite data performs slightly better than data captured from the ground.\n\nThe paper is based on a study that examines how well satellite and weather station data explain agricultural performance. It concludes that the satellite\u2019s ability to see the entirety of a landscape makes it record more accurate data when measuring temperature.\n\nHowever, satellite data is not as precise as data obtained from the ground when measuring precipitation. While Etherisc\u2019s insurance product can accurately measure droughts, it might not measure rainfall correctly.\n\nA more recent take from the communications team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tilts towards ground thermometers rather than satellites when measuring the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nBerende, however, assures us that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cIn the past two seasons, the satellite data covered 10\u00d710 km. For this year, we\u2019re in the process of increasing the resolution to 5\u00d75 km,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking beyond the limitations of satellite technology, blockchain, the Internet of things (IoT), and other technologies could be a compelling solution to Africa\u2019s low insurance penetration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "APC, PDP primaries: The battle before the real war",
          "text": "With the announcement of the date for the presidential primaries in Nigeria\u2019s two major political parties, aspirants are now intensifying their strategies on how to clinch the ticket of their parties.\n\nWith the array of presidential aspirants already on parade, the real battle is expected to take place at the primaries.\n\nIt is also expected that the next weeks leading up to the primaries would witness serious political intrigues, alignment and realignment of forces.\n\nThere are high level consultations by aspirants who crisscross the length and breadth of the country seeking endorsements by some powerful elements, particularly from those touted to \u201cown the country.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are scheduled to hold delegate primaries next month ahead of the June 3, deadline for the submission of candidates by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nIn both parties the primaries are expected to be keenly contested among the leading aspirants, partly due to the winner-take-all kind of politics played in Nigeria.\n\nIn the last few months, several leading politicians have publicly signified their interest to contest their party presidential ticket in the two major parties.\n\nAlthough it is presumed that some of the aspirants are not serious about their ambition and are only in the race to negotiate their political future, no aspirant will go to bed and sleep on the assumption that other aspirants were featherweight contestants.\n\nObservers also said that part of the reason the primaries would be a battle is the high cost of the nomination forms.\n\n\u201cWhat may likely raise the tempo of the contest at the primary level is the high cost of forms. Even the PDP where the form was sold for N40million, an aspirant losing such an amount of money would feel it for some days.\n\nEven if the money did not come from their pocket, those who contributed the money for them were expecting that they would reap someday.\n\nThen, in the APC, N100million form is not a joke, especially when there is no guarantee or promise of any form of refund in the event that an aspirant fails to clinch the ticket. So, it is going to be a serious battle,\u201d Rufus Onye, a grassroots politician, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe APC last week fixed its presidential nomination and expression of interest forms at N100 million.\n\nThe expression of interest form for presidential aspirants is expected to go for N30 million while the nomination form is pegged at N70 million.\n\nThis, however, contrasts with the N40 million that the main opposition party, the PDP, is charging its presidential aspirants, comprising N35 million for nomination forms and N5 million for expression of interest forms.\n\nIn the PDP, there are seventeen top politicians jostling for the ticket at the presidential primary slated for May 29.\n\nSome of the aspirants are former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar; Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal; a United States-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze; Newspaper publisher, Dele Momodu; Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike; Investment Banker and Economist, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel and a Pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa.\n\nAlso in the APC, several notable politicians have declared interest in clinching the presidential ticket they are, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; former Abia governor and serving senator, Orji Uzor Kalu, former Imo governor and senator, Rochas Okorocha, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Transport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, among others.\n\nVoting at the primaries is expected to be done by delegates, an affair that has often witnessed moneybags politicians deploy funds to bribe or secure the votes of the delegates.\n\nHowever, since incumbent governors are in control of the party structure in their states, they often hold the ace in party primaries in Nigerian politics in the last few decades.\n\nThis makes their support crucial for any aspirant to emerge victorious.\n\nAhead of the primaries in the two parties, observers say that the support of incumbent governors and the aspirants\u2019 ability to win the heart of Northern delegates which often are the majority would be crucial for success.\n\nThey said that the presidential aspirants would need to get substantial numbers of the governors to their side.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about negotiation and renegotiation; they have to consult and re-consult the party\u2019s delegates to seek their votes during the primaries. Mind you, the delegates\u2019 list and most often the governors control the delegates on how and who to vote for,\u201d Kunle Okunola, a political analyst, said.\n\nOkunola added that the presidential aspirants\u2019 strong relationships with the governors and some members of the National Assembly hold the ace in party primaries in Nigerian politics.\n\n\u201cI know by now, many aspirants would have promised and assured the governors and NASS members of some advantages if they emerge victorious in 2023.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about negotiation and renegotiation, so several bargaining will definitely be going on right now both in the APC and the PDP,\u201d he added.\n\nSimilarly, Public Affairs Analyst, Tinu Oke, said having the backing of North delegates would be crucial towards the victory of any aspirant at the primaries since they would form the bulk of the delegates.\n\nHe, however, stressed that the delegates and the party would want an individual with wide support nationally and strong financial strength so that they can do well in the main election.\n\nRead also: Nomination fee: PDP sees APC inflicting maximum pain on members\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is worthy of note that the North would be another factor. As it is constituted in both parties, the north controls 60 percent of the delegates while the south controls 40 percent.\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is that whoever the North supports would definitely emerge the candidate because the region is known for its unity in any presidential convention.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, the real battle would be for Northern votes, adding that in most instances the Northern leaders know who they are supporting.\n\n\u201cIn the South, the story is different because the major candidates can only get delegates from their geo-political zone.\n\n\u201cSo, it will be a battle for Northern votes and the northern leaders Know who they are supporting.\n\n\u201cMoney would be a defining factor in the primaries both in APC and PDP because both parties are setting for delegate convention,\u201d Oke stressed.\n\nBut Aloysius-Michaels Okolie, a professor of Political Science, berated the manner primaries are being conducted in the country, noting that the current practices where governors hijack delegates was not healthy for democracy and had contributed to bad governance and the emergence of irresponsive and irresponsible leaders.\n\nHe advocated for a holistic change in the manner presidential primaries are conducted in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThat is why they want indirect primaries; what we have is a system where few people, I mean cabal, would just choose who they want as delegates and these people would go on and do blind voting according to what the governors say.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason why Nigeria is like this, leaders have failed; they distorted governance and it is undemocratic and would not lead us anywhere.\u201d\n\nUnlike President Buhari\u2019s intervention before the APC\u2019s recent National Convention where he anointed Abdullahi Adamu as the consensus candidate for the party\u2019s national chairman, he has said nothing about anointing any of the Presidential aspirants before the convention. But he has recently advised the Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to provide a level playing field for all aspirants during the primaries.\n\nIn APC, the game is still open despite the talks about \u201canointing\u201d by President Buhari. Buhari\u2019s influence, if there will be any, would be seen after the primaries.\n\nBusinessDaySunday gathered that it is difficult for any of the APC aspirants to go to bed with the mindset that he is the preferred candidate of the President, as anything can happen within a matter of minutes.\n\nThe politician, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, referred to what happened to the former governor Peter Odili, who had begun to parade himself as the would-be running mate to Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, but the arrangement changed in a twinkle of an eye right at the venue of the Convention in 2007.\n\n\u201cGovernor Peter Odili waited at the Eagle Square with the delegates from Rivers State, to hear the last word if anything could change. There was a lot of going forward and backwards; a lot of wheeling and dealing. It was a political coup as far as he was concerned. In every political gathering all over the world, there are intrigues; a lot of things happen. Nothing is sacrosanct until the primary is over. It is a game that the person that comes to smile at you now, the next moment, when he wants to vote changes his mind and drops his ballot for another person, and you are still thinking he has voted for you,\u201d the politician said.\n\nIn PDP also, observers say that unless there is consensus before the primaries, it would be a fight to the finish.\n\nKingsley Aru, a political scientist, said that with the level of desperation that some of the aspirants on the PDP platform are going about their aspiration, it could be a bitter primary, except reason prevails towards the day of the exercise.\n\n\u201cI hear that there are talks going on among some aspirants on who would step down for whom? If that succeeds and the decide and resolve to work together as a party, PDP may have a chance of winning the Presidential election in 2023 because a lot of public sentiment is leaning towards them as a result of certain considerations,\u201d Aru said.",
          "summary": "With the array of presidential aspirants already on parade, the real battle is expected to take place at the primaries.\nIn the last few months, several leading politicians have publicly signified their interest to contest their party presidential ticket in the two major parties.\nThe expression of interest form for presidential aspirants is expected to go for N30 million while the nomination form is pegged at N70 million.\n\u201cMoney would be a defining factor in the primaries both in APC and PDP because both parties are setting for delegate convention,\u201d Oke stressed.\nHe advocated for a holistic change in the manner presidential primaries are conducted in Nigeria.",

The newly deployed CP takes over from Philip Ogbadu who retired from the force after 35 years of service.\n\nThe governor during the visit, along with the CP, decorated 10 newly promoted police officers.\n\nObaseki said as a result of the increased collaboration with the NPF, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba has deployed a special tactical team to complement the government\u2019s efforts at restoring peace and sanity across Edo communities.\n\nThe governor who described the issue of land grabbing in various communities in the state as worrisome, said the IGP will deploy special squads to assist in restoring sanity to communities across the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cI thank the IGP for deploying two police special squads to Edo State. We would soon inspect their accommodation as they will be deployed to the state in the next few weeks. This squad will deal with community issues and issues of land grabbing. We need your support and that of the area command. I have spoken with the AIG who assured us that all land cases that come to the area command will be referred to the Edo Command.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with the issue of land grabbing squarely as it is impeding development in Edo State. We have a land committee in place, which is currently reviewing cases before it. We are making resources available to fight this menace in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki, who urged the new CP to develop a mechanism to forestall electoral violence during the forthcoming Presidential elections, added, \u201cAs we prepare for another set of elections, we want to work with you to design a system that will not allow electoral violence in Edo State.\n\n\u201cWe want to tackle electoral violence. We must have a peaceful election; both pre and post-electioneering activities must be peaceful in Edo State. Election is not war and we don\u2019t see reasons why people take up arms during this process.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI have been told that you have been putting in place an action programme to mop up those causing trouble for us, especially at the Ovia axis in the state.\n\n\u201cThe key to our security success in the state is hinged on the synergy and collaboration among security agencies in the state and the police is the apex. Once we have a very cooperative and open CP who is ready to work with other sister agencies in the state, it will help tackle the security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to invest in the security system and security architecture, and also support you in terms of logistics, equipment and operations.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Yaro noted, \u201cI am here to thank you for the top-notch security architecture on the ground which I have noticed with satisfaction and ready to key in to advance the cause of stability and security in Edo State.\u201d\n\nThe Edo CP also thanked the governor for his relentless support to security agencies in the state, pledging to work with the government to sustain peace and security.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "WBC champion Tyson Fury produced a stunning one-punch stoppage in the sixth round to beat fellow Briton Dillian Whyte, and then suggested he may now retire from the sport.\n\nFury dominated what was a scrappy bout and then unleashed a vicious right uppercut.\n\nWhyte, admirably, got to his feet within the count before staggering into the referee as the fight was halted.\n\n\u201cThis might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King,\u201d Fury said post-fight.\n\nFury \u2013 who also retained his Ring Magazine belt \u2013 is unbeaten in 33 bouts, while Whyte \u2013 suffering his third loss in 31 bouts \u2013 falls short on his first attempt at a world title.\n\nIf Fury does decide to hang up the gloves, the 33-year-old will miss out on an opportunity to fight for the undisputed crown \u2013 a fight which could potentially be staged later this year \u2013 and a chance to cement his status as Britain\u2019s greatest ever heavyweight.\n\n\u201cI promised my wife that would be it after the [Deontay] Wilder fight,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I got offered a fight at Wembley and I owed it to the fans. What a way to go out.\u201d\n\nRecord crowd witnesses Fury\u2019s greatest punch\n\nWith 94,000 fans in attendance \u2013 a post-war British record \u2013 there was an electric atmosphere like no other for a fight dubbed by some as the greatest all-British heavyweight dust-up in history.\n\nBoos echoed around the iconic stadium as a pumped-up Whyte let out his trademark wolf-like howl before walking to the ring.\n\nFury\u2019s ring walk was extravagant. It began to the tune of Don McLean\u2019s \u2018American Pie\u2019, soon turned into \u2018Juicy\u2019 by Notorious B.I.G and ended on \u2018Sex on Fire\u2019 by Kings of Leon. Fury then sat on a throne as fireworks blasted skywards, before heading towards the ring.\n\nHe towered over Whyte as the two men touched gloves. Fury teased before the fight that he could switch to southpaw and neutralise Whyte\u2019s dangerous left hook but, surprisingly, it was Whyte who came out as a southpaw in a cagey opening round.\n\nIt was then Fury\u2019s turn to switch from orthodox in the second as the battle of mind games continued, with the champion edging the opening two rounds.\n\nHe landed with a solid two-punch combination in the third, prompting Whyte to charge at the champion. But the challenger could not get close to Fury, who used his height and reach advantage to keep Whyte at bay as the fight progressed.\n\nThe contest truly heated up in a spicy fourth round. Whyte connected when asked to break, which clearly agitated Fury.\n\nThe fighters twice received a telling off from Mark Lyson, as the referee struggled to control the two men who boast a combined weight of 37 stone.\n\nWhyte\u2019s telegraphed overhand rights were getting nowhere close to the elusive Fury, who was connecting with ease.\n\nThen came arguably Fury\u2019s greatest punch of what is proving to be an illustrious career. He teed it up with a left jab and as Whyte stepped forward, Fury whipped in the brutal uppercut.\n\nWhyte fell back on the canvas. He channelled the warrior spirit he spoke of before the fight but, as he made it to his feet, was clearly in no position to continue.\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\nPrint\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This is perhaps, the largest collection of bankers on the FMBN that I can remember in a long time.\u201d the Minister said.\n\nHe also advised the Board and Management to promptly engage with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and ensure FMBN\u2019s compliance with regulatory stipulations for operating as a Bank.

          "text": "By Emmanuel Obisue\n\nPresident of the World Bank Group, David Malpass has asked the Federal Government to have a rethink on its policy on fuel subsidy, stating that the huge amount being expended on the policy could be channeled into other critical sectors.\n\nMalpass noted this on Wednesday at a media briefing at the ongoing World Bank/International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC, United States.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Nigerian Senate last week approved N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated February 10, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nAccording to Malpass, generalised subsidies have significant negative effects on any system. Thus, he reiterated the need for the country to do away with the multiple exchange rate system, which he said is \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there was a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort.\n\n\u201cThe most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help,\u201d he noted.\n\nMalpass further noted that Nigeria also has trade barriers that continue to distort trade and capital flows. He urged the Nigerian Government to improve to help the country and its people move forward.\n\n\u201cI take note of the complicated situation that they face where there are weapons flowing into northern Africa that find their way into non Nigerians that create violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a very challenging situation that the government faces. I think all over the world, people should have an understanding of the fragility that is facing several parts of the world, but in particular, the Sahel and the Sub-Saharan Africa area where the weapons flow from outside of Africa are putting a great burden on governments around the continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge opportunity because of its natural resources and because of its people, and I think I could see its growth accelerate with improvements in policy,\u201d he added while commenting on the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe World Bank had in November 2021 warned Nigeria not to delay any further in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has sued President Muhammadu Buhari over his failure to order the unblocking of millions of telecommunication subscribers barred from making calls on their SIMs.\n\nThis is coming two weeks after the group issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the Federal Government to unblock millions of unregistered lines, following a recent directive for telecommunications companies to block outgoing calls on all unlinked lines, as the deadline for the verification expired on March 31.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/711/2022 filed at the Federal High Court in Lagos, SERAP sought an order to set aside the directive by Buhari to telecommunications companies to block outgoing calls on all unlinked lines without due process of law.\n\nSERPA joined the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, and his Communications and Digital Economy counterpart, Isa Pantami as respondents in the suit.\n\nREAD ALSO: SERAP Gives FG 48-Hour Ultimatum To Unblock Millions Of Unregistered SIMs\n\n\u201cWhile Nigerian authorities have a legal responsibility to protect, ensure and secure the rights to life and property, any such responsibility ought to be discharged in conformity with human rights standards,\u201d the suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part.\n\n\u201cFundamental rights are regarded as part of human rights and are protected to enhance human dignity and liberty.\n\n\u201cUnblocking the phone lines unlawfully barred from making calls would improve respect for the rule of law, and ensure people\u2019s right to freedom of expression, and access to information, as well as their right to associate with others.\n\n\u201cThe blocking of people from making calls constitutes impermissible restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, information, and association.\n\n\u201cThe rights to freedom of opinion and expression and access to information are protected under section 39 of the Nigerian Constitution, article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act.\n\n\u201cThese rights must be protected online as they are protected offline. Any restriction on these rights must be provided by law, be necessary for a democratic society and serve a legitimate aim.\n\n\u201cThe blocking of people from making calls on their SIMs also amounts to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their right to family life, and socio-economic rights, as it unnecessarily or disproportionately interferes with these fundamental human rights.\n\n\u201cThe decision to block the phone lines also appears to be arbitrary and lacks any legal framework, independent and judicial oversight. This may allow authorities to act in an unfettered and potentially arbitrary or unlawful manner.\n\n\u201cUnder international human rights law, States including Nigeria \u2018shall not engage in or condone any disruption of access to digital technologies for segments of the public or an entire population.\u2019 States must refrain from cutting off access to telecommunications services.\n\n\u201cMillions of Nigerians including persons with disabilities, elderly citizens, persons living in remote areas have been unable to capture their biometrics, and obtain their NINs due to logistical challenges, administrative and bureaucratic burdens, as well as the persistent collapse of the national grid.\n\n\u201cThe rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and freedom of association, whether offline or online, promote the democratic ideal by allowing citizens to voice their concerns, challenge governmental institutions, and hold the government accountable for its actions.\u201d",

          "text": "The Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, has been buried in the ancient town of Oyo in south-west Nigeria.\n\nHis remains were laid to rest on Saturday within the premises of the palace, barely a day after he was certified dead in a hospital in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital.\n\nAlaafin, popularly known as \u2018Iku Baba Yeye, was 83 years as of the time his death was announced.\n\nFollowing the announcement of his demise, Islamic rites were conducted on the body of late Alaafin, signalling the beginning of his final journey home.\n\nIslamic clerics led by the Chief Imam of Oyo town were joined by members of the family of the late traditional ruler and some of his chiefs to offer prayers for the repose of his soul.\n\nAfter the prayers, his body was taken back to the palace where the final burial was held.\n\nAn Oyo prince and a close relative of the Alaafin, Archbishop Ayo Ladigbolu, confirmed the burial of the monarch to Channels Television.\n\n\ufeff\n\n52-Year Reign\n\nThe news of the death of the top Yoruba traditional ruler broke on Saturday morning hours after he died at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital in Ado Ekiti.\n\nAlaafin Adeyemi, who served as the permanent chairperson of the Oyo State Council of Obas and Chiefs, was reportedly sick and was scheduled to be flown abroad for treatment before he joined his ancestors on Friday.\n\nHe was the third to ascend the throne from the Alowolodu Ruling House and ruled for 52 years \u2013 making him the longest-reigning traditional ruler in Oyo town.\n\nAlaafin was born Lamidi Olayiwola Atanda Adeyemi on October 15, 1938, and succeeded Oba Gbadegesin Ladigbolu I, as the new Alaafin on November 18, 1970.\n\nFollowing his demise, the Bashorun of Oyo and Head of the \u2018Oyo Mesi\u2019, Yusuf Akinade, is expected to lead Oyo town before a new Alaafin would be installed.\n\nThe monarch died months after the death of two other top traditional rulers in the state \u2013 the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, and the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi.\n\nWhile Oba Olalekan Balogun has been crowned as the 42nd Olubadan of Ibadan land, the people of Ogbomoso have yet to get a new traditional ruler.\n\nA Golden King\n\nReacting to the death of the traditional ruler, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State declared that the incident was a huge loss to the state, Nigeria, and the Yoruba race.\n\nHe described Oba Adeyemi\u2019s death as a personal loss to him, adding that he was an ever-supportive royal father and a worthy leader who spared nothing in trying to make Oyo State and Nigeria greater.\n\nThe governor, who said Alaafin\u2019s words of advice and guidance were always golden and helpful, condoled with the Oyo State Traditional Council, the Oyomesi, Oba Adeyemi\u2019s immediate family, the people of Oyo Kingdom, and the entire Yoruba race and prayed to God to grant repose to the soul of the departed monarch.\n\nHe stated that apart from Oyo State losing its last man standing in the rank of experienced monarchs with long years of royal leadership, it has also lost a royal institution and an authority, which Alaafin had become by virtue of his high-octane understanding of Yoruba history, politics, and national development.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi was our last man standing in the rank of most eminent royal fathers with long years of leadership,\u201d the governor said. \u201cHe became a golden king, an institution and an authority rolled into one by virtue of his immense experience, wisdom and understanding of Yoruba history, royalty, and politics.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi not only elevated the Alaafin throne with his knowledge and wisdom, but he also became a worthy exemplar for royal leadership in Africa and brought glory to Oyo State and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cKabiyesi never spared anything in his strive to make Oyo State greater and to bring about the Nigeria of everyone\u2019s collective dream.\u201d\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo is also among prominent leaders who have paid tribute to the late Alaafin whom he said was a symbol of Nigeria\u2019s epic struggle for self-discovery and self-actualisation.\n\nObasanjo, in a letter, condoled with Governor Makinde, the family of Oba Adeyemi, and the entire people of Oyo on the transition.\n\nHe stated that the late highly revered monarch was a patriotic and respected traditional ruler who had immeasurable love for his people and great faith in a united Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe (Alaafin) stood out as a voice of forthrightness in national affairs, and he was as well a fervent promoter of mutual tolerance and understanding, not only among the diverse people who live in his domain but also across the country,\u201d the elder statesman was quoted as saying in a statement by his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi.\n\nAccording to him, it was during Oba Adeyemi\u2019s reign that Oyo town got transformed into the modern city that it has become and his contribution to nation-building was also acknowledged in the conferment of the esteemed national honour of Commander of the Federal Republic, CFR, on him and other honorary degrees that he received from Nigerian and outside educational institutions.",

          "text": "French voters began casting their ballots Sunday for the presidential run-off between centrist incumbent Emmanuel Macron and his challenger Marine Le Pen, after a fractious campaign that has seen the far-right come its closest yet to winning power.\n\nMacron went into the election with a stable lead in opinion polls, an advantage he consolidated in the frenetic final days of campaigning, including a no-holds-barred performance in the pre-election debate.\n\nBut analysts have cautioned that Macron, who rose to power in 2017 aged 39 as the country\u2019s youngest-ever modern leader, can take nothing for granted given forecasts of low turnout that could sway the result in either direction.\n\nHe must above all hope that left-wing voters who backed other candidates in the first round on April 10 will back the former investment banker and his pro-business, reformist agenda to stop Le Pen and her populist programme.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Dead, 16 Missing In Japan Sightseeing Boat Accident\n\nVoting stations will close at 8:00 pm (1800 GMT), when preliminary results will be released that usually predict the final result with a high degree of accuracy.\n\nSome 48.7 million French are eligible to vote.\n\nTo take account of the time difference with mainland France, polls opened earlier in overseas territories, home to almost three million French.\n\nThe first vote in the election was cast midday on Saturday, Paris time, by a 90-year-old man in the tiny island territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, off the northern coast of Canada.\n\nPolls subsequently opened in France\u2019s islands in the Caribbean and the South American territory of French Guiana, followed by territories in the Pacific and then the Indian Ocean.\n\nTurnout Key\n\nMacron himself repeatedly made clear that the complacency of stay-at-home voters precipitated the shocks of the 2016 elections that led to Brexit in Britain and Donald Trump\u2019s election in the United States.\n\nAnalysts say abstention rates could reach 26 to 28 percent, though the 1969 record for a second-round abstention rate of 31.1 percent is not expected to be beaten.\n\nFar-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, who scored a close third-place finish in the first-round vote, has pointedly refused to urge his millions of followers to back Macron while insisting they should not vote for Le Pen.\n\nAnother factor is that elections are being held in the midst of the Easter school break in much of France.\n\nAccording to Martial Foucault, director of the CEVIPOF political studies centre, a high abstention rate will narrow the gap between Macron and Le Pen, describing this as a \u201creal risk\u201d for the president.\n\nEarly turnout indications will be closely watched from the overseas territories, where average incomes are lower than in mainland France and which generally backed Melenchon in the first round.\n\nIn New Caledonia, for example, turnout at midday was just 18.2 percent. In mainland France, the first turnout estimation will be published at 12:00 pm.\n\nHigh Stakes\n\nThe stakes are huge for both France and Europe, with Macron pledging reform and tighter EU integration while Le Pen, who would be France\u2019s first female president, insists the bloc should be modified in what opponents describe as \u201cFrexit\u201d by another name.\n\nMacron has also opposed Le Pen\u2019s plan to make it illegal to wear the Muslim headscarf in public, though her team has walked back on the proposal ahead of the vote, saying it was no longer a \u201cpriority.\u201d\n\nThey have also clashed on Russia, with Macron seeking to portray Le Pen as incapable of dealing with the invasion of Ukraine due to a loan her party took from a Russian-Czech bank.\n\nMacron would be the first French president to win re-election in two decades since Jacques Chirac in 2002.\n\nIf elected, he is expected to address supporters on the Champ de Mars in central Paris at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nPolls have shown Macron with a lead of around 10 percentage points, a much closer outcome than in 2017, when the same two candidates faced off and Macron carried the day with 66 percent of the vote.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Shanghai authorities battling an outbreak of COVID-19 have erected fences outside residential buildings, sparking fresh public outcry over a lockdown that has forced much of the city\u2019s 25 million people indoors.\n\nImages of white hazmat suit-clad workers sealing entrances of housing blocks and closing off entire streets with roughly two metre-tall green fencing went viral on social media, prompting questions and complaints from residents.\n\n\u201cThis is so disrespectful of the rights of the people inside, using metal barriers to enclose them like domestic animals,\u201d said one user on social media platform Weibo.\n\nOne video showed residents shouting from balconies at workers trying to set up fencing before relenting and taking it away. Other videos showed people trying to pull fences down.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this a fire hazard?\u201d asked another Weibo user.\n\nMany of the fences were erected around compounds designated \u201csealed areas\u201d \u2013 buildings where at least one person tested positive for COVID-19, meaning residents are forbidden from leaving their front doors.\n\nIt was not clear what prompted authorities to resort to fencing. A notice dated Saturday from one local authority shared online said it was imposing \u201chard quarantine\u201d in some areas.\n\nReuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the notice or all of the images, but saw green fencing on a street in central Shanghai on Sunday.\n\nThis week, Reuters has also seen police in hazmat suits patrolling Shanghai streets, setting up road blocks and asking pedestrians to return home.\n\nThe Shanghai government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMISERY\n\nChina\u2019s most populous city and most important economic hub is battling the country\u2019s biggest COVID-19 outbreak with a policy that forces all positive cases into quarantine centres.\n\nThe lockdown, which for many residents has lasted over three weeks, has fuelled frustration over access to food and medical care, lost wages, family separation and quarantine conditions.\n\nIt has also dragged on the world\u2019s second-largest economy, with factory production disrupted by snarled supply chains and difficulties faced by locked-down residents returning to work. read more\n\nShanghai is carrying out daily citywide COVID-19 tests and accelerating transfer of positive cases to central facilities to eradicate virus transmission outside quarantine areas.\n\nIn the past week, authorities have also transferred entire communities, including uninfected people, saying they need to disinfect their homes, according to residents and social media posts.\n\nMany residents have turned to the internet to vent about the lockdown and express dissent, using euphemisms and other means to battle government censors who often remove content critical of the authorities.\n\nVideos of \u201cDo You Hear The People Sing?\u201d, a protest anthem from \u201cLes Miserables\u201d, have been widely reposted, with the title of the French musical receiving over 90 million mentions on WeChat on Saturday, the chat app\u2019s data showed.\n\nShanghai reported 39 COVID-19 deaths for April 23, versus 12 a day earlier and by far the most during the current outbreak.\n\nIt did not report any deaths in the first few weeks, fuelling doubt among residents about the figures. It has since reported 87 fatalities, all in the past seven days.\n\nThe city recorded 19,657 new locally transmitted asymptomatic cases, versus 20,634 a day prior, and 1,401 symptomatic, versus 2,736.\n\nCases outside quarantined areas totalled 280 from 218 on the previous day. Other cities that have been under lockdown began easing restrictions once cases hit zero.\n\nChina largely succeeded in keeping COVID-19 at bay following the initial outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019, with a \u201cdynamic zero\u201d policy aimed at stamping out chains of infection.\n\nThat approach has been challenged by the spread of the highly infectious but less deadly Omicron variant, which has prompted cities to impose various levels of restrictions on movement.\n\nNationwide, China reported 20,285 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases for Saturday, versus 21,423 a day earlier, with 1,580 symptomatic cases, versus 2,988.\n\nBeijing recorded 22 new COVID-19 cases \u2013 all locally transmitted \u2013 compared with six the day before, prompting a number of gyms and after-school activity providers to suspend in-person classes.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "French voters are heading to the polls to decide whether to give centrist Emmanuel Macron five more years as president or replace him with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.\n\nAfter a divisive election campaign, Ms Le Pen faces an uphill battle with her 44-year-old opponent polling ahead.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIn order to win they both need to attract voters who backed other candidates in the first round.\n\nBut these are two polarising figures in France and abstention is a key factor.\n\nMr Macron\u2019s detractors call him arrogant and a president of the rich, while the far-right leader has been accused of having ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPolls opened in the run-off vote at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and 48.7 million people are eligible to take part. First projections of who has won will come at 20:00.\n\nMr Macron rose to power on a whirlwind promise of change, but many complain they are yet to see it. His presidency has been buffeted by protests, the Covid pandemic and now the rising cost of living.\n\nMarine Le Pen, meanwhile, has learned from the mistakes she made when she was resoundingly beaten by the same opponent in the second round in 2017. This is her third tilt at the presidency and if she fails it could be her last.\n\nThe great unknown in this election is how many voters will refuse to back either candidate, whether by casting a blank ballot or not turning out at all. Much of France is on holiday and turnout could be historically low.\n\nThe campaign has been short but the choice for voters is clear, between a pro-European sitting president and a nationalist candidate who seeks to ban the headscarf and restrict immigration.\n\nWhatever the result, Mr Macron will address voters on Sunday evening from a stage at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\u2018This place is dead after 7pm\u2019\n\nThe rising cost of living \u2013 described in France as pouvoir d\u2019achat or spending power \u2013 has become the number one issue for French voters and Marine Le Pen has promised voters an immediate onslaught on it if she wins.\n\nShe has fared particularly well in the smaller towns and rural areas that have struggled economically during the Macron era.\n\nShe came top two weeks ago in La Fert\u00e9-sous-Jouarre, a pretty town on the River Marne an hour east of Paris. Sitting outside a bar, C\u00e9cile says the pandemic hit the area particularly hard: \u201cBefore Covid there was a bar here called Avenue de Champagne, but that shut and now the place is dead after 7pm.\u201d\n\nShe will vote Le Pen as will Fred, who works on the Paris metro network: \u201cPeople can\u2019t afford to pay for gas and electricity. When I\u2019m in Paris some things are too expensive and you have to eat.\u201d African immigrants he knows in the capital also say they will vote for her, he adds.\n\nThere are plenty of shy Le Pen voters here too. France needs to change, they say, and they leave it at that.\n\nShe has carefully moderated her views, but still plans a referendum on strict immigration controls and her idea for a \u201cEurope of nations\u201d would tear the EU apart.\n\nJean-Claude, 66, may not agree with her hostility to the EU, but he complains too many people take advantage of France\u2019s welfare system and take drugs.\n\nLe Pen and Putin\n\nAcross France Emmanuel Macron is particularly popular with younger and older voters, and that is the case in La Fert\u00e9 too.\n\nApprentice accountant S\u00e9r\u00e9na, 18, is worried about the war in Ukraine: \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what Le Pen feels about Putin. Changing president would destabilise the situation now.\u201d\n\nNicole, 76, runs a library in a nearby village and she has noticed many people turning to the far right. \u201cI\u2019m not so worried about her, more about the people behind her \u2013 her lieutenants.\u201d\n\nMs Le Pen fares less well in the big cities, like Paris and Lyon, where her opponent led in the second round. But what could decide this election is who secures the support of almost 22% of the electorate who voted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon.\n\nHe was narrowly beaten by Marine Le Pen but won in cities including Marseille and Nantes.\n\nThe town of Trappes, to the south-west of Paris, is a M\u00e9lenchon stronghold where Le Pen voters are in short supply.\n\nOutside the local shops, a woman in a hijab condemns the far-right\u2019s policies as racist. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote blank,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a popular idea that is seen as a protest vote that benefits neither candidate. On reflection she adds she might back Mr Macron, or even not vote at all.\n\nMany M\u00e9lenchon voters here appear undecided. Outside a nursery school, Murad says he might vote blank too. \u201cMacron is more for the rich than the poor,\u201d he says, before adding that he could still vote for him.\n\nUnemployment may be down and purchasing power may be higher than in 2017, but many voters on the left are disillusioned with the sitting president for cutting housing aid to millions of low earners and abolishing a wealth tax that targeted millionaires.\n\nWhen Emmanuel Macron swept to power, it was on the promise of change.

          "text": "WBC champion Tyson Fury produced a stunning one-punch stoppage in the sixth round to beat fellow Briton Dillian Whyte and then insisted he will retire from boxing.\n\nFury dominated what was a scrappy bout and then unleashed a vicious right uppercut.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nWhyte, admirably, got to his feet within the count before staggering into the referee as the fight was halted.\n\n\u201cThis might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King,\u201d Fury said post-fight.\n\nHe added later: \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the road. I\u2019ve been away for a long time. I fulfilled everything I\u2019ve ever wanted to fulfil.\n\n\u201cI will retire as only the second heavyweight in history, after Rocky Marciano, to retire undefeated. I was unbeatable at this game.\u201d\n\nFury \u2013 who also retained his Ring Magazine belt \u2013 is unbeaten in 33 bouts, while Whyte \u2013 suffering his third loss in 31 fights \u2013 fell short on his first attempt at a world title.\n\nIf Fury does decide to hang up the gloves, the 33-year-old will miss out on an opportunity to fight for the undisputed crown \u2013 a fight which could potentially be staged later this year \u2013 and a chance to cement his status as Britain\u2019s greatest ever heavyweight.\n\n\u201cI promised my wife that would be it after the [Deontay] Wilder fight,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I got offered a fight at Wembley and I owed it to the fans. What a way to go out.\u201d\n\nWith 94,000 fans in attendance \u2013 a post-war British record \u2013 there was an electric atmosphere like no other for a fight dubbed by some as the greatest all-British heavyweight dust-up in history.\n\nBoos echoed around the iconic stadium as a pumped-up Whyte let out his trademark wolf-like howl before walking to the ring.\n\nFury\u2019s ring walk was extravagant. It began to the tune of Don McLean\u2019s \u2018American Pie\u2019, soon turned into \u2018Juicy\u2019 by Notorious B.I.G and ended on \u2018Sex on Fire\u2019 by Kings of Leon. Fury then sat on a throne as fireworks blasted skywards, before heading towards the ring.\n\nHe towered over Whyte as the two men touched gloves. Fury teased before the fight that he could switch to southpaw and neutralise Whyte\u2019s dangerous left hook but, surprisingly, it was Whyte who came out as a southpaw in a cagey opening round.\n\nIt was then Fury\u2019s turn to switch from orthodox in the second as the battle of mind games continued, with the champion edging the opening two rounds.\n\nHe landed with a solid two-punch combination in the third, prompting Whyte to charge at his opponent. But the challenger could not get close to Fury, who used his height and reach advantage to keep Whyte at bay as the fight progressed.\n\nThe contest truly heated up in a spicy fourth round. Whyte connected when asked to break, which clearly agitated Fury.\n\nThe fighters twice received a telling off from Mark Lyson, as the referee struggled to control the two men who boast a combined weight of 37 stone.\n\nWhyte\u2019s telegraphed overhand rights were getting nowhere close to the elusive Fury, who was connecting with ease.\n\nThen came arguably Fury\u2019s greatest punch of what is proving to be an illustrious career. He teed it up with a left jab and as Whyte stepped forward, Fury whipped in the brutal uppercut.\n\nWhyte fell back on the canvas. He channelled the warrior spirit he spoke of before the fight but, as he made it to his feet, was clearly in no position to continue.\n\nFury, as expected, took the microphone and treated fans to his own rendition of \u2018American Pie\u2019 in the ring following his victory.\n\nIt was a singsong to end the perfect homecoming party for the Morecambe-based fighter, who was boxing in the United Kingdom for the first time since 2018.\n\nHe said before the fight that this would be his last. That by boxing at Wembley he had reached his pinnacle.\n\nMany in the sport took those comments with a touch of scepticism \u2013 it is something he said several times before \u2013 but it seems Fury is sticking to his word.\n\nHis compatriot Anthony Joshua is likely to rematch Ukraine\u2019s WBA, IBF and WBO champion Oleksandr Usyk this summer.\n\nThe lure of fighting the winner for all the belts \u2013 and the lucrative nature it brings, particularly if Joshua is victorious \u2013 could just tempt Fury to halt his retirement plans.\n\nA career of highs and lows\n\nIf this is the end, however, it is a remarkable career from a man who at 6ft 9in and 19 stone has an ability to glide across the ring resembling an elegant ballroom dancer. His style, for his size, is unmatched.\n\nHe is a boxer who went from narrowly beating John McDermott on points for the English title in Brentwood to becoming a unified world champion, shocking long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in Germany in 2015.\n\nA boxer who came back from over two and half years out of the sport and reclaimed a heavyweight title, cracking America and sharing arguably one of the greatest trilogies in the sport with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe has entertained reporters by dressing up as batman or taping his mouth shut at media conferences. Fury even had time to join the scripted world of professional wrestling.\n\nIn the second coming of his career, Fury has spoken openly about \u2013 and become an advocate for \u2013 mental health struggles.\n\nBut his career has not been short of controversy. Not long after his first world title, Fury made homophobic and sexist remarks during an interview.\n\nHe previously tested positive for a banned steroid \u2013 something he blamed on eating uncastrated wild boar \u2013 and later admitted to use of drink and drugs to help deal with depression.\n\nMore recently, his fight with Whyte had been somewhat overshadowed by Fury\u2019s links to Daniel Kinahan, who earlier this month was among seven people hit with worldwide financial sanctions by the United States.\n\nFury had previously been advised by Kinahan but this week insisted he has \u201cabsolutely zero\u201d involvement with the Irishman.\n\nIt has been a career full of highs and lows. But despite the retirement, seeing the Gypsy King in a ring again \u2013 with potentially an opportunity to cement his status as the greatest British heavyweight in history \u2013 is wholly possible.\n\nWhat next for Whyte?\n\nApart from the few months following his defeat to Alexander Povetkin in 2020, which he then avenged, 34-year-old Whyte had been mandatory challenger for the WBC belt since 2017.\n\n\u201cDillian is a warrior and I believe he will be a world champion,\u201d Fury said as he and Whyte embraced post-fight.\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest and, unfortunately, he had to fight me tonight. You are not messing with a mediocre heavyweight, you are messing with the best man on the planet.\u201d\n\nSince his first career defeat to rival Joshua in 2015, Whyte has proven his world-level credentials with wins over the likes of Joseph Parker and Povetkin. He is still a big draw in the sport.\n\nA rematch with rival Joshua, should he lose against Usyk, is easy to sell and one which could capture the imagination of boxing fans.\n\nTime will tell what the future has in store for Whyte, but the night belonged to Fury \u2013 one of, if not the greatest British heavyweight of all time and a future hall-of-famer.",

          "title": "Clearing Agents to Shut down Nigerian Ports on Monday Over 15% Levy on Imported Vehicles",
          "text": "Clearing agents under the aegis of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) have resolved to embark on a warning strike from Monday, April 25.\n\nThe Chairman of ANLCA Taskforce, Mr. Rilwan Amuni, announced the strike action in a circular issued at the weekend in Lagos.\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) had recently introduced a 15-per cent National Automobile Commission (NAC) levy on used imported vehicles, but this did not go down well with clearing agents in the country\u2019s maritime sector.\n\nThe National Public Relations Officer of Customs, Timi Bomodi, said the move was in line with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Common external tariff, 2017-2021.\n\nBomodi said in a statement that the service migrated from the old version of the ECOWAS CAT to the new version, adding that this was in line with the World Customs Organisation\u2019s five-year review of its nomenclature.\n\n\u201cOn Friday, April 1, 2022, the Nigeria Customs Service migrated from the old version of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff (2017- 2021) to the new version (2022- 2026). This is in line with WCO\u2019s five years\u2019 review of the nomenclature. The contracting parties are expected to adopt the review based on regional considerations and national economic policy.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cThe nation has adopted all tariff lines with few adjustments in the extant CET. As allowed for in Annex II of the 2022-2026 CET edition, and in line with the Finance Act and the National Automotive Policy, NCS has retained a duty rate of 20 per cent for used vehicles as was transmitted by ECOWAS with a NAC levy of 15 per cent. New vehicles will also pay a duty of 20 per cent with a NAC levy of 20 per cent as directed in the Federal Ministry of Finance letter ref. no. HMF BNP/NCS/CET/4/2022 of 7th April 2022\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents, Ports & Terminal Multipurpose Limited chapter, Abayomi Duyile, while reacting to the hike, said the move could have an adverse effect on the sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs I speak to you now, the NCS has reintroduced the NAC levy, which is a 15-per cent payment on used imported vehicles. That is a major issue; it means an additional 15 per cent on the duty we are paying currently.\u201d\n\nDuyile said he was surprised the service was coming up with the levy in the second quarter of this year.\n\nAlso speaking, the Chairman of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders, PTML Chapter, Mr. George Okafor, said: \u201cThis is wrong because there is no way Customs can calculate NAC levy on used vehicles. It should be for new vehicles. The levy is for new vehicles, and not old or used vehicles. We will have to meet with the Customs command to determine the next line of action.\u201d\n\nBut ANLCA argued that the NAC levy is mostly meant for new vehicles, questioning the rationale behind the introduction of the duty on used vehicles.\n\nThe ANLCA circular said the warning strike was a fall-out of consultations among critical stakeholders.\n\nIt said the warning strike would commence on Monday and will last till Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have consulted widely among critical stakeholders as par the 15 per cent NAC and \u201cillegal benchmarks on Pre-Arrival Assessment Report (PAAR),\u201d the circular said.\n\n\u201cIt has been concluded that the 15 per cent NAC is a fraud and an obnoxious policy.\n\n\u201cIn view of this, in conjunction with other stakeholders there will be a one-day warning strike on April 25 by 10:00 a.m. prompt, starting from our \u2018Holy Ground\u2019 in front of Grimaldi.\n\n\u201cAnd we will move down to Customs Area Controller (CAC\u2019S) of Port and Terminal Multi-services Ltd. (PTML) and Tincan enroute all other terminals in Tincan and Apapa.\n\n\u201cPlease note that April 25 and 26 is just a \u2018warning strike\u2019; agents are allowed to do their jobs and tidy up against Wednesday in lieu of whether there will be a reverse or not.\u201d\n\nThe ANLCA expressed optimism that the authorities concerned would reverse the \u201cIllegal 15 per cent NAC and also review the benchmarks on PAAR\u201d within the next 48 hours.\n\nIt, however, enjoined its members to ensure a total shutdown at all ports if the policy is not reversed after the warning strike.\n\nEromosele Abiodun",
