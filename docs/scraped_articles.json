          "text": "The Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, has said he will reveal the sponsors of killings in the state in two weeks.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Lagos, Uzodimma insisted that he had identified the politicians behind insecurity in the state, and investigations by security agencies were ongoing\n\nHe said, \u201cPoliticians against the ruling All Progressives Congress are behind the killings and maiming in the state and I vow to name them. However, I had a meeting with security agencies who pleaded that naming the sponsors when the investigation is still going on could jeopardise the efforts.\n\n\u201cThe last time I contacted them a few days ago, they requested two more weeks. I do hope that in two weeks, the report would be ready and then it would be made public to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe governor also spoke on the quest for the presidency by the South-East, noting that Igbo presidency in 2023 would address the injustice and the cries of marginalisation in the region.\n\n\u201cEvery political party is after candidates\u2019 capacity to win elections. In the South-East, we are ready to produce the President of Nigeria. There is a national sympathy for the South-East to produce the President. What will make it work is for the two leading political parties to produce candidates from the South-East geopolitical zone.\n\n\u201cLet the Peoples Democratic Party produce a South-Easterner as their presidential candidate. Let the APC also produce a South-Easterner as their presidential candidate. With this, we would have centralised this power-sharing in a manner that it has become all-inclusive and justice and equity would have been seen to be done,\u201d he added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The general calls on other political parties in the State to take a cue from the PDP\u2019s April 30th Ward Congresses in Akwa Ibom, attest to the transparent conduct of the exercise in the State.\n\nWhile alluding to the phrase, \u201cwho born dog\u201d used by Senator Bassey Albert in one of his recent campaigns in the State, the group opined that \u201cThe idea of war drums being sounded as precursor to the political season should be discouraged and forestalled. \u201c\n\nTo forestall a breakdown of war and order, \u201cthese aggrieved politicians who are sounding gongs of war, should be invited and advised that election is never, and should not be seen as a do or die affair\u201d, the group maintained, and added that \u201canyone who is not a victor now, could definitely be one tomorrow. There is no need to heat up the polity because of selfish desperation.\u201d\n\nOn their part, the Mandate Eyes posited that splinter groups hurriedly assembled overnight, were being used as agents of doom to paint an ugly picture that doesn\u2019t exist, about Akwa Ibom State.\n\n\u201cTruth is, the sponsors of this fallacious petition were merely prepared for petitions and protests, and not for elections.\n\n\u201cThat is why, in a widely circulated video of award Congress in Senator Bassey Albert\u2019s Ward, Eastern Ibiono Ward 1, the returning officer Mr Okon Essien and members of the party were seen lamenting his absence from the Congress.\n\n\u201cWe in the Mandate Eyes wish to state categorically that Governor Udom Emmanuel has not breached any section of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cRather what the Governor has done, in consonance with his political and economic inclusion agendum, is opening of the political space to encourage competition and deepening the process of democratic consolidation.\n\n\u201cThese purveyors of falsehood should henceforth refrain from making unsubstantiated statements capable of threatening the peace currently being enjoyed in the state.\n\n\u201cThey should see reasons to embrace truth and peace that have characterized the state from 2015- the inception of Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s administration.\u201d",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anambra State Governor, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, has announced the appointment of Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency for a four-year tenure.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Agbata will be expected to use his experience to help the government achieve its plans of building a mega-city. This will include expanding broadband access, digitising government services, and supporting technology startups in the state.\n\nAgbata brings over a decade of experience working in the technology sector in different roles in the media and startup space, experience that he believes will serve him as he begins a new chapter.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on how his past will help him in his new role, Agbata said, \u201cWith my industry experience, I will be able to quickly launch new programs, attract the right partners, strengthen the tech and developer communities, organise programmes and meetups, and tons of other initiatives and activities that will benefit both Anambra State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgbata\u2019s mandate will tie neatly into the state government\u2019s mission to make Anambra the digital and creative capital of Nigeria. Through the Soludo Solution, the state plans to train and support up to 10,000 youth annually while setting up a five billion venture capital fund to incubate and provide growth capital for startups.\n\nMuch of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector has been seen in Lagos State. However, growth in the industry needs to be spread across more cities if the country\u2019s unemployment rate is to be reduced.\n\nWith ICT\u2019s growing contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, some states have taken steps to take advantage of this trend.\n\nIn 2020, the Edo State Government launched the Edo Innovation Hub. The hub provides a place for state residents to convene and potentially build technological products.\n\nLast year, it inaugurated a board with Victor Asemota, SwiftaCorp Co-founder as its chairman; and Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President on Digital Transformation, as a member.\n\nAlready, the state has partnered with tech talent accelerator, Decagon in a project that plans to train 15,000 residents of the state in software development and is an attempt to follow and potentially leapfrog Lagos State as a top destination for technological innovation.\n\nOne factor that has aided the rise of Lagos as a tech hub is the existing infrastructure absent in most states in the country.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the South Eastern region of Nigeria, where Anambra State is, has the lowest Internet penetration rates, with 13.7 million users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing the number of residents connected to the Internet will be vital in achieving the government\u2019s goals. Already, the previous government has set the ball rolling by waiving the right-of-way charges for telcos in the state, paving the way for the new government to build on it.\n\nIn Agbata\u2019s experience and Soludo\u2019s previous experience as a Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the state could become a digital powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be learning about the Web3 from experts. Isn\u2019t this something you should look forward to too?\n\nInterestingly, Bolu highlighted five ways we can learn Web3 at the Summit here: 5 ways to learn about Web3 at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass up this opportunity to learn from great minds. To attend, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nProblems YC-backed startups are solving\n\nTikTok\u2019s Pulse\n\nTigerrise\u2019s plan to improve mental health\n\nWhat problems are YC-backed startups solving?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe you\u2019ve been seeing Y Combinator (YC) posts in our newsletter for over a week now. And I understand how tiring it can be to see the same thing repeatedly.\n\nDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m about to change that. This is a new story. And, I won\u2019t bore you. You\u2019d tell me if I was, won\u2019t you? \ud83e\udd14\n\nKeep in mind that Chimgozirim had a chat with the founders of Y Combinator (YC) in March 2022 and told us how they work. Please read it here: Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows more interest in East and North Africa\n\nBesides, on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, we issued a report indicating the following:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can, of course, download the report here. It\u2019s completely free.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s crucial to note that 95 African companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, roughly half of which are 51 fintechs from Nigeria. Most importantly, it\u2019s also critical to ask questions such as, \u201cWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve?\u201d\n\nAccording to our data, these startups are active in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics. So, again, what problem are they attempting to address?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, is likely to have an answer to your question. Please look at it here: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\n\nTikTok to split ad revenue with creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall this: Meta needs to get over TikTok? Interestingly, TikTok appears to be upping its game, leaving Meta with no breathing room. Maybe some sleepless nights for Meta in the coming days?\n\nWhy? TikTok has introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that will allow brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nIsn\u2019t this fantastic news for TikTok Pulse creators? To put things into perspective, ad revenue will be split 50/50 between creators and publishers. This is similar to what YouTube offers creators, who reportedly receive a 55% cut.\n\nNow, you\u2019re interested, aren\u2019t you? But there\u2019s a catch: TikTok says p,m Pulse will be available only to creators and publishers with at least 100,000 followers, and even then, ads will only appear alongside \u201cthe top 4% of all TikTok videos.\u201d\n\nMoreover, TikTok\u2019s Pulse will also ensure that creator content is \u201csuitable\u201d for advertisements.\n\nThis means that Pulse will allow brands to target their ads to specific areas of TikTok. Brands can use Pulse to place ads alongside videos in 12 different categories, including beauty, fashion, pets, gaming, TV & movies, auto, Spanish language, sports and recreation, and more.\n\nFor the time being, this feature will be available to a select group of users in the United States beginning in June 2022. And sometime in September 2022, more countries.\n\nTigerrise to improve mental health access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emily Underworld on Unsplash\n\nIn Africa, mental health care is scarce. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), 75-95% of people with mental illnesses do not have any access to appropriate care in low and middle-income countries.\n\nTo back up this claim, Kenya\u2019s health ministry reports that 75% of people in need of mental health services cannot obtain them. Knowing the stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses in Africa, I don\u2019t think this is breaking news.\n\nWhy? Studies have shown that Kenyans suffering from mental illnesses are frequently stigmatised on several levels.\n\nConsequently, Tigerrise \u2014 a company which uses data-driven insights to disrupt the delivery of health and wellness services positively \u2014 has partnered with the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nMoreso, it has received a $1 million grant to empower Kenyan youth to take charge of their mental and physical health to increase access to mental health care in Kenya.\n\nWhat\u2019s in for Kenyans? Over the next three years, the Elton John AIDS Foundation\u2019s $1 million grant will ensure that all Triggerise-affiliated clinics in Mombasa, Kenya, provide mental health screening and services ranging from individual and group counselling to trauma-based care.\n\nMoreover, these services will be fully integrated with Triggerise\u2019s existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for young people aged 15 to 24.\n\nSince seamless access to SRH is critical for this age group, the collaboration will ensure that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services are part of Triggerise\u2019s established offerings in Mombasa.\n\nRichard Matikanya, Triggerise\u2019s Chief Operating Officer said, \u201cThe timing of this investment is particularly exciting, as the growing mental health burden among young people in their diversity \u2014 particularly those living with HIV \u2014 has largely been overlooked. Our partnership will allow us to contribute to the evidence base on how to ensure that young people have access to mental health services that respond to their needs on their terms.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LOOK LIKE?\n\nChange: an Opportunity rather than a Fear\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d \u2014 and other lies I\u2019ve loved\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to state that technology and exposure have changed how startups operate in Nigeria. After its first entry with Senegal\u2019s Wave, Y Combinator, one of the most prestigious accelerators in the world today, has gained increasing prominence in Africa.\n\nResearch from the good folks at Intelligence by Techpoint, our data and research team, has shown that African startups, on average, enter YC within a year or two of launch.\n\nIn March 2005, four illustrious professionals decided to start a company that would change how venture capitalists (VCs) invest in startups. With a seed fund of $150,000, the company took in the likes of Reddit in its first batch and has gone on to fund an enviable list of startups, including Stripe, Airbnb, and OpenSea.\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Y Combinator has seemingly increased its focus on Africa annually. This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Nigerian startups have dominated the scenes, gravitating towards the accelerator. Little wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria. Egypt comes in at a distant second with 12 startups, while Kenya rounds up the top three countries with 9 startups.\n\nDifferent interested parties have reasons for Nigeria\u2019s seeming dominance in YC, but it\u2019s not so surprising for the accelerator.\n\nKat Manalac, Head of Outreach at Y Combinator, points out that when one company from a region goes through YC, gets featured in the press, and raises money after demo day, more founders from that region start applying the following year.\n\n\u201cWe saw this in 2014 with Algolia \u2014 the Algolia founders were some of YC\u2019s first French founders. They went through YC in Winter 2014, and in the following batch, we saw 17 French founders go through the program. This is what started happening with African companies after Paystack went through the batch,\u201d she says.\n\nCombined, Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups had raised $1.3 billion as of March 2021, with two of them \u2014 Wave and Flutterwave \u2014 reaching a billion-dollar valuation. Paystack, another huge success story, was acquired by Stripe, a US-based payments startup, for $200 million in 2020.\n\nThese headline-grabbing stories appear to show investor attraction for YC-backed companies. For most investors, getting into YC means that a startup now has a higher valuation. But the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\n\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\n\nWhile this might be the most obvious question, I guess we should have framed it thus: What problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve? Why? To use the Nigerian parlance, \u201cProblem nor dey finish\u201d, which simply means problems are never ending.\n\nOur data shows that these startups are playing in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll work our way up from the industries with the least focus to the ones with the most focus for this article. We found some startups working in some unexpected industries, but you\u2019ll have to download the report to find out.\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms are together because each sector has only one YC-backed startup trying to solve its problems. This is hardly surprising, considering that only 5% ($245m) of the $4.9 billion African startups raised in 2021 went to the Education sector.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s education startups didn\u2019t get up to 3% of startup funding in 2020 ($1.07 billion), Media and Telecoms did not make any notable imprint on the funding numbers for 2021 and 2020.\n\nThese startups have raised a combined $7.2 million and are seemingly making decent strides in their respective industries.\n\nIn 2021, the African Union reported that there were 42 million out-of-school children in Africa, with 40% of this number coming from West Africa. Six out of ten Africans are still without access to the Internet, and affordability remains a big issue for those who have access.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are huge capital-intensive sectors and might not be appealing to the fast-paced, high-growth nature of modern startups. But we might just be an innovative execution away from the problem. Easier said than done, we know. As for media? That\u2019s a different ball game entirely.\n\nOther sectors like Real Estate and Marketing also feature in this group.\n\nEnergy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, two Energy startups have gone through the prestigious accelerator programme and closed a combined $22 million to date. Slightly better than the three industries above, renewable energy solutions have attracted decent funding in Africa.\n\nWhile it only accounted for 5% ($245 million) of funding in 2021, it took 22% of funding in the previous year. A cursory glance at the numbers, which show that 43% of Africans didn\u2019t have access to electricity as of 2019, evidently points to a vast untapped market.\n\nLike Telecoms, this is also capital intensive, and from what we\u2019ve observed, several renewable energy solutions are barely affordable for the average (or even upper-middle-class) African.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all its classes and tasty nutrients, food is an integral part of society. So far, YC has funded three startups looking to provide tech-enabled solutions for food security in Africa, and they have secured a combined $64 million.\n\nLike the previous industries, it appears there\u2019s a low investor appetite for startups building agriculture solutions across the continent. Agriculture startups accounted for 4% of funding in 2021, lower than 7% in 2020.\n\nAccording to world vision, 282 million people are undernourished in Africa, and that\u2019s just one result of several underlying problems. While food prices keep rising, 37% of food produced gets wasted.\n\nMobility & Logistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility & Logistics is at the heart of commerce and nearly everything we do. To date, six African Mobility & Logistics startups have gone through YC, raising $94.6 million. A trend we observed is that most of these startups are based in North Africa, with roughly 30% from Nigeria.\n\nRecent funding announcements have shown a renewed interest in eCommerce in North Africa. Overall, Mobility & Logistics companies accounted for 10% of the total funding in 2021, a marginal improvement from 7% in 2020.\n\nWhen we split both sectors, we\u2019ll find that most of these companies are logistics companies. Mobility startups, on the other hand, have not raised as much.\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nAfrica\u2019s Health sector is huge not for its number of hospitals and medical infrastructure but for the number of problems waiting to be solved. Everything, from preventive healthcare, telemedicine, health insurance, and precision medicine, represents critical areas in Africa.\n\nY Combinator has invested in eight African Health startups that have bagged a combined $115 million. These startups offer diverse healthcare solutions in preventive healthcare, health insurance, cancer diagnostics, medical logistics, and precision medicine.\n\nNine out of the top ten causes of death in Africa are health-related problems that run pretty deep. While healthcare startups are emerging, their services are mainly meant for a particular class, so it\u2019s hard to see how they can reach the mass market without significant regulatory backing.\n\nHealth startups accounted for 8% of 2021\u2019s funding, not improving on 9% in 2020. While technology is great, there are other serious considerations beyond its scope \u2014 for now at least.\n\nMarketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace startups have grown in popularity in recent years, and platforms that simply offer the technology to connect sellers to buyers are popping up with diverse execution strategies. So far, YC has invested in 17 startups looking to help Africans buy and sell online.\n\nConsidering the well-documented struggles of Jumia and Konga, questions abound on the viability of eCommerce startups in Africa. But these questions have not stopped YC-backed African eCommerce startups from bagging $138 million to date.\n\nOverall, eCommerce startups have accounted for 3% and 5% of funding in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also noteworthy is that an increasing number of eCommerce startups are now serving businesses rather than consumers directly.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services startups are the cream of the crop and the most popular sector by almost any metric in use. It has attracted the most funding and, perhaps, the most media attention for the past four years.\n\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni. They\u2019ve collectively raised over $854 million, about 65% of the total funding raised by Africa\u2019s YC alumni.\n\nHowever, this trend is not peculiar to YC. Fintech companies accounted for 62% of funding in 2021, mainly due to megadeals from Flutterwave and Chipper Cash. In the preceding year, fintechs grabbed 33% of funding, still much higher than any other sector.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons for the prominence of fintech companies. Over half of the continent\u2019s population does not have access to formal financial services. As of 2020, the median age of Africans was 19.7 \u2014 this means half of the population was younger, and half of the population was older.\n\nMost fintech companies\u2019 efforts do not seem geared toward improving financial inclusion but rather promising a better experience for people who already have bank accounts. However, the jury is still out on how successful they\u2019ve been.\n\nPayments, for instance, have witnessed the most advancement. With the exploits of Paystack and Flutterwave, API-led fintechs are changing how financial companies communicate, but nearly every other sub-sector is still in the early stages.\n\nWhy is the focus on fintech?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we fund is typically a reflection of what strong teams are applying with,\u201d says YC\u2019s Manalac, in response to our question on fintech\u2019s evident dominance.\n\nManalac\u2019s assertion suggests that the company does not deliberately look out for fintech companies, but it receives several applications from founders offering financial services solutions.\n\n\u201cThat payments lead the way shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because it is a primary pain point for all human beings irrespective of where you are, and is one area that technology has proven that it can build solutions for,\u201d says Adesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier/SSA Banks & Fintech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital.\n\nPelumi Aboluwarin, CTO of Nigeria\u2019s Nomba (formerly Kudi), maintains that running a business is hard, so payments shouldn\u2019t be difficult too. Perseus Mlamba, CEO, Zambia\u2019s Union54, also argues that payment is the key to unlocking innovations in health, agriculture, and industry.\n\nWhile both founders run prominent financial services startups, Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of Releaf, a Nigerian Agritech startup, agrees.\n\n\u201cFintech was the first piece of our growing innovation story so it makes sense that most of the investment and attention so far has gone to that sector. However, as innovation from more sectors emerges, I believe we will see a more diverse split.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, we can safely say that YC-backed companies are mainly looking to solve problems in finance, eCommerce, logistics, and Healthcare. As these entrepreneurs gain more experience, we should better understand how these tech solutions could be best applied in an African context. As the founders we spoke to explained, going through YC is just the beginning.\n\nLooking to understand how YC\u2019s activities are changing Africa\u2019s startup landscape? We spoke to some prominent entrepreneurs who have gone through the accelerator to gain insights. Watch this space on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "summary": "This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\nLittle wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria.\nBut the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni.",

          "text": "Travelling to the United States with the hope of treating severe malaria could result in a financial nightmare as the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) withdraws from supplying treatment to hospitals.\n\nA returning traveller from a malaria-endemic country like Nigeria will only access Intravenous Artesunate, the only approved form of treatment, in commercial pharmacies at $60,000, Boghuma Titanji, a Cameroonian medical doctor and clinical researcher, said in a tweet.\n\nChecks on the CDC website show that distribution to hospitals will be discontinued from September 30, 2022 as it is available in adequate supply from major drug distributors. According to the centre, severe malaria should be treated with intravenous (IV) antimalarial medications, as the first-line drug for the treatment of severe malaria in the US.\n\nThe drug used to be supplied to patients on request, free of charge by the CDC as a better standard for treating severe malaria. It was also a replacement for quinidine, a previously used drug produced by Eli Lilly, but which production stopped in 2017.\n\nArtesunate made by Amivas LLC. Global health got approved in 2020 with a 150-fold hike in price to $30,000 for an average cost of treatment for an adult, making malaria treatment costlier to treat in the US than in low and middle-income African countries.\n\nAmivas attributed the price hike to the cost of FDA licensing and production, combined with the small market for artesunate in the US, according to an advocacy piece written by Anne Frosch, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota; Aileen Ahiskali, an infectious diseases pharmacist at Hennepin Healthcare and Chandy John, a pediatric infectious diseases physician and professor of pediatrics and medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine.\n\nThe cost of the drug this year has doubled to $60,000, according to Titanji.\n\nIn a separate tweet, Stone Doggett, an infectious disease physician, and scientist at the Oregon Health and Science University said the cost of IV artesunate increases at least 10,000 times (over $35,000)\n\n\u201cI am very interested in the story behind a company being created to manufacture artesunate in partnership with the US Army, receiving exclusive rights and potentially a 100 million dollar transferable priority review voucher and settling on a $35,000 to $105,000 price tag,\u201d Doggett said.\n\nRead also: It is cost-effective to prevent malaria says Reckitt marketing director\n\nOnly about 300 people develop severe malaria in the US yearly and artesunate manufactured outside the US cannot be imported.\n\nMalaria treatment in most African countries costs less than $5. In India, it is between $10 and $25 for an intravenous Artesunate course, depending on when the patient can be switched to oral treatment.\n\nIn their plea for urgent solutions in terms of pricing and availability, Frosch, Ahiskali and John said the financial crisis facing healthcare and the resulting lean hospital budgets mean that medication for uncommon diseases like malaria may not be stocked by most hospitals.\n\n\u201cWhen purchased after a case is diagnosed, because of its limited availability, distributors take anywhere from 12 hours, at best, to five days to deliver the drug, a dangerous delay in care,\u201d they said.\n\nAccording to Titanji, a returning traveller from a malaria-endemic region with severe malaria in the US could die before the hospital procures the drug due to cost.\n\nDespite being an off-patent and widely used drug, she said the sales right is now owned by a few suppliers who have inflated the price for profit.\n\n\u201cThe moral of this story is if you are travelling to a malaria-endemic part of the world from the US, obtain and take your malaria prophylaxis diligently because the US is the last place you want to have severe malaria right now. Our health system is broken,\u201d she said.",

We believe that members of the Association are patriots who have continued to bear the brunt of an unfavourable oil market for which we salute their doggedness,\u201d the statement read.",

When communicating a message, the media transmits not just the content of the message, but also their interpretation of it.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the state government\u2019s intervention in tackling erosion in the state, Obaseki said that the state government has built a total length of over 40 kilometers of secondary drains.\n\n\u201cWe have built a total length of over 40kms of secondary drains. This excludes over 400km constructed by other ministries and agencies; over 14kms of primary stormwater culverts, drains and over 4km of earth storm water channels.

We, therefore, call on the government to act urgently to resolve these unending operational challenges, while Dana Air will continue to support every effort by the AON to achieve a quick and peaceful resolution in the interest of our dear country Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The Mohammed Hayatu-deen Campaign Organisation has lamented that the announcement by the airline operators in the country that they would shut down domestic flight services was not only disturbing but also disheartening to any patriotic citizen of Nigeria.\n\nA statement signed by the organisation\u2019s director-general, Senator Isa Galaudu, quoted the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Mohammed Hayatu-deen, as saying that the reason for the lamentable situation was the escalating price of aviation fuel (jet fuel A1) from N190 to N700 per litre.\n\n\u201cThis represents more than a 250% jump in price at a time when NBS is reporting official inflation of 15%. The Hayatu-Deen Presidential Campaign Organization is of the view that this deplorable outcome is another symptom of an economy that is in dire need of rescue from the claws of subsidy agents. The economy is fast approaching failure because of neglect and living in denial of policy makers at a time when industry wide passenger revenue growth is increasing due to the risks and hazards of rail and road travel. As a consequence of this, airlines should be making more money and reinvesting in seat capacity,\u201d Hayatu-deen was quoted as saying.\n\nHayatu-deen said this was not the case because of pricing distortions and the consequences of a dysfunctional subsidy regime.\n\n\u201cIt is not rocket science to know that jet fuel represents 40% of the direct operating costs of airlines. Therefore a 250% increase in the price of this input has completely eroded the thin margins of airline operators,\u201d he added.\n\nHayatu-deen, therefore, advised the government as a matter of urgency to embark on a two-pronged approach to mitigate the cataclysmic and systemic risk this development poses to an already fragile economy afflicted by enormous power shortages.\n\nFirst, he noted, was the immediate need for a massive increase in supply by an import intervention to push down prices and stabilise the market, saying the other being a more fundamental and strategic move to address the structural imbalance of the industry.\n\nHe said this would entail fast-tracking the revamp of the moribund refineries and accelerating the commissioning of the private refining capacity.\n\n\u201cThese together with an efficient review of the failed subsidy system will bring down prices whilst simultaneously increasing output of refined products including jet fuel, diesel and PMS thus bringing the industry into full and dynamic equilibrium,\u201d he said.\n\nHayatu-deen added Nigerians were already feeling the weight of excruciating economic and social problems, and they do not deserve to be placed under additional unbearable stress.",

          "title": "With 3 weeks to June 3 deadline: APC, PDP undecided over zoning of presidential tickets",
          "text": "With about three weeks to the Independent National Electoral Commission\u2019s June 3 deadline for presidential primaries, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the major opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are still mum and keeping Nigerians in suspense over which zone will fly their presidential flags in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe governing APC slated its primaries for May 30/31 in Abuja while the PDP on the other hand holds its presidential convention May 28/29.\n\nThe parties\u2019 indecision has fuelled speculations that it might be an open game among all the presidential aspirants.\n\nThe seeming stalemate has continued to generate reactions from both the northern and southern flanks on what\u2019s likely to be the consequence of the \u2018inaction\u2019 on zoning by the two political parties.\n\nThe two parties have communicated the schedule of their primaries and congresses to the INEC, just as the commission recently reminded them of the June 4 deadline which it said was sacrosanct.\n\nAPC\n\nThe indecision by the governing APC over zoning has obviously left the political game open to all presidential aspirants from the North, South-south, South-west and South-east.\n\nThe APC had fixed May 30/31 as the proposed date for its presidential primary election and also proposed May 23 for the governorship primary.\n\nThe party, in a letter, addressed to Professor Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), dated April 6, notified the election body of its dates and schedule of its primaries for the nomination of candidates for the 2023 elections.\n\nAs at the last count, not less than 27 aspirants have indicated their interest to succeed Buhari using the APC platform.\n\nBefore now, it was purely a southern affair until recently when some northerners, including Governor Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and former Zamfara state Governor Ahmed Yerima joined the fray, while Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan is being rumoured to also declare his bid for the top job.\n\nAmong those in the race are Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello, Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi, former Ogun state Governor Ibikunle Amosun, former Imo state Governor Rochas Okorocha and recently a former minister and current President African Development Bank(ADB) Dr Adeshina Akinwumi among others.\n\nThe party extended the deadline of purchasing nomination of forms to May 10 from its earlier date of May 6 when it was expected to have ended.\n\n...Power shift against 1999 Constitution \u2013 APC presidential aspirant\n\nBut when asked to respond to the agitations for zoning, an APC presidential aspirant, Dr. Abubakar Alkali, warned that the ruling party may have waved a goodbye to the presidency in the 2023 elections if it fields a presidential candidate from the South against an opposition PDP presidential candidate from the North.\n\nAlkali said power shift can only happen during a military to civilian transition where a military government can use extra-constitutional means to stop candidates from other regions from contesting the elections as they did in 1998.\n\n\u201cPower shift is a clear breach of section 131 of the 1999 constitution (as altered) and as such, any candidates from any region ostracised from contesting the 2023 Presidential elections can choose to go to court to challenge their exclusion. This presents a glaring legal lacuna which can only be resolved through an amendment of the relevant sections of the constitution.\n\n\u201cIf the constitution says all eligible Nigerians should be allowed to contest the Presidential elections, why will candidates from a particular section of the country be excluded?\n\n\u201cA political party is at liberty to zone its presidential ticket to any region, but power swing cannot be stamped as a national policy based on section 131 of the 1999 constitution. By the way, zoning by political parties is in order and in the spirit of political strategies to ensure victory in the election.\u201d\n\nThe Adamawa born presidential aspirant who said the stakes were too high for Nigeria to stagnate its future on the altar of rotational presidency, added that \u201cwhat is required is to open the political landscape and source for passionate Nigerians with the right mentality, knowledge, passion and patriotism to take this otherwise great nation to the top echelon in the comity of nations.\n\n\u201cPower shift could potentially lead to very serious breaches of Nigeria\u2019s constitution and sustenance of the rule of law in Nigeria. It has the potentials to cause very serious risk to Nigeria\u2019s internal security and could potentially lead to anarchy going forward. Power shift is at best, a model being used by desperate politicians to achieve personal interest. It is not in the national interest.\n\n\u201cThe way to go is to abide by what the constitution says: allow every eligible Nigerian to contest the elections in accordance with section 131 (a-d) of the 1999 constitution (as altered).\u201d\n\nAPC spokesman\n\nSpeaking on the telephone to one of our correspondents Sunday, APC National Publicity Secretary, Barrister Felix Morka, said there was no timeline on when decision would be taken on the issue of zoning.\n\nWhen reminded that the party had 21 days left to conduct presidential primary election, the APC spokesman said the party leadership would meet at the appropriate time and take a decision.\n\nMorka said: \u201cThere is no timeline to discuss the issue of zoning but the party leadership will actually meet and discuss it and take decision at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nPDP\n\nIn a related development, with 19 days to the PDP National Convention to elect the party\u2019s presidential candidate, the party is yet to unveil its position on zoning.\n\nAt the height of the agitation among PDP stakeholders, the National Executive Committee (NEC) swiftly inaugurated a 37-man zoning committee led by Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom on the 24th of March, 2022, to recommend to the party whether zoning would help it return to power at the centre in 2023 or not, and which part of the country should the presidential ticket be zoned to.\n\nThough the committee, after three consecutive meetings, submitted its report to the Senator Iyorchia Ayu-led NWC, over three weeks after, the party still keeps mum on zoning.\n\nAnd ahead of the party\u2019s National Caucus and 96th edition of the National Executive Committee (NEC) meetings hold Wednesday (May 11, 2022), Blueprint\u2019s investigation revealed that zoning no longer appears to be a major hurdle before the party.\n\nMore the any other, the meetings, it was gathered, would focus mostly on making a success of the forthcoming national convention and not zoning.\n\nThe two meetings will according to a reliable source set up committees for its May 28 National Convention, decide on the venue, budget for the convention and financial statement, especially the amount generated from sales of forms.\n\nThe source said: \u201cFor a while, if you look at the situation, you will understand that the party has successfully downplayed zoning. Though it will still come up in the NEC meeting, considering the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) timetable and other issues before the party and aspirants, it will no longer be as hot as many think it will be.\u201d\n\nProducing acceptable candidate our concern \u2013 PDP\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint on the telephone, the PDP Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Ibrahim Abdullahi, said for now, the party was more concerned with producing a presidential candidate that would salvage Nigeria from hopelessness, not zoning.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, there is no way the party will be disturbed about that, zoning is not a constitutional issue, it is an agreement that was informed by the necessity of that time and a diplomatic way of taking everyone along.\n\n\u201cThe party can choose its presidential candidate from anywhere at any point in time. This candidate could come from the north or the south; we are not so bothered about where the candidate will come from.\n\n\u201cWe are doing zoning to ensure that everyone in the party and from every region in the country is taking along in the scheme of things. So it is not sacrosanct.\n\n\u201cThe party is not so bothered about where the presidential candidate comes from. What is paramount to us is to produce a candidate that has the capacity not only to win the election but one that will govern Nigeria well and deliver the dividends of democracy, a candidate that will salvage Nigeria from the apparent hopelessness that has befallen the nation. This is uppermost in the concerns of the PDP.\u201d\n\nAspirants in negotiation\n\nMeanwhile, our checks revealed that there were grand moves by aspirants from the north to queue behind one of their own who will eventually contest against an aspirant from the south for the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nOur source said\u201d many of the aspirants are already negotiating for other positions.\u201d\n\nNo queuing behind northern candidate \u2013 Clark\n\nTaking strong exceptions to any attempt to go against zoning, a leading voice for a Southern presidency in 2023, former Federal Commissioner for Information in the Yakubu Gowon Military regime and Ijaw National Leader, Chief Edwin Clark, warned against another northern presidency after Buhari.\n\nClark said the matter was discussed at the 2014 national confab, insisting \u201crotation is the only vehicle of unity in Nigeria and it was decided at that conference there should be power shift, there should be rotation among the various ethnic groups or the various parts of this country if we are to have unity in this country.\n\n\u201cWhen El-Rufai said sometimes ago that 19 governors met with Mr President, Vice President that all the positions held by the northerners should be moved to South and vice versa.\n\n\u201cSo we thought that the zoning has been done. So the South will produce the next president. Now that no southerner contested any position in the party which was zoned to the north and because the chairmanship was zoned to North central, Abdullahi Adamu took over. Look at the way they are now moving in.\n\n\u201cThen we are moving nowhere! No southerner will support a candidate from the North. We can\u2019t live as second class citizens, where your right of franchise is taken over by someone who feels that it is his birth right to rule.\u201d\n\n\u2018Setting stage for chaos\u2019\n\nWeighing in on the controversy, a political analyst and former National Chairman of the National Democratic Party (NDP), Chudi Chukwuani, told Blueprint that the two major political parties are setting the stage for chaos by downplaying zoning.\n\n\u201cThe PDP and APC are setting the stage for maximum confusion and chaos,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne would have thought that the PDP would have learnt lessons from their past indiscretions. Recall that in the build-up to the 2011 and 2015 elections, PDP was in power.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, the clamour within the party was that zone to the north to enable the north complete the tenure of late President Yar\u2019adua, but greed and sweetness of power never allowed the then PDP leadership to take an informed decision. And that led to the resistance that ex-President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan should continue.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, there was also a higher clamour that PDP should zone to the north, because the north, yet again, the PDP zoned to the south and of course, Jonathan lost. North galvanised and stood behind President Muhammadu Buhari emerged.\u201d\n\nThe political analyst also added that \u201cin the APC, they created this illusion that the Presidency will go to the south, but they have thrown the floodgate open and aspirants from the north are rushing to purchase forms. So, this has also put whatever zoning between north and south APC claims into jeopardy.\n\n\u201cInstead of the PDP to use the opportunity to correct all the mistakes they made in 2011 and 2015, the party is not decisive. Now, the party members and aspirants are divided over zoning because the party\u2019s leadership is not straightforward.\n\n\u201cThe way the PDP is going about the zoning their chances are extremely limited. This is largely because the seed of disunity is already on the ground,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

We also wish to assure foreign airlines operating in the country that all logistics and services for their operations remain in place as usual and that no disruptions whatsoever should be envisaged.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Airline Operators Suspend Withdrawal Of Services Hours To Deadline\n\nAccording to him, the ministry has received a series of enquiries since airline operators issued a notice of withdrawal of flight services as a result of the rising cost of Jet A1 (aviation fuel).\n\nThe minister\u2019s spokesman stated that the decision of the association was purely a business one, saying members were private businesses reacting to market forces but appealing for interventions to enable them to carry on with their operations.\n\nHe added that the ministry has made conscious efforts to assist the group, including facilitating a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, during which they got several concessions such as duty-free importation of aircraft, engines, spare parts, and other components.\n\n\u201cThe honourable minister at various times personally took members of the association to engage with Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to sort out issues of access to foreign exchange (FOREX) for their operations, and also the NNPC to exploit ways of ensuring the availability of Aviation fuel (JET A1) through importation or from the major marketers,\u201d Odaudu said.\n\n\u201cIt should also be recalled that members of the association were also considered for and given bail-out funds to the tune of N4 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that they remained afloat.\n\n\u201cThis was without prejudice to the fact that most of them were heavily indebted to aviation agencies (as they still are). We believe that members of the association are patriots who have continued to bear the brunt of an unfavourable oil market for which we salute their doggedness.\u201d\n\nThe government, according to the minister\u2019s spokesman, remains committed to the continued growth of the aviation industry where airlines and other service providers operate in a profitable and competitive environment.",

More than 97% of the Election Committee voted in a secret ballot Sunday morning.\n\nHis appointment is widely seen as an attempt by the Chinese government to tighten its grip on the city.\n\nSunday\u2019s election comes after significant changes were made to Hong Kong\u2019s electoral laws last year to ensure that only patriots loyal to Beijing can hold office. In order to effectively eliminate opposition voices, the legislature was also reorganized.\n\nLee will replace current leader Carrie Lam on July 1.\n\nThree members of the League of Social Democrats, a local activist group, attempted to march toward the election venue Sunday morning while carrying a banner demanding universal suffrage, which would allow Hong Kongers to vote for both the legislature and the chief executive.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy camp has long demanded universal suffrage, which they claim is guaranteed in the city\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law. It was also a major demand during the 2014 Umbrella Revolution and the 2019 anti-government protests.\n\nThe election of Lee as Hong Kong\u2019s next leader has raised fears that Beijing will tighten its grip on the territory. He spent the majority of his civil service career in the police and security bureau, and he is an outspoken and ardent supporter of a national security law enacted in Hong Kong in 2020 to quell dissent.\n\nOver 150 people have been detained under the security law, which criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces to meddle in city affairs. Almost all prominent pro-democracy activists have been imprisoned, while others have fled to other countries or have been forced to remain silent.\n\nAs a result of the 2019 protests and subsequent harsh pandemic restrictions, thousands of residents, including many professionals and expatriates, have fled the city of 7.4 million people.",
