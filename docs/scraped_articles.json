          "text": "The Peoples Redemption Party has accused the governments of Sokoto and Zamfara States of negligence and a \u201cpoor sense of purpose\u201d over the non-participation of the students in the 2022 West African Senior School Certificate Examination.\n\nThe party, in a press statement signed by the Chairman, Bello Falalu, on Saturday, said that Governors Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Bello Mattawalle of Zamfara state did not prioritise education because they were insensitive to the plight of the people and were more concerned about actualising their individual political ambitions.\n\nThe PRP urged the governments to enable the participation of the students of the states for the forthcoming WASSCE while also providing quality education in order to help curb the moral and insecurity challenges in the states.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe importance of education cannot be overemphasized as it is the backbone of any sustainable development, true civilisation, peace, and progress.\n\n\u201cIt is only through education the security and prosperity of the posterity can be safeguarded and guaranteed. Thus, being unconcerned with the education of the children of the masses by the governments of Sokoto and Zamfara States implies lack of vision and a poor sense of purpose. It is unarguable that education is the most potent weapon against insecurity.\n\n\u201cIf social unrest, tribal clashes, kidnapping, banditry, terrorism, and bigotry will be stopped, government at all levels must give education utmost priority. It must also provide job opportunities for the people.\n\n\u201cIt is most dismal that the Zamfara State governor that has no funds to register the children of the masses for WAEC could afford to buy and distribute 260 luxury cars to traditional rulers for selfish political reasons.\n\n\u201cEducation in Sokoto and Zamfara suffers backwardness because the interest of the governors ruling those states centre on the actualisation of their ambitions, not the liberation of the public from shackles of ignorance.\n\n\u201cNeglecting the educational sector of the states is a misplacement of priorities which comes with heinous consequences more destructive than a cluster of atomic bombs.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on the ruling governments to provide quality education at all levels to curb the prevailing moral decadence and insecurity that have been bedeviling our country.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Seplat\n\nLaud Orjiako as he retires.\n\nRatify appointment of 3 new Non-Executive Directors\n\nBy Peter Egwuatu\n\nShareholders of Seplat Energy Plc, a leading indigenous Nigerian energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) and London Stock Exchange (LSE) currently have commended the performane of the company over the years despite operating environment challenges.\n\nAt the 9th Annual General Meeting. AGM held in Ikoyi, Lagos, the shareholders gave their approval for the dividend payment of $0.10 per share and praised Dr A.B. C Orjiako\u2019s 13 years as Seplat Chairman as well as laud his retirement from the board.\n\nThe shareholders also approved the appointment of three Non-Executive Directors\n\nMeanwhile, after the AGM the board elected Mr Basil Omiyi as its new independent non executive Chairman.\n\nThe financial year report showed an increase in profit before tax of 197.8 percent to N34.7billion from N10.6billion year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4 billion from N1.7billion year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent. The energy Company also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6 billion from N57.9 billion year-on-year; as its gross profit soars to N48.8 billion from N20.1 billion year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent.\n\nSpeaking to the shareholders, the Chairman of Seplat Energy, Dr. Orjiako said: \u201cOur operational and financial performance in 2021 reflects the challenges of our business in Nigeria. Our average working interest production was 47,693 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) including 29,091 boepd of liquids and 107.9 MMscfd of gas (18,602 boepd).\u201d According to him, \u201cOur robust operational performance, despite our operational challenges meant that we were able to meet our dividend commitment, and with the Board having approved a Q4 dividend of $0.025 per share, we once again returned $0.10 per share to our shareholders for the 2021.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that \u201cSince we raised $535million at our initial public offering in May 2014, we have returned over $400million to shareholders in the form of dividends.\u201d He explained that \u201cThe performance of our oil business was impacted by two lengthy shut-ins at one of the third-party operated export routes that we rely upon.\n\nThis underscores the need for alternative export routes to mitigate this risk. \u201cWe drilled five oil wells and three gas wells during the year; the oil wells have a combined gross potential of 17.5 kbopd and the gas wells have a combined gross rate of 130 MMscfd of gas and 5.2 kbopd of condensate. I am particularly proud of our strong safety record which saw us reach 24million hours without any Lost Time Injury (LTI) from our operated assets in 2021.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that the company introduced hydrocarbons into the Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline (AEP) and are poised to launch this alternate export route which will enable the company to evacuate up to 40 kbopd gross from our OMLs 4, 38 and 41.\n\nAccording to the Chairman, this is an achievement worthy of note and this performance translated into revenues of $733million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $372million, up 38 per cent and 40 per cent respectively, from 2020, as our business recovered from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOur cash position remained strong as we ended the year with $341million in cash and a net debt of $426million. We have certainly delivered on that vision of building a business that is now the leading Nigerian independent and a major provider of natural gas to the domestic market.\u201d\n\nOn his decision to retire as Chairman and Director of Seplat Energy, he noted that, \u201cIn fulfilment of a promise we made long ago to have an Independent Non-Executive Chairman, I decided that it was essential to retire from the Board and as Chairman of Seplat Energy.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore a promise kept in the overall interest of the Company. I have now served as Chairman of Seplat Energy for 12 years and it has been an honour and a privilege to do so. I am proud of what we have been able to achieve, as we established ourselves as the largest indigenous independent energy company in Nigeria through operational excellence, the acquisition of eight oil and gas assets, the expansion of our domestic gas business and the dual listing on both the Nigerian and London Stock Exchanges, the first by a Nigerian company. These achievements are down to our excellent team and our strong, collaborative relationships with our stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWith the recently announced proposed acquisition, we are going to be in an even better position to drive transformational growth and profitability for all our stakeholders, meet our vision of delivering Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and become the Nigerian energy champion.\n\nI am leaving the Board of Directors with a sense of fulfilment, not only in co-founding Seplat Energy, but also steering it to an enviable position.\u201d\n\nThe chairman said \u201cThis is my last AGM as your Chairman. Now that I have climbed the iroko, I have fetched all the firewood,\u201d Orjiako cheerfully told the shareholders at the meeting.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the appointment of the new directors the Chairman said that \u201cthe Board of Seplat Energy is pleased to welcome Mrs Bashirat Odunewu, Mr. Kazeem Raimi and Mr Ernest Ebi.\n\nNoting that they are excellent professionals with their wealth of experience spanning over decades and that Seplat Energy eagerly looks forward to the enormous contributions they will make towards achieving global success.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, of the Energy company, Mr. Roger Brown during intersction with news men said: \u201cThe energy industry in Nigeria has a bright future and as Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy leader we are going to be powering the country\u2019s energy transition and future prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe addition of MPNU nearly trebled our production and doubled our reserves on a pro forma 2020 basis, reinforcing our leadership of Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns.\n\n\u201cOur 2021 performance was affected by outages at Forcados Terminal that will no longer have such an impact when we switch to the new Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline, which we expected to launch in March. This is part of our strategy to diversify and de-risk routes to market, assuring higher revenues from significantly better uptime and lower reconciliation losses. Furthermore, once we have completed our acquisition of MPNU, we will add significant production from offshore assets with dedicated export terminals that also have higher availability and lower reconciliation losses.\u201d\n\nShareholders who spoke at the meeting were unanimous in their commendation of the board and management of Seplat for the impressive financial results.\n\nAyodele Kudaisi of Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN) who tagged her comments as validatory/ recommendation said, \u201cAs the saying goes, there\u2019s nothing that has beginning that doesn\u2019t have an end. It is so painful to all shareholders that you have to leave at this point in time. You have done so well and so much for the entity called Seplat Energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and your team have taken Seplat to an enviable position among all its peers, with resiliency, commitment, focus and unsurpassed objectivity.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, another shareholder, Prince Dr, Anthony Omoniyi Omojola, current national coordinator, Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria said \u201cThat Seplat Energy Plc is a reliable energy company with limitless potentials is not a mere statement. This has been aptly demonstrated in our performance in the 2021 annual report and accounts we are considering.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have shown leadership by example by your actions as we pray to reap the benefits of this well planned out accelerated growth pattern. We congratulate you. We are proud of the strong foundation you have laid to position Seplat as a leading indigenous energy company in Nigeria within a short space,\u201d Omojola said.\n\nMatthew Akinlade, president, Noble Shareholders Solidarity Association (NSSA) said \u201cThis is a unique occasion that one must commend the Board and Management of the company for stellar performance.

Those of us who are 60 years old never heard of a crisis in Warji before this time.\n\n\u201cI must commend religious leaders, traditional leaders and security personnel for putting up a combined effort that lead to quenching of the violence.\u201d\n\nMohammed, who visited the town in the company of heads of security agencies in the state and top government officials, maintained that peace was an integral part of development and appealed to people, particularly adherents of the two major religions in the state, to be tolerant of each other\u2019s religion with a view to enabling his administration to continue with its developmental projects across the state.\n\nGovernor Mohammed added that the spate of insecurity across the country was enough source of worry for every well meaning Nigerian.\n\nThe governor said the state government under his leadership had special regard for peace and religious tolerance, adding that for that reason it would not spare anyone found fanning the embers of trouble in any parts of the state.\n\nHe assured that an investigation would be carried out on the incident in order to forestall recurrence of such unfortunate incident in the state.\n\n\u201cMy administration has a special regard for peace and religious tolerance and I will not fold my arms to allow unpatriotic people cause trouble in any part of the state,\u201d he vowed.\n\nThe administration, according to the governor, was doing everything possible to promote peace and stability in the state and would not allow any challenges capable of causing setbacks to the state\n\nSpeaking earlier, the chairman, Warji LGA, Adamu Muhammad Danjumai, commended the governor for the prompt visit.\n\nDanjumai also commended security operatives for their prompt intervention, which he said greatly helped in restoring normalcy to the town, pledging to work closely with security agents to ensure peace and stability in the area.\n\nOn his part, the state Commissioner of Police, Umar Sanda, informed that the police and other security agencies quickly intervened and brought the ugly incident under control.\n\nCP Sanda vowed that the police and other security agencies would not tolerate people taking laws into their hands\n\nHe, however, urged religious leaders in the state to always assist in sensitising their followers on the need to have peace, tolerance as well as religious knowledge.",

Let it end now, in Affirmative Action,\u201d he said, citing previous killings for alleged blasphemy in Kano and Bauchi states.\n\nHe spoke in Abuja at the launch of the memorial publication on the late Chief of Army Staff, General Ibrahim Attahiru.\n\nAlthough he acknowledged the condemnation of the killing by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Sultan of Sokoto who also serves as the Amir of Nigerian moslems, women organisations, workers\u2019 unions and professionals from all walks of life, he deplored the Chief Imam of the National Mosque, Abuja, Professor Ibrahim Maqari and a few others for allegedly justifying the Sokoto lynching.\n\nHe said: \u201cTo anyone who cares to listen, Maqari has implicitly directed his followers to take the law into their own hands in the name of religion, and in a nation beset on all sides by wars of ultra-nationalism and religious fanaticism. That is the message of a supposedly holy man to youths, to us, his message to a nation embroiled in a madness of multiple insurgencies.\u201d\n\nSoyinka said the imam should be removed from office and tried \u201cunder any existing laws that approximate hate rhetoric, incitement to murder and abuse of office.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have gone beyond theocratic rhetoric that merely pays lip service to civilized norms. Let all pietistic denunciations be backed by affirmative action.\u201d\n\nOn the security challenges in the country, Soyinka called for what he called off-beat, lateral thinking, new constructs outside orthodox boxes of military engagement.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet no one imagine that the ongoing insurgency will forever remain within its present borders. It spreads. It contaminates. It breeds mutations in the least expected places.\n\n\u201cTo anticipate, and prepare, is not even military thinking but the urging of common sense \u2013 and that, is universal territory.\u2019\n\nBut he explained that his call for total mobilization \u201cis not meant to expand the military as a career but to induce its social integration as a calling.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe entirety of national life, lifestyle, priorities, urgently demands re-designing to respond, holistically, to the exigencies of current abnormalities.\n\n\u201cThe much-touted, consistently sidelined, willfully misrepresented call for National Restructuring, for instance, as well as proposals for state and community policing, are only alternative and/or partial expressions of this holistic and urgent imperative.\n\n\u201cWe continue to ignore it at the peril of total, messy, irreversible disintegration.\u201d\n\nGeneral Attahiru died last year in Kaduna when his plane from the Air Force fleet exploded as it landed at the airport.",

          "title": "UK court seizes \u00a32m cash linked to Jerry Useni",
          "text": "Judge accuses former FCT minister of creating four accounts to conceal proceeds of corruption\n\nUseni says sums paid into accounts were gifts from friends, relatives, well-wishers on festive occasions\n\nA Royal Court in Jersey Island, United Kingdom has reportedly seized about \u00a32 million belonging to Lt. Gen. Jeremiah Useni (rtd), a former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory during the Gen. Sani Abacha-led military administration.\n\nThe said sum, described by a Jersey Island publication, Bailiwick Express, as \u201cdirty money transferred into local bank accounts by a Nigerian General and politician said to be corrupt dictator Sani Abacha\u2019s right-hand man\u201d, was said allegedly transferred by Useni into four Standard Chartered Bank accounts on the Island.\n\nUseni, the second most senior officer under the rule of General Abacha between 1993 and 1998, was said to have first opened an account in Jersey in 1986 in the name of \u2018Mr Tim Shani\u2019, who he later admitted did not exist and presented himself as the true account holder.\n\n\u201cOver the next 15 years, money totalling \u00a31.9m was transferred into four accounts held by \u2018Mr Shani\u2019 with Standard Chartered Bank,\u201d the publication stated.\n\nIt added: \u201cIn 2001, the bank wrote to Gen Useni \u2013 believing him to be \u2018Mr Shani\u2019 \u2013 informing him that changes to anti-money laundering legislation in Jersey had resulted in stricter regulations, including the need to have a certified copy of his passport.\n\n\u201cIn response, six months later, \u2018Mr Shani\u2019 requested that the entire balance in his existing accounts be transferred to a Nigerian bank, in which it transpires that Gen. Useni was a shareholder.\n\n\u201cThis request was rejected, and in February 2003, the bank was refused permission to operate the accounts by the police\u2019s Joint Financial Crimes Unit. \u201cThere followed several attempts by Gen Useni\u2019s lawyer to unfreeze the accounts and, in 2007, Gen Useni finally identified himself as the true owner of the Shani accounts.\n\n\u201cGiving his occupation as \u2018Lieutenant-General\u2019, he informed Standard Chartered that the main source of his wealth was derived from the profits of his multiple businesses, which included transportation, hotel hospitality, petrol stations, personal savings and property investment.\n\n\u201cHe said the reason for opening a Jersey-based account was for \u201csecurity\u201d as it was \u201cnecessary to hold a proportion of wealth outside of Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, the bank asked Gen Useni to explain the source of the money and why he had transferred it to the accounts, as well as \u2018supporting documentation to back up the provenance of the funds\u2019 and a full explanation as to why the account was originally opened up under a different name.\u201d\n\nBailiwick Express said although in correspondence the following year Gen. Useni said he dealt in property investment where he sold some and put some in rent and owned a shopping centre, two petrol stations and a domestic gas station, a farm and a rice mill, he provided no information about his income in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe publication stated: \u201cHe (Useni) added that he had not set up the original account in a false name, rather he had used a \u2018coded password name\u2019 as advised by the person who had set it up on his behalf. \u201cHowever, he did not explain why he had used \u2018Tim Shani\u2019, with Jersey\u2019s Attorney General concluding that he did so in order to further distance himself from the ownership of assets that had a likely criminal origin.\n\n\u201cIn a judgment handed down this morning setting out its decision to order the transfer of the \u00a32m into the island\u2019s Criminal Offences Confiscation Fund\u2019, the Royal Court said: \u2018The Attorney General believes that the Shani accounts were created to hold, hide and conceal bribes or other proceeds of corruption received by Useni during the period he held office.\n\n\u201cThe payments into the Shani accounts were more likely than not for the purposes or on account of exercising political influence over the award of lucrative contracts to foreign and Nigerian companies for the supply of industrial or commercial services in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf this conduct had occurred in Jersey, it would have constituted the customary law offence of misconduct in a public office.\u201d\n\nThe report added that through a Jersey-based lawyer, Gen. Useni fought but failed to prevent the seizure.\n\nHe was also said to have explained the source of the funds in a written affidavit as follows: \u201cIn accordance with a culture of gift-giving in Nigeria, which is still accepted practice in Nigeria, government officials from time to time receive cash gifts from friends and well-wishers during festive seasons.\n\n\u201cThese acts are similar to gifts being provided by Members of Parliament in England or corporate gifts being provided to directors/employees.\n\n\u201cThe culture needs to be looked at in the context of when I was a government official, and at that material time, save there being a culture of gift-giving, there was no official code of conduct governing the issue.\n\n\u201cThis could also be said to be true for the western governments, from what I know, so Nigeria should not be chastised or criticised for this.\u201d\n\nExplaining the use of the name of a fictitious person to set up the original account, Useni reportedly said: \u201cThe primary reason for this again was nothing sinister, but for my own protection. As you will understand from reviewing Nigeria\u2019s history, it has had a number of coups, and we are now on our fifth republic.\n\n\u201cThe governmental regimes are unstable, and if rulers came into office who are not friendly to my political persuasion, my wealth and safety could be on the line.\u201d\n\nHe reportedly added that the money constituted savings for his retirement and there had not been a code of conduct in place in Nigeria at the time obliging him to declare it.\n\nHowever, the Royal Court was not convinced by his explanations.\n\nIt said: \u201cEssentially, [Gen Useni\u2019s] case is that the source of the substantial sums paid into the bank accounts is cash gifts from friends, relatives and well-wishers on festive and other ceremonial occasions in accordance with Nigerian custom, but in the view of the Court, it is simply not credible that friends, relatives and well-wishers would make gifts to [Gen Useni], as a public official, of such magnitude to allow him not only to accumulate millions in these bank accounts, but to acquire the very substantial assets he said he owned in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is an explanation that verges on the absurd.\u201d\n\nIt also found that there had been a code of conduct for public officials in place in Nigeria well before substantial amounts were paid into the Jersey accounts.\n\nIt concluded: \u201cThe affidavits of [Gen Useni] have not satisfied the Court that the property held in the bank accounts is not tainted property and on the application of the Attorney General, we will make a Forfeiture Order in relation to that property.\u201d\n\nThe Court reportedly ordered that \u00a345,000 be taken out of the amount seized to pay Standard Chartered Bank\u2019s legal costs.\n\nIn 2020, Jersey returned more than \u00a3230m of money to Nigeria which had been laundered through the United States and the island by Gen. Abacha.",

          "title": "Dozens of lawyers to the defence of Sokoto killers",
          "text": "It is one of the galling realities of Northern Nigeria that it was not difficult to find lawyers to defend two men suspected of involvement in the lynching of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto. Not only was it easy to assemble lawyers almost spontaneously, it was also easy to find nearly three dozens of them led by a law lecturer at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, Mansur Ibrahim, a professor. The two suspects, Bilyaminu Aliyu and Aminu Hukunci, need defence lawyers; but to find nearly three dozen lawyers eager to defend the suspected killers is a reflection of the ethical and moral miasma the region is enveloped in. The two accused were among dozens involved in the lynching of Miss Samuel, a lynching depressingly inspired and orchestrated by her fellow students over unsubstantiated allegations of blasphemy.\n\nThe murder has shockingly become a barometer of the mindset of northern elites. Apart from the high calibre defence team, some of them learned in the principles of law, other key northern officials ranging from serving bureaucrats to former government officials have shamelessly jumped to the defence of the killers. State commissioners, serving or retired, waffling former Nigerian leaders, Deputy Chief Imam of the Abuja Central Mosque, Ibrahim Maqari, a professor, and a host of notable individuals whom the society respected have joined the fray on the side of the killers. It became clear last week that the core North has vacillated very badly on the murder, cannot be persuaded to condemn the lynching, and prefers to quibble over the alleged blasphemy.\n\nIt is unclear why there is so much ambiguity on the lynching of the young student, or why there seems to be near unanimity of opinion in the North on the supposed guilt of Miss Samuel. Despite that confusion, what is even more important is why the supporters of the killers side with the extra-legal measures taken by the lynchers. First there was no consensus on the issue of blasphemy or the guilt of Miss Samuel. Yet, without recourse to the law or even the principles of Islamic jurisprudence, lynchers carried out an execution. The lynching and the complicity of a significant section of the Northern elite expose the ugly underbelly of the core North. It is an ugliness that has been long in maturing, but is now in full bloom. The lynchers and their supporting regional elite displayed ignorance of the law, not to say a visceral hatred of minorities, whether ethnic or religious. The consequent bifurcation of the core North and the religious and ethnic dichotomies which are its byproducts may eventually become the fuel that will conflagrate the region swarming with hordes of bitter, uneducated and unemployed youths.\n\nIt is inconceivable that only two people were involved in the murder of Miss Samuel. Dozens and dozens of gleeful and bloodthirsty rioters participated. To forestall their arrest and to cripple a possible police dragnet to haul the fleeing murderers before the law, a riot of indescribable proportion was organised to foil the attempt and prevent societal retribution. Such murder and lack of retribution are not without precedent in the region. If the madness is to end, the Sokoto State government, Nigerian Justice ministry, presidential aspirant and governor of the state Aminu Tambuwal, not to say the president himself, Muhammadu Buhari, have a chance to prove that such bloodthirstiness would not be tolerated on their watch. There are doubts that their denunciations of the crime committed on May 12 by the Sokoto mob were genuine and sever enough. But as tame as some thought the denunciations were, the relevant officials must have had time to reflect on the international disgrace the murder has brought upon Nigeria, not to say the ham-fisted and desultory manner the crime has been handled.\n\nThe murder was committed virtually in the presence of social media. Many of the faces seen on camera have not been arrested. It is not clear, given the riots that followed the arrest of two suspects, that the police will be eager to find the fleeing murderers. It would, however, be unwise to leave the assignment to local police. The crime calls for the deployment of federal police investigators, crack detectives who would brook no opposition. In addition, the trial of the arrested suspects should require the involvement of the Nigerian Justice ministry. This is the ministry\u2019s opportunity to prove that the Nigerian constitution is above any religion, region or ethnic group. Given what is on the ground, local prosecutors are likely to make heavy weather of the trial, and will in view of local hostility find it difficult to prove the involvement of the two suspects. They will need external help. Indeed, defence lawyers will focus more on trying to prove a lack of evidence tying the suspects to the crime. But whether by incompetent investigations and prosecution or by clever defence by smart lawyers, exculpating the suspects will be interpreted as official connivance. That would be truly tragic.\n\nWhether Sokoto State officials, northern elites and the federal government realise it or not, Miss Samuel\u2019s lynching is capable of making ethnic and religious divisions in the country widen into a chasm as hate preachers and extremists begin to entrench themselves in state and federal governments. If decisive steps are not taken to find Miss Samuel\u2019s killers and investigate and successfully prosecute a crime committed openly to the shame of the country and streamed live, more and more Nigerians may begin to lose hope in the unity and stability of Nigeria. Too many northern elites have demonstrated irresponsibility and shamelessness in this murder case, which they hide under the cover of blasphemy. Hopefully, Sokoto State and the federal government are sensitive enough to realise that sweeping this case under the carpet or handling it shoddily will have consequences.\n\nHafsat Abiola-Costello on Yahaya Bello\n\nThe Director-General of the Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Orgnisation, Hafsat Abiola-Costello, needs no introduction. Nor, going by the huge price her parents paid in their fight for democracy, does she need introduction to politics. She was born into it; and now, as DG of a campaign organisation, has the chance to prove her mettle. Whether Mr Bello, Governor of Kogi State, wins the nomination or not, Mrs Abiola-Costello has now cut her teeth in politics and will likely continue in it for a long time. It is ironic that she is doing it, as she observed, in North Central, not her native Southwest.\n\nBut addressing journalists in Lagos last Monday, she said a few things out of sync with her brilliance and altruism. Defending her role as DG of the Yahaya Bello campaign, not to say her optimism about the relevance and qualification of the aspirant, she declared: \u201cI am proud of GYB because of his development records in Kogi. This is a governor that is always looking for progress and the development of lives of his people. This is me, a Yoruba, supporting someone from North Central. There is no progress without demands; I lost my parents, though unfortunately, because Nigerians believed in them. I\u2019ve been working with GYB for a while and I have seen that he has the courage and intelligence to deliver Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNo, madam, GYB does not have the courage and intelligence to deliver anything, not himself, not Kogi, let alone Nigeria. And as to GYB looking for the progress and development of the lives of his people, nothing could be further from the truth. Mrs Abiola-Costello said a few more glamorous things about the aspirant, including his economic record. She exaggerated his credentials and capacity. The aspirant she described is completely alien to Kogi people. They would like to meet such a man, real or fictional. Having ruled the state for about six years, GYB has proved nothing near what the director-general painted. She painted a myth; Kogites know a monstrous failure.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer Imo State governor, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, is a reporter\u2019s delight any day anytime.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with Sunday Sun, he spoke on a wide range of issues, especially the forthcoming presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe senator representing Imo West equally reacted to the unending crisis raging between him and the incumbent governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodimma, why the killings in the Southeast has persisted and the practical solutions to solving the escalating killings.\n\nDo you in anyway feel intimidated by the galaxy of APC presidential aspirants squaring it up with you?\n\nIn the contrary, I am rather happy because it makes the competition much more interesting. You may recall that I am more or less a veteran on this, having contested for presidency first, second and third times. So, it is not a strange terrain for me. What you have seen being displayed will rather make it more interested. Sincerely speaking, I am happy to see these arrays of people contesting for the office of the president. This is the time for the party to assess the individual track records and who they are before deciding. So, I am not in any way threatened or intimidated. In the contrary, I feel much more qualified to bring victory to our party if given the presidential ticket.\n\nBreaking!!! Earn up to N2 - N3 million monthly GUARANTEED (all paid in US Dollars).

I am right to say that Nigeria needs three basic things now, the first is a unifier, an individual who can win this election and every part of this nation will feel belonged. We are talking about a detribalised Nigerian, and that is where Rochas comes first. I don\u2019t have any tribal sentiment or mark. The second is that Nigeria needs somebody who understands the problems of this country and can grow the economy. I have been able to identify the problems of this country and that is about wealth creation. Other aspirants may have 10, 15 to 20-point agenda, but I have only one. Create you the wealth of this country and every other problem will be solved. What we are battling with is lack of adequate funds to fix our nation, and the hunger, poverty, insecurity, joblessness for our youths. It is not everyone that has the capacity to create wealth. Therefore, at the end, Rochas stands out head and shoulders above others in this case. The third point is finding where we are in this country and the mood of the nation, you will find out that this nation requires somebody with compassionate heart, somebody with the heart of gold and somebody that cares because you cannot give what you don\u2019t have. I care especially for the poor and the downtrodden and I am sure that their prayers will see me through. This is where I stand tall above others especially as it concerns the poor and the needy. High percentage of this country is in poverty.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThese three major issues will be the deciding factors for the party and Nigerians to choose their next president. Another very important point also is that the APC is wise enough to know which candidate can defeat the opposition party and who is nationally accepted. The good thing is that they know that I have that national acceptance whether from the Muslims, Christians, Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba. That again stands me out and I believe that by God\u2019s grace, I will clinch the presidency of Nigeria and what is holding me from the Aso Rock Villa is the ticket of the APC. And once I have it, the did is done. There will be a new and great Nigeria, where everybody will be proud of under my leadership.\n\nWhat will be your reaction should Buhari or the party adopt consensus option for presidential candidate?\n\nI don\u2019t see that happening. What is likely to happen is that the party will consider the mood of the nation. Just as the southerners are saying that it is wrong for the northerners to aspire again after eight years, the same mood suggests that it will not be proper for the Southwest to contest again to keep the same power after having eight years of presidency and eight years of vice presidency. The consensus we will be looking at is the type that will narrow it to the Southeast. It is the best consensus for the APC.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nWhy has it become difficult for you to mend fences with Governor Hope Uzodimma?\n\nThat is a very difficult question and I don\u2019t even have an answer. Here is a willing heart for peace, to mend fences and there is no receiving heart for peace. However, I don\u2019t think it is an issue any longer. We have pushed that behind us and forged ahead. I even made the ultimate sacrifice particularly in the last national convention of our party when I told my candidate to withdraw to allow the governor\u2019s candidate for the Zonal Vice Chairman to go. He picked all the positions.\n\nI had a court judgment for the State Exco of Imo, but they are not recognised. I again, maintained my calm. What else will I prove that I want peace at all costs, but when you want peace at all costs, and it is not forthcoming, you must see it natural and divine. My major concern is the level of killings in the state especially in my senatorial zone. If there is anything making my heart to bleed, it is because people are beheaded on daily basis. Human body treated like a trash.\n\nSuch attitude is very, very unIgbo. Never in our checkered history or culture did it happen or did we condescend this low. This is only happening within this administration. And anytime that anything is going wrong in any state, hold the leadership responsible. I was governor for eight years, there was an absolute peace. I tolerated all the political nonsense and that is what leadership is all about. If you are not ready to tolerate, don\u2019t go into leadership. This is the simple truth and how it is supposed to be.\n\nBut he said that political opponents are responsible for the killings?\n\nHe said that no PDP person was killed, but only the APC and that it is political opponents so it is no longer about Rochas, PDP will have to answer if they are actually responsible for the killings or not. I have challenged him to mention names when he said it was political opponents, but that didn\u2019t happen. He seems to have narrowed it very well. Since PDP are not killed, it means the people doing the killings must be PDP and they should explain to us.\n\nWhat are the practical solutions to the killings in the Southeast and do you think government has done enough?\n\nIt is unfortunate and that is what I rather say because I had expected that the government should have done more engagements rather than being confrontational since government has shown absolute weakness and inability to handle the situation. The confession of inadequacy is not a disgrace to any man in leadership. Accepting it and making efforts to correct it is the wisdom behind leadership.\n\nDeep down you, what are your fears as you go into the presidential race?\n\nAbsolutely no fear, I will be the president of Nigeria. If this nation is to grow and be great, Rochas should be on the driving seat. I am confident of becoming it and I will achieve it. Above all, God loves this country and He is about to do magic thing for this country. And 2023 will be the beginning of a new Nigeria.",

          "text": "\n\n*No signal there\u2019ll be free, fair elections in 2023, PDP alerts EU\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF) has condemned in strong terms the decision by the two main political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to jettison \u201cthe time-honored principle of rotation,\u201d ahead of their presidential primaries, \u201cwhich has traditionally served as the glue holding Nigeria together.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same day, the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyochia Ayu yesterday told a visiting delegation of the European Union (EU) that his party was not getting very encouraging signals that there would be free and fair elections in the country next year.\n\n\n\nThe SMBLF in a communiqu\u00e9, issued yesterday at the end of its meeting in Abuja, signed by its Chairman, Chief Edwin Clark; Leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President-General, Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus; President-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor; and National Chairman, Pan-Niger Delta Forum, Senator Emmanuel Essien, warned that the reported permutations by the two parties to foist Northern presidential candidates on the nation would be a grave misadventure, with grim consequences on national concord and harmony.\n\n\n\nIt reiterated its stance on the principle of zoning and power rotation between the North and the South, as the basis on which the Nigerian Federation has, since Independence, been premised, stressing that they are fundamental to the future existence of the country.\n\n\n\nSMBLF therefore called on all delegates of all political parties to reject Presidential aspirants, or candidates, from the North, and only vote for those from the South in the party primaries.\n\nThe Forum also called on all politicians and professionals from the South not to accept, on any account, the position of Vice President, as that would amount to a shameful committal of present and future generations of Southern Nigeria to senseless political vassalage.\n\n\n\nThe leaders, while commending a number of northern governors such as Malam Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State, Babagana Umara Zulum of Borno State, and Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State, who have demonstrated great patriotism by their public support for the rotation of the presidency to the South, urged other northern leaders, who believe in the oneness of Nigeria, to support this cause, because therein lies the unity and progress of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nOn the worsening state of insecurity and rampaging violence across the country, the Forum warned that Nigeria was plummeting into a state of total disorder and lawlessness, with attacks on innocent people resulting in kidnapping, loss of lives and destruction of properties happening in different parts of the country almost daily.\n\nThe Forum condemned in unmistakable terms, the killing of Miss Deborah Samuel Yakubu, a student of the College of Education, Sokoto, by her Muslim schoolmates and the wide spread violence that engulfed the state, following the arrest of two of her killers.\n\n\n\nAccording to the leaders: \u201cSadly, the federal government and its security agencies are not doing enough to arrest the situation, whereby people can no longer travel safely either by road, rail or even by air to Kaduna State in particular. It is not only frightening but unimaginable that despite the heavy presence of military commands and installations in the State there could be such security challenges.\u201d\n\nThe SMBLF cited the bombing of the Kaduna-Abuja bound train over 60 days ago, as well as the brazen attack on motorists on the Abuja-Kaduna Road about two days ago, saying, \u201con both occasions, innocent lives were lost while several people were wounded with many abducted. Undesirably, most of those who were kidnapped are still in the terrorists\u2019 captivity after 60 days.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt said it classified these killings as pervasive acts of aggression on the indigenous people, \u201cbeing perpetrated by elements of Islamic extremism and terrorists, as cultural genocide and ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nThe SMBLF continued: \u201cThe Meeting cautions that these bellicosities and deliberate programme to exterminate the indigenous populations of the Middle Belt are, by implication, acts of aggression against the rest of Nigeria, and would not be tolerated any further. The Meeting resolved to resist, through all legitimate means, the barefaced attempts by religious fundamentalists to impose on the rest of us, a Nigeria of \u201cone country, different laws.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo Signal There\u2019ll Be Free, Fair Elections in 2023, PDP Alerts EU\n\nAyu yesterday told a visiting delegation of the European Union (EU) that his party was not getting very encouraging signals that there would be free and fair elections in the country next year.\n\nAyu, who spoke when the EU delegation, led by Samuela Isopi, visited the party as part of its mission on the Nigerian 2023 general election, said \u201cinsecurity is at its peak in Nigeria and extending beyond the rural areas and even coming to the urban centers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP Chairman drew the attention of the EU and other members of the international community to the fact that Nigerians want free and fair elections in the country, adding, \u201cThe signals that we\u2019re getting are not very encouraging.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyu told the EU delegation: \u201cAs a political party, we want to appreciate the European Union for their various contributions to Nigeria, whether economically or politically. There are also important cultural exchanges that are vital to our country; we want to appreciate the European Union for that.\n\n\u201cI would say that I also want to appreciate the interest in the growth of democracy in Nigeria, for the last 24 years that this political party came on board and helped to stabilise democracy in Nigeria, the European Union has actually been a very worthy partner.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always given support, they\u2019ve shown interest, and we hope this will continue, because we don\u2019t want to return to the dark days of dictatorship. We hope that the European Union, as our friends in the international community, will continue to support genuine democratic processes and institutions, because no country lives as an isolated entity in the world. And therefore we think that the European Union and other friends of Nigeria have an important role to play.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the ongoing registration of voters, he told the EU team that the PDP was not getting a favourable technical report because the regulatory body (INEC) lacked the technical capacity to register more voters in the ongoing registrations exercise.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ayu, \u201cIt is not just the mobilisation by the political parties, but it is also the technical capacity of INEC to go out there and register Nigerians because in a population of almost 200 million People, we expect that 40% of the population should be captured on the electoral register and that is not the case.\n\n\u201cI think what we have today is less than 5% and it\u2019s not good enough.\n\n\u201cAnd, therefore, we want to call on INEC and all our friends that can help in that direction to make sure more people are captured on the electoral register.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyu told the European Union delegation that by the end of this month, Nigerians would be in position to know the next president of the country, boasting that the PDP would produce the next president.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe know that in the next eight days, we will know the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, because once the delegates in our political party, cast their vote, and the pronouncement is made on who is the candidate of the PDP, we will not be calling him candidate of the PDP, we will be calling him the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, he said the All Progressive Congress (APC) should be willing to accept defeat when the time comes.\n\nAyu said: \u201cWe worry about post elections as a political party. We have demonstrated that democracy is best when you transit smoothly from one electoral cycle to the other. And therefore, we want everybody to appreciate what we did when we lost elections in 2015. We didn\u2019t use agencies of the state to stay in power.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe conceded defeat and when we win, we expect those who are currently in government to concede defeat because they are going to lose the next election. And they shouldn\u2019t hang in there and create an atmosphere of instability in the country. So with the current escalation of violence in the country, we hope, and we pray, that it is not deliberate to extend the tenure of this administration which has failed the country. We hope that when they lose, they also will willingly concede defeat, and hand over power to the Nigerian people.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a political party, we\u2019re having our convention in the next eight days. And in the tradition of this party, we want our convention to be very transparent; we will provide a fair and open view to everybody i.e. our 15 presidential aspirants.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyu also lamented the rising debt of Nigeria, saying when the PDP was in power, Nigeria was a debt-free country.\n\nHe said. \u201cToday, we are the country with the highest debt to GDP in the world, it is in trillions. It is our hope that this will not continue because it has a direct impact on the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThe lack of employment opportunities, lack of attention to even education, lack of attention to industrialisation, these have worsened the condition of our people, particularly the youth. Therefore, these are areas, as a party, we\u2019re interested in addressing when we come back to power because we believe that Nigerians will vote for the PDP in the next election.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation, Isopi, said the EU had been supporting Nigeria in strengthening its democratic governance through the support of all the stakeholders from INEC to the other actors and players of the process of the society, the media, and the political parties.\n\nShe further stated. \u201cWe have also at the request of the Nigerian authorities always deployed electoral observation, to entrench the process of democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is part of our regular consultations with all the stakeholders, actors and partners, particularly in view of the next elections and I would like to reaffirm our support to Nigeria\u2019s democracy and we continue to work together with all the institutions and stakeholders involved.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Narrates how DSS tried to save victim, assures Nigerians justice will be served\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nThe Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal yesterday approved the immediate lifting of the curfew imposed on the state last week to curtail the spread of violence that followed the killing of Deborah Yakubu, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education by some fanatical Muslim schoolboys who accused her of blaspheming Prophet Mohammed.\n\n\n\nThe governor also banned all forms of processions in the state until further notice.\n\nOn the same day, the governor, a PDP presidential aspirant, who was on a campaign visit to Asaba, Delta State, gave a detailed account of how the DSS tried to save Deborah, but were over-powered by the mob, assuring Nigerians that justice will be served.\n\nDeborah was killed and her remains were set on fire by the extremists, two of whom have been arrested and arraigned by the Sokoto State Police Command.\n\n\n\nTambuwal\u2019s announcement lifting the curfew is contained in a statement released yesterday by the state\u2019s Commissioner for Information, Isah Galadanci.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cActing on enabling powers under section 176 (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, section 1, 2, and 4 of the Public Order Act, and section 15 of Sokoto State Peace Preservation Law, the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, has, after due consultations, lifted the curfew imposed on Sokoto metropolis with immediate effect\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Governor has urged the general public to be law-abiding and remain peaceful at all times, stressing the need for peaceful co-existence amongst the people in the state. He reiterated the need for peace as the necessary foundation for any meaningful development.\u201d\n\n\u2018Deborah: Justice Will be Served\u2019\n\nWhile speaking in Asaba, Delta State yesterday, Tambuwal assured Nigerians that justice will be served in the killing of Deborah.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen shortly after his meeting with PDP delegates in the Unity Hall, Government House Asaba, Tambuwal described the incident as unfortunate because \u201cSokoto is a peaceful place where people live peacefully irrespective of ethnic or religious differences.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor said nobody has right to take laws into their hands, while also debunking the rumour that no attempt was made by security officials to save Deborah from the mob attack.\n\nHe said that personnel of the Department of State Security (DSS) got to the scene early and had rescued the victim to a safe place before the mob overpowered the DSS officials.\n\n\n\nTambuwal said, \u201cThe security agencies, particularly the DSS, were able to get to the school in time and they were actually able to get our sister, Deborah rescued from the hands of the mob initially. As they were mobilising forces from the military barrack and the police command, the mob was growing.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, one of the DSS personnel that really attempted to save her is in hospital receiving treatment because he had a broken head and another one had a broken hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, they were actually overpowered. It is not as if she was left alone; there was rescue attempt by the DSS and they were where she was locked for safety but the mob overpowered them.\n\n\u201cIt was not that the security agencies didn\u2019t respond; maybe, they didn\u2019t respond adequately, but there was a response.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSokoto is one state where the state government, which l preside over, pays the school fees and give school materials to every student of Nigeria that is schooling in our public schools without discrimination.\n\n\u201cSo, we don\u2019t discriminate against our brothers who are from other parts of the country and we live peacefully.\n\n\u201cNormalcy has returned to Sokoto and the matter is in court and it is being tried. l can assure you that by the special grace of God, there will be justice in that matter.\u201d\n\nTambuwal: Buhari\u2019s Exclusion of South-East in Govt Fuelling Insecurity\n\nEarlier yesterday, the Sokoto State Governor was in Imo State as part of his campaign for the presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\nWhile addressing the Imo State chapter of the PDP on his presidential aspiration, Tambuwal said the insecurity in the South-east was a result of the exclusion of the people of the zone from the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government.\n\n\n\nThe governor said his presidency, if elected, would quench insecurity in the zone by incorporating a large number of people from the zone into his administration.\n\nAccording to him, the people of the zone feel cheated that Buhari left them out in the scheme of things in his regime.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cBuhari has shortchanged the South-East. I was the one who advised Saraki to choose Ike Enweremadu to become his deputy in 2015. There is a complete case of exclusion of the people of South East. The head of the ten most important parastatals are not from South-East, including the CBN governor.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of the service chiefs is from the South-east. The president, the vice president, the Senate president, the deputy senate president, the speaker of the House of Representatives and his deputy are not from the South-east.

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

Also, engage my newsletter by leaving your thoughts and encouraging others to subscribe. Promise to do it? Pinky swear? I believe you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo, I\u2019m excited today, and you know why! \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a Tomorrow is the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Africa Summit (TABS)! Well, honestly, it\u2019s been a stressful week for the Techpoint Africa team. But, you know what? It\u2019s over already. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve registered, you\u2019ll see all the fantastic things we\u2019ve packaged just for you tomorrow. However, all tickets, including giveaways, are sold out.\n\nSo, prepare your NFT and web3 questions. You also don\u2019t want to miss the exhibition booth, networking, and the hackathon\u2019s grand finale. You\u2019re excited too, aren\u2019t you? \ud83d\ude09 I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\n\nIf you do not have a ticket to the physical event, you can register online for free here.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\nNetflix\u2019s Mystery Box\n\nTikTok\u2019s plan to credit creators\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory Farms, a Kenyan-based startup, has raised $5 million in new funding.\n\nEd Brakeman, a senior managing director at Bain Capital and Hans den Bieman, Founder and ex-CEO of Mowi, a company that claims to be one of the world\u2019s largest salmon businesses, led the investment.\n\nLaunched in 2015 by Joseph Rehmann (CEO), Victory Farms is a tilapia aquaculture startup and farm with hatcheries, nursery ponds, and deep-water cages.\n\nThe company claims to have grown twice as fast as any other African fish company. Also, the CEO says they have sold to mass market Africans through a highly innovative Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) cold chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Rehmann, the RTM cold chain uses predictive data to push fish to thousands of marketers every day across Kenya with less than 1% spoilage.\n\nCurrently, Victory Farms has more than 54 retail locations where over 15,000 market women go to buy fish, and according to Rehmann, they use no electricity or ice.\n\nThis funding will enable the company to expand into Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.\n\nNetflix for kids and people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix has launched \u201cMystery Box\u201d, a new feature that helps kids discover new movies and TV shows.\n\nWhy? Netflix wants children to try new movies. According to Netflix, children frequently rewatch their favourite shows, making it difficult to persuade them to try something new.\n\nAlso, the company says Mystery Box will provide kids with a personalised experience that will assist them in discovering their next favourite series or movies, and reconnect them with a familiar character.\n\nThis is now available on the company\u2019s connected TV platforms globally.\n\nNetflix is also expanding its accessibility features globally and launching a new collection featuring stories about people with disabilities in honour of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which was observed yesterday, May 19, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the company is expanding its subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) and audio descriptions (AD) offerings in additional languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\nWhy? Heather Dowdy, Netflix\u2019s Director of Accessibility, stated that they are adding more subtitles because more subscribers are watching disability-inclusive content globally.\n\nMoreover, remember that Netflix reported a 200,000-subscriber loss globally in the first quarter of 2022. Perhaps, this could be a strategy for Netflix to retain and gain more subscribers.\n\nTikTok to credit creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never used TikTok, but I\u2019m considering signing up. You\u2019re asking me why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\nJust this month, the company introduced two new features \u2014 Pulse and Branded Mission \u2014 for content creators to earn money on the app.\n\nDespite its popularity, TikTok has been criticised for amplifying trends without crediting the original creators. TikTok launched a new feature to that effect two days ago, May 18, 2022.\n\nThis feature, a button, allows creators to credit all types of inspiration for their content, like dances, jokes, and viral sounds. By tapping on \u201ccredit\u201d in the video\u2019s caption, TikTok viewers can discover the original creators behind the content.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nReport: The impact of Y Combinator in Africa over the years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know that YouTube can identify the most replayed parts of your video? This means you can skip some boring parts of YouTube videos. And no, you haven\u2019t missed out because the feature was introduced yesterday, May 18, 2022.\n\nThe company said it added a graph that people can use to quickly locate and watch parts played the most by other users. Per YouTube, \u201cif the graph is high, that part of the video has been replayed frequently.\u201d\n\nYouTube is also introducing another feature, Single Loop, which allows users to loop a video indefinitely. Moreover, in full-screen mode, a new panel will appear to display video information like the video description, video chapters, and comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, YouTube is expanding support for video chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles. It\u2019s a feature that enables users to skip ahead to a specific video section or easily rewatch that section.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAutochek\u2019s new acquisition\n\nTikTok\u2019s Branded Mission\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\nJumia\u2019s earnings for Q1 2022\n\nAutochek acquires Morocco\u2019s KIFAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek, a digital automotive commerce company, has acquired Morocco\u2019s KIFAL Auto.\n\nThis follows Autochek purchasing Cheki\u2019s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria and collaborating with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast last year.\n\nConsequently, Autochek is now available in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast). It\u2019s also present in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). And thanks to the acquisition of KIFAL Auto, it now has a presence in North Africa, specifically Morocco.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, KIFAL claims it\u2019s one of the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets for used and new cars.\n\nKIFAL Auto, like Autochek, connects car buyers and sellers and, through partnerships, provides financing and insurance.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Maane and the KIFAL Auto team joins Autochek to lead the company\u2019s North African expansion efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Autochek, it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and partnerships with over 70 financing partners, including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Bank.\n\nFor more information on this acquisition, listen to today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast here.\n\nTikTok to roll out a new ad product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has announced the launch of \u201cBranded Mission,\u201d a new advertising product.\n\nWith this product, creators will be able to connect with brands and potentially earn rewards for their videos using this product.\n\nAdvertisers can use the new ad product for crowdsourcing content from creators and turning top-performing videos into ads. Also, they can launch branded campaigns and encourage creators to participate in them.\n\nThey\u2019ll create a brief and distribute it to the creator community to encourage them to participate in Branded Missions. TikTok creators can then choose which Branded Missions to join.\n\nIn summary, Branded Mission allows emerging and aspiring creators to respond to ad casting calls directly on TikTok.\n\nSo, who is eligible to participate? Branded Missions are open to all creators who are 18 years old and above and have at least 1,000 followers.\n\nPer TikTok, eligible creators whose videos are chosen by brands will \u201cbenefit from a cash payment and increased traffic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company believes that this product will allow the TikTok community to have a creative hand in brand campaign ads.\n\nBranded Mission is currently in beta testing and is available to brands in over a dozen markets. Plus, it will be available in more markets later this year.\n\nSimilar, but kinda different: Recall that earlier this month, TikTok introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that allows brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nWell, the company emphasises that it is constantly looking for innovative ways to support creators and assist brands in reaching users on its platforms with relevant content.\n\nBesides, the product is currently available in 12 countries, with plans to expand into additional markets by the end of the year.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in two days!

The startup is focused on simple tools for merchants to manage their customers, record stocks, receive payments, make payments, and access cash advances against their future cash flow.\n\nBamba aims to be one of the innovators in addressing the lack of digital solutions for record-keeping and payments, which creates a barrier that prevents these businesses from scaling due to insufficient access to credit facilities.\n\nConsequently, it plans to use the funds to expand its engineering team and user base in 12 sub-Saharan African countries where mobile money is prevalent.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumia, the pan-African e-commerce company, announced its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.\n\nOn today\u2019s podcast, Chimgozirim refers to Jumia as \u201c\u2026the guy who never fulfils his potential.\u201d What?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d That was brutal, if you ask me. What do you think?\n\nAnyway, when you compare this report to the first quarter of 2021, you\u2019ll see how Jumia\u2019s results demonstrated consistent growth.\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking me how. Well, I\u2019ve got you. The report shows that Jumia experienced significant growth in orders, gross merchandise value (GMV), and revenue.\n\nIn other words, orders increased by 40% year on year, from 6.6 million to 9.3 million. GMV increased by 27% year on year, from $198.9 million to $252.7 million. And Jumia\u2019s revenue reached $47.6 million, up 44 percent from $33 million in Q1 2021.\n\nHowever, these figures fell far short of where the eCommerce giant ended 2021, with the last quarter recording GMV sales of $330 million, revenue of $62 million, and orders of 11.3 million.\n\nDespite \u201ccontinued global supply chain volatility for these categories,\u201d food delivery grew 86% year over year, while phones and electronics grew 19%.\n\nOther negatives include its Q1 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) loss, at $53 million, up 70% year on year.\n\nIf you want to know why Chimgozirim said what he said, don\u2019t forget to listen to the podcast.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSEC\u2019s rules: Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxation is not a subject that Nigerians want to talk about, but the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is about to make it unavoidable. Using the National Identification Number (NIN), the organisation wants to track financial transactions in the country to tax Nigerians effectively. Your NIN will be required for any transaction you engage in, including paying school fees or purchasing a car.\n\nThis was how we kicked off proceedings on the Techpoint Africa podcast today. While this development could increase government revenues, Oluwanifemi wondered how good this could be in light of revelations that cast doubt on the safety of data collected by Nigerian government agencies.\n\nNext was a look at Jumia\u2019s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1 2021, the company witnessed impressive growth with revenue growing to $47.6 million, orders growing to 9.3 million, and gross merchandise value hitting $252.7 million.\n\nWith the company announcing that it had acquired a payment service solution provider license (PSSP), we explored the possibility of the company growing its fintech footprints. We also touched briefly on its healthtech ambitions and its chances of survival.\n\nWe rounded up the day\u2019s discussion with news of Autochek\u2019s acquisition of the Moroccan cars marketplace KIFAL Autos and the viability of the BNPL model for cars. Emmanuel shared a Technext report that revealed that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales. With many Nigerians earning below 200,000, it\u2019s not clear how profitable these companies could be in the long run.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, please follow the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

They transmit knowledge and nurture human minds for optimal potential.\n\nIn Nigeria, the tertiary institutions are veritable tools for the realisation of socio-economic national development; hence the most powerful and critical success factor for individuals and society.\n\nHowever, in the face of the incessant insufficient funding beclouding public tertiary institutions in the country, many of these institutions are yet to tap into the numerous benefits of schools- private industry-partnership ventures.\n\nBut the Federal College of Education (Technical), Akoka, the story is different as the institution embraced and is maximizing the benefits of schools-private industries- partnership.\n\nAccording to Samuel Ukit, the dean school of technical education of FCE(T), Akoka, the college partnered with a firm \u2018Automedic Company \u2018 in the year 2009 with a memorandum of understanding geared toward the generation of revenues for both parties, which profited the college in many ways.\n\n\u201cIt exposed our students to numerous practical approaches to their career and in turn generated revenue to both the college and the Automedics,\u201d Ukit said.\n\nAkinpelu Oluwafemi an instructor in the automobile technical department disclosed to BusinessDay that the project which lasted for about 5years had many people coming from within and outside the college community to fix their vehicles in the workshop.\n\n\u201cPeople were coming from even the University of Lagos and other neighbouring communities to service and repair their vehicles with us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a noble venture that generated many gains both in terms of finance and academics because our students were exposed to competency-based education to complement the theories,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, the academic scholars said that there is also another private-partnership venture available to institutions such as the vendor\u2013partnership scheme ongoing in the college.\n\nAccording to the dean, the college-vendor-partnership scheme is currently being run in the metal department of FCE (T), Akoka, \u201cIt is designed in such a way that individuals can come in as an apprentice and learn the technical skills at a price, or as experts in partnership with the college to use the tools at a price.\n\n\u201cPrivate companies also have a slot to have their machines serviced or repaired in the college workshop by these professionals at a price which the institution shares with its partners according to prior agreements.\n\n\u201cThese arrangements in return yield dividends financially to the institution in form of internally generated revenue.\u201d\n\nExperts believe that to achieve complete education and be fully literate, industry leaders and progressive entrepreneurs need to be partnered as adjunct lecturers in the various Nigerian tertiary institutions to enable them to translate their experiences to transform the students.\n\nAccording to Izu Nwachukwu, a senior lecturer, at the University of Calgary, Canada, \u201cThe 21st-century education is competence-based, where students learn to master their chosen careers through learning by practice system.\n\n\u201cMaking experts adjunct lecturers will be an avenue for them to share their experiences with students thereby preparing them for the lifelong learning.\u201d\n\nEducation, he reiterated should be made to prepare people to live happier, healthier, and more fulfilled in life. And this according to him can only be realised by tailoring the education system to encouraging learners to learn and develop transferable skills.\n\nSimilarly, Emmanuel Nnadozie, the executive secretary of the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) in a paper he delivered at the 2022 Bullion lecture said, \u201cEducation has generally been poorly funded by the federal government in Nigeria over the years, averaging just 6percent since attaining independence in 1960.\n\nMoreover, given the yawning gap between budgetary allocations and release, especially in recent years when all levels of government suffered from significant revenue shortfall and rising debt service, the actual release to education and other sectors has always been lower than budget.\u201d\n\nFunding shortfalls in the tertiary education sector have been the norm for many years as enrolments have increased more quickly than the government\u2019s capacity to maintain corresponding increases in financial support.\n\nAnd because government funding is insufficient, Nigerian tertiary institutions, just like others elsewhere in the world have to seek to supplement their public funding with internally generated incomes or revenues.\n\nThe intellectual quotient system of education is outdated. Nigeria needs as a matter of urgency to switch to competence-based education system to meet up with the global community.\n\nStudents must have the outlet to acquire skills; students must have the outlet to merge theory and practical knowledge. It is a win-win situation for the students and the non-student trainees.\n\nFor instance, if students are sent to the mechanic village and the mechanics on their own learn certain theoretical skills from these students that will help them in better management of the human and material resources they have.\n\nOn the other hand, the students will learn the skill that is required and find more ways to be more innovative, to create the entrepreneurial drive to be the manager of resources.\n\nIt has become imperative for tertiary institution lecturers to know the best teaching and learning process to be adopted so that graduates will perform according to expectations.\n\nExperts believe that this will in a massive way help curb the rising numbers of graduates in the street that are unproductive and are becoming very dangerous to society.\n\nAccording to Anthony Adebayo, metal-tech instructor, \u201cWe all condemn the practice of yahoo boys, but we must note that these are not just uneducated people; most of them are graduates, who lack the skills, hence, they do not have what it takes to live and they find themselves driven into some of these atrocities.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that to tame this ugly development among our young men and women is to teach them how to become responsible and productive citizens. The most important challenge is the quality of education given to young minds.\n\nAnother engineer advocates for the work job learning education system as a solution to the incessant half-baked graduates coming out of Nigeria\u2019s tertiary institutions.\n\n\u201cEverybody is aware that Nigerian engineering graduates are not performing to the expectations of the labour market. Hence, the need to design the most appropriate module to solve this problem from the root causes, which happens to be the teaching and learning process,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed that the country\u2019s tertiary institutions must adopt a teaching approach that will help students of engineering programmes produce goods and services that are expected from engineers. He explained that most times these institutions are not able to expose students to competency-based education because the equipment is not there.\n\nTo overcome such shortcomings, Nnadozie recommends that tertiary institutions among other things must learn to rely less on the government for funding by seeking avenues to boost their internally generated revenues.\n\nRead also: Nigerians rely on unhappy teachers to develop education sector\n\n\u201cInternally generated revenue (IGR) can be a very solid means of financing tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Most tertiary institutions in the country need to set up internally generating revenue units to source for funds to assist the government in financing the institutions. Internally generated revenue unit in higher institution, therefore, is to serve as a relief to government expenditure,\u201d he stated.\n\nResearch has shown that industry and university collaborations (ICUs) have a long tradition in several countries worldwide and universities play a crucial role in achieving economic growth in today\u2019s knowledge-based societies.\n\nAccording to a World Bank report in 2002, the late 20th century witnessed a decrease in public funding for higher education, relative to private funding, in most parts of the world.\n\nFurther findings indicated that in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the proportion of institutional funding received from the state declined; in some jurisdictions, this translated into reduced public funding per student.\n\nMany publicly funded universities responded, first, by cutting costs and, then when it became clear that a return to the status quo ante was not in the cards by seeking out new sources of revenue.\n\nThe ambition of policymakers and universities to develop \u2018third missions\u2019 in addition to the two traditional core missions of research and teaching, and to commercialise academic knowledge, for instance through continuing education programmes, patenting, technology transfer offices, science parks or incubators have intensified the relevance of such collaborations.\n\nIndustry and university collaborations according to scholars have the tendency for companies to profit from highly qualified human resources such as researchers or students, gain access to technology and knowledge, and can boost the use of expensive research infrastructure.\n\nUniversities, in return, benefit from additional funding provided, from access to industrial equipment, or from licensing or patenting income. In fact, collaboration with industry has become an inevitable part of tertiary education funding, and the funds from international organisations and business enterprises for research and development in the higher education sector nowadays represent a \u2018significant source\u2019 in many countries.",

Lasun Yussuf, a former deputy speaker of the house of representatives and governorship candidate of Labour Party in the July 16 election in Osun State, Rt. has raised alarm of threat to life by some political assailants.\n\nYussuf raised the alarm against the backdrop of his campaign office that was vandalized by suspected political hoodlums.\n\nAddressing journalist in his campaign office in Osogbo on Friday, Hon. Yussuf said, happenings in recent times, particularly since he secured the ticket of the Labour Party to contest the July election in Osun State, portend danger to his life.\n\nHe said, \u201cas a politician, I believed this was one of those antics in politics by some politicians, until I started noticing open confrontations being carried too far, which the public, especially security agents, must be aware of.\n\n\u201cI hereby seize this opportunity to intimate the press and public about the ugly incident at our campaign office yesterday and some previous physical attacks on my person and my entourage in the past two weeks. All these ugly attacks on me personally and my campaign office point to the fact that my life and all others involved in my Gubernatorial Campaign in Osun are in SERIOUS DANGER!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cLast week some political thugs abruptly stopped my convoy threatening and warning me of several planned attacks if we refuse to back from our gubernatorial campaign. In fact, to put it straight, I was told POINT BLANK that my life is in danger and that they will continue to trail me to attack me and also disrupt all my campaign activities and events anywhere in Osun State.\n\n\u201cAt exactly 11pm yesterday, some political thugs numbering about eight stormed my campaign office at Oroki Estate, barely 30 minutes after we all left for the day. They came with cutlasses, guns and other weapons and descended on my billboards, signposts and windows of the gate house, destroying everything in sight.\n\n\u201cThe Night Guard in Panic came out to challenge them with all his might. He was however, able to battle them causing them to run away. But this happened after they had destroyed everything outside the campaign office while the Night Guard\u2019s resistance prevented them from gaining entrance to the campaign office\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore I seize this opportunity to intimate the public and the whole world that my political opponents have sponsored some thugs to be after my life and to disturb our gubernatorial campaign. The Security Operatives are hereby put on Red alert in this respect\u201d\n\n\u201cState here unequivocally that nothing can stop our campaign and no threats can stop me from becoming governor of Osun State come July 16 2022. I am peace loving and expect all contestants to be. Thuggery and hooliganism or employing violence to win election will not work this time around! Even using money will not!\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\u2026says \u2018award is a challenge to impact more on humanity\u2019\n\nIn recognition of his achievements and outstanding performance in office, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun, on Friday night, received yet another award, as he was crowned the Vanguard Newspapers\u2019 Governor of The Year 2021 for Good Governance.\n\nHe received the award at a colourful event tagged \u2018Vanguard Personality of the Year 2021 Award\u2019 which held at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos.\n\nRecall that Oyetola had in the recent past won the Business Day Best Governor of the Year award, Blueprint Newspaper Governor of the Year, DAAR Communications Outstanding Leader in Governance, Nigerian NewsDirect 2021 Best Governor of the Year and Man of the Year award, among others.\n\nThe governor described his latest award as a challenge to impact more on humanity just as he dedicated it to the people of Osun for giving him the opportunity to prove that governance can be done better with utmost fear of God and for the sake of humanity.\n\nAccording to the management of the Vanguard Newspapers, the choice of Governor Oyetola for the Good Governance award was basically on empirical facts and indisputable statistics on the geometric transformation that Osun and her people had witnessed under his watch since assumption of office.\n\nIt explained that the philosophy of the award is to recognise and celebrate excellence, national pride and service to humanity.\n\n\u201cSince assumption of office you have delivered the dividends of democracy without loans. It is on record that you have prudently managed available resources while your Administration has kept faith with the people and maintained fidelity with your electoral promises.\n\n\u201cWe also noted the crisis in the education sector and how brilliantly the Governor has resolved it. One other thing we have seen is the character of Mr. Governor: no crisis, no rancour. In fact, we have seen the highest level of decorum in governance.\n\n\u201cGenerally, this nomination for the award of Governor of the Year for Good Governance is actually an encouragement award on how the Governor has raised the pedestal of governance for the people of Osun and beyond,\u201d the award organisers added.\n\nSpeaking shortly after receiving the award, Governor Oyetola thanked the management of the Vanguard Newspaper for recognising the modest achievements his administration had made to transform Osun. He dedicated the award to the people of the State for giving him the opportunity to serve them.\n\nOyetola said: \u201cI am highly elated to accept this award of Governor of the Year for Good Governance by one of the nation\u2019s frontline and integrity-savvy newspapers. This a reward for hardwork and I accept it wholeheartedly.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, good governance in itself answers to unblemished demonstrable service to the people and its factors for service are economic buoyancy, transparent and inclusive governance, equitable service delivery and political will; and all are seemingly mutually inclusive.\n\n\u201cHowever, achieving good governance and winning nomination in a depressed economy in a country where some of the competitors are way richer than us, makes our story somewhat different.\n\n\u201cWe came in when no one gave us a chance. We inherited a financially challenged State and one that could not pay its bills. We were however resolved to make a difference. And the difference we have so far made through prudent management of resources, including plugging waste and cutting costs.\n\n\u201cThrough creative and innovative alternative project funding, we have built and rehabilitated roads that had been abandoned for three decades or more.\n\n\u201cOur service distribution is anchored on quality and equitable service delivery. From infrastructure to health and education, security to welfare, projects and service have been equitably distributed to all the wards in the nine Federal Constituencies and three Senatorial Districts of the State.\n\n\u201cIn these three and a half years that we have been in the saddle, we have proved as a government that good governance and service delivery is possible in a depressed economy; that we can execute projects without borrowing; that we can look inward to pay salaries.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over three and a half years in government building a solid foundation for a sustainable economy. The remaining years shall be spent to build bricks that will deliver a strong and prosperous Osun and a happy and productive people. This is our mission in government. This is the least we owe our people.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, dedicate this award to our people wherever they are, for giving us the opportunity to prove that governance can be done better with utmost fear of God and for the sake of humanity.\n\n\u201cTo the staff and management of Vanguard Newspapers, we thank you for recognising our modest achievements as we continue to keep our eyes on the ball. We appreciate you for giving us this award to encourage us to do more\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of the occasion and former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Obong Victor Attah, lauded the leadership of the newspaper for promoting excellence, hard-work, competence, integrity and character through it daily reportorial and yearly award of excellence.\n\nAttah also charged Oyetola and other awardees to continue to be the source of inspiration and perfect examples for those behind.\n\nOther award recipients are: Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun; Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki; Nasarawa State Governor, Alhaji Abdullahi Sule; Gombe State Governor, Muhammed Inuwa Yahaya, foremost Legal Luminary, Aare Afe Babalola among others.\n\nGovernor Oyetola was accompanied to the event by his wife, Mrs. Kafayat, his children, Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye, Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, Chief of Staff, Dr. Charles Akinola, Finance Commissioner, Bola Oyebamiji, Information Commissioner, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, former member of House of Representatives, Hon. Ayo Omidiran and other friends and well-wishers.",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has paid a condolence visit to the new President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, on the passing of his predecessor, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. During the visit, President Buhari expressed his condolences and that of Nigeria to Sheikh Mohamed and congratulated him on his election as President. He assured the new UAE leader of his determination to do more to ensure the growth of the strategic partnership between Nigeria and the Asian country. President Buhari also hopes that under Sheikh Mohamed the two countries will continue to actively champion a vision of sustainable security, strengthen counterterrorism cooperation, facilitate trade and investment, and promote prosperity and development. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, said in a statement on Saturday that in the seven years of the Buhari administration, the two countries \u201chave actively conducted bilateral dialogues\u201d. These dialogues, according to him, have led to several agreements and Memoranda of Understanding that have paved the way for further cooperation, mutual understanding and progress in many aspects of their bilateral relations. President Buhari had left Nigeria for the UAE on Thursday, six days after the death of Sheikh Khalifa.\n\nSheikh Khalifa, who was rarely seen in public died on Friday, May 13 aged 73 after battling illness for several years.\n\nThe Ministry of Presidential Affairs announced 40 days of mourning, with flags at half-mast from the day of his death and work was suspended in the public and private sector for the first three days.\n\nSheikh Khalifa took over as the UAE\u2019s second president in November 2004, succeeding his father as the 16th ruler of Abu Dhabi, the richest of the federation\u2019s seven emirates.\n\nHe has rarely been seen in public since 2014, when he had surgery following a stroke, although he has continued to issue rulings. The cause of death was not immediately released.\n\nThe UAE, a former British protectorate that was founded in 1971, has gone from a desert outpost to a booming state in its short history, fuelled by its oil wealth and Dubai\u2019s rise as a trading and financial centre.\n\nThe Arab world\u2019s second-biggest economy behind Saudi Arabia has also begun to wield growing political influence, filling a space ceded by traditional powers such as Egypt, Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe country of 10 million also joined military campaigns in Libya and Yemen and broke ranks with much of the Arab world to establish ties with Israel in 2020.\n\nThe bearded Sheikh Khalifa had cut a frail figure on his occasional public appearances, while his Sheikh Mohamed hosted world leaders and led diplomatic forays abroad.\n\nThe late Sheikh Khalifa, who had no formal higher education, led the UAE as Dubai emerged as a tourism and trade hub and Abu Dhabi pumped oil as a key OPEC player.\n\nHe came to the rescue of Dubai when it was hit by the global financial crisis in 2009, extending a multi-billion-dollar lifeline to the debt-laden emirate.",

          "text": "The Kylian Mbappe transfer saga came to a conclusion on Saturday amid confirmation the Paris Saint-Germain forward had snubbed a move to Real Madrid in favour of signing a three-year contract extension at the Ligue 1 club.\n\nESPN reported last year that PSG rejected a series of bids from Madrid for Mbappe, the last of which was up to \u20ac200 million, and the Spanish giants had been confident that they would finally land their long-desired target on a free transfer this summer, with his deal due to expire on June 30.\n\nHowever, a last-ditch effort from PSG to persuade Mbappe to stay proved successful on Saturday, with the forward pledging his future to the Ligue 1 club until 2025.\n\n\u201cI would like to announce that I have chosen to extend my contract at Paris Saint-Germain, and of course I am delighted,\u201d Mbappe said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that here I can continue to grow at a club that provides everything necessary to perform at the highest level. I am also delighted to continue to play in France, the country where I was born, where I have grown up and where I have made my name.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank the President, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, for his trust, his understanding and his patience. I would also like to thank all the fans of Paris Saint-Germain, both in France and around the world, for their support, especially in recent months. Together, side by side and ambitious, we will make magic in Paris.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Saturday, sources told ESPN that Mbappe had personally contacted Madrid president Florentino Perez to inform him of his decision, as well as PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino and his teammates.\n\nSources said that PSG sporting director Leonardo could leave the club as a consequence of the deal, with Mbappe preferring former Monaco and Lille executive Luis Campos as a replacement, and Pochettino\u2019s future was also in doubt.\n\nMbappe joined PSG from AS Monaco in 2017, with the club eventually paying a world-record fee for a teenager of \u20ac180m.\n\nHe has gone on to score a total of 168 goals in five years at the club, making him their second-highest career scorer behind Edinson Cavani.\n\nMbappe has won Ligue 1 four times at PSG and been voted France\u2019s player of the season three times, including this year after his 25 goals and 17 assists helped PSG to the title.\n\nThroughout that time, he has been pursued by Real Madrid, whom he supported as a boy and came close to joining in 2017.\n\nIn August 2021, the LaLiga club saw a series of bids for Mbappe rejected, despite the prospect of him leaving for free at the end of his contract, which had just 12 months remaining.\n\nMadrid remained in contact with Mbappe\u2019s representatives during this season and believed that the player had given them his word that he would join this summer.\n\nAt the same time, PSG never gave up on persuading him to stay, and with the end of the season fast approaching this week, there was uncertainty at both clubs over Mbappe\u2019s final decision.\n\nOn Friday, ESPN reported that there was \u201cpessimism\u201d at Madrid over their chances of completing a deal, as well as \u201cnervousness and confusion\u201d at the player\u2019s public behaviour and lack of communication.\n\nMadrid\u2019s transfer strategy has been built around their pursuit of Mbappe in recent years, and they will now plan for life without him. Meanwhile, PSG look to build a team around the forward to end their wait for a first Champions League trophy.\n\n\u201cKylian\u2019s commitment to PSG represents an amazing milestone in the history of our Club, and a wonderful moment for our fans around the world,\u201d club president Al-Khelaifi said.\n\n\u201cSince the day Kylian joined our family, he has achieved greatness beyond his years on every single stage. In committing to PSG, he will be the foundation of our Club\u2019s future both on and off the field.\n\n\u201cI am incredibly proud and very happy \u2014 for Kylian, for our fans, and our entire PSG family worldwide \u2014 that we will continue our wonderful journey together. For our fans and our Club, the greatest chapters of our future lie ahead.\u201d",

          "text": "Russia stopped delivering gas to Finland in an escalation of a dispute over energy payments with Western nations, and claimed victory in a weeks-long battle for Mariupol\u2019s devastated Azovstal steel plant as it presses for control of the Donbas.\n\nRussia also launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize the last remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Luhansk, one of two provinces that make up the southeastern Donbas region: where Russian-backed separatists already controlled swathes of territory before the Feb. 24 invasion.\n\nThe last Ukrainian forces holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered on Friday, Russia\u2019s defense ministry said, ending the bloodiest siege of the war.\n\nThe ministry said in a statement that 2,439 defenders had surrendered in the past few days, including 531 in the final group.\n\nEarlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine\u2019s military had told the last defenders at the steelworks they could get out and save their lives. The Ukrainians did not immediately confirm the figures on Azovstal.\n\nUkraine\u2019s General Staff of Armed Forces did not comment on Russia\u2019s claim in its morning update on Saturday.\n\nThe end of fighting in Mariupol, the biggest city Russia has captured so far, gives Russian President Vladimir Putin a rare victory in the invasion after a series of setbacks in nearly three months of combat.\n\nZelenskiy told local television that while the fighting would be bloody and victory difficult, the end would only come through diplomacy.\n\n\u201cFor them, all these victories \u2013 the occupation of Crimea or Donbas \u2013 is very temporary. And all this will return \u2013 since this is our territory,\u201d he said on Saturday.\n\nFull control of Mariupol will give Russia command of an overland route linking the Crimea peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014, with mainland Russia and areas of eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia separatists.\n\nThe Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of Ukrainians who surrendered at the Mariupol steel plant as prisoners of war and Kyiv says it wants a prisoner swap. Moscow says the prisoners will be treated humanely, but Russian politicians have been quoted as saying some must be tried or even executed.\n\nGAS DISPUTE\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland on Saturday after it refused to agree to Russian demands to pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of Western sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. read more\n\nThe move comes days after Finland and Sweden decided to apply to join the NATO military alliance, a decision spurred by the Ukraine war.\n\nFinnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows and that the country will manage without.\n\nMost European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars and Moscow cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland last month after they refused to comply with the new payment terms.\n\nIn addition to trying to isolate Russia through sanctions, Western nations have stepped up weapons supplies to Ukraine since the invasion. Kyiv got another huge boost on Saturday when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill to provide nearly $40 billion in military, economic and humanitarian aid to the country.\n\nMoscow says Western arms deliveries for Kyiv, and the imposition of drastic sanctions amount to a \u201cproxy war\u201d by the United States and its allies.\n\nThe Russian military said on Saturday it had destroyed a major consignment of Western arms in Ukraine\u2019s Zhytomyr region, west of Kyiv, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the report, which also said Russian missiles had struck fuel storage facilities near Odesa on the Black Sea coast and shot down two Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft and 14 drones.\n\nPutin says Russian troops are engaged in a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to demilitarise Ukraine and rid it of radical anti-Russian nationalists. Western countries call it an unprovoked war of aggression.\n\nThousands of people in Ukraine have been killed and urban areas have been shattered in the war. Almost a third of Ukraine\u2019s people have fled their homes, including more than 6 million who have left the country.\n\nOFFENSIVE IN LUHANSK\n\nRussia, which announced in late March it was focusing its military efforts on taking control of Donbas, launched what appeared to be a major assault to seize remaining Ukrainian-held territory in Luhansk.\n\nLuhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said in a social media post early on Saturday that Russia was trying to destroy the city of Sievierodonetsk, with fighting taking place on the outskirts of the city.\n\n\u201cShelling continues from morning to the evening and also throughout the night,\u201d Gaidai said in a video post on the Telegram messaging app.\n\nDespite losing ground elsewhere in recent weeks, Russian forces have advanced on the Luhansk front.\n\nThe city of Sievierodonetsk and its twin Lysychansk across the Siverskiy Donets River form the eastern part of a Ukrainian-held pocket that Russia has been trying to overrun since mid-April after failing to capture Kyiv.",
