It is part of being used and I didn\u2019t like that. Most of us are reformers and one of the ways to reform the system is to make it more accountable and to make the people have a voice in who represents them as opposed to a few people sitting in the four corners of a wall and writing results.\n\n\u201cThere is a process; when we come back from recess, as I said, the House will look at those amendments.

It is the decision of the National Assembly; if they determine that the reasons are not good enough, then, there is a process prescribed by the constitution.\u201d\n\nThe projects unveiled by the Speaker included the Obele mini stadium, Dosunmu Road, Adedoyin Road, Ojikutu, Ishola Road by Randle, Rasaq Balogun mini stadium and the Razaq Balogun Road and Adeniran Ogunsanya Street, all in Surulere.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress has said the administration of Governor Seyi Makinde has performed abysmally low in terms of provision of adequate security and infrastructural development in Oyo State.\n\nThe opposition party, in a statement on Thursday by its Caretaker Publicity Secretary, AbdulAzeez Olatunde, said Makinde had performed far below expectation despite spending 31 months in the saddle as the governor of the state.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe government of Seyi Makinde claimed to have procured fire fighting vehicles from Turkey for about one year without functioning.\n\n\u201cThe Ajumose buses in the state are due for replacement; Governor Seyi Makinde claimed to have procured some, which are only seen when his party, the PDP, has assignments outside Oyo State.\n\n\u201cThe past government provided solar powered street lights, while GSM chose the \u2018incorruptible\u2019 way of replacing them with diesel powered street lights.\n\n\u201cIf there is one sector the people of Oyo State are anxiously praying for the fast-tracking of the terminal date of this government, it is security. Governor Makinde chose to celebrate his birthday in Saki, Oke Ogun, what followed was mayhem \u2013 maiming and killings.\n\n\u201cCan the people of Oyo State forget the wanton overnight destruction of Igangan town in the Ibarapa area of Oyo State on the dawn of June 6, 2021? Governor Seyi Makinde assured Igangan residents that such an attack would never happen again, but it recurred within 10 days on June 16, 2021, as if daring Makinde\u2019s lack of resourcefulness.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Oyo Kajola Group, in a statement by its Media Coordinator, Adebayo Ayandele, described the statement by the APC as \u201cfarcical, unfounded and untrue.\u201d\n\nThe group said the APC in the state had demonstrated by the statement that it could not be cured of its post-2019 election loss syndrome.\n\nThe group said, \u201cThe APC has been aimlessly striving to feed the public with lies, while presenting itself as a party of blind and bad losers, who do not want anything good for Oyo State.\n\n\u201cThe 31 months of Governor Makinde\u2019s governance in Oyo State have exposed the underbelly of the corrupt and nefarious government run by the APC in eight years, as a sector by sector analysis of the achievements of the Makinde government placed side-by-side with the APC government will show how wicked and ungodly the latter was.\n\n\u201cIn just 31 months, it is on record that the Makinde government started and completed the 65-kilometre Moniya-Ijaiye-Iseyin Road, which was inaugurated in June. Several APC leaders, including Prof Adeolu Akande, the NCC Chairman; Hon Shina Peller, House of Representatives member; and Mr Wasiu Dauda, a former Commissioner for Works, regularly ply that road.\n\n\u201cWe dare the APC to show the world any evidence to prove that the Makinde administration was not the one that reconstructed that major road. They should also tell the world any inter-town road started or completed by the Ajimobi government in eight years.\n\n\u201cIn just 12 months, the 9.7-kilometre Saki township road abandoned by the APC government since 2016 has been completed by the Makinde government, with an extension of over one kilometre already approved by the government.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nLassa Fever\n\nThe death toll for Lassa Fever in Nigeria from January 2021 has jumped to 92, with Bauchi and Ebonyi States recording new deaths.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) disclosed this on Tuesday in its latest situation report on the outbreak of the disease in the country.\n\nAccording to the NCDC, week 50, which covered December 13 to 19, revealed that three more deaths were reported in the week under review.\n\nWhile Bauchi reported two new fatalities, Ebonyi recorded one new death from the disease.\n\n\u201cCumulatively from Week 1 to Week 50, 2021, 92 deaths have been reported with a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 20.3 per cent, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2020 (20.7 per cent),\u201d it stated.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Lassa fever is an acute viral illness and a viral haemorrhagic fever first reported in the Lassa community in Borno when two missionary nurses died from an unusual febrile illness.\n\nSince then, Nigeria has continued to report cases and outbreaks and the disease is increasingly recognised to be endemic in many parts of West Africa such as Benin Republic, Ghana, Mali and the Mano River region (Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea).\n\nThe agency noted that a total of 190 new cases were suspected in 11 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), but just 10 cases were confirmed in four states.\n\nAmongst others were; Edo \u2013 two, Ondo \u2013 four, Bauchi \u2013 three, and Ebonyi \u2013 one, and two of them are healthcare workers.\n\nThe number of new confirmed cases, the agency stated, is the same as the figure reported in the previous week.\n\n\u201cIn total for 2021, 17 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 66 Local Government Areas,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cOf all confirmed cases, Edo has (43 per cent), Ondo (35 per cent), and Taraba (five per cent).\n\n\u201cThe predominant age group affected is between 21 and 30 years (range: 1 to 70 years, Median Age: 29 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.9. The number of suspected cases has decreased compared to that reported for the same period in 2020,\u201d it added.\n\nNAN recalls that Lassa virus is transmitted to man by infected multi-mammate rats and humans become infected from direct contact with the urine and faeces of the rat carrying the virus.\n\nPeople also contract the disease by touching soiled objects, eating contaminated food, or exposure to open cuts or sores.\n\nSecondary transmission from person to person can also occur as a result of exposure to the virus in the blood, tissue, urine, faeces or other bodily secretions of an infected patient.",

It is part of being used and I didn\u2019t like that.\n\n\u201cMost of us are reformers and one of the ways to reform the system is to make more accountable and to make the people have a voice in who represents them as opposed to a few people sitting in the four corners of a wall and writing results.\n\n\u201cThat is what the amendment was all about. Again, there is a process.\n\n\u201cThe president has, in his wisdom, rejected it and I believe he did it with good intentions based on the advice that he got. He weighed everything. Again, maybe times are different. He has people who advised him and I guess they advised him against the amendment bill.\n\n\u201cThere is a process. When we come back, as I said, the House will look at those amendments. We will sit as the National Assembly, look at the reasons and at that point, consider removing that clause and pass the bill so that we do not do away with the baby and the bath water.\n\n\u201cBut then, it is not my decision to make. It is the decision of the National Assembly, if they determine that the reasons are not good enough, then, there is a process prescribed by the constitution.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the National Assembly may veto the bill, he said: \u201cWhich way the sword is going to fall, I have no idea until that time. I cannot read the minds of the whole National Assembly members.\n\n\u201cThey need 2/3 of the member to override the president, there is a reason the constitution prescribes 2/3, veto is not something you easily override.\n\n\u201cIf they muster enough and they believe it is in the best interest of Nigerians, then, that is what we will do; otherwise, we will take out the clause and pass the bill so that Nigerians can have a credible electoral act and due process. They must get it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll continue to do more for my constituency\n\nSpeaking the projects and the impact it will have on his constituents, the Speaker said: \u201cMy job as a legislator is to represent those who voted me in and those that did not and that is what I have been striving to do for years even before I became Speaker. We thank God for what we have been able to do, we made promises and we delivered. To me, this is what I call the real dividend of democracy. It tells you the difference it will make to the youths. When I was campaigning, I told the people what I was going to do. I saw the state of the roads and stadium and when I came in, that is what I did. We will continue to do more because it is never enough.\u201d",

          "text": "Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has said the Southeast deserves to produce President Muhammdu Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023.\n\nHe, however, noted that Igbo Presidency in 2023 cannot be a matter of right, but a product of negotiations and conversations\n\nIkpeazu stated this while briefing reporters after a meeting with President Buhari in Abuja yesterday.\n\nThe governor argued that since the Igbo of the Southeast, more than any other ethnic group, have a better understanding of all parts of Nigeria, they should have a shot at the Presidency.\n\nHe. jokingly told the reporters not to be surprised that the Igbo see business opportunities in the dreaded Sambisa Forest in Borno State.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIkpeazu, however, said he is not considering joining the presidential race yet as he is more concerned with delivering his electioneering promises to the people of Abia State.\n\nHe added that he would only start thinking of his post-governorship career after May 29, 2023.\n\nHis words: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in the Presidency. I\u2019m very busy as governor and thinking about what I will become now will amount to shortchanging my people who gave me a mandate for an initial four years and renewed it for another four years and it will terminate around May 2023.\n\n\u201dWe are yet in 2021 and it will be self-serving for me to begin to think about what I will become instead of concentrating on serving my people for the time they elected me. Maybe after May 2023, I\u2019ll begin to think about what next to do.\n\nRead Also; INEC to spend N305b on 2023 polls\n\n\u201dHaving said that, I think that the Southeast people have a right to take a shot at the Presidency of Nigeria and I dare say that our qualification starts from the fact that we understand and know Nigeria better than people from the other zones of Nigeria.\n\n\u201dI dare say, this is my opinion. We go everywhere; we are everywhere; we invest everywhere and we are pan-Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cToday, a lot of people, on a lighter note are afraid of Sambisa. But for an Igbo man, Sambisa is a business opportunity. So, it will be preposterous of me not to add my voice to that one.\n\n\u201dHowever, the question of Nigeria President of Southeast extraction is a national question that requires negotiation, discussion, and conversation with all parts of this country and I am least qualified to determine what happened in 2023.\n\n\u201dI also want to spend my time supporting the incumbent President to do his time and do his best while we wait for what happens to begin to unfold. So, these are my views about the Presidency.\u201d\n\nOn the role of political parties in the emergence of a desired Nigerian President, Ikpeazu said: \u201cPolitical parties need to be sensitive to the feelings of the various contending forces because politics should not be a winner-takes-all thing.\n\n\u201d Political parties should be alive to the sentiments and feelings of their members in taking decisions and going forward. We are at a critical point in our history and anything that is self-serving, anything that is selfish, anything that leads to winner takes all mentality should be jettisoned at this time.\n\n\u201cWe need to rescue our nation, we need to work hard to put Nigeria in a strong footing before we can begin to look at other things.\n\n\u201cAs I said earlier, these can not be done in isolation. It\u2019s not a matter right, it\u2019s not a matter of \u2018I have to\u2019, it\u2019s a matter of negotiation, conversation, and discussions and I think Nigeria is alive to all of these. We can find people who listen.\u201d\n\nThe governor also spoke on the qualities that the 2023 presidential candidates must have and how the political parties may choose them.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first place, anybody who wants to aspire to the highest post of the Presidency, it doesn\u2019t matter where you come from, must have what I regard as pan-Nigerian mentality.\n\n\u201cHe must be somebody who has an understanding of all the contending interests and influences in this country. He must understand that we are a country of diversity with different persuasions, traditions, cultures, religions. All of these must be put in a place where you can understand and respect them. \u201c\n\n\u201cThat individual must also be somebody who is ready to accommodate the youth. We are drifting into an age that what youths understand may not be understood by those who grew up before this era.\n\n\u201cThe next President must also reflect an extreme women agenda. Such a person must also be in investor-friendly; he must be an individual who understands the nuances of economics and what is the relationship between international politics and the economy. The person must be strong enough to face up to the issue on the front burner, which is security.\n\n\u201cHe must be able to create jobs, he must be able to not deploy the kinetic device all the time; he must able to also listen and negotiate peace. \u201d",

          "text": "Those seeking information on the forensic audit report submitted on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) got an answer from President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday.\n\nThe President assured Nigerians that every kobo stolen from the agency would be recovered and everyone indicted in the audit report would be prosecuted.\n\nBuhari gave the assurance yesterday during the virtual commissioning of the NDDC Prototype Hostel at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThere have been calls from relevant Niger Delta stakeholders for the release of the audit report and the inauguration of the Commission\u2019s governing board by the President.\n\nThe President said the report of the forensic audit was being reviewed for the purpose recovering stolen funds and recommending culprits for punishment.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBuhari, however, expressed regrets that the special development fund of the entire region was squandered by a few for more than 20 years, leaving many in penury, noting that had the funding made available over the years been judiciously and transparently used, the lives of the people of the oil-rich region would have been far better.\n\nHe said the Commission should prove to both government and the people of the Niger Delta that it could achieve the set objectives and mandates for which it was conceptualised and created, even as he directed all statutory contributors to its funding to meet their obligations by remitting all outstanding funds, transparently, to the interventionist agency.\n\nRead Also; Buhari urges accelerated action in mining sector\n\nThe President said: \u201cThe Niger Delta Development Commission needs to demonstrate that it can achieve the objectives it was conceived for and make its impact felt all over the Niger Delta Region.\n\n\u201cThe lives of the people of the Niger Delta could be so much better, if the funding received by this commission since its inception, in billions of naira over the last 20 years, have been judiciously deployed in service of the people.\n\n\u201cThe serial abuse, lack of delivery and what had become an entrenched institutional decay, was the reason I called for the forensic audit.\n\n\u201cTherefore, going forward we shall ensure every recoverable kobo, is recovered for use in service of the people of this region and those found culpable shall face the law.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I want to use the opportunity of this commissioning to direct all statutory contributors to the NDDC to remit all outstanding funds to the Commission, and to ensure this is done transparently and according to laid down procedure and process.\u201d\n\nThe President directed that all abandoned projects that directly impact the livelihood of the people should be revived and completed.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I directed the minister of Niger Delta Affairs to institute a forensic audit of the Commission, after many representations by major stakeholders in the Niger Delta, I had also directed that all viable projects which had been abandoned, but which would impact positively on the lives and livelihoods of the people, be immediately revived and completed.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that the contract for the building of 1,050 capacity hostel for male and female students was awarded in 2004, and like many others, it was abandoned.\n\n\u201cThis prototype university hostel consists of 1,050 bed spaces, 525 each for males and females, and is furnished to meet the needs of a university student. The complex also boasts of significant hard and soft infrastructure to ensure its sustainability and durability.\n\n\u201cThe completion of this structure is equally in recognition of the importance government attaches to providing quality housing and improved education for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore another important proof that this administration is committed to satisfying the needs of the people, throughout Nigeria, and fulfilling their expectations.\n\n\u201cGovernment must continue in its efforts to serve the people, by providing amenities, as well as the enabling environment for scholarships, investments across all sectors, for sustenance of the environment, and overall growth of the economy.\n\n\u201cSignificant part of this success story is that it could easily not have happened. The contract for this hostel was awarded as far back as 2004. It was one of many projects abandoned across the Niger Delta region, but which I directed the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, to expeditiously complete and put to use,\u2019\u2019 the President added.\n\nPresident Buhari said that in many public universities and institutions of higher learning, children face accommodation challenges, while private investors were taking advantage of the gap to provide accommodation, unfortunately tasking the resources of parents and guardians.\n\n\u201cMany of them are located far away from school premises and come with their own peculiar challenges. It is good that such an infrastructure gap is being addressed, by providing accommodation for students that would be affordable, well built, and in a secure environment.\u201d he said.\n\nThe President noted his deputy Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, had on his behalf, inaugurated the Special Protections Unit Base 6 Barracks in Omagwa, Rivers State, which was built and donated by the NDDC to the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nThe President said: \u201cFirstly, and as stated at that occasion, the complex is part of a crucial component of the major reform we are undertaking with the Nigerian Police Force.\n\n\u201cWhile we are working to increase the number of police personnel, within set yearly targets, and re-equip personnel, both in personal gear and hardware, accommodation remains an important feature of that reform. Indeed, it showed that we can alleviate the accommodation challenges of senior security personnel in order to enhance security in the region.\n\n\u201cSecondly, this singular intervention demonstrates that NDDC understands the importance of government\u2019s effort at improving the lives and livelihoods of our police officers, in line with my directive that building of barracks for men and women of the police force should be done in collaboration with the Special Housing effort of the Family Home funds.\u2019\u2019\n\nAkpabio said the completion of the NDDC headquarters complex and other projects clearly showed the President\u2019s commitment to improving the livelihood of people in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buhari is focused on development of Nigeria and the Niger Delta. The President wants to ensure that by the time he leaves office, the NDDC is repositioned to live up to the expectations of the founding fathers.\u201d\n\nNDDC Sole Administrator Effiong Akwa thanked the President for always honouring the institution by commissioning three projects in a year.\n\n\u201cThe three projects have one thing in common, they were all abandoned before the forensic audit,\u201d he added.\n\nChairman of the House of Representatives Committee on NDDC Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo renewed the agency\u2019s commission\u2019s commitment to delivering more people-poriented projects in the NDDC mandate areas.\n\nTunji-Ojo, representing Akoko Northeast/Northwest Federal Constituency described the project as a renewal of government\u2019s resolve to bring development to the communities in the oil-rich region.\n\nAccording to him, the hostels were built to making the varsity community friendlier for academic pursuit.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can assure you that with our continual synergy and cooperation, we will continue to collectively birth more developmental projects in the mandate areas.\u201d",

          "title": "Soldiers arrest 567 criminals in South-South in 2021 \u2015 DHQ",
          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ), in Abuja Thursday said that soldiers on internal security operations in the Niger Delta region of the country have recorded tremendous successes with the arrest of 567 suspected criminals in the outgoing year 2021.\n\nThe soldiers under the auspices of Joint Task Force South-South Operation Delta Safe (OPDS), demobilized 1,423 illegal oil refining sites, 4,929 storage facilities and 536 large wooden boats, popularly called \u2018Cotonou boats, 13 ships laden with crude oil cargo, 9 barges and arrested 137 trucks and other types of vehicles conveying illegally refined products.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Major General Benard Onyeuko, made this known in as statement issued in Abuja on the achievements of the joint task operations between January and December, 2021.\n\nOnyeuko, while noting that the Joint Task Force conducted both kinetic and non-kinetic operations within its large area of jurisdiction spanning the entire Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Edo, Anambra, Imo, Abia, Akwa Ibom Cross River States, that the terrain of the Joint Operation Area was swampy, water-logged and crisscrossed by a network of rivers and creeks. He said that due to the nature of the terrain in the region and the need to reduce fatigue on troops, most of the operations were intelligence-driven.\n\nTo effectively tackle the security challenges in the area, Onyeuko, said the OPDS was made into a multi-agency organisation comprising elements drawn from 12 different security agencies which are NA, NN, NAF, DIA, NPF, DSS, NSCDC, NCS, NIS, NCoS, NDLEA and EFCC.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe JTF leverages capabilities as well as information generated and shared by the aforementioned agencies in conducting operations aimed at attaining the JF\u2019s mandate. OPDS has conducted a wide range of operational activities within the period under review and has achieved successes.\u201d\n\nHe listed some of its activities to include protection of Oil and Gas Facilities, Anti-Crude Oil Theft Operations and Clearance of Militants\u2019/Pirates\u2019 Camps as well as non-kinetic conflicts resolution.\n\nGiving an update on the activities of OPDS in the last one year, Gen Onyeuko said\u201dThe OPDS has made tremendous efforts to actualise its mandate within the period under review. The JF has conducted several operations to ensure safe and peaceful operation of the O&G Industry as well as security of people in the area. Some of these activities include protection of Oil and Gas Facilities, Anti-Crude Oil Theft Operations and Clearance of Militants\u2019/Pirates\u2019 Camps as well as non-kinetic conflicts resolution. These achievements will be discussed further.\n\n5. Protection of Oil and Gas Facilities. The JF conducts static deployments, escort duties and patrols around major oil and gas facilities within the JOA. These deployments and patrols have drastically reduced third party infractions on such facilities. As part of efforts to sustain the drive towards protecting oil facilities, the JTF SS OPDS partners with key oil industry players to save the crude oil pipelines from activities of criminals. The partnership has so far yielded successes in the areas of curbing pipeline vandalism. It is therefore, desirable that operational capability of the Force be continuously enhanced so as to sustain a stable security environment in the Niger Delta in general and the oil and gas infrastructure in particular.\n\n6. Anti-Crude Oil Theft Operations. The anti-Crude Oil Theft (COT) efforts of the JF during the period in consideration has led to the demobilization of about 1,423 illegal oil refining sites (each of which contains many camps), over 4,929 storage facilities and 536 large wooden boats, popularly called \u2018Cotonou boats\u2019 among others. Also, 13 ships laden with crude oil cargo, 9 barges, 137 trucks and other types of vehicles conveying illegally refined products were arrested. Additionally, about 40 million litres of crude oil and 67 million litres of illegally refined products mostly AGO were recovered from the criminals. In the process of conducting these operations, 567 suspects were arrested in connection with various crimes. The suspects and exhibits have all been handed over to the appropriate prosecuting agencies for prosecution. While some of the arrested suspects have been convicted, others are still undergoing trials in various courts of law. Nonetheless, the JTF will sustain its anti-COT efforts until the crime is totally eliminated or reduced to the barest minimum.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

The objectives of the operations were to get rid of militants and pirates/sea robbers taking refuge in the JOA. In all, about 51 such camps were completely destroyed while 153 assorted weapons as well as large number of various calibre of ammunitions were recovered from the criminals. While the NN is tackling the piracy issues at the high seas, the JTF is appropriately handling the backwaters. At present, due to the sustained clearance operations on sea robbers/pirates and other criminals\u2019 camps within the JOA, the number of sea robbery and pirate attacks in Nigerian waters as well as the Gulf of Guinea respectively, have drastically reduced. For instance, in 2021, there were 28 reported cases of pirate attacks in the Gulf of Guinea which forms part of Nigeria\u2019s waters while within the same period, only 4 attacks were recorded in Nigerian Waters. Nonetheless, the JTF SS OPDS would maintain the tempo of clearance operations on pirate camps in order to sustain the current gains.\n\nNON-KINETIC CONFLICTS CONTAINMENT AND RESOLUTION EFFORTS OF THE JOINT FORCE\n\n8. In support of the protection of O&G infrastructure in the JOA, the JTF SS OPDS has continued to effectively utilize the non-kinetic conflicts containment and resolution mechanism. These include using the appropriate legal and judicial instruments, Civil Military Cooperation CIMIC mediations efforts to resolve mostly Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) related disputes between host communities and O&G companies as well as involving media campaigns by way of radio jingles to sensitize members of the public on the ills of illegal oil bunkering and refining activities.\n\n9. Adherence to Legal and Judicial Processes. One of the most effective non-kinetic approach to conflict containment and resolution effort is the observance of human rights and resolution of conflicts through the judicial processes. It is important to note that the JF has always adhered to court summons, injunctions and other judicial processes in the resolution of conflicts. The OPDS Legal Unit has successfully defended various cases in court during the period under review while others were amicably resolved out of court. This approach has tremendously contributed to the peace that is being observed generally in the region today. We hope to reinforce and sustain this effort having realised its effectiveness.\n\n10. CIMIC Mediation Efforts. Within the year 2021, the JTF SS OPDS has amicably resolved about 54 Corporate Social Responsibility-related heated disputes involving oil companies such as; SEEPCO, SPDC, AITEO, NECONDE and NAOC among others, with their host communities. The employment of non-kinetic instruments has contributed immensely to averting breaches against Oil and Gas infrastructure by host communities which has thus, significantly contributed to providing a conducive environment for O&G businesses to thrive. Similarly, due to the level of trust and confidence that both the O&G companies and the host communities have reposed on the OPDS, the JF has minimal cases of human rights abuses which could mostly arise from confrontations with troops by aggrieved parties.\n\nAPPRECIATION FOR SUPPORT OF THE JTF ACTIVITIES\n\n11. While counting the JTF remarkable achievements in 2021, I will not forget to acknowledge the tremendous support and encouragements always received from the CDS, Gen LEO Irabor, the service chiefs as well as other heads of security agencies that contribute personnel for the operations of the JTF. We sincerely thank them all. I wish to also thank every stake holder, the general public as well as members of the press, for being there for us as we try to protect the interest of our dear country Nigeria. Similarly, may I appreciate the efforts of the gallant troops as well as all other security operatives who have continuously shown commitments in their assigned responsibilities towards our journey to nation building. I urge them to redouble their efforts in order to enter the new year 2022 with high morale, zeal and renewed vigour to accomplish the tasks before us.\n\n12. For avoidance of any doubt, I hereby warn all those perpetrating illegalities by way of crude oil theft, illegal oil refining and pipeline vandalism within our JOA and their collaborators, to have a rethink over their actions which constitute economic set back for our country and health hazards to all of us. The OPDS has emplaced measures in conjunction with other relevant stakeholders and agencies to deal with such criminals more decisively than ever. In this regard, all commanders under the JTF SS OPDS have already been directed to go after and effect arrests on all persons involved in the aforementioned crimes. Accordingly, members of the public are please enjoined to patriotically oblige the JTF information on such bad eggs. Meanwhile, all law abiding persons are encouraged to go about their lawful businesses with assurances of protection from the JTF.",

Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe job is difficult but it can be done and I believe that with you all working together, we can get there. We should and we just have to and I believe we should do that.\u201d\n\nIn his address, the minister of Defence Major General Bashir Magashi, while congratulating the officers, urged them to develop solutions that would end the insecurity in the country and make it safe for citizens to go about their legitimate duties without fear of being attacked.\n\nIn a related development, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshall Oladayo Amao, has charged newly Air Vice Marshals and Air Commodores in the Nigerian Air Force not to relent in their service to our fatherland. He said all hands should be on deck towards \u201cenhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for joint force employment in pursuit of national security imperatives.\n\nAmao, while reminding the officer of the huge tasks ahead of them, said \u201cI urge you to see your promotion as the beginning of another phase of your career in the Service, which of course, comes with greater responsibilities. I am particularly elated because this ceremony is indicative that the Nigerian Air Force now has more strategic and analytical minds in our pool of manpower resource to bring to bear their knowledge and experience on how to tackle the security challenges facing the Nation.\n\n\u201cTo those who have not benefitted from this promotion exercise, I enjoin you not to relent in your service to our fatherland. Promotion is said to come from God; albeit hard work, excellence and professionalism are factors that determine which direction the pendulum swings. Please note that your hard work and services are appreciated. However, due to a number of factors, including vacancies, not all eligible personnel could be promoted during the exercise. I therefore urge you to continue to put in your best and be selfless in your service for the greater good of the Nigerian Air Force and the Nation as a whole. I am confident that if you continue to do this, in due time, your efforts will be rewarded.\n\n\u201cAs I congratulate the newly-promoted officers on your well-deserved promotion, I charge you to put all hands on deck in our quest towards \u201cenhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for joint force employment in pursuit of national security imperatives\u201d. We cannot afford to fall short of the expectations of the good people of Nigeria. I therefore encourage you all to be guided by the words of a former United States Defence Secretary, Gen James Mattis, who said \u201cI don\u2019t lose any sleep at night over the potential for failure. I cannot even spell the word\u201d.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, as you embark on this new phase of your careers, please note that a much higher level of dedication to duty is required of you. You will also be required to continue to display exceptional integrity, selfless service and commitment to excellence, which would ensure that the Nigerian Air Force records outstanding results in every area of competence and translate to successes in the various theatres of operation with resultant improved security for our people across the country. You must equally remember that the Nation and the Service have been magnanimous to you. Accordingly, it is expected that you would do your utmost to reciprocate the confidence reposed in you\u201d.",

          "text": "By Onuminya Innocent In Sokoto\n\nThe Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Rev Father Matthew Hassan Kukah, has said he is not against the government of President Muhammadu Buhari but speaks against the way the president is handling the deplorable security situation and economic woes in the country.\n\nHe said this while fielding questions from newsmen at St Barkitha Catholic Secretariat Sokoto.\n\n\u201cOurs has become a house of horror with fear stalking our homes, highways, cities, hamlets and communities as bandits and insurgents maim lives at will,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe cleric also accused the president of lopsided appointments stressing that such has caused divisions and agitations in the country.\n\nHe maintained that he was not bothered about which region or religion produces the president, saying he is only interested in good governance .\n\nHe noted that he had a cordial relationship with President Buhari, maintained that it was sycophants that were trying to sow seed of discord between him and the administration.\n\n\u201cIf I pick my phone and call Mr. President now he will pick. The other time he missed my calls he called me back and we greeted. But you know some people cry more than the bereaved\u201d, he stated.\n\nNoting that he will be clocking 70 years next year, he said if he could not be cowed when he was young, would he now be afraid of speaking the truth.\n\n\u201cIn a developed country, when you speak the truth you will be celebrated. Look at how people are celebrating late Arch Bishop Desmond Tutu, but here people tag you as an enemy of government\u201d.\n\nHe agreed with the President for refusing to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. He said Buhari was right, noting that the issue of direct and indirect primaries should be left for political parties to decide.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if Manchester United are playing against Arsenal it is less for them to choose who makes up their team. What they are interested in is winning, you can\u2019t tell them the mode of selection\u201d, he said.\n\nHe advised the National Assembly to espounge that section of direct or indirect primaries for the president give assent to the bill.\n\nWhen asked how he intends to lift 50,000 Nigerians out of poverty, the cleric explained that he had mapped out empowerment program that will soon commence.\n\n\u201cI intended to buy tricycles to give to the transporters who cannot afford it, when l give you I will tell you to pay back the money so that we will give another person.

          "title": "Ibrahim Datti Ahmed (1936 to 2021)",
          "text": "By Olusegun Adeniyi\n\nI experienced a sincere sense of loss early this morning when I received a terse message from my friend, Mohammed Jamu. \u2018You lost your friend last night. He will be buried today at 10am\u2019, he wrote. The message was accompanied by photographs I took with the late Dr Ibrahim Datti Ahmed at his residence almost a decade ago. Although I had resolved not to write this week (Christmas in Kwara State is a season of indulgence for me), I feel compelled to pay tribute to the deceased Supreme Council for Shariah in Nigeria (SCSN) president. Incidentally, my last personal encounter with him was on 20th May 2012. I recall that as he escorted me to the car to bid me bye after a very enlightening session, he turned to my friend and asked, \u201cPlease what is the name again?\u201d\n\n\u201cMohammed Yusuf\u201d came the reply from Jamu who deliberately omitted his middle name by which most of us know him. \u201cAh, you share the same name with the late Boko Haram founder\u201d, said late Ahmed. While it was amid laughter that we left his austere Kano home, the convivial mood belied our serious discussion on the security challenge facing our nation and how his patriotic efforts at mediation had been mismanaged by the relevant authorities.\n\nMy relationship with Datti Ahmed dates to early 1991 when I was a fresh reporter with The Guardian newspaper. At that period, he was contesting the presidency on the platform of the defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP). I was introduced by his late friend and Second Republic Kwara State Deputy Governor, Alhaji Abatemi Usman. Datti Ahmed had also by then become close to my guardian, Chief Cornelius Adebayo (former Kwara State Governor with whom I was living) and he (Ahmed) took an immediate liking to me and a genuine interest in my career.\n\nBorn in 1936 in Daigari, Kano, Datti Ahmed attended Barewa College before reading medicine at the University of Ibadan. He began his working career as a House/Medical Officer in the Northern Nigerian Civil Service. At age 30 in 1966, he resigned to go into private medical practice with the establishment of Kano Clinics. And he has at various times served in public capacities. For instance, between 1976 and 1979, he was the pro chancellor and chairman of the governing council of the then University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife).\n\nA simple man who lived a complicated political life, Datti Ahmed was a disciple of the late Aminu Kano. However, during the Second Republic, he led the Concerned Citizens Committee, a group of prominent Northern politicians and professionals who threw their support behind the presidential aspiration of the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo during the 1983 general election. When he was contesting the presidency in the ill-fated Fourth Republic, Datti Ahmed shocked many northerners when he publicly criticized Nigeria\u2019s membership of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) which had by then generated controversy. He said if elected, he would reexamine its relevance to the nation\u2019s economic and political need. Remarkably, even then, he was renowned as a strong adherent of Islam which he would fully later embrace in the last decades of his life.\n\nAlthough we spoke on phone a couple of times in recent years, my last conversation with Datti Ahmed was the May 2012 visit to his Kano residence. We spent almost two hours together though we had not seen or spoken for almost 15 years before then. Prior to the visit, nobody alerted him that I was coming. I simply asked Jamu to drive me to his residence where surprisingly the man at the gate did not even ask who we were before ushering us in. Datti Ahmed, he said, had gone to the Mosque but would soon be back so he brought out chairs for us to sit and wait outside the small bungalow. Not long after, the medical doctor turned Islamic cleric drove himself in and it was evident he had not lost his sense of humour. As he moved closer and recognised me in flowing white babariga and a red cap (the signature costume for Kwankwaso\u2019s supporters supplied by Jamu), he said \u201cSegun, I didn\u2019t know you have also become a \u2018Kwankwasiyya\u2019\u201d.\n\nI recall that encounter with nostalgia. We spoke about the state of the nation and several issues that hamper our development. He was particularly concerned about education in the North. Datti Ahmed told me interesting stories about Awolowo\u2019s free education programme and its impact on the development of the Southwest which still reverberates today. With several anecdotes of prominent Yoruba academics he encountered while he was pro Chancellor at Ife, I leant more from him about Awolowo\u2019s free education and its impact than I ever knew before then. After discussing a wide range of issues, we ended up with his abortive attempt to intermediate with Boko Haram on behalf of the federal government which was then a national issue. Without hedging, he gave me details of what happened and how the opportunity was mismanaged.\n\nAccording to Datti Ahmed, based on their concerns about the spate of violence in the North, he and a few others had been looking for a way to intervene but didn\u2019t know anybody who could put them in contact with Boko Haram. And then someone introduced to them a man, (a Christian who had just converted to Islam and was close to the Boko Haram leadership). It was this man who linked Datti Ahmed and the SCSN Secretary, Mr Nafiu Baba-Ahmed with the Boko Haram leadership. On that basis, the duo of Datti Ahmed and Baba-Ahmed approached President Goodluck Jonathan regarding their efforts and expressed the need for confidentiality. While President Jonathan warmed to the idea and detailed a senior official (name withheld) with whom they met twice, everything they discussed was reported in the media. So, invariably, it was the attention-seeking presidency official who thwarted their efforts.\n\nBecause he prefaced our conversation with a proviso that it was not for publication, I didn\u2019t write about my encounter with Datti Ahmed at the time and I will preserve his memory by not revealing what he told me about those delicate negotiations. But it is important to state that unlike some clerics who go into forests with camera crews, Datti Ahmed believed that negotiations with criminal elements (whether insurgents or bandits) are not something you conduct with media exposure. It is the result that should speak for such efforts, and he made that clear to authorities. The moment that agreement was breached, Datti Ahmed pulled out of the negotiation with Boko Haram. And on 18th March 2012, he issued the following statement: \u201cAs a concerned elder and President of the Supreme Council for Shariah in Nigeria (SCSN), I felt very disturbed with the turn of events and the increasing cycle of massive violence in our country, and especially, in the Northern and Muslim part of Nigeria. We in the SCSN, therefore, made enquiries as to how to reach the current leadership of the Jama\u2019atu Ahlis Sunnati Lidda Awati wal Jihad, otherwise known as Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cOur enquiries led us to a reporter who we realized maintained close and valuable professional contact with leadership of the Sect. Through this gentleman, we contacted the leadership of the Sect and established from them that as Muslims they were prepared to consider \u2018Sulhu\u2019 which means \u2018broad reconciliation\u2019 regarding the dispute between them and the Government.\n\n\u201cIt was, at this juncture, that I and the Secretary General of the SCSN, on behalf of the Supreme Council for Shariah in Nigeria contacted the Federal Government at the highest level and intimated them of this great possibility of reconciliation and peaceful resolution of the crisis. This was on Monday, 5th March, 2012. My delegation was well received, and a high-ranking civilian officer was appointed immediately to liaise with us towards a successful resolution of the crisis. To our shock and dismay, no sooner had we started this dialogue; Nigerian newspapers came out with a lot of the details of the meeting held.\n\n\u201cThis development has embarrassed us very much and has created strong doubts in our minds about the sincerity of the Government\u2019s side in our discussion as the discussion is supposed to be very confidential to achieve any success. In view of this unfortunate and unhelpful development, we have no option but to withdraw from these early discussions. We sincerely regret that an opportunity to negotiate and terminate this cycle of violence is being missed.\u201d\n\nThe late Ibrahim Datti Ahmed was known for the promotion of his religion in his later life. He left the world of medicine and politics to become a cleric but never made merchandise of his faith. Whatever one\u2019s view about that may be, Datti Ahmed was a man of strong conviction, a genuine patriot who lived an austere and disciplined life. May God grant him Aljanah Firdaus and comfort the family he left behind.\n\nMeanwhile, since we are in that time of the season when we reflect as we come to the end of one year and look forward to the next, let me leave readers with a story I once shared on this page of a little boy who visited the village store with his father. On their way out after shopping, they encountered the owner of the store who offered the little boy some free candy. \u201cGet a hand full of candy\u201d the store\u2019s proprietor said to the boy. Rather than act as directed and scoop the candy, the boy just stood there looking up to his father. Apparently thinking the boy didn\u2019t get his message, the owner repeated himself, \u201cSon, get a hand full of candy, it\u2019s free.\u201d Again, the boy did not move as he continued to look up to his father.\n\nApparently embarrassed by what he considered his son\u2019s timidity, the father reached into the jar and got a hand full of candy. He then handed it to his son who beamed with smiles. But as they walked back home, the father stopped and asked his son why he had to rely on him rather than scoop a handful of the free candy by himself. With another big smile on his face, the boy looked up to his father and said: \u201cBecause I know that your hand is bigger than mine.\u201d\n\nWhatever may be the challenges of 2021 that is sure to end in a matter of hours, for those of us who believe in Higher Power, we must learn to place them in His hand. Because the hand of God is bigger than ours.\n\nI wish all my readers a prosperous 2022!\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Produces 441m barrels of projected 635m crude\n\n\u2022Only 12 of country\u2019s 53 oil rigs active\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAt a projected 1.86 million barrels daily oil production in the country\u2019s 2021 budget, Nigeria recorded a huge deficit of almost 200 million barrels in the first 11 months of this year.\n\nThis was largely due to the rising cases of crude oil theft, ageing infrastructure, challenges associated with host communities, under investment, and poor security in the waterways.\n\nFigures from the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Petroleum Commission (NURPC) obtained by THISDAY, indicated that while Nigeria was expected to pump approximately 635 million barrels of oil by November this year, it struggled to produce only 441 million barrels in the period.\n\nMany oil companies are reporting huge losses, sometimes up to 80 per cent of production in the pipelines. \u201cWhen they pump through the pipelines, they only get about 20 per cent of product and the rest lost to pipeline breaches and organised theft. The 20 percent hardly covers cost of production,\u201d an industry expert explained.\n\nSome of the operators essentially, identified security as a core issue for the oil companies as product losses through the pipelines are now so massive that it is affecting their bottomline and the country\u2019s revenue projection from crude oil export. Huge quantities of products are daily stolen by individuals and organised cartels of criminals.\n\nThe Navy and other security agencies that are supposed to protect the waterways and the companies\u2019 operations are either looking the other way, or colluding with syndicates of oil criminals to steal this all-important national resource. It is now a huge and thriving business at the expense of the country.\n\nThis is part of the reason many major oil companies are divesting from the country. To prevent this huge losses to the oil companies, they have largely resorted to using barges to transport oil and the process of building barges and allowing their usage by the government is huge and cumbersome. The cost element to that is; it dramatically increases cost of production to these companies\n\nThis year has been a big disappointment for the industry in Nigeria in terms of matching production with market demand as efforts to meet its almost 1.7 million barrels per day allocation had produced little result.\n\nNigeria, going by the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was expected to produce 1.683 million bpd in January 2022. However, meeting that target would be an uphill task as it has maintained an average of 1.25 million barrels in the last few months.\n\nAn analysis of the data from the regulatory commission indicated that aside its condensates production, which averaged 300,000 barrels daily, the country, through the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and its Joint Venture (JV) partners, pumped far below its forecast for the commodity for the period.\n\nThis was in contrast to last year, when the country was producing 1.7 million barrels per day on the average, except when OPEC compelled its members to cut their production in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEven then, NNPC and its partners pumped almost 1.4 million barrels daily, but that figure has slumped since the August 2021.\n\nThe NURPC data detailing crude production so far this year showed that the country only managed to pump 1.23 million barrels per day in August, 1.24 million barrels per day in September, 1.22 million barrels per day in October, and 1.27 million barrels per day in November.\n\nOn a monthly basis, the figures further revealed a decline from January as production was 42.1 million barrels for that month; in February it was 39.8 million barrels while in March, Nigeria pumped 44.2 million barrels, a relatively good month compared to the rest.\n\nBut April saw the country produce 41.1 million barrels; it was 41.6 million barrels in May; 39.4 million barrels in June; 41 million barrels in July, before it began a downward spiral till now.\n\nIn addition, 38.4 million barrels were pumped from around 30 Nigeria\u2019s terminals and streams in August, 37.4 million barrels in September, 38 million barrels in October and 38.2 million barrels in November.\n\nThe unimpressive production figures have also negatively affected NNPC\u2019s remittances to the federation account and by extension the monies shared by the federal, state and local governments this year.\n\nFor example with a paltry N10.54 billion in November, NNPC was only able to remit 8.5 per cent of its projected N122.7 billion to the Federation Account, a joint pool of funds shared by the country\u2019s three tiers of government.\n\nAside April this year, when the national oil company paid in nothing into the federation account, the November remittance represented the second least payment for the year.\n\nThe information on the proceeds of the NNPC\u2019s sales of crude oil and gas and subsequent contribution to the account was contained in its presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for the month of December 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the N10.5 billion represented a 29.1 per cent decline of the monthly contribution, which has steadily declined in the past three months due to a variety of factors, including under-production and petrol subsidy payments.\n\nIn addition, while a total of N2.30 trillion was supposed to have been paid to the federal, state and local governments in the first 11 months of 2021, only N522.2 billion had been paid as of November.\n\nThe NNPC data showed that the continuous deficit payment had so far resulted in a shortfall of N1.78 trillion in the current year.\n\nHowever, the national oil company blamed the inability to restart the oil wells shut down in 2020 when OPEC compelled member countries to cut production for the declining production.\n\nAdded to that, it listed issues with host communities, vandalism, incessant force majeure on major assets, as well as technical issues leading to shutdowns.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that ageing upstream infrastructure due to years of under-investment remained a major headwind confronting the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate document released by the upstream commission showed that out of Nigeria\u2019s 53 oilrigs, only 12 had been near active in the last few months, while 25 are on standby and 16 have been stacked.\n\nIn terms of terrain, of the 53 rigs, 33 are onshore, 11 are offshore, while nine were found in the swamps.\n\nWhile a stacked rig means the ones which may or may not be operable, but which are stored and have no crews, an active rig count, is an official listing of operational oil and gas rigs in a certain area.\n\nIn the oil industry, the rig count is a major index of measuring activities in the upstream sector.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence. Nkongho died on December 26, 2021.\n\nNkongho had over 15 years of experience in identifying, building, and capturing value for corporations and funds in Africa is the founding partner of Otundi Ventures, a pan-African early-stage fund. She was also a founding investor at Digital Growth Africa (DiGAME), one of Africa\u2019s earliest (2016) institutional venture investing organisations, which has deployed about $35 million in the series A/B rounds of high-growth, tech-enabled businesses including Getsmarter (exited to 2U, Inc.), SWVL, 10X Investments, and Rhino Safaris Africa.\n\nPrior to that, she was a founding team member at Nubuke Investments, a $75 million multi-strategy pan-African fund.\n\nOutside investing, she briefly worked as an African c-suite executive via her roles as the Head of Business Development, SOLO Phone Nigeria, and Head of Strategy & Business Development, Etisalat Nigeria.\n\nEarlier in her career, she spent seven years working at global financial services companies, Morgan Stanley (New York and Hong Kong) and at Merrill Lynch (London).\n\nNkongho was a Kauffman fellow, with an MBA from Columbia Business School and a B.A. from Princeton University.\n\nAs a Nigerian-American, Nkongho spent her formative years in the US, with occasional visits to Nigeria, especially to see her grandmother in eastern Nigeria. It was these visits that opened her eyes to the transformation that was taking place in Africa, making her shift her focus to working in the African investment space.\n\nNnena Nkogho by Kunmi Owopetu\n\nAn ardent believer in the power of technology, she explained why she eagerly supports the African tech ecosystem, in this interview.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother was a farmer in eastern Nigeria, but not a very [successful] one. She would wake up at the crack of dawn to fetch water. She would then carry large containers of water on her head to the rocky soil of her small plot of land. Over the past five years, I\u2019ve seen technology change the lives of smallholder farmers like my grandmother. I\u2019ve seen businesses use the mobile platform to offer value-added services\u2014provide loans for better seeds, automatically irrigate land, and find better markets (and pricing) for harvested goods. Technology-enabled investing can transform lives. To me, that\u2019s the most impactful thing that you can do.\u201d\n\nThe African and global technology ecosystem mourns the loss of their colleague, friend, peer, and mentor. As a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal has been granted the opportunity to publish tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime. May her soul rest in eternal peace.\n\n(L-R) Nnena Nkongho, Principal, DiGAME; Taiwo Ketiku, VP Investments, EchoVC; Omobola Johnson; Senior Partner, TLcom and Osarumen Osamuyi, Founder, The SubTxt (Moderator) at TechCabal Townhall Mobility event.\n\nEghosa Omoigui, founder, EchoVC Partners\n\nAbsolutely devastated to hear of the passing of @NnenaP, an amazing woman, friend, investor, & long-time believer in & contributor to the African tech ecosystem.\n\n\n\nAs one of the few Black female @KauffmanFellows, she was a shining light to many.\n\n\n\nMy condolences to her family.#RIP \u2014 Eghosa Omoigui (@EghosaO) December 26, 2021\n\nIdris Bello, founder, LoftyInc\n\nVery early on as we were figuring out our Fund journey at LoftyInc Capital, a mutual friend introduced me to Nnena who was then at Digame Investment. We met up and by the time we were done, she had shortened my VC journey, while sharing great insights from her own journey. Over the last year, I have kept tabs on her as she set up Otundi and worked harder than anyone I have seen to build her new fund. Hence, her death comes as a rude shock, especially at this opportune moment for venture capital on the African continent. On behalf of LoftyInc Capital, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Nnena\u2019s family and friends and the folks at Otundi. She will be missed.\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, Big Cabal Media\n\nNnenna was a wonderful person, generous, cheerful and helpful to a fault. She was a close friend and supporter of our work at TechCabal, ready to offer advice, connections and knowledge whenever we asked it of her. She checked in on us and offered encouragement at those times when it was most needed. She will be greatly missed by us all. May she rest her peace and God comfort her family and loved ones.\n\nEmilian Popa, Ilara Health\n\nYou started out as a colleague and became a friend over the years. Your thoughtful advice and friendship will be missed. Rest in peace.\n\nDotun Olowoporoku, Novastar Ventures\n\nI first met Nnena at a conference in Kigali in 2020. The last time we met was over dinner a few weeks ago at another conference in Abu Dhabi. I\u2019m always grateful for the time we spent discussing and debating. Nnena was super thoughtful, willing to help and deeply insightful. She was one of a rare breed of institutional VCs in Africa who had been active for a long time in the region, and yet remained genuinely curious about what came next. It\u2019s devastating that we\u2019re losing her when we really need more African VC fund managers like her. She will be greatly missed.\n\nKarim Shariff, Managing Partner, Majlis Investments\n\nNnena. What beautiful energy and willingness to listen to perspective. Her memory attached her to Africa. Her imagination will bring her back. A sense of culture, geography, and technology. Always tirelessly moving. We met, over the years, in New York, London, Dubai, and Nairobi. She knew these places intimately. I know I will miss her and her lens on everything.\n\nIyin Aboyeji, founder, Future Africa\n\nNnenna was a force of nature, a real one. She always had the courage to say what everyone was thinking but dreading to say. This was where we found a common cause. No one was ever in doubt of where they stood with her. Her impact in our industry was silent but potent. The Get Smarter deal is one for the ages. Our industry will miss her. May her soul Rest In Peace and may GOD give her family and friends the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\nSteven Grin, managing partner, Lateral Capital.\n\nNnena was a friend, colleague, and an intellectual sparring partner with no BS, in a world filled with so much fakery. She was relentlessly curious and had that rare combination of being strong and vulnerable at the same time. She was a trailblazer and deeply committed to the African tech ecosystem, especially at a time when most LPs did not believe in the asset clas. I know she was particularly excited about the work she was doing with Kauffman, her new fund, Otundi, and her support to emerging female managers. Being one of a few female general partners in our space, we have lost a real lion. I can only trust, somehow, that we will all continue in her honour, doing our part, to keep up the work.\n\nMari\u00e8me Diop \u2013 Orange Ventures.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days since I heard the devastating news of Nnena\u2019s passing. I have been processing it since then\u2026, and after the tears, questions, sorrow, remembrance, and acceptance\u2026, it still hurts to know that she\u2019s gone forever.\n\nI liked Nnena very much. I met her almost five years ago. We hit it off straight away and have stayed in touch ever since. She was always supportive, enthusiastic, empathetic, and so hard-working. These past six months after she started Otundi Ventures, we had wonderful conversations once or twice a week, and she always had great insights on how to address the root cause of gender inequality and biases in our industry.\n\nShe fought hard not only to get a seat at the table but to build her own and hence forge a path for women investors in Africa.\n\nNnena cared about people. She loved the arts and creative minds. Even when she was very busy, we sent each other encouraging messages, and she was always advising me to take care of myself. I am glad that she knew how much I valued her, which I told her for the umpteenth time in our last conversation, a few days before she left this world. Nnena, you will be really missed, and I will continue to hold you warmly in my heart. Rest in peace, my friend. My deepest condolences to her family and friends.\n\nWale Ayeni \u2013 IFC | World Bank Group\n\nThis is difficult to write. Nnena was a giant. She was ebullient, extremely dedicated, and cared deeply about Africa. Her passion for the ecosystem and for founders was palpable, and I will miss our hour-long conversations on the ecosystem. I, and we, have lost a colleague and trusted friend. Her energy is irreplaceable. We will miss you Nnena, and we won\u2019t forget.\n\nIK Kanu, founding partner, Atlantica Ventures\n\nNnena was always real to me and everyone that met her. She was always positive, smiling, and quick to lend an ear or hand. We met years ago, and strengthened our friendship during our Kauffman Fellowship. She was strong, confident, yet humble and kind. Always laughing and looking forward to better days ahead. Rest well with God my dear friend.\n\nRomain Diaz \u2013 Founder & CEO, Satgana\n\nI am deeply saddened that my mentor, Nnena P. Nkongho, has left this world. I met Nnena five years ago in Cape Town, and she has been one of the most important people in my professional development ever since. From a mentor, she became a friend, advisor, and confidant.\n\nI am profoundly grateful for all the countless hours that she selflessly spent to help me figure things out, solve problems, strategise, and grow.\n\nEvery hour I spent with her equated to months of accelerated development, thanks to the right blend that she always brought between validating me and challenging me. She is the one who pushed me to pursue a vision that later gave birth to Satgana. She believed in me when I sometimes didn\u2019t. I wish all entrepreneurs out there find their own Nnena.\n\nIf anything, as I have been told by another dear friend and business partner, I should honour her by making this company as successful as she believed it would become. Thank you for everything, Nnena. You\u2019ll leave a hole in my life and those around you.\n\nRest in peace. Much love.\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nArun Iyer \u2013 Alpha Direct Insurance\n\nNnena was an incredibly astute individual and investor. In the brief time in which I got to know her and the interactions we had, she became a friend and partner, giving me advice and being open, honest, and straightforward about everything she did, every interaction we had. She gave me the inspiration to aim higher and push harder because she believed in us founders as much as we believed in ourselves. She understood our business so quickly and well, and she had an incredible ability to be forthright and candid while staying supportive and encouraging. She thought like a founder, and her optimism and enthusiasm were infectious.\n\nWe lost a true gem of a human being. It\u2019s a big loss for the entire African technology ecosystem and the world at large. May her soul rest in eternal peace, and I pray for her family and loved ones to find the strength and courage to deal with her loss.\n\nCraig McLeod \u2013 Box Commerce\n\nNnena Nkongho was one of the greatest champions of the African tech ecosystem as a VC, leader, pioneer and, hands down, one of its smartest players. She was a great mentor, friend and peer. In an ecosystem of only a handful of giants, she stood tall. She will be missed.\n\nLeonard Stiegeler \u2013 Founder, Pulse Africa\n\nI was deeply saddened to hear of Nnenna\u2019s passing.\n\nShe was a kind, joyous, and thoughtful person that I was lucky to meet in different places around Africa & in the UAE, over the years. Every time we met, we had great discussions and I left smarter than I had come.\n\nNnenna\u2019s impact in the African technology and venture capital space will live on. Her support for entrepreneurs, businesses, and industries will facilitate opportunities for young people and economies for generations to come.\n\nMy thoughts are with her loved ones and friends.\n\nIbrahim Sagna \u2013 AFREXIMBANK\n\nSome people show up in your life and leave without notice, not realising how they have impacted you. Such individuals are so consumed by their mission to share what they know that they are not counting or keeping tabs of their impact. Instead, they remain busy improving other people\u2019s lives. Rumi\u2014Persian poet and philosopher\u2014reminds us that, \u201ca candle never loses any of its light while lighting up another candle\u201d.\n\nNnena Nkongho is such a candle. She is that sister who comes into your life without notice; that missionary who enlightens you with the breadth of her knowledge and network in African tech investment and leaves you forever impacted. I had just moved to Cairo, and in one small trip, she had managed to plug me into the local ecosystem and left me at first curious, then ultimately full of passion for the sector and its players.\n\nThe reality is that Nnena was not just remarkable because of her knowledge, network, or dedication to startups. She was remarkable because her fundamental character combined humility and ingenuity on the one hand, and calmness and a zest for life on the other. She gave and gave. She was selfless. We will all miss a phenomenal human.\n\nHer departure leaves many of us in shock. May she rest in perfect peace. Hereby extending our most sincere condolences to her family.\n\nSamer Salty, Managing Partner, Zouk Capital\n\nYou could always tell you are in the presence of a gentle soul when you are speaking with Nnena. She always cared about people, regardless of their walk of life. For her, doing good is good business. It was a great pleasure to have worked with her and known her. We will miss you, Nnena.\n\nIdo Sum, Andreata, and the TLcom team\n\nWe met Nnena first in 2013, through a mutual friend at Kuramo, one of Africa\u2019s very first fund of funds. She was just out of Columbia Business School, helping Africa founders in the very early days of the African tech ecosystem, and keen to play a role in its formation. Our first chat was a sign for the years to come. She was a super open, honest, smart, nice, deliberate, and driven person.\n\nWe remained friends, and over the years after she joined DiGAME, started sharing investment opportunities and insights with each other. Nnena was a voice we listened to. Grounded, rounded, thoughtful, and most importantly, in the early days of African tech, a true optimist.\n\nIn the coming years, our paths crossed many more times. Drinks in Cape Town, dinners in Kigali, Zooms, WhatsApp messages\u2026 She was always keen to collaborate. She was full of good humour and lightened the load of life with a good laugh. When Nnena decided to launch her own fund, we couldn\u2019t have been happier. A women-led team, with a great perspective of the scene\u2019s evolvement and exits expertise, nothing could stand in her way.\n\nOur last catch up was just a few weeks back. As always, future-looking, with her eyes set to conquer the next summit ahead. Little did we know at that time\u2026\n\nWe stand broken-hearted at the loss of one of our true friends in this journey. Nnena will forever be in our hearts. A true leader, early visionary and, above all, a mensch. You will forever be in our hearts.\n\nRaj Kulasingam, Senior Counsel, Dentons\n\nI met Nnena many years ago when venture in Africa was a desert. Since then, whenever we met, I was always struck by her warmth, genuineness, and willingness to share her experience and knowledge.\n\nHer passing will be felt by many I know. I hope we can remember her not only for the contributions she made but also for her warmth and humanity.\n\nStephan Breban, CEO, Giants\u2019 Shoulders Capital Limited\n\nThe first thing to say is that this has hit me far more than I expected. Maybe because she was always so full of life. I\u2019ve lost people closer to me, and in the current environment, it should not be too shocking. But this is. I know many people know her and remember her fondly. There will be many tributes to her intelligence and general investment and tech brilliance, and so I\u2019m going for another angle. I\u2019m going to share my favourite memory of Nnena. We met many times in many different cities, and she would always know the best spot for coffee. She was a proper authority. The first time I met her in London, I knew I had to do something special. No coffee was ever going to impress her, so I took her here, a Victorian urinal that had been converted to a coffee shop. Not sure I can say she loved it, but I made an impression! If you ever get to London, please visit Fitzrovia, have a coffee there, and try to imagine Nnena\u2019s reaction.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "GetEquity is changing startup investment in Africa. But how?",
          "text": "GetEquity, a Nigeria-based investment platform, came into the market with the mantra of \u201cchallenging the status quo of startup financing and venture capital\u201d in Africa. The company says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nLooking back at its activities, that mantra doesn\u2019t seem like a mere marketing play, the startup is indeed walking the talk. But how is it doing that?\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July this year, GetEquity is a product of a series of iterations. Initially, the co-founders didn\u2019t set out to democratise startup investment in Africa. In fact, Dike and Okafor, who are blockchain engineers, were building a blockchain exchange platform, and Temitope was working around a big data analytics product. But, on getting into the Mozilla Accelerator, the trio realised that they could \u201cmerge forces\u201d and build one of the most innovative products in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cI met Temitope at the Mozilla Accelerator after we\u2019d bantered on Twitter for the longest time. I and William are technical persons and Temitope is a business operator, so I asked Temitope to help us figure out the business side of our product and we\u2019d help him build a technical team for his product,\u201d said Dike, CEO at GetEquity. Apparently, this was the supposed skill trade that would lead to the founding of GetEquity.\n\nThis is how disruption looks like\n\nTake a look at this: Shola, 25, wants to invest in a high-growth startup but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and when he finally finds some answers, his cheque is not enough to be an LP or even get him into an angel syndicate. So, he gives up. On the other side of things, Ada, a young founder, is struggling to raise enough capital to keep her startup running. So, she shuts down the business.\n\nBut what if Ada could find 10, 20, 100, or even more, of Shola who only have maybe $100 or less to invest? She could have raised close to what she needed to keep her business alive. This simple thinking led to building GetEquity.\n\nAcross the world, investing in early-stage businesses is not usually a public affair; it is mostly available to capital institutions, top-tier individual angel investors, syndicates (a group of angel investors), and sometimes, family and friends. Though this is still largely the case, startups like GetEquity are making a decent effort to disrupt this privileged arrangement and open up the space to any interested party.\n\nOn GetEquity, startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Herconomy, a fintech startup for women, closed a $100,000 pre-seed funding round within 24 hours on the platform. That\u2019s 20% of the total funding raised and the portion reserved for its community. Before now, the possibility of a Nigerian startup closing a funding round\u2014both the seeds and the series\u2014within 24 hours was not only a tall order but a fantasy.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Fluidcoins, TalentQL and Mizala have closed $30,000, $25,000, and $25,000, respectively, from users who weren\u2019t necessarily part of their communities.\n\nTo clear the misconception that GetEquity was built on blockchain technology, the CEO said their technology only employs the core blockchain concept, which is tokenisation. \u201cBlockchain is all about ownership, accessibility and security, and we have borrowed this core concept to tokenise funding on our platform,\u201d Dike said.\n\nThis means, when a company wants to raise $50,000, it\u2019s technically selling 5,000 tokens at $10 per one.\n\nDue diligence and investment security\n\nOne of the most important and heaviest stages of investment is due diligence (DD); it\u2019s at this point the worthiness of a company is being tested. A lot of checks and notes comparisons happen at this stage. The question now is if investors can\u2019t carry out DD individually, how do they then know that a business is worth investing in?\n\nApparently, GetEquity operates like every other VC: its team of diverse backgrounds\u2014law, marketing, investment, business development\u2014analyse the potential growth of a startup before onboarding them on their platform. If that\u2019s the case, one can chose to question the validity of the disruption the company promises to bring into startup investment. Isn\u2019t this just a digital VC? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. GetEquity\u2019s DD process is reportedly fast and doesn\u2019t hold startup to ridiculous equity shares, unlike most conventional VCs.\n\n\u201cWe look through the entire business\u2014the model, product roadmap, founder(s), traction, and revenue. We ensure the business is solid before we enlist them on our platform,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of growth Ekundayo, who doubles as joint CEO at Printivo.\n\nHowever, Ekundayo mentioned that even though the company\u2019s approach to DD is thorough, the company can\u2019t guarantee investors ROI on all their investments. And that\u2019s why GetEquity accepts investments as low as $10; this way investors can minimise risk by putting in small money across a number of startups.\n\nGrowth and Traction\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 GetEquity raised in April this year, it also raised an undisclosed six-figures pre-seed from Green House Capital, a renowned fintech investment shop based in Nigeria, and this validates the potential of its products. Since the investment, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nGetEquity has released a couple of features that make investing on its platform even better; it launches secondaries where users can sell off their equity (token) according to its present value. For instance, if a user wishes to sell their token after buying and keeping for a while, all they need to do is indicate their interest to sell and they will be matched with a buyer, and vice versa.\n\nThe startup also recently just released Dealroom, a feature that allows users, mostly syndicates, to privately raise money faster. Think of a private room where you can quickly meet with your family and then convince them to commit to a course, but here, the course is raising money.\n\nGetEquity has a wallet infrastructure that users can use to hold value until ready to invest in their chosen startup. It charges between 0.5-5% on every transaction, depending on the payment option chosen. There\u2019s also an option to fund a wallet with crypto for those living where crypto dealings aren\u2019t frowned at, thanks to its partnership with Fluidcoin, another startup that has raised on its platform. The company also charges startups 4% commission on transaction.\n\nBoth local and international investors are bullish on Africa, especially Nigeria, which recorded the largest funding of about $1.4 billion out of almost $5 billion funding raised by African startups in 2021. With a more inclusive funding infrastructure built by GetEquity, this trend promises to continue for Nigeria come 2022.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve come across the buzzword, non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Internet, chances are you have also seen the latest buzzword \u2014 Web3. Both words are generated by proponents of blockchain technology and crypto heads who believe it is the future of the Internet.\n\nAlthough some people like Elon Musk have said the word is a mere \u201cmarketing buzzword than reality right now,\u201d a deeper look at it suggests it could change not just the Internet but the world economy as we know it. But before I suggest that Musk could be wrong and sound like a crypto head myself, what exactly is Web3?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting web3 is real \u2013 seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now \u2013 just wondering what the future will be like in 10, 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2021\n\nWhat is Web3?\n\nWeb3 is simply the Internet that belongs to everyone. A decentralised World Wide Web owned by no one but run based on everyone\u2019s decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get a deeper understanding of what Web3 is and the rationale behind its formation, it is important to start from the beginning \u2014 the first and second generations of the web and how they\u2019re different from the imminent third generation.\n\nWeb1: The beginning\n\nWeb1 is the earliest version of what we call the Internet today. According to a 2014 paper by Nupur Choudhury, World Wide Web and Its Journey from Web 1.0 to Web 4.0, the Web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1989. He envisioned the Web in three ways: a Web of documents (Web1), a Web of people (Web2) and a Web of data (Web3).\n\nIt is accurately referred to as \u201cread-only web\u201d as there were very few visuals besides text. Unlike today\u2019s Internet that allows users to interact with information online, users of Web1 were more passive and only read things online.\n\nThere was no comment section like you have on the Techpoint Africa website or Twitter or Facebook where you air your views or share your opinion about someone else\u2019s. To get an excellent example of what Web1 is like, visit Cameron\u2019s World, a web-collage of text and images from 1994 to 2009. Another great example will be what CNN used to look like in 2000.\n\nBerners-Lee is a British scientist who worked at Organisation Europ\u00e9enne pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire (CERN). He submitted the proposal for what is known as the Internet today as an effective communication system at CERN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim-Berners-Lee. Source: Britannica\n\nHowever, Berners-Lee realised that what he had proposed was far more powerful than just being a communication system within CERN but for the whole world. He and Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist, decided to connect information on the Web with hypertext and the Internet was formed.\n\nInterestingly, the first iteration of the Internet was very different from what we have now. To millennials or Gen Zs, Web1 was more or less looking at an offline doc.\n\nWeb2: Current dispensation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Web1 looks like\n\nBy 2004 the era of Web1 was about to fade away and the second iteration of the Internet was on its way. It would mark the beginning of user-generated content on the web. The same way Web3 is causing a stir now on the Internet, the coming of Web2 also did the same thing. It was dubbed a movement and a new wave of social services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the words of Tim O\u2019 Riley, Co-Founder of the O\u2019Riley Media and the man who popularised the term Web2, \u201cWeb 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as a platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform.\n\n\u201cChief among those rules is this: Build applications that harness network effects to get better the more people use them.\u201d\n\nWeb2 was truly transformative; it birthed social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, which have dominated online social interactions to date. Cloud computing, eCommerce, financial services and many of the things we enjoy on the Internet today were only possible with the creation of Web2.\n\nAlthough Web2 stirred as much excitement as Web3 is doing now, people calmed down when Web2 became an everyday thing.\n\nThis is Web3\n\nWeb3 underpins the idea behind the creation of cryptocurrencies which is simply decentralisation. The technologies behind cryptocurrency, such as blockchain and cryptography, will also be a crucial part of Web3.\n\nLike Web2, Web3 wants to make the Internet more inclusive but, in contrast, take control away from big corporations like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It aims to do this by decentralising the Internet.\n\nMat Dryhurst, a Berlin artist and a proponent of the Web3 revolution, says, \u201cThere\u2019s a small group of companies that own all this stuff, and then there\u2019s us who use it, and despite the fact that we contribute to the success of these platforms, we don\u2019t have anything to show for it.\u201d\n\nBut how will Web3 give people control of the Internet? We\u2019re already seeing a glimpse of how Web3 will work with the advent of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for example, does not belong to anyone and every data on the Bitcoin network is not in a single place, it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nWhat to prepare for with Web3\n\nWith Web3, user data on the Internet is not held by Google or Facebook; it\u2019s on a blockchain that belongs to everyone. According to Business Insider Africa, you\u2019ll only need a single account to do anything on the Internet. For example, the same account will be used for Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, Jumia, Bolt, and even Techpoint Africa.\n\nBasically, all of the applications and websites online will be decentralised. So, we\u2019ll log in to these applications the same way we use the Web3 wallet, Metamask, to log into blockchain platforms like decentralised finance.\n\nFor example, to buy or upload an NFT on OpenSea, an NFT market, you only need to connect your Metamask wallet, and it identifies you. The same Metamask wallet can be used to log in to other NFT marketplaces like Rarible and SuperRare. In fact, decentralised finance platforms (DeFi), decentralised exchanges (DEX) and virtually every Web3-enabled application will work with that same wallet.\n\nAnother huge part of Web3 will be artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI works with Web2, the third generation of the Internet will help AI understand the content on the web the same way humans do, making AI a lot smarter. In an example by CoinMarketCap, AI will not just understand words but the emotions behind the words with something called Semantic Web, a writing standard on the web that makes online content readable for AI and machines.\n\nIt is important to note that a large part of what Web3 is said to be capable of hasn\u2019t been seen or tested. However, many venture capitalists seem to believe strongly in the Web3 future.\n\nThis year alone, $27 billion has been raised by Web3-related startups, which is over 1,200% more than what the whole African startup ecosystem raised in 2019 and 2020 combined.\n\nGetting started with Web3 in 2022\n\nAlthough the idea of Web3 isn\u2019t fully formed, platforms that embody the concept already exist, and they\u2019re creating sources of collaboration and income for people. Such platforms include decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO), DeFi platforms, crypto gaming platforms, and even the metaverse.\n\nHowever, there are financial and educational barriers to entering these platforms as they\u2019re very new and complicated. So, the first step to getting started with Web3 will be learning, for instance, knowing how to get into the world of non-fungible tokens.\n\nWhile Web3 might be a new concept, there\u2019s quite enough content about it on the Internet, and a quick Google search could do a lot of wonders.\n\nWhen it comes to earning with Web3, on the other hand, a quick search on the Internet might not cut it. However, gaming seems like the least risky way to profit from the new Internet iteration.\n\nIn Africa, platforms like the Metaverse Magna have made it easy to profit from crypto gaming with their scholarship programme. It provides players with the assets they need to compete on crypto gaming platforms such as Axie Infinity, where they can earn up to $2,000 a month.\n\nA career in Web3 is also another path to profiting from it in 2022. Web3 and blockchain experts are in high demand as the field is still new. Dapp University is a great place to start learning about careers within Web3.\n\nWhile Web3 might be the shiny new future of the Internet, only time will tell if it will deliver on its many promises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Expectations are high among shippers and manufacturers that depend on seaports to bring in raw materials and export finished products, as Nigeria welcomes Lekki Port Seaport, its first deepwater port.\n\nAccording to Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited, the developer of the $1.5 billion Lekki Deep Seaport with 16.5 metres depth \u2013 deepest in Nigeria, the port would be completed in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nWith the coming of the much-awaited deep seaport, the Nigerian port industry will likely begin to play at par with its West African peers such as Abidjan Port, Lome Port and Tema Port that have developed deeper and more extensive seaports, industry analysts say.\n\nThese nations left Nigeria behind after they succeeded in building modern ports with the capacity to handle cargoes in a timely and more efficient manner.\n\nAs a deepwater port, Lekki Port will have the capacity to accommodate larger and more modern vessels with an economy of scale for the shipper and fast delivery of consignments from the port of origin to Nigeria.\n\nOn the economic gains of the port, Warredi Enisuoh, a ship captain, says the daily cost difference between a ship carrying 4,500 Twenty Equivalent Units (TEUs) of containers, like in the case of Apapa Port, and a larger vessel with a capacity to carry 20,000 containers is about $1,000, which is why deepwater ports are becoming popular all over the world.\n\nTogo Port, which has a deepwater port, handles vessels in just 1.4 days while Nigeria\u2019s Apapa Port handles vessels in four days, he says.\n\nBusinessDay understands that Lekki Port was conceptualised to bridge the gap in the projected demand for containerised goods, especially as the capacity of existing ports in Lagos to handle the boom is becoming limited.\n\nThe port, according to projection, is expected to help decongest the Apapa Port, which is currently struggling with limited space and poor infrastructure, especially for cargo evacuation from and to the port.\n\nInterestingly, the Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited states that as of November 28, 2021, construction works at the project site port have reached 74.15 percent.\n\nThe developer further says the dredging and reclamation works have reached 85.38 percent while the building of quay walls has reached 77.96 percent.\n\nAlso, construction works on the breakwater stand at 75.94 percent while the construction of the landside infrastructure stands at 60.36 percent.\n\nEmma Nwabunwanne, a Lagos-based importer, who spoke on the importance of the port, says Nigeria needs a deeper port to complement the existing ones, as Apapa and Tin-Can ports in Lagos are currently running out of capacity going by the level of congestion in the terminals.\n\nMeanwhile, Du Ruogang, managing director, LFTZ Enterprise, says the delivery of the Lekki Port project would go a long way in helping Nigeria to bridge the infrastructure gap in its maritime sector.\n\nOn his part, Tony Anakebe, a maritime analyst, who described the coming on board of Lekki Port as a game-changer, notes that the port would help to take pressure off the nation\u2019s busiest ports in Apapa.\n\nAccording to Anakebe, Lekki Port, if properly structured, especially in terms of having the necessary cargo evacuation models, would go a long way to reduce congestion within Apapa Port terminals, and gridlock on roads leading to the ports in Lagos.\n\nDuring one of her quarterly inspections of the port, Magdalene Ajani, the permanent secretary of the Federal Ministry of Transport, assured that the developer of Lekki Port were working assiduously to meet the deadline of fourth quarter 2022 for commencement of commercial operations as directed by Rotimi Amaechi, the minister of transportation.\n\nOn the ability to deliver the port on schedule, Ruogang says China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), the EPC contractor, is working round-the-clock to ensure timely completion of the project, and to deliver a world-class port that would be the deepest in the sub-Saharan African region.\n\nRuogang, who is confident that the port project would be delivered by the third quarter of 2022 as scheduled, says the primary focus is to continue to make progress on the construction as well as make preparations for the commencement of port operations at Lekki.\n\nLekki Port, which is being constructed on a 90-hectare of land based on Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) arrangement, would comprise of three containers, three liquid, and one dry bulk berths.\n\nIt is also expected to have a projected capacity of 2.7 million TEUs of containers per annum.",

          "text": "Despite 2021 being a tough year for businesses globally owing to the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact, start-ups in Africa\u2019s biggest economy continued to show great promise, becoming increasingly instrumental in the new normal.\n\nThe Nigeria\u2019s entrepreneurship ecosystem attracted $1.37 billion investment deals in 2021, highest on the continent, according to a compilation by thebigdeal.gumroad.com \u2013 an African startups deals database.\n\nTech and fin-tech businesses accounted for over 90 percent of the total deals for the period.\n\nYearly, we are seeing more innovative entrepreneurs providing solutions to societal problems, causing disruption in their sectors while creating jobs.\n\nOn this note, BusinessDay takes a look at some of these start-ups who will make some serious impact in the country\u2019s entrepreneurship ecosystem in 2022 amid the omicron variant and difficult business environment.\n\nRead Also: Meet five investors behind 2021 biggest funding in Nigerian startups\n\nThe criteria used in our assessment include, but not limited to, growth, social and economic impact, international recognition, expansion, structure of business, must be founded in less than five years, and potential for growth. The entrepreneurs are not in any particular order.\n\nAs a result, here are the 10 burgeoning entrepreneurs worth watching in 2022:\n\nuLesson\n\nThrough many students were able to learn during the initial lockdown in Africa\u2019s biggest economy to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nuLesson \u2013 an ed-tech start-up founded by Sim Shagaya, founder of Konga and DealDey,is currently the leading ed-tech business for students as it allows users through its platform to experience a digitalised learning by taking lessons, mock exams, and access their performance through a well-detailed user-friendly dashboard.\n\nSince it\u2019s launched, uLesson has introduced new features. It recently launched a one-to-many live class feature with polls and leaderboards and a one-to-one live experience for DevKids, a coding class independent of the core uLesson platform.\n\nDevKids has since been rolled back, though Shagaya said uLesson is making efforts to introduce the feature \u2014 which started as an experiment in teaching kids how to code and at some point made 30percent of the company\u2019s revenues \u2014 into the uLesson platform by early 2022.\n\nBefore its establishment in February 2020, the ed-tech start-up has already secured over $3.1 million for its funding from TLcom Capital.\n\nIn January, the edutech startup raised a $7.5 million Series A funding from five investors and just recently closed a $15million Series B round a few weeks ago.\n\n54gene\n\nAbasi Ene-Obong left his role as a management consultant in the pharmaceutical sector in the US to Nigeria to build Africa\u2019s first biobank.\n\nIt was founded by the young entrepreneur in July 2019 to unlock the African genome and improve the understanding of the world\u2019s most genetically diverse population.\n\nEne-Obong and his team started from the very beginning as there were no blueprints for biobank on the continent.\n\n54gene partners with hospitals and research institutions in African countries and with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to address the challenge of limited diverse genomics data, which may hold the key to medical discoveries and new healthcare solutions.\n\nBacked by investors including Y Combinator, Fifty Years Ventures, Better Ventures, and KdT Ventures, 54gene aims to equilibrate healthcare for people of African origin while advancing the quality of medical care worldwide.\n\nIt recently launched its diagnostics subsidiary \u2013 7RiverLabs \u2013 fitted with state of the art technology to offer healthcare providers and patients access to world-class, cost-effective, speedy, reliable and advanced molecular diagnostics. The business is looking radically to disrupt the $100billion global pharmaceutical industry.\n\nAutochek\n\nAutochek, an automotive technology company set out to transform the African automobile industry by creating a single marketplace for consumers\u2019 automotive needs, from sourcing and financing to after-sales support and warranties.\n\nStartup veteran Etop Ikpe, once of DealDey and Cars45, launched his new venture \u2013 Autochek \u2013 with a bang in September 2020, announcing the acquisition of automotive marketplaces Cheki Nigeria and Cheki Ghana, previously part of ROAM Africa\u2019s portfolio of leading online marketplaces.\n\nROAM Africa, Cheki\u2019s parent company, has transferred ownership and operational control to Autochek of its Nigeria and Ghana brands Autochek, and all Cheki Nigeria and Cheki Ghana outlets will be rebranded.\n\nThe auto-tech auto company recently closed a $13.1million seed funding round, coming after a year it raised a $3.4 million pre-seed funding round to help it grow its operations and develop its platform.\n\nAlso, it just launched the continent\u2019s first online brand new car loans marketplace to further deepen its mobility.\n\nDrugStoc\n\nGetting quality medicines is not always easy in a developing country like Nigeria.\n\nBut the situation is gradually changing with the entry of DrugStoc, a multi-channel, cloud-based health pharmaceutical platform founded by Chibuzor Opara and Adham Yehia.\n\nThe platform exists to empower healthcare providers to fulfil their mandate for a healthier Africa. Opara\u2019s DrugStoc seeks ways to improve access to pharmaceutical products and services.\n\nOpara, managing partner and co-founder of DrugStoc, says the company exists to solve the problems of fragmented supply chain market, counterfeiting and in-transparent pricing.\n\nOpara is a medical doctor and health economist. His co-founder Adham Yehia is an expert in health facilities management. Both of them met in the Netherlands while doing their post-graduate studies.\n\nSourcing drugs from DrugStoc is a simple process: You go on the platform, place an order and within 24 hours the products will be supplied, according to Opara. The platform offers a myriad of payment, credit and financing solutions which are adapted to the realities of the pharmaceutical supply chain in the country.\n\nThe drug firm works with over 800 pharmacies and with the Association of General and Private Medical Practitioners of Nigeria, which has over 2,000 registered members.\n\nThe firm deploys artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology to enhance its track and trace capability with a view to sanitising the system.\n\nThe growth of the company has been tremendous since 2017. So far, the amount of prescriptions through hospitals and pharmacies that the firm serviced in the last two years has exceeded two million.\n\nOpara reminds Nigerians that DrugStoc\u2019s products are not expensive because of the firm\u2019s advantage of doing huge volumes.\n\nCurrently, DrugStoc is on an aggressive expansion plan to deliver quality pharmaceutical products to 100 million people within the country and has just closed a $4.4 million Series A funding for the expansion.\n\nEden\n\nTraffic congestion in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s megacity, has become a nightmare for professionals, making it hard for them to cope with mundane tasks of home cleaning and laundry.\n\nTo change this for professionals, Eden has strategically positioned itself as the go-to platform for home service needs to help busy professionals take care of their cooking and domestic cleaning.\n\nEden is a home services app where individuals can schedule their food, laundry and cleaning services from their comfort.\n\nEden was co-founded in 2019 by Nadayar Enegesi, co-founder of Andela, and Prosper Otemuyiwa and Silm Momoh \u2013 ex-executives of Andela.\n\nWhen the founders, ex-Andelans executives, launched the home service app two years ago, it raised some eyebrows.\n\nAt the time, founders were increasingly launching ventures in fintech, e-commerce and logistics, so it was surprising to see ex-Andelans executives choose to tackle a space many felt couldn\u2019t be profitable for a tech company in Nigeria.\n\nThe startup recently raised a $1.4 million seed round to deepen its market penetration.\n\nEdukoya\n\nEdukoya is a free learning application that helps learners increase the success rate of examinations by providing unlimited practice questions, detailed solutions, and access to online tutors, etc.\n\nFounded by Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya became the second most downloaded education app in Nigeria following its launch in December 2021.\n\nThe start-up is currently in beta with plans to go live fully in 2022 to make high-quality instruction and content accessible and affordable to every student, expand its online curriculum content coverage and on-demand tutoring feature for secondary school learners.\n\nIt secured a $3.5 million in pre-seed funding which it will use to transition from beta to live launch, build its team and customer base. The company has offices in the United Kingdom and Nigeria.\n\nAgricrop\n\nAgricorp international is a Nigerian-based start-up that specializes in producing, processing, and exporting spices particularly ginger, the company was launched in November 2018 by Kenneth Obiajulu and Oyewale Omotimirin.\n\nAgricorp has supported over 5,000 smallholder farmers with inputs and training on good agronomic practices.\n\nIt has built a 0.5MT per hour spice processing plant in Kaduna, Nigeria that produces value-added products for the export market.\n\nIt has also used its proprietary technology, Farmbase to register, aggregate, and pay farmers for produce sold.\n\nIn September 2021, the firm raised $17.5 million in Series A funding, which is expected to help boost its operations locally and globally. Altogether it has received a total funding amount of $17.8 million since its launch.\n\nMono\n\nMono is a tech company that provides businesses with access to high-quality financial data and direct bank payments via open banking platforms.\n\nLaunched in 2020 by Abdulhamid Hassan and Prakhar Singh, the company has successfully carried out over 200 million transactions, covered three countries across the African continent and has 1,200 developers and businesses building with their products.\n\nMono has 18 investors and has received seed funding worth $17.6 million with five funding rounds, starting with a pre-seed fund of $500,000 in September 2020.\n\nThe company plans to be in five African countries by 2022 utilizing its recent seed fund.\n\nMoove\n\nMoove was founded by Ladi Delano and Jide Odunsi in 2019 and it commenced operations in June 2020. It is a Lagos-based mobility fintech company passionate about addressing vehicle financing and enabling people to afford vehicles of their choice in Africa.\n\nMoove inserts its alternative credit-scoring technology onto ride-hailing and e-logistics platforms, which allows access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics of mobility entrepreneurs to underwrite loans.\n\nAlready the company has extended its operations to Nairobi, Kenya, and has the intention of reaching more African countries in the coming years.\n\nThe start-up has managed to raise a total of $68.2 million in funding with a total of 18 investors since its launch.\n\nPayday\n\nPayday is a platform created to provide swift payments systems for Africans within and beyond the continent. Its product offerings include sending and receiving money globally, getting paid by foreign employers and clients, issuing Virtual Mastercards, paying tuition and other fees abroad.\n\nFounded in May 2021 by Favour Ori, Payday launched its beta test in June 2021 and proceeded with a cold launch in July. Within three weeks of launch, the platform successfully processed over $1.4 million in transactions\n\nPayday is also used by foreign businesses such as TalentQL (TechStars), Tupelo, and a slew of others to pay their employees in Africa for a variety of services such as payroll, taxes, and compliance.",

          "text": "Some Nigerian oil workers at the local units of International Oil Companies (IOCs) are staring at a bleak future as the planned sale of onshore and shallow waters assets could leave thousands jobless with denied benefits, BusinessDay interview with several oil workers shows.\n\nOil majors Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Eni are in a hurry to sell off their troubled Nigerian assets after COVID-19 interfered with their divestment plans in 2019.\n\nThese oil majors are keen to offload their onshore and shallow water assets before the end of the Buhari administration, a government they have found favourable to their interests.\n\nUnder the APC-led government, oil majors have seen renewed payments on cash call arrears, a lax enforcement of expatriate quotas and even favourable fiscal regime in the new oil law.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian workforce of these oil companies say their management have perfected plans to pawn them off to local operators who are angling to buy up the assets to work on contract basis with significant haircut to their pay.\n\nOthers say the oil majors are laying off their Nigerian workers and denying them benefits that are entitled to them after many years in the employ of these companies.\n\nRead Also: How Nigeria can prosper from its oil and gas riches\n\nSince the past three years, ExxonMobil has been firing senior managers and staff on projects they no longer consider attractive.\n\n\u201cFor almost a year, we went to work unsure if we would have a job the next day,\u201d said a senior staff member who pleaded anonymity, as the company\u2019s policy prohibits him from speaking with the media.\n\nBefore the pandemic, ExxonMobil and some other IOCs offered attractive entitlement packages as they began winding down their operations in Nigeria, but this has since declined.\n\nAt Chevron, workers say they are getting some of their benefits though the massive job cuts are ongoing.\n\nLast year, Chevron Nigeria Limited fired over 1,000 of its Nigerian workforce forcing the Labour Unions, Nigerian Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas workers (NUPENG) and Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) to shut the company\u2019s 220,000 barrel per day operations at the Agbami field.\n\nTo resolve the impasse, Chevron was forced to negotiate compensation packages for staff, which eventually restored things to relative normalcy.\n\nShell and ExxonMobil, sources within the companies say, are taking a page from the same play book. Both companies did not respond to BusinessDay requests for comment.\n\nBusinessDay gathers that these oil companies are on the verge of disengaging thousands of their workforces while also arranging to pawn some of them off to local companies who will employ them as temporary contract staff, therefore denying them the benefits of a full staff.\n\nSome oil and gas industry operators say while it is industry practice to transfer IOC staff working on some projects that were sold to the new owners, it is the responsibility of the IOC to ensure that the staff is equitably treated.\n\nBut this has not always been the case. In the previous round of divestment by Shell in 2010, some of the company\u2019s staff were pawned off to Neconde, a subsidiary of Nestoil who bought some oil fields from Shell, but many were rendered redundant in a matter of months. Some who were retained earned far less and on contract basis, a source close to the company said.\n\nTo forestall this situation, BusinessDay gathers that the staff union at ExxonMobil has dragged the company to the Industrial Court to protect the right of workers to full benefits if they were disengaged after the divestment.\n\nThe erstwhile regulator, the Department of Petroleum Resources, now the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission laid down a procedure by virtue of the Guidelines issued in 1997 and then re-issued in 2005.\n\nAyodele Oni, energy lawyer and partner at Bloomfield law firm, citing the procedure, says the oil company first had to inform the regulator and obtain consent, once it relates to Nigerian staff.\n\n\u201cThe application for termination of their employment must contain their compensation package,\u201d he states.\n\nOnce the regulator gives consent, they must implement the decision of the regulator within 10 days (such decision would include payment of compensation). If this process is not followed, the staff to be terminated could petition the regulator, or approach the National Industrial Court if he is not satisfied.\n\nSome of the staff of these companies say the procedure has not been followed.\n\nPaul Osu, head of the public affairs unit of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission, did not respond to messages seeking confirmation.\n\nRecall that in 2018 some ex-security staff of ExxonMobil also took the company to court to demand their entitlements after they were disengaged. The matter, which went up to the Supreme Court, has since been decided in favour of the former staff and three years after the judgment, ExxonMobil is yet to pay their entitlements.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of being patient since 2018, when most of us worked for ExxonMobil all our lives and have no other means of survival. No pension and no gratuity,\u201d they said in a statement issued in March.\n\nIOCs are selling off their onshore and shallow water assets in the Niger Delta. Some local companies including Seplat, Chappel, among others, have expressed interest and negotiations are ongoing.\n\nShell is leading the pack as it plans to divest all of its operated joint venture (JV) licences held by the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC). This includes a 30 percent interest in 19 oil mining leases (OMLs). Shell is seeking buyers for asset packages in the Eastern, Western and shallow water delta.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 That the Edo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have the temerity to convene a press conference and raise issues about governance and development is not only a slap on the faces of citizens of Edo State, but a sign of selective amnesia.\n\nEdo State, as of today, is perhaps the most peaceful place to live in the entire country with incidences of crime and criminality in the state, over the last three months nearing almost zero, and the APC dares to call for a state of emergency in the state, when it superintends over a federal government under which Nigerian lives are slaughtered and maimed on a daily basis all across Nigeria.\n\nCan Edo APC not see that their call for a state of emergency should be more appropriately directed to a federal government, which they lead, that has reduced the value of Nigerian lives to near nothing?\n\nIn Nigeria today, under the leadership of the APC, which their shameless and ragtag Executive Committee (EXCO) in Edo who addressed the press conference represent, you cannot travel from Abuja to Kaduna; Abuja to Keffi; or from Abuja to Minna, by road, without a seventy percent chance of being attacked, kidnapped or killed by bandits. And yet these palace jesters gather in the safety of Benin City, provided by the excellent leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki and mouth non-existent chaos.\n\nThe APC wants a state of emergency declared in a state that did not only pay salaries and pensions of state government workers by 14th of December, but also released funds to the local governments to ensure that their employees are also paid salaries in time for the yuletide celebrations, while the APC-led Federal Government was struggling to meet their FAAC obligations for the end of year.\n\nDoes the party want a state of emergency in a state where every flight, or bus coming into the state is fully booked with air carriers and road transporters jostling to keep up with the pressure of travellers trooping into the state?\n\nThey want a state of emergency where investments are rolling in large numbers with consortiums setting up tech parks, establishing malls, processing factories, coupled with the expansion of the real estate sector, which are creating job opportunities for youths in the state?\n\nIn Nigeria, it is common knowledge that the level of fidelity and honesty expected from the ilk of politicians that these APC jesters represent is extremely low. It is rather shameful for old men \u2013 grandfathers, for that matter \u2013 to sit comfortably, look into the camera and tell bare-faced lies about the Edo State Judiciary, the state legislature, the newly reconstructed Government Science and Technical College (GSTC), street-lighting project, Edo Tech Park, Edo Innovation Hub, among others.\n\nIt is now apparent that the Edo APC are stuck in the past, refusing to accept the reality that government has evolved and no longer dwell on the anachronistic ideas they are used to when they were in government. Today, the advances in technology deployed in public service administration, basic education reform, youth empowerment, and other areas of technology intervention are too sophisticated for them to comprehend, which is why they have elected to launch these futile attacks.\n\nWe are not surprised by this outburst as it is their stock in trade. Hence, we advise the public to be wary of the antics of the APC, their stale lies and baseless propaganda.\n\nThe PDP-led government in Edo State has and will continue to put the interest of the people over and above the interest of all others.

          "text": "The federal government has disclosed that the major challenge that bedeviled the nation in 2021 was insecurity.\n\nThis is even as the federal government noted that in spite of the security and the usual economic challenges, especially the dwindling resources available to the government, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has availed itself creditably.\n\nMinister of information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who disclosed this in Lagos on Thursday while briefing journalists to showcase the achievements of the Buhari Administration during the outgoing Year 2021, said despite the enormity of the challenges, the nation\u2019s military has continued to live up to their billing.\n\nHe said the nation owes them a debt of gratitude for their patriotism and sacrifice.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2019We just can\u2019t appreciate them enough, as you will soon see when I break down their achievements in the year under review,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nTo keep our country safe, the minister said the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) has set up various operations across the country.\n\n\u2018\u2019These include the Joint Task Force (JTF) North East, tagged Operation HADIN KAI covering the\n\nNorth East region; the JTF SS, tagged Operation DELTA SAFE covering the South South region; the JTF NW, known as Operation HADARIN DAJI\n\ncovering the North West region; Operation SAFE HAVEN covering Plateau, parts of Kaduna and\n\nBauchi States; Operation WHIRL STROKE covering Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba States; JTF SW, referred to as Operation AWATSE and covering\n\nLagos and Ogun States; Operation THUNDER STRIKE covering Abuja-Kaduna Highway and Operation WHIRL PUNCH covering parts of Kaduna State.\n\n\u2018\u2019Gentlemen, in the North East Zone under Operation HADIN KAI, a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic operations, coupled with a review of strategies, led to the neutralization of over 1000 terrorists, rescue of 2000 civilians and the surrender of over 22,000 terrorists including their families.\u2019\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said many arms and ammunition were also recovered.\n\nIn addition to the destruction of several IED/bomb-making factories of the ISWAP/BHT under Operation HADARIN DAJI in the North West, he said the conduct of offensive clearance operations, raids and air operations resulted in the neutralization of about 427 bandits, arrest of 257 bandits, rescue of 897 civilians and recovery of 3,087 livestock.\n\nSimilarly, he stated that Operation WHIRL PUNCH covering parts of Kaduna neutralized about 215 bandits, arrested 133 bandits, rescued 296 civilians and recovered 136 livestock, while Operation THUNDER STRIKE neutralized 36 bandits, arrested 74, rescued 296 civilians and recovered 136 livestock.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019In the North Central, raids and clearance operations conducted by Operation SAFE HAVEN neutralized 91 criminal elements, arrested 155 suspects, rescued 159 civilians and recovered 3,259 livestock.\n\n\u2018\u2019For its part, Operation WHIRL STROKE neutralized 158 criminals, arrested 151 suspects and rescued 183 civilians.\n\n\u2018\u2019Operation DELTA SAFE in the South-South destroyed about 1,520 illegal refineries, confiscated 5,315 storage facilities and impounded 617 boats, amongst other items. Additionally, about 74,297,425 litres of Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK), 41,971,693 litres of crude oil and 88,350 litres of PMS were recovered. Furthermore, 174 trucks and 13 vessels were impounded while 755 illegal oil bunkerers were arrested and 153 assorted weapons recovered.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2019In the South West, patrols and clearance operations by troops of Operation AWATSE led to the arrest of 46 persons for various forms of criminalities while several vehicles, jerricans, motorcycles and electricity generators used for illegal bunkering were seized.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe noted that the effectiveness of the military was enhanced by the leadership provided by President Muhammadu Buhari and the unwavering commitment of the armed forces and its leadership.\n\nMohammed said the procurement of modern platforms for the armed forces has also gone a long way in raising the level of their operational readiness and efficiency, in addition to boosting their capabilities.\n\nDuring the period under review, he said the Nigerian Army procured 160 MRAPS, 150 trucks and 60 APCs to improve its equipment holding.\n\nHe said various kits were equally provided for troops. This is in addition to the provision of accommodation for troops and the recruitment of over 10,000 personnel into the Army.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Nigerian Navy (NN), for its part, commissioned the FALCON EYE Maritime Domain Awareness Capability, the third locally-built Seaward Defense Boat, one helicopter, 4 inshore patrol boats and 90 Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats.\n\n\u2018\u2019Over 1,500 personnel were recruited into the Navy during the year. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) took delivery of 12 Super Tucanos and 3 JF-17 Thunder Fighter Aircraft and other platforms with which it has conducted several Air interdictions, provided close air support to ground troops and destroyed several illegal structures and equipment belonging to terrorists, bandits and other criminal elements,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe said the Armed Forces of Nigeria has also contributed immensely to International peace and security efforts with its robust participation in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the regional initiative, the ECOWAS Military Intervention in Gambia (ECOMIG).\n\nMohammed said the Nigerian military\u2019s continued participation in these Missions has ensured their viability and sustenance towards achieving their military and political goals.\n\nHe continued, \u2018\u2019Overall, the good news is that the military, in spite of its achievements, is not resting on its oars. The Military has assured that it is also poised, in fulfillment of its constitutional duties, to address the myriad of evolving contemporary threats, particularly as the 2023 elections draw nearer.\n\n\u2018\u2019Still on the fight against insecurity, the implementation of the community policing initiative of the current administration has led to the training of 25,000 constabularies in several police colleges\n\nacross the country. The successful officers who were trained on basic police duties, modern intelligence gathering techniques, rule of law, etc. were deployed to their Local Governments of Origin to aid in intelligence gathering and improve police visibility in their communities.\n\n\u2018\u2019Also, in an effort to improve the police/citizens ratio, 418 Cadet officers of regular course 3 were successfully graduated in June 2021 and deployed into the operational asset of the Nigeria Police Force. Through the Police Trust Fund, 200 Buffalo branded vehicles, bulletproof vests, protective helmets, drugs, and medical equipment as well as arms and ammunition, riot control equipment, and combat equipment were procured for the Police Special Weapon and Tactical Squad (SWAT).\n\n\u2018\u2019The Ministry of Police Affairs has also entered into a contract agreement for the supply of police Anti Riot Equipment with Poly Technology of China through a Government-to-Government arrangement at a cost of 44 million U.S. Dollars.\n\n\u2018\u2019These equipment will go a long way in boosting the capacity of the police to control civil unrest in the most efficient and civil manner.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the economy, the Information minister said the recovery of the economy remained on a steady path throughout the year 2021.\n\nHe said many countries around the world face unprecedented challenges, starting from 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Nigeria is no exception.\n\nHe said the Nigerian economy was hit by the pandemic in mid- 2020, and the economic disruptions led to a recession.\n\nThe minister said the poor performance of the economy during the COVID-19 era affected output growth, trade, household welfare and livelihood.\n\nHe, however, said this led to a quick response by the federal government with the rolling out of effective fiscal and monetary policies as well as health-related policies intended to curb the spread of the pandemic and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy.\n\n\u2018\u2019This has yielded considerable results. For example, the country\u2019s domestic growth in the first three quarters of 2021 was positive, recording real GDP of 0.51 percent in Q1, 5.01 percent in Q2 and 4.03 percent in Q3 2021, This was an improvement from a declining performance in the first three quarters of 2020 (which led to economic recession) put at 1.87 percent in Q1, -6.10 percent in Q2 and -3.62 percent in Q3 2020,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nNevertheless, Mohammed said the fourth quarter 2020 recorded a slight improvement of 0.11 percent, ushering in positive growth rates in the three quarters of 2021.\n\n\u2018\u2019This economic performance in 2021 shows a steady improvement in growth over the last three quarters of 2020, and this can be attributed to government policies and strategies such as the Economic Sustainability Plan; the N500 billion COVID 19 Crisis Intervention Fund etc.\n\n\u2018\u2019In the oil sector, real growth shows poorer performance in 2021, recording 2.21% (year-on-year) in Q1 2021, -12.65% in Q2 2021 and \u201310.73% in Q3 2021, from stronger growth of 5.06% in Q1 2020, -6.63% in Q2 2020, and -13.89% in Q3 2020,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn the oil and gas sector, he said undoubtedly it is one of the greatest achievements of the current administration in 2021 describing it as a sector very critical to the nation\u2019s economic well-being.\n\nHe said the passage and signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) is a landmark achievement.\n\nHe said many have described it as the most profound event in the Nigerian oil and gas space in the last 20 years.\n\n\u2018\u2019The PIA is envisaged to foster investment in the industry and delineate responsibilities to the various institutions. Its key objectives are: to establish a commercialized National Oil Company (NNPC Ltd.)\n\n\u2018\u2019To entrench accountability and good governance; to promote the exploration and exploitation of the petroleum resources in Nigeria for the benefit of all Nigerians as well as foster the sustainable development of the host communities,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOverall, he said the PIA serves to ensure the efficient and effective technical and operational regulation of the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the oil industry through the formation of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, among others.\n\nOn infrastructure, he said the current administration has distinguished itself in the provision of key infrastructures in the works and housing, which according to him is important to the growth and development of the economy.\n\nIn its efforts to provide basic infrastructure, especially roads and housing, he said the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing carried out the following projects in 2021.\n\n\u2018\u2019(I) Nnewi-Uduma Road, Sections I and II (26.27km) in Enugu and Ebonyi States\n\n\u2018\u2019(II) Kano-Maiduguri Road Section II (100.08KM),\n\n(Shuwarin-Azare) in Jigawa and Bauchi States\n\n\u2018\u2019(III)\n\nKano-Maiduguri Road Section III (Azare-Potiskum). 106.34km in Bauchi and Yobe States\n\n\u2018\u2019(IV)\n\nVandeikya-Obudu Cattle Ranch Road Phase I and II (24km) in Benue and Cross River States\n\n\u2018\u2019(V) Sokoto-Tambuwal-Jega-Kontagora-Makera Road (304km).\u2019\u2019\n\non water resources, he said some 159 Rural Water Supply Schemes were constructed in the North-East, IDP camps and some Federal Institutions and Establishments by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources in the year under review.\n\n\u2018\u2019In addition to the completion of 12 dams, the Ministry also embarked on the implementation of the Partnership for Expanded Water Sanitation\n\nand Hygiene (PEWASH) programmes with the construction of 926 rural water supply schemes in 12 States of Imo, Katsina, Jigawa, Plateau, Zamfara, Sokoto, Ondo, Osun, Delta, Bauchi, Kaduna and Gombe States,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\non National Social Investment Programmes (NSIP), he said the Federal Government has continued to implement the National Social Investment Programmes.\n\nOn the directive of Mr. President, he said the N-Power has been expanded from 500,000 to 1 million beneficiaries.\n\nHe said the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) has been restructured to GEEP 2.0. The revamped GEEP 2.0 was officially launched on 24 August 2021 and has successfully registered over 600,000 potential beneficiaries in all the 774 LGAs nationwide through a collaborative partnership with the National Orientation Agency.\n\nHe also noted that the transportation sector definitely the most outstanding achievement in the transportation sector in 2021 is the flag-off of the commercial operation of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line in June 2021 by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said the trains are currently conveying goods and\n\nservices and reducing traffic and human pressure on infrastructural facilities on the Lagos-Ibadan highway.\n\n\u2018\u2019Then there was the ground-breaking ceremony for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Eastern Narrow Gauge Railway project and the Bonny Deep Sea and Railway Industrial Park,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nConclusively, he said the current administration, in spite of daunting challenges, made tremendous progress in 2021 in fighting insecurity, growing the economy, reforming the oil sector to spur more investments.",

          "text": "The federal government has disclosed that the major challenge that bedeviled the nation in 2021 was insecurity.\n\nThis is even as the federal government noted that in spite of the security and the usual economic challenges, especially the dwindling resources available to the government, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has availed itself creditably.\n\nMinister of information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who disclosed this in Lagos on Thursday while briefing journalists to showcase the achievements of the Buhari Administration during the outgoing Year 2021, said despite the enormity of the challenges, the nation\u2019s military has continued to live up to their billing.\n\nHe said the nation owes them a debt of gratitude for their patriotism and sacrifice.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2019We just can\u2019t appreciate them enough, as you will soon see when I break down their achievements in the year under review,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nTo keep our country safe, the minister said the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) has set up various operations across the country.\n\n\u2018\u2019These include the Joint Task Force (JTF) North East, tagged Operation HADIN KAI covering the\n\nNorth East region; the JTF SS, tagged Operation DELTA SAFE covering the South South region; the JTF NW, known as Operation HADARIN DAJI\n\ncovering the North West region; Operation SAFE HAVEN covering Plateau, parts of Kaduna and\n\nBauchi States; Operation WHIRL STROKE covering Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba States; JTF SW, referred to as Operation AWATSE and covering\n\nLagos and Ogun States; Operation THUNDER STRIKE covering Abuja-Kaduna Highway and Operation WHIRL PUNCH covering parts of Kaduna State.\n\n\u2018\u2019Gentlemen, in the North East Zone under Operation HADIN KAI, a combination of kinetic and non-kinetic operations, coupled with a review of strategies, led to the neutralization of over 1000 terrorists, rescue of 2000 civilians and the surrender of over 22,000 terrorists including their families.\u2019\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said many arms and ammunition were also recovered.\n\nIn addition to the destruction of several IED/bomb-making factories of the ISWAP/BHT under Operation HADARIN DAJI in the North West, he said the conduct of offensive clearance operations, raids and air operations resulted in the neutralization of about 427 bandits, arrest of 257 bandits, rescue of 897 civilians and recovery of 3,087 livestock.\n\nSimilarly, he stated that Operation WHIRL PUNCH covering parts of Kaduna neutralized about 215 bandits, arrested 133 bandits, rescued 296 civilians and recovered 136 livestock, while Operation THUNDER STRIKE neutralized 36 bandits, arrested 74, rescued 296 civilians and recovered 136 livestock.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019In the North Central, raids and clearance operations conducted by Operation SAFE HAVEN neutralized 91 criminal elements, arrested 155 suspects, rescued 159 civilians and recovered 3,259 livestock.\n\n\u2018\u2019For its part, Operation WHIRL STROKE neutralized 158 criminals, arrested 151 suspects and rescued 183 civilians.\n\n\u2018\u2019Operation DELTA SAFE in the South-South destroyed about 1,520 illegal refineries, confiscated 5,315 storage facilities and impounded 617 boats, amongst other items. Additionally, about 74,297,425 litres of Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK), 41,971,693 litres of crude oil and 88,350 litres of PMS were recovered. Furthermore, 174 trucks and 13 vessels were impounded while 755 illegal oil bunkerers were arrested and 153 assorted weapons recovered.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2019In the South West, patrols and clearance operations by troops of Operation AWATSE led to the arrest of 46 persons for various forms of criminalities while several vehicles, jerricans, motorcycles and electricity generators used for illegal bunkering were seized.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe noted that the effectiveness of the military was enhanced by the leadership provided by President Muhammadu Buhari and the unwavering commitment of the armed forces and its leadership.\n\nMohammed said the procurement of modern platforms for the armed forces has also gone a long way in raising the level of their operational readiness and efficiency, in addition to boosting their capabilities.\n\nDuring the period under review, he said the Nigerian Army procured 160 MRAPS, 150 trucks and 60 APCs to improve its equipment holding.\n\nHe said various kits were equally provided for troops. This is in addition to the provision of accommodation for troops and the recruitment of over 10,000 personnel into the Army.\n\n\u2018\u2019The Nigerian Navy (NN), for its part, commissioned the FALCON EYE Maritime Domain Awareness Capability, the third locally-built Seaward Defense Boat, one helicopter, 4 inshore patrol boats and 90 Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats.\n\n\u2018\u2019Over 1,500 personnel were recruited into the Navy during the year. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) took delivery of 12 Super Tucanos and 3 JF-17 Thunder Fighter Aircraft and other platforms with which it has conducted several Air interdictions, provided close air support to ground troops and destroyed several illegal structures and equipment belonging to terrorists, bandits and other criminal elements,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe said the Armed Forces of Nigeria has also contributed immensely to International peace and security efforts with its robust participation in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the regional initiative, the ECOWAS Military Intervention in Gambia (ECOMIG).\n\nMohammed said the Nigerian military\u2019s continued participation in these Missions has ensured their viability and sustenance towards achieving their military and political goals.\n\nHe continued, \u2018\u2019Overall, the good news is that the military, in spite of its achievements, is not resting on its oars. The Military has assured that it is also poised, in fulfillment of its constitutional duties, to address the myriad of evolving contemporary threats, particularly as the 2023 elections draw nearer.\n\n\u2018\u2019Still on the fight against insecurity, the implementation of the community policing initiative of the current administration has led to the training of 25,000 constabularies in several police colleges\n\nacross the country. The successful officers who were trained on basic police duties, modern intelligence gathering techniques, rule of law, etc. were deployed to their Local Governments of Origin to aid in intelligence gathering and improve police visibility in their communities.\n\n\u2018\u2019Also, in an effort to improve the police/citizens ratio, 418 Cadet officers of regular course 3 were successfully graduated in June 2021 and deployed into the operational asset of the Nigeria Police Force. Through the Police Trust Fund, 200 Buffalo branded vehicles, bulletproof vests, protective helmets, drugs, and medical equipment as well as arms and ammunition, riot control equipment, and combat equipment were procured for the Police Special Weapon and Tactical Squad (SWAT).\n\n\u2018\u2019The Ministry of Police Affairs has also entered into a contract agreement for the supply of police Anti Riot Equipment with Poly Technology of China through a Government-to-Government arrangement at a cost of 44 million U.S. Dollars.\n\n\u2018\u2019These equipment will go a long way in boosting the capacity of the police to control civil unrest in the most efficient and civil manner.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the economy, the Information minister said the recovery of the economy remained on a steady path throughout the year 2021.\n\nHe said many countries around the world face unprecedented challenges, starting from 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and Nigeria is no exception.\n\nHe said the Nigerian economy was hit by the pandemic in mid- 2020, and the economic disruptions led to a recession.\n\nThe minister said the poor performance of the economy during the COVID-19 era affected output growth, trade, household welfare and livelihood.\n\nHe, however, said this led to a quick response by the federal government with the rolling out of effective fiscal and monetary policies as well as health-related policies intended to curb the spread of the pandemic and mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy.\n\n\u2018\u2019This has yielded considerable results. For example, the country\u2019s domestic growth in the first three quarters of 2021 was positive, recording real GDP of 0.51 percent in Q1, 5.01 percent in Q2 and 4.03 percent in Q3 2021, This was an improvement from a declining performance in the first three quarters of 2020 (which led to economic recession) put at 1.87 percent in Q1, -6.10 percent in Q2 and -3.62 percent in Q3 2020,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nNevertheless, Mohammed said the fourth quarter 2020 recorded a slight improvement of 0.11 percent, ushering in positive growth rates in the three quarters of 2021.\n\n\u2018\u2019This economic performance in 2021 shows a steady improvement in growth over the last three quarters of 2020, and this can be attributed to government policies and strategies such as the Economic Sustainability Plan; the N500 billion COVID 19 Crisis Intervention Fund etc.\n\n\u2018\u2019In the oil sector, real growth shows poorer performance in 2021, recording 2.21% (year-on-year) in Q1 2021, -12.65% in Q2 2021 and \u201310.73% in Q3 2021, from stronger growth of 5.06% in Q1 2020, -6.63% in Q2 2020, and -13.89% in Q3 2020,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn the oil and gas sector, he said undoubtedly it is one of the greatest achievements of the current administration in 2021 describing it as a sector very critical to the nation\u2019s economic well-being.\n\nHe said the passage and signing into law of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) is a landmark achievement.\n\nHe said many have described it as the most profound event in the Nigerian oil and gas space in the last 20 years.\n\n\u2018\u2019The PIA is envisaged to foster investment in the industry and delineate responsibilities to the various institutions. Its key objectives are: to establish a commercialized National Oil Company (NNPC Ltd.)\n\n\u2018\u2019To entrench accountability and good governance; to promote the exploration and exploitation of the petroleum resources in Nigeria for the benefit of all Nigerians as well as foster the sustainable development of the host communities,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOverall, he said the PIA serves to ensure the efficient and effective technical and operational regulation of the upstream, midstream and downstream sectors of the oil industry through the formation of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, among others.\n\nOn infrastructure, he said the current administration has distinguished itself in the provision of key infrastructures in the works and housing, which according to him is important to the growth and development of the economy.\n\nIn its efforts to provide basic infrastructure, especially roads and housing, he said the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing carried out the following projects in 2021.\n\n\u2018\u2019(I) Nnewi-Uduma Road, Sections I and II (26.27km) in Enugu and Ebonyi States\n\n\u2018\u2019(II) Kano-Maiduguri Road Section II (100.08KM),\n\n(Shuwarin-Azare) in Jigawa and Bauchi States\n\n\u2018\u2019(III)\n\nKano-Maiduguri Road Section III (Azare-Potiskum). 106.34km in Bauchi and Yobe States\n\n\u2018\u2019(IV)\n\nVandeikya-Obudu Cattle Ranch Road Phase I and II (24km) in Benue and Cross River States\n\n\u2018\u2019(V) Sokoto-Tambuwal-Jega-Kontagora-Makera Road (304km).\u2019\u2019\n\non water resources, he said some 159 Rural Water Supply Schemes were constructed in the North-East, IDP camps and some Federal Institutions and Establishments by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources in the year under review.\n\n\u2018\u2019In addition to the completion of 12 dams, the Ministry also embarked on the implementation of the Partnership for Expanded Water Sanitation\n\nand Hygiene (PEWASH) programmes with the construction of 926 rural water supply schemes in 12 States of Imo, Katsina, Jigawa, Plateau, Zamfara, Sokoto, Ondo, Osun, Delta, Bauchi, Kaduna and Gombe States,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\non National Social Investment Programmes (NSIP), he said the Federal Government has continued to implement the National Social Investment Programmes.\n\nOn the directive of Mr. President, he said the N-Power has been expanded from 500,000 to 1 million beneficiaries.\n\nHe said the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) has been restructured to GEEP 2.0. The revamped GEEP 2.0 was officially launched on 24 August 2021 and has successfully registered over 600,000 potential beneficiaries in all the 774 LGAs nationwide through a collaborative partnership with the National Orientation Agency.\n\nHe also noted that the transportation sector definitely the most outstanding achievement in the transportation sector in 2021 is the flag-off of the commercial operation of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail line in June 2021 by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said the trains are currently conveying goods and\n\nservices and reducing traffic and human pressure on infrastructural facilities on the Lagos-Ibadan highway.\n\n\u2018\u2019Then there was the ground-breaking ceremony for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Eastern Narrow Gauge Railway project and the Bonny Deep Sea and Railway Industrial Park,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nConclusively, he said the current administration, in spite of daunting challenges, made tremendous progress in 2021 in fighting insecurity, growing the economy, reforming the oil sector to spur more investments.",

Look at how people are celebrating the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu, but here people tag you as an enemy of the government,\u201d said Kukah who added that at nearly 70 years, nobody can stop him from telling the truth.\n\nKukah also endorsed the refusal of the President to assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, noting that political parties should be given the chance of how they will select candidates for election.\n\nThe Cleric therefore advised the National Assembly to remove the section related to direct or indirect primaries in the Amendment Bill so that the the president can assent to the bill.",

          "text": "At the State House in Abuja, President Muhammadu Buhari and former President Goodluck Jonathan are currently meeting.\n\nOn Thursday about 3 p.m., Jonathan arrived at the Presidential Villa.\n\nHowever, as of press time, the reason of his visit was unknown.\n\nJonathan may have paid a visit to the White House to advise President Obama on his work as ECOWAS Chief Mediator in Mali, according to reports.\n\nMeanwhile, there were indications that Jonathan was planning to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) (PDP).\n\nAccording to SaharaReporters, the APC cabal loyal to President Muhammadu Buhari was eager to get Jonathan into the party for a variety of reasons, including to stymie the presidential ambitions of the party\u2019s national head, Bola Tinubu, who is eyeing the presidency in 2023.\n\nIn September 2021, a top source told SaharaReporters that Buhari had begun courting Jonathan in order to pull him into the APC and have him run for president and succeed him.\n\nAccording to the source, the Presidency cabal wants Jonathan to be the next president because they feel he will not probe Buhari\u2019s regime\u2019s misdeeds.\n\nJonathan is also rumored to be pursuing a presidential bid to serve two terms in office, something the APC denied him in the 2015 presidential election.\n\nHe has apparently consented to play the game, despite his weak chances in the PDP for 2023, thanks to former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar\u2019s wealth and connections.\n\nIn the 2019 presidential election, Atiku was the PDP\u2019s presidential candidate.\n\nDespite the fact that Atiku has not to declare his candidacy, he appears to be testing the waters, as several support groups for his 2023 ambition have already surfaced.\n\nJonathan is particularly cautious of the threat posed by the ambitions of the governors of Sokoto and Rivers states, Aminu Tambuwal and Nyesom Wike, who are rumored to be mulling a combined ticket, according to the source.\n\nJonathan, on the other hand, is reported to have been granted certain criteria by Buhari\u2019s cabal, which have yet to be fully met, resulting in his delay in joining the ruling party.",

He must understand that we are a country of diversity with the different persuasions, traditional, cultural, religious and all of these must be put at a place where you can understand and respect them.\n\n\u201cThat individual must also be somebody who is ready to accommodate the youths of this country because turning it into a slogan the fact that youths are our leaders of our future have bit sever us correctly because we are drifting into an age that youths understand which many people may not understand, those who grew up before this era.\n\n\u201cSo, that people must be willing to accommodate the youth without necessarily throwing away very experienced ones, he must be able to find a labyrinth of all the interests.\n\n\u201cHe must also reflect an extreme women agenda. Such a must also be in investor-friendly, he must be and individual who understands the nuances of economics and what is the relationship between international politics and economy and the person must be strong enough to face up to the issue on the front burner, which is security.\n\n\u201cHe must be able to create jobs, he must be able to not deploy the kinetic device all the time, he must able to also listen and negotiate peace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian and religion believes that you seek peace and you will find it. So, that which you seek is not commonplace. So, must be able to dredge up courage to listen to one another and then find a middle course all the time for the interest of our people.\n\n\u201cWhat the political parties need to do. Well, the political parties need to be sensitive to the feelings of the various contending ground because politics should not be a winners take all thing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all times that you want to use your might, at times you listen even to those whom you think are weak or those whom you think may not be able to find themselves at the centre stage due to circumstances.\n\n\u201cBecause of you don\u2019t do that, you will bottle up sentiments that will implode the system going forward. So, you must be able to create ventilations from here and there so that you can accommodate diverse opinions and have strategies to help you run the country.\n\n\u201cSo, all the political parties should be alive to this sentiments and feelings in taking decisions going forward. And we are at a critical point in our history and anything that is self-serving, anything that is selfish, anything that is leads to winner take all mentality should be jettisoned at this time. We need to rescue our nation; we need to work hard to put Nigeria in a strong footing before we can begin to look at other things.\n\n\u201cSo, if we have this at the back of our minds, my thinking is that we will arrive at the fact that there is a geo-political zone that has been clamoring and yearning for an opportunity to lead.\n\n\u201cAnd we should be gracious and magnanimous enough to give consideration to such yearnings and aspiration.\n\n\u201cBut as I said earlier it cannot not be done in isolation. It\u2019s not a matter right, it\u2019s not a matter of \u2018I have to.\u2019 It\u2019s a matter of negotiation, conversation and discussion going forward.\n\n\u201cAnd I think Nigeria is alive to all of that. We can find people who listen,\u201d Governor Ikpeazu enunciated.\n\nHe emphasized that he is not interested in the presidency, noting that he is very busy as governor and \u201cthinking about what I will become now will amount to shortchanging my people who gave me a mandate for an initial four years and renewed it for another four years and it will terminate around May 2023\u201d.\n\nAccording to Ikpeazu, it will be self-serving for him to begin to think about what he will become instead of concentrating on serving his people for the period which he has been elected to serve.",
          "summary": "\u201cThe question of Nigeria president of southeast extraction is a national question that required negotiation, discussion, and conversation with all parts of this country and I am least qualified to determine what happened in 2023.\n\u201cWhat the political parties need to do.\nWell, the political parties need to be sensitive to the feelings of the various contending ground because politics should not be a winners take all thing.\n\u201cSo, all the political parties should be alive to this sentiments and feelings in taking decisions going forward.\n\u201cAnd I think Nigeria is alive to all of that.",

          "text": "At a projected 1.86 million barrels daily oil production in the country\u2019s 2021 budget, Nigeria recorded a huge deficit of almost 200 million barrels in the first 11 months of this year.\n\nThis was largely due to the rising cases of crude oil theft, ageing infrastructure, challenges associated with host communities, under investment, and poor security in the waterways.\n\nFigures from the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Petroleum Commission (NURPC) obtained by THISDAY, indicated that while Nigeria was expected to pump approximately 635 million barrels of oil by November this year, it struggled to produce only 441 million barrels in the period.\n\nMany oil companies are reporting huge losses, sometimes up to 80 per cent of production in the pipelines. \u201cWhen they pump through the pipelines, they only get about 20 per cent of product and the rest lost to pipeline breaches and organised theft. The 20 percent hardly covers cost of production,\u201d an industry expert explained.\n\nSome of the operators essentially, identified security as a core issue for the oil companies as product losses through the pipelines are now so massive that it is affecting their bottomline and the country\u2019s revenue projection from crude oil export. Huge quantities of products are daily stolen by individuals and organised cartels of criminals.\n\nThe Navy and other security agencies that are supposed to protect the waterways and the companies\u2019 operations are either looking the other way, or colluding with syndicates of oil criminals to steal this all-important national resource. It is now a huge and thriving business at the expense of the country.\n\nThis is part of the reason many major oil companies are divesting from the country. To prevent this huge losses to the oil companies, they have largely resorted to using barges to transport oil and the process of building barges and allowing their usage by the government is huge and cumbersome. The cost element to that is; it dramatically increases cost of production to these companies\n\nThis year has been a big disappointment for the industry in Nigeria in terms of matching production with market demand as efforts to meet its almost 1.7 million barrels per day allocation had produced little result.\n\nNigeria, going by the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was expected to produce 1.683 million bpd in January 2022. However, meeting that target would be an uphill task as it has maintained an average of 1.25 million barrels in the last few months.\n\nAn analysis of the data from the regulatory commission indicated that aside its condensates production, which averaged 300,000 barrels daily, the country, through the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and its Joint Venture (JV) partners, pumped far below its forecast for the commodity for the period.\n\nThis was in contrast to last year, when the country was producing 1.7 million barrels per day on the average, except when OPEC compelled its members to cut their production in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEven then, NNPC and its partners pumped almost 1.4 million barrels daily, but that figure has slumped since the August 2021.\n\nThe NURPC data detailing crude production so far this year showed that the country only managed to pump 1.23 million barrels per day in August, 1.24 million barrels per day in September, 1.22 million barrels per day in October, and 1.27 million barrels per day in November.\n\nOn a monthly basis, the figures further revealed a decline from January as production was 42.1 million barrels for that month; in February it was 39.8 million barrels while in March, Nigeria pumped 44.2 million barrels, a relatively good month compared to the rest.\n\nBut April saw the country produce 41.1 million barrels; it was 41.6 million barrels in May; 39.4 million barrels in June; 41 million barrels in July, before it began a downward spiral till now.\n\nIn addition, 38.4 million barrels were pumped from around 30 Nigeria\u2019s terminals and streams in August, 37.4 million barrels in September, 38 million barrels in October and 38.2 million barrels in November.\n\nThe unimpressive production figures have also negatively affected NNPC\u2019s remittances to the federation account and by extension the monies shared by the federal, state and local governments this year.\n\nFor example with a paltry N10.54 billion in November, NNPC was only able to remit 8.5 per cent of its projected N122.7 billion to the Federation Account, a joint pool of funds shared by the country\u2019s three tiers of government.\n\nAside April this year, when the national oil company paid in nothing into the federation account, the November remittance represented the second least payment for the year.\n\nThe information on the proceeds of the NNPC\u2019s sales of crude oil and gas and subsequent contribution to the account was contained in its presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for the month of December 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the N10.5 billion represented a 29.1 per cent decline of the monthly contribution, which has steadily declined in the past three months due to a variety of factors, including under-production and petrol subsidy payments.\n\nIn addition, while a total of N2.30 trillion was supposed to have been paid to the federal, state and local governments in the first 11 months of 2021, only N522.2 billion had been paid as of November.\n\nThe NNPC data showed that the continuous deficit payment had so far resulted in a shortfall of N1.78 trillion in the current year.\n\nHowever, the national oil company blamed the inability to restart the oil wells shut down in 2020 when OPEC compelled member countries to cut production for the declining production.\n\nAdded to that, it listed issues with host communities, vandalism, incessant force majeure on major assets, as well as technical issues leading to shutdowns.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that ageing upstream infrastructure due to years of under-investment remained a major headwind confronting the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate document released by the upstream commission showed that out of Nigeria\u2019s 53 oilrigs, only 12 had been near active in the last few months, while 25 are on standby and 16 have been stacked.\n\nIn terms of terrain, of the 53 rigs, 33 are onshore, 11 are offshore, while nine were found in the swamps.\n\nWhile a stacked rig means the ones which may or may not be operable, but which are stored and have no crews, an active rig count, is an official listing of operational oil and gas rigs in a certain area.\n\nIn the oil industry, the rig count is a major index of measuring activities in the upstream sector.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Buhari Receives Manufacturers, Promises Access to Forex",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has assured manufacturers in the country that the federal government would take appropriate measures to improve access to foreign exchange (forex) for importation of raw materials and machines that are not readily available locally. Buhari gave the assurance on Wednesday, in response to a request by the leadership of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).\n\nMAN had, during an advocacy visit to State House, Abuja, appealed to the government to take steps to ensure that the real sector contributed more to the Nigerian economy.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Nigerian Association Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), and some experts blamed the rising volume of Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit on the inability of the government to enforce its policy on consumption of locally manufactured goods.\n\nBuhari told the MAN executive that the relevant ministry would revisit their concerns about the increase in excise duties on some identified products and other tariff-related matters.\n\nOn the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the president said Nigeria would fast-track the process of setting up the Designated Competent Authority that would superintend the administration of Rules of Origin and Commission as well as the automation of issuance of electronic Certificate of Origin.\n\nHe said the federal government would also ensure that relevant platforms were established for monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the Ease of Doing Business and improve government patronage of made in Nigeria products.\n\nBuhari told the MAN delegation, \u201cOur strategic plan to boost manufacturing activities in the country is on course. We will continue to improve the patronage of locally made goods, bridge the gap between skills required by industry and those provided by our tertiary institutions, and ensure seamless access to long term finance for our Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs).\n\n\u201cWe recognise that MAN remains a key stakeholder in this journey and we will continue our engagement with you.\u201d\n\nStressing his belief in a private sector-led economy as an elixir for job creation, Buhari urged the leadership of MAN to continue to encourage manufacturers in the country. He said the government recognised the resilience of their members and other private sector organisations in promoting a virile manufacturing sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI beseech you to continue to support the government in our quest to provide the appropriate environment that will attract the necessary investment, both domestic and foreign, for the upliftment of the nation\u2019s economy,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president noted that while the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on the economy, with the attendant fluctuations in the prices of oil, his administration successfully contained the spread of the virus and other diseases.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government would continue to consistently deploy prudent means of judiciously utilising its limited revenue to sustain the economy and stimulate growth.\n\nBuhari emphasised that in spite of limited resources, his government had made appreciable progress in road and rail infrastructure development; provision of stimulus packages for the manufacturing sector; improvement in energy management; and support for exporters with a view to improving the operating environment for businesses in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThese projects are there for all to see. Furthermore, we are vigorously pursuing reforms on ease of doing business and currently putting in place other necessary policy measures and incentives that will guarantee full recovery from the consequences of COVID-19, sustain economic development and further shield the economy from the potential impact of fluctuations in the price of crude oil in the global market.\n\n\u201cI have listened carefully to all the challenges enumerated by the president of MAN and would like to assure you that, like we have done in the recent past, we will give consideration to some of the constraints that are yet to be fully addressed, especially those that align with our policies and programmes for economic recovery and sustainable development.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that this administration is fully aware that the survival of Nigeria lies in agriculture and having a viable domestic manufacturing sector. I must emphasise here that when I say agriculture, I also refer to agro-allied business, which is the value-added component in the value chain.\u201d\n\nAccording to the president, a strong manufacturing sector creates more jobs and wealth for the citizens.\n\n\u201cIt will usher in sustainable economic prosperity because we will produce what we consume as a nation and generate foreign exchange by exporting surpluses and by import substitution,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in her remarks, Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mariam Katagum, stressed that the ministry would continue to work with MAN in the areas of policy, trade and creation of an environment that would facilitate the growth of businesses in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMAN is in business to create a climate of opinion in this country so that manufacturers can operate efficiently and profitably for the benefit of all,\u201d she said.\n\nMAN president, Mansur Ahmed, said the advocacy visit was basically to thank the president for all the support extended to the manufacturing sector since his assumption of office in 2015, and seek further support for the sector to overcome constraints to competitive manufacturing in the country.\n\nAhmed articulated remedies to the challenges of the sector, and spoke on the Blueprint for Accelerated Development of Manufacturing in Nigeria, which will be formally presented to Buhari in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe MAN leadership identified some challenges that could be addressed in the immediate term to improve the manufacturing environment. They include, according to him, inadequate supply of foreign exchange, inadequate electricity supply, poor access to long-term fund, poor patronage of Made-in-Nigeria goods and local content development, and looming increases in tax rates.\n\nNACCIMA, Analysts List Measures to Reverse Nigeria\u2019s Trade Deficit\n\nMeanwhile, NACCIMA and some experts attributed the country\u2019s rising trade deficit to the inability of the government to enforce its policy on the consumption of locally manufactured goods. They also blamed the trade deficit on Nigeria\u2019s over reliance on imported refined petroleum products and the weak non-oil sector.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated that Nigeria recorded N3.03 trillion trade deficit in the third quarter of 2021. Nigeria\u2019s total foreign trade grew to N13.3 trillion in the third quarter of 2021, and was made up of N8.2 trillion imports and N5.1 trillion exports.\n\nReacting to the negative trade balance, Director General of NACCIMA, Mr. Ayo Olukanni, said in an interview with THISDAY that the association had used every opportunity since the beginning of the year to raise the alarm about the country\u2019s growing trade deficit. Olukanni pointed out that the trend was also responsible for the perennial weakness of the naira against the dollar and some other international currencies.\n\nOlukanni said, \u201cWe observed the growing gap between import and export, which was also reflected in the pressure on the naira and loss of its value in the forex market. It is, therefore, not surprising that we are ending up with these figures as trade deficit in the third quarter of year 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the fact that we have not rigorously implemented our policies to truly consume what we produce and produce what we consume. Must we always import champagne and wines of all make from all corners of the world to celebrate Christmas and the New Year? We have the capacity to produce most of what we import. We should, therefore, put a stop to importation of such categories of goods, such as textile, canned food, and drinks.\n\n\u201cAs we look forward to year 2022, we must rigorously pursue our policies, especially as envisioned in the national budget for 2022, to reduce importation and improve on our nonoil export.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the need to address the well-known infrastructure challenges in the country, saying, \u201cWe must empower our local industries to significantly improve their productive capacity to meet local needs. In this respect, our new national policies on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which include micro enterprises, deserve attention and more support as Year 2022 rolls in.\n\n\u201cThe objective should be to reduce importation of goods as we concertedly work to reduce and even end our trade deficit. Year 2022 is an opportunity for us to truly walk the talk as a less import dependent country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, an economist and Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, stated that current trade balance deficit of N3 trillion, as reported by the NBS for the third quarter of this year, represented an increase of 26.5 per cent on year-on-year comparative analysis.\n\nYusuf noted that the huge import bill on refined petroleum products and the weak competitiveness of the country\u2019s non-oil economy were major contributory factors to the unfavourable balance of trade position.\n\nHe said the balance of trade position of the country could be addressed by giving exporters unfettered and unconditional access to their foreign exchange proceeds.\n\nYusuf said, \u201cWe need to create a fast track for exporters at the ports. If we can have fast track for imports, it is even more imperative that we have a fast track for export. Meanwhile, export processes remain very frustrating at our ports. The shipping companies and the terminal operators do not accord the desired priority to export. This should change.\n\n\u201cTerminal operators and shipping companies should be compelled to prioritise export. For most of them, export is not in serious reckoning in their operations.\u201d\n\nYusuf, who is the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also stated that government should provide access to intermediate inputs on concessionary terms to exporters in order to make their exports competitive both in quality and price.\n\nSimilarly, Chief Executive Officer of De-SME Facilitators Limited, Mr. Tony Chinwe, identified the sharp drop in the non-oil export and a huge increase in the aggregate import value as major causes of Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit.\n\nChinwe said the drop in the value of non-oil exports \u201ccan be traced to a rapid drop in the value and volume of agricultural and agro-processed export products due to insecurity challenges that disrupted farming activities and increased economics of production for farmers.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAlso, the twin effects of COVID-19 and insecurity have seen the nation spending huge sums on the importation of medical consumables, vaccines, food items, sanitary/hygiene products and military equipment to combat both menace. These have significantly increased the aggregate import bill of the nation.\u201d\n\nHe recommended that the government should diversify the export base of the economy by creating an enabling environment for the private sector to drive the process.\n\nChinwe stated, \u201cSome of the sectors that should be given boost in this regard are petroleum and petro-chemical industry products, food products, auto and auto-parts, cotton-textile-garment products, foot wears and packaging materials.\n\n\u201cWe, as a nation, have the comparative advantage in these areas. If government provides the enabling environment, we can be a net exporter of these products.\n\n\u201cWe should domesticate and develop petroleum value chain to save the foreign exchange spent in importing them and even export the excess to generate foreign exchange revenue; ditto for the food and agriculture value chain.\u201d\n\nChinwe stated that the interventions required from government to reverse in the country\u2019s trade deficit included the \u201ccreation of viable industrial parks and clusters with captive power, security and other shared services where business entities that are involved in manufacturing and agro-processing can take up work spaces.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cthe Bank of Agriculture (BOA) should be restructured, recapitalised and re-engineered to prepare it for a major role in financing agribusinesses along agriculture value chain,\u201d while the \u201cbottleneck that stifle export processing in Nigeria should be removed.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos",
          "summary": "He said the government recognised the resilience of their members and other private sector organisations in promoting a virile manufacturing sector in Nigeria.\n\u201cLet me assure you that this administration is fully aware that the survival of Nigeria lies in agriculture and having a viable domestic manufacturing sector.\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated that Nigeria recorded N3.03 trillion trade deficit in the third quarter of 2021.\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that we are ending up with these figures as trade deficit in the third quarter of year 2021.\n\u201cThe objective should be to reduce importation of goods as we concertedly work to reduce and even end our trade deficit.",

          "text": "The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), one of the leading philanthropies empowering young African entrepreneurs across all 54 African countries, has opened applications for its 2022 TEF Entrepreneurship Programme on www.TEFConnect.com.\n\nAccording to a statement yesterday, African entrepreneurs with business ideas or existing businesses under five years, are encouraged to apply now for $5000 seed capital, mentorship, business management training, among others in the 2022 entrepreneurship programme\n\nIt stated that, \u201csince 2015, the TEF Entrepreneurship Programme \u2013 the only African-funded entrepreneurship catalyst of its kind \u2013 has empowered 15,847 African entrepreneurs with non-returnable seed capital of $5,000 each; 12 weeks of business management training; access to experienced mentors; and membership to Africa\u2019s largest entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, the Tony Elumelu Foundation disbursed $24.75 million to 5,000 African entrepreneurs across Africa for its 2021 Entrepreneurship Programme. The Foundation\u2019s Entrepreneurship Programme remains one of the largest private sector responses to driving the economic recovery of African youth, women and SMEs given the effects of the covid19 pandemic across Africa.\n\n\u201cAcross Africa, the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme beneficiaries are starting and growing trailblazing businesses that have collectively created over 400,000 direct and indirect jobs.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the launch of the 2022 TEF Entrepreneurship Programme, the CEO of the Foundation, Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu said: \u201cWe are constantly blown away by the quality of businesses that come from Africa every year. This motivates us to scale our efforts to empower even more entrepreneurs on continent.\n\n\u201cThe innovation, knowledge and resilience of African entrepreneurs is central to charting Africa\u2019s socio-economic transformation and meet the continent\u2019s development objectives. We are also proud of the increase in female participation on our programme, especially with the 2021 cohort where we witnessed a record 68 per cent selection of women entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nFounding Trustee of the TEF, Dr. Awele Elumelu stated: \u201cThrough the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme, we seek to democratise luck.\n\n\u201cHard work plays an important and undeniable part in success, but one must not discount the role of luck \u2013 someone being willing to take a chance on you or business idea by empowering you through training, mentorship or funding. \u201cOur hope is that, through the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme, we would help the next business leader or captain of industry be whom they are meant to be.\n\n\u201cThis is our own way to give back and also to empower the generation coming behind us so that they can go even further than we have. As a parent, one\u2019s desire is for your children to do better than you and so you will provide the resources and materials that they need to ensure that they go far in life. Similarly, at the Foundation we are equipping the next generation with the tools they need to succeed.\u201d\n\nAlso, commenting on the benefits of the programme, a 2015 Tony Elumelu Entrepreneur, Hauwa Liman, a female business owner and Founder of Afrik Abaya said: \u201cI am always proud to say that I am from the inaugural cohort of the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme. My business is located in Kaduna, in northern Nigeria. I benefitted from this Programme in 2015, and it opened up lots of doors and opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about the seed capital, but what really fascinates me about the Programme is the knowledge. I call it a mini-MBA programme, because from the ideation stage it teaches you how to really articulate your business, and it gave me my first business plan. The network, visibility and opportunities are endless.\n\n\u201cMy entrepreneurship experience cannot be complete without the Tony Elumelu Foundation. I will start exporting to other countries soon courtesy of the Foundation. We now employ ten permanent staff and an additional eight staff on a commission basis.\u201d\n\nThe TEF is empowering women and men across the African continent through entrepreneurship to catalyse economic growth, drive poverty eradication and ensure job creation.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s mission is rooted in the philosophy of Africapitalism, which positions the private sector as the key enabler of economic and social wealth creation in Africa. Through TEFConnect, the Foundation\u2019s proprietary digital platform, it has provided capacity-building support, advisory and market linkages, to over 1.5 million Africans.\n\nThe Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme is open to entrepreneurs across Africa: new start-ups and existing young businesses, operating in any sector.",
