This happens frequently.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, such actions by state governments constitute a major disincentive to prospective investors in the sector and invariably jeopardise the efforts of the government to deepen the mining industry in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere is no way this will ever benefit the majority of our people.\u201d\n\nHe also lamented the spate of insecurity in resource-rich communities as rival groups struggle to control access.\n\nOsinbajo stated, \u201cThen, there are the huge security concerns that always develop in the struggle for the control of mineral resources in poorly regulated, unregulated, or ungoverned spaces.\n\n\u201cAlmost invariably, these situations lead to criminal activities and particularly, the proliferation of weapons and armed groups. This is true historically and more evident now.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, necessitated the strategic cooperation between the Federal Government, states and resource-rich communities.\n\n\u201cIt is for these reasons that this strategic engagement with the leadership of the 774 local governments is critical,\u201d he noted.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Department of State Services, has revealed the details on the raid carried out on Sunday Adeyemo\u2019s (Igboho) Soka residence in Oyo state.\n\nThe details were contained in a press statement released on Thursday night. The statement reads:\n\nIn the early hours (about 0134 hours) of today, 1st July, 2021, a joint team of security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo a.k.a. SUNDAY IGBOHO at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place. On approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be IGBOHO\u2019s guards. Six (6) of them were armed with an AK-47 gun and Three (3) others, with Pump-Action riffles.\n\nIn the course of the exchange, two (2) of IGBOHO\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and is very stable.\n\nAfterwards, the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered the following among others:\n\ni. Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles;\n\nii. Three (3) Pump Action guns;\n\niii. Thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines;\n\niv. Five Thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition;\n\nv. Five (5) Cutlasses, One (1) Jackknife, One (1) Pen Knife\n\nvi. Two (2) Pistol holsters;\n\nvii. One (1) binoculars\n\nviii.

Further exploitation and forensic analysis are ongoing.\n\nALSO READ: PHOTOS: Exhibits recovered from Sunday Igboho\u2019s Soka residence\n\nAside the items recovered from the building, about thirteen (13) suspects including twelve (12) males and one (1) female were arrested and brought to Abuja. While one suspect is being profiled, the other twelve (12) paraded here are:\n\ni. Abdulateef OFEYAGBE\n\nii. Amoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K (female)\n\niii. Tajudeen ERINOYEN\n\niv.

Inform Nigerians and the world that Sunday IGBOHO and his group, in the guise of a campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order. This, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by IGBOHO and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\n\nii. Alert foreign missions and licensing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that IGBOHO could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\n\niii. Apprise stakeholders that the Five (5) AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building are suspected to be those collected by IGBOHO\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State\n\nThe gun duel which lasted for an hour offered IGBOHO the chance to escape. Sunday ADEYEMO a.k.a Sunday IGBOHO is now on the run. IGBOHO may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him. But this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him. And the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\n\nConsequently, ADEYEMO/IGBOHO is advised to turn himself into the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful. He should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Federal government of Nigeria has been advised to be cautious and reasonable in handling the treason case preferred against the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nEmeka Kalu, a former governorship aspirant from Abia State, gave the advice in a statement made available to newsmen in Umuahia on Thursday night.\n\nHe said that Kanu deserves fair hearing, fair treatment, insisting that all professional care must be taken to ensure he does not die in custody.\n\nHe further insisted that provisions of international law on conflict resolutions, United Nations Organization charters on fundamental human rights and self-determination must be properly followed in handling a high profile case of this nature to avoid regrettable mistakes.\n\nKalu warned the government against handling the matter with aggressive or brutal show of force in the face of the current volatile and fragile conditions of the Nigeria state.\n\nHis words, \u201cThe jubilation making round the width and length of this country on the arrest of the IPOB Leader should not been seen as a success celebration of having finally apprehended \u201cthe clog in the wheel of Nigeria\u201d but should be seen as a mark of government commitment to entrench peace and tranquility in the country.\n\n\u201cThis is a democratic dispensation where rule of law prevails and reigns supreme. The provisions of Int\u2019l law on Conflict Resolutions, UNO charters on Fundamental Human Rights Protection & Self Determination must be properly followed in handling a high profile case of this nature to avoid regrettable mistakes. The Nigeria we see today belongs to all of us and nobody or ethnic group has monopoly of ownership of our dear Country, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is a sensitive issue that requires proper administrative professionlism and Federal Government under the watch of President Buhari is advised to be judicious in the management of the case because of its sensitivity.\n\n\u201cTerrorism is a condemnable act in the heart of every right thinking man so Government is encouraged to fight and prevent it at all costs. Government must do everything in her power to ensure that carrot hands are not given to others while another is treated with brutality.\n\n\u201cDialogue is important in this context as the government opens a door for it. Federal should endeavour to create an enabling ground for peaceful dialogue not only with IPOB but with other ethnic nationalities agitating for self rule and restructuring of our nationsi fiscal federalism.\n\n\u201cThis window for peace does not mean weakness on the part of government but it is one of the bureaucratic keys by which the gate of justice and equity are opened in a democratic and justice-oriented government\u201d.\n\nDAILY POST recall that the Federal Government had on Tuesday disclosed that it has rearrested the self-acclaimed Biafran leader.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN who confirmed the development, said he was arrested by a combined team of Nigerian and foreign security agents in a coordinated interception.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, he was dragged before Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court for the continuation of his trial. Justice Nyako, after listening to Kanu and the government, remanded him in the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS. Kanu had a few years ago jumped bail and escaped out of the court.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Emeka Kalu has advised the Federal government to apply the same technical security professionalism to tackle herdsmen killings, banditry and Boko Haram insurgency that have been ravaging all nooks and crannies of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt stands to reason that killings, terrorism, banditry, kidnapping and other handful of crimes are condemned as \u201cevil\u201d in any contemporary society, so, we must live to stand by the side of truth which is a force that cannot be suppressed no matter how we hate it.\n\n\u201cIt is crystal clear that since herdsmen have been attacking farms and farmers across the Nation with resultant disaster, none of the culprits has ever been arrested, interrogated let alone prosecution instead the Federal government is bent on re invoking the purported gazette for grazing routes which the 1999 Constitution has no provisions for.\n\nContinuing, Kalu added, \u201cIt is a pity that Nigerians are being killed on daily basis by these attackers without repulsive resistance from the Nigeria Security forces. In the words of Uttoman Dan Fodio,\u201d Conscience is an open wound, only truth can heal it. Today, where is the conscience in the Federal Government to condemn all these ills and at the same time proffer meaningful solutions to tackle them?\n\n\u201cWe are living in a fragile society where truth is manipulated into falsehood. Nigerians are tired of bad news and insecurity. We are tired of hunger and high handedness, we are fed up with man s inhumanity to man. We are tired of failure of polices and its attendant bureaucratic bottlenecks.\u201d",

We are spending all the money to provide security for our people. They need to be alive first, before we can talk of development. And he would smile daily to the bank.\u201d\n\nAdesina said despite the humongous resources being deployed to combat insecurity, great developmental strides are also being taken, because Zulum is not squirreling everything away.\n\n\u201cIt is said that while he was the Commissioner for Reconstruction, Zulum still lived in the family house. He hadn\u2019t built a home for himself. No wonder he became Governor, and is serving with heart and might, despite the grave challenges.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari, who was a military governor of the old Borno State, had very kind words for Zulum when he visited. A man parsimonious with praises, the President said the host was forthright, resilient, and committed to development, despite the security challenges confronting the State.\n\n\u201cThe President said the Governor takes huge personal risks to promote peace and development, spending nights with the vulnerable and displaced. And I ask again: where did this man emerge from? It\u2019s never done like that here.\n\n\u201cThe APC waxes stronger by the day. While the rival People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) waxes weaker and weaker. A topic for another day, but with Governors like Zulum, I\u2019ll put my money on the APC any day.\n\n\u201cWith public officers like Zulum, confidence is rekindled in Nigeria. Not everyone is a thief. Not everyone is a plunderer. Muhammadu Buhari, honest, straight as an arrow, is replicating himself in many people. Zulum seems to be one, and it makes one glad.\n\n\u201cKashim Shettima, the immediate past Governor took great strides. He has bequeathed to the State a man taking giant strides. That\u2019s the way it should be. You don\u2019t succeed without a worthy successor.\n\n\u201cI know Governor Zulum. He has no airs around him. He\u2019s just like the man next door. Simple, self-effacing. True is the saying that it\u2019s the empty barrels that make the loudest noise.\u201d\n\nAppreciate Buhari when he arrives \u2013 Zulum tells Borno residents ahead of President\u2019s visit",

          "title": "The parents are not always to be blamed",
          "text": "By Olukorede Yishau\n\nSince the news broke that Chidinma Ojukwu, a student of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), killed her older lover, closet sinners have been busy pontificating and offering unsolicited pieces of advice. I am less concerned about what has been said about the late Usifo Ataga, I am concerned about what has been said about parenting, about how her parents supposedly failed, and about how the fact that she came from a broken home could have contributed to her failure as a human being.\n\nWell, the world over, examples abound to prove that parenting is a tricky thing, very tricky and no one has the perfect formula. All we do is try and hope our kids will turn out well. A few examples will suffice.\n\nMy six years in secondary school were spent away from home and from my parents, except on the few occasions we were home for holidays. We were free and many misbehaved: sex, cigarettes and I am sure a few even tried Marijuana. We had strict housemasters and housemistresses, but. despite that. those who wanted to be bad found a way to be. Our school was surrounded by bushes and many escaped to smoke and do all sorts. Classrooms at night were also dark enough for shenanigans.\n\nAs far as our parents were concerned, we were in strict hands and were bound to be of good behaviour, but there were instances when the teachers who were supposed to keep us upright were the ones sleeping with the girls, many of them between 15 and 16 years. and the ones who refused were targets of punishments. At least three of the girls are now wives to their ex-teachers, one even wrote the Senior School Certificate pregnant. We only knew when she was delivered of a baby some six months after completing her studies.\n\nThere were instances when suspected boyfriends of girls being targeted by some of our young teachers got the beatings of their lives for daring to love what the big men ought to be enjoying. Many who started experimenting with Marijuana then have graduated to something worse and are popular on the streets of Lagos Island for the wrong reasons.\n\nOur parents felt we were in a mission school and were bound to turn out well. It didn\u2019t work out well for some.\n\nThis thinking that being in a mission school helps is a myth that has been debunked many a time. Students of universities owned by churches, despite all the strict rules, are known to smoke hard drugs, skip school to go party hard on the Island, and have sex uncontrollably. We even saw a sex tape of students from a popular faith-based university some years back.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome months back, I heard of a girl who attended a faith-based university. Her parents are pastors, her mother considered her fragile and unable to withstand pressure. Her mother was always worried about her because of this. She had more confidence in her younger sister being rugged and capable of taking care of herself. But, this mother really knows nothing of her daughter. The image she presents at home is different from her reality and it all started at the faith-based school, where she learnt to jump the fence and escaped to the Island to party like there is no tomorrow and drink beer, whisky and vodka and any kind of alcohol man has ever made. A pastor close to her could not close his mouth when a friend she interned with and her other colleagues regalled him with her escapades. He kept saying \u201caah, aah, that small girl\u201d.\n\nI know of a senior colleague who spent his early life in and out of church. His father was a vicar. He left home and went to the university and, for four years in the university, he dumped his Christianity and avoided church. He rebelled for years. Can we blame his parents for this? Thankfully, he didn\u2019t stray beyond redemption and is now in the service of the Lord, but not many have this second chance.\n\nSome days back, I read a piece credited to an advertising guru. In it, he narrated the nasty paths he and classmates and seniors threaded while in secondary school: sex, drugs, prostitutes, and more. In the university, he became worse and added gambling. While he sobered after starting his career, not a few of his friends in crime found it impossible to retrace their steps.\n\nI know of a family of seven where all the kids were raised by the parents under one roof and two of the kids chose the rough paths, one even embraced cultism. Yet, they were all trained by the same parents. I know of another family of five which one just chose to be the black sheep and while their mother lived, she used to say she scored four over five in parenting.\n\nI will be a liar to say some parents do not deliberately lead their kids astray. We have seen parents who have helped their children cheat in exams, we have seen parents who encouraged their girls to become prostitutes, we have seen parents who direct their children to follow their crooked paths, but we have also seen kids who against all odds turn out exceptionally well in all ramifications despite having crooks for parents, thus proving right the Yoruba adage that the white pap is made from the dark pot.\n\nMy final take: There is no signed-sealed-and-delivered parenting manual anywhere. Yes, there are a number of principles that can help, but they are not sacrosanct. The Bible and the Quran contain many of these principles, but even with kids raised with these principles, we have seen exceptions. So, before you heap the blame solely on parents when their kids fail, know that even in the best of homes, there are always some kids who just want to be bad like that.",

          "title": "TB @ 60: His generosity reminds me of MKO",
          "text": "By Ogbeni Goke Odeyinka\n\nI have always wondered why some people think I am the closest person to Tunji Bello. But I know I am not. I came to know Tunji when I joined National Concord newspapers as a reporter in the 80s, and he was on the Features Desk. Since he normally passed by the newsroom before getting to his office, he would breeze into the newsroom on few occasions. There was nothing special about that except for the exchange of pleasantries whenever we met along the corridor or elsewhere.\n\nOur \u201cfriendship\u201d however started when he was appointed Politics Editor. His office was directly opposite the newsroom, and I visited there regularly for information on happenings in the political arena. Apart from \u201cpolitricks\u201d (as our Publisher, MKO, would call it), we talked sports (football mostly) and music, especially Abami Eda\u2019s (Fela\u2019s) afrobeat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter close of work, we would ride in his jalopy (Volkswagen beetle) to a joint along Morocco Road, Mushin, Lagos for drinks. From there we would head for Lawanson, Surulere where he normally dropped me off to find my way home at Ijesha, and it could be as late as 11pm, while he headed for his Ilasa abode.\n\nWhen the IBB regime proscribed National Concord at the peak of the June 12 debacle in 1993, I was privileged to be among the few reporters chosen to work on a \u201cnew\u201d publication (Lagos News, a publication originally owned by the late Lateef Kayode Jakande, former governor of Lagos State). Tunji was the Editor and I cannot say why he chose me as a reporter, but I did not disappoint him with my exclusive stories every Monday.\n\nLater, after being appointed the Editor of Sunday Concord in 1995, he wanted me to join him but my Editor, Nsikak Essien, would not let go.\n\nAn incident happened while I served as chairman of the Concord Chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ). I was to be transferred to Uyo, Cross River State, to take me away from \u201cthe scene\u201d of action in order to destabilise the union. It was believed then by some management staff that I was becoming uncontrollable and running a \u201cparallel management\u201d and the only way to \u201cclip my wings\u201d instead of sacking me was to transfer me to an outstation along with the secretary. It was Tunji whom I learnt years later, that counselled that it would amount to a witch-hunt to transfer the chairman and secretary at the same time and also that it was against the labour law.\n\nBut, in an effort to cripple the union, the secretary was eventually taken to Minna, and that was how Jide Oritunsin got transferred and found a new home in the Niger State capital.\n\nWhen the opportunity came, I left Concord for greener pastures and, in the process, lost touch with Tunji and didn\u2019t reconnect until we met at THISDAY newspapers premises sometime in 2001. I went there to see another good friend, the Great Grand Commander, Kayode Komolafe (KK). I was chatting with KK when Tunji strolled in and he was surprised to see me after some years of separation.\n\nNothing special transpired between us thereafter until he became Commissioner for the Environment, Lagos State, in 2003. In a particular year when the list of editors were been compiled for \u201cXmas Welfare\u201d, he added my name to the list. This met stiff resistance from some quarters, but he stood his ground and I benefited from it.\n\nIn 2006, my apartment was burgled, and I didn\u2019t know who informed Tunji. He sent for me and gave me some money. Apart from me, I know of some other persons he had touched with his milk of human kindness, especially ex- Concordians. He bought working tools for some and got employments/admissions for many. He paid school fees, settled hospital bills, and in some cases, assisted some financially when they had important occasions/events. He is a cheerful and silent giver/donor.\n\nSometime ago, a journalist with the NTA approached me, and narrated what she was going through and the need to seek Tunji\u2019s assistance came up. The contact was established and she had cause to smile at the end of the day.\n\nBeyond that, I can also attest that Tunji has used his position to assist people whom he never met except through text/Whatsup messages. There was a time a community leader in Soluyi (Gbagbada, Lagos) complained to me over some environmental challenges in the area and I suggested he should reach out to him. At first, he hesitated for, according to him, \u201chow can a whole commissioner respond to a text message from an unknown man\u201d. I convinced him and he \u201ctried\u201d his luck. The following day, he not only got a reply, but officials of the ministry went there for a tour/ survey. My friend wrote a letter of appreciation and caused it to be published in Vanguard newspaper. That\u2019s just one of the many I am aware of.\n\nIn 2015, the first edition of Concord Family Reunion was held, and Tunji assisted the Organizing Committee to the best of his ability. The second edition would not have held if not for his support and others. It\u2019s not a matter of being patronizing to him, other members of the committee are alive and can as well debunk my statements if untrue. I remember also how he assisted his first PA to study for his Master\u2019s degree in law in England. I know because the man involved happens to be my in-law. The way he goes about assisting people generously reminds of the legendary MKO Abiola, who gave freely to all and sundry and did not know how to say no to anyone in need. I am sure Tunji is just hearing about this particular story from a third party from the pages of this book like any other person. As a good Methodist, I have my methods just as my friend has his silent way of making people around him happy. I am sure he would not relent in doing good to those in need, even after he must have left office.\n\nHere is wishing him many more years ahead in undiminished glory, good health and prosperity.",

          "text": "By Julie Manga\n\nAsk Nigerians: no one is at a loss on the good intentions of governments, past or current, in the commitment towards delivering on policies developed to better impact the lives of citizens and enhance livelihood. Every plan is as good as implemented to design. Often, good policies end or fail at the implementation stage; not because they are impracticable but due to the inability of managers to track their progress and get feedbacks on their sustainability.\n\nThe assessment of course is not for glorification or to deodorize such efforts but also to help understand the strength or deficiencies of plans and programs, for possible fine-tuning, improvement and support which are often geared towards broader coverage and policy efficiency.\n\nTowards this end, the ingenious and similarly audacious determination of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government to pull 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years continues to dominate public discourse with pessimists considering this too daring, impossible and non-realistic. Aside from other programmes of the Buhari administration to lessen extreme poverty among the poor through micro-credits, the government in rolling out the National Social Investment Programme, NSIP, understands the necessity of producing results by frequently interrogating and tracking the workability and challenges being faced through frequent updates and reliable feedbacks for effective implementation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe National Social Investment Programme is targeted at reducing poverty among the downtrodden and is designed to promote sectorial linkages and synergies in ensuring partnerships with critical stakeholders, as well as the buy-in and ownership of states and local governments. It comprises the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme, Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme, N-Power and the Conditional Cash Transfer Programmes as main components. All these programmes have become familiar in almost every Nigerian home.\n\nThe Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development which is saddled with the supervision of the NSIP realized the importance of deploying proportional monitoring tools through which the laudable interventionist packages could be assisted to deliver on their mandate. While addressing trained independent monitors at the flag-off for the distribution of engagement letters and devices to successful monitors recently in Abuja, Alhaji Bashir Nura Alkali, the permanent secretary, underscored the importance of raising these monitors in a bid to achieve intended results.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to achieve the set goals and objectives of each of these programmes, the ministry believes that adequate monitoring is important. The engagement of independent monitors for NSIP therefore is one of the strategies to ensure these programmes achieve desired results. While the engagement of independent monitors is not new, we at the ministry have reviewed the modalities and designed a more robust and proactive strategy to monitor the programmes,\u201d Alkali told his audience.\n\nHe also disclosed that the monitors have been mandated to assess beneficiaries of these programmes within their locality in schools, households, and market clusters on a routine basis. They are equipped with the standardized reporting tool in hard copy as well as electronically, to help in measuring the impact of various programmes.\n\nThe monitors were introduced to the Social Investment Management Information System application operable on their tablets by which they are expected to return data-backed, trustworthy feedback for valuation for policy adjustment and necessary decision-making engagements where possible. With an economy that is recovering from the recession after the impacts of Covid-19 as well as multiplier consequences of global economic downturn, the massive funding of social investments brings a refreshing hope for the most vulnerable among the Nigerian people, especially the aged, children, unengaged youths and women.\n\nHowever, the success or otherwise of the NSIP rests on all stakeholders to collaborate with the Federal Government in its quest to ensure fair monitoring of these programmes by enlisting the support of beneficiaries themselves across all segments. Needless to mention the impartiality of the monitors themselves who must rise above board to report flawless data in the interest of continuity and further expansion of these programmes to the benefit of the people.\n\nIt is also quite important that state and local governments are fully mobilised to cooperate with the Federal Government by ensuring that these programmes are effectively monitored across the country.\n\nSimilarly, all stakeholders, particularly the state focal persons and officials of the National Orientation Agency which were involved from the inception of this programme for training the independent monitors, must collaborate continuously to engender and deepen citizen awareness and support for the scheme if the results desired at the inception of this laudable scheme must come to reality.\n\nExperience teaches that the critical missing link in most government policies and programmes are proper monitoring and evaluation, this is why the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Umar Farouq must be applauded for coming up with a monitoring template aimed at supporting the NSIP to deliver according to the president\u2019s mandate.",

          "text": "Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThe Department of State Services(DSS), has explained why it carried raided the home of Sunday Igboho, in Ibadan, Oyo State .\n\n\n\nThe raid conducted by a team of joint security operatives in the early hours of Friday according to the DSS director of public relations Peter Afunaya,\n\nwas based on intelligence that Igboho had stockpiled arms in the place.\n\nHe told newsmen in Abuja that on approaching the premises, the security operatives were attacked by men suspected to be working as security guards for the suspect.\n\nDuring the shoot out, he stated that two of the guards were shot dead while twelve others were arrested. He stressed that one of the operative was wounded during the operation.\n\nAfunaya gave the names of twelve persons arrested , a female inclusive, as Abdulateef OFEYAGBE\n\niAmoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K Tajudeen ERINOYEN, Diakola ADEMOLA, Abideen SHITTU\n\nJamiu NOAH, Ayobami DONALD\n\nAdelabe USMAN, Oluwafelumi KUNLE, Raji KAZEEM, Taiwo OPEYEMI and Bamidele SUNDAY.\n\nHe explained that a search was conducted in the house\n\nAfunaya\u2019s statement reads; \u201cIn the early hours (about 0134 hours) of today, 1st July, 2021, a joint team of security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo a.k.a. SUNDAY IGBOHO at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place.\n\n\u201cOn approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be IGBOHO\u2019s guards. Six (6) of them were armed with AK-47 gun and Three (3) others, with Pump-Action riffles.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two (2) of IGBOHO\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and is very stable.\n\n\u201cAfterwards, the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered the following among others:Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles; three (3) Pump Action guns; thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines and five thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition.\n\nHe also stated that five (5) cutlasses , one (1) Jack knife, one (1) Pen Knife;\n\ntwo (2) Pistol holsters;one (1) binoculars ; a wallet containing Five (5) US Dollars in one (1) Dollar denomination; local and international driver\u2019s licences in his name, ATM Cards, a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name were found.\n\nAlso discovered , he said were two (2) whistles; fifty (5) Cartridges; eighteen (18) Walkie-Talkies;\n\nthree voodoo charm jackets/traditional body armour;\n\ntwo (2) Laptops (One (1) Toshiba and One (1) Compaq); and his International Passport and those of many others (as displayed here). He maintained \u201c further exploitation and forensic analysis are ongoing.\n\n\u201cAside the items recovered from the building, about thirteen (13) suspects including twelve (12) males and one (1) female were arrested and brought to Abuja. While one suspect is being profiled, the other twelve (12) paraded here are: Abdulateef OFEYAGBE,\n\nAmoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K (female)\n\n, Tajudeen ERINOYEN, Diakola ADEMOLA\n\n, Abideen SHITTU\n\n, Jamiu NOAH\n\n, Ayobami DONALD\n\n, Adelabe USMAN\n\n, Oluwafelumi KUNLE\n\n, Raji KAZEEM\n\n, Taiwo OPEYEMI and\n\nBamidele SUNDAY.\n\nHe said the briefing was to \u201cinform Nigerians and the world that Sunday IGBOHO and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order. This, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by IGBOHO and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\n\n\u201cAlert foreign missions and licencing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that IGBOHO could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\n\n\u201cApprise stakeholders that the Five (5) AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building are suspected to be those collected by IGBOHO\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State.\u201d\n\nHe said the \u201c gun duel which lasted for an hour offered IGBOHO the chance to escape. Sunday ADEYEMO a.k.a Sunday IGBOHO is now on the run. IGBOHO may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him. But this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him. And the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\u201d\n\nHe added \u201c Consequently, ADEYEMO/IGBOHO is advised to turn himself in to the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful. He should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly\u201d.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Kalu\u2019s magic wand in Abia North",
          "text": "From Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nHow many times would a man kill lions before he is addressed as \u201cOgbuagu\u201d (killer of lions)? Answer: Killing just one lion earns him the sobriquet.\n\nPrior to Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu\u2019s election in 2019 to represent Abia North senatorial zone in the Senate, the zone had been represented by persons who give head pans, shovels and hair driers to the constituents as democracy dividends. But, with the election of Orji Kalu, former governor of Abia State and current Senate Chief Whip, into the Senate to represent Abia North, the narrative changed. Kalu has \u2018killed\u2019 so many lions on this front that he cannot only be said to be Ogbuagu, but at the same time feathers surely must be competing for space on his red cap, going by the accolades he has received from his constituents.\n\nWhile Kalu traversed the length and breadth of the zone during electioneering, he promised the people a new dawn, if elected. And, true to type, he has delivered on his promise.\n\nNicknamed Action Governor by a former President of the country when he superintended the affairs of Abia, he has brought again brought action to the people of Arochukwu, Bende, Isuikwuato, Ohafia and Umunneochi, the five local government areas that make up Abia North.\n\nArochukwu LGA\n\nMassive roads reconstruction is going on simultaneously in the five local government areas of Abia North senatorial zone, courtesy of Kalu\u2019s political dexterity. According to the Ogbuagu himself when he inspected some of the ongoing road projects recently, at least 32 of such roads have either been completed in the area or have reached advanced stages. Not given to taking credit for what others did, Kalu disclosed that, out of the roads in question, 21 were his constituency projects, while the remaining were being handled by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), also through his intervention.\n\nSome of the roads that the Senate Chief Whip facilitated and had been completed in Arochukwu include the 3.2-kilometre Atan Ihechiowa Road, which the senator himself recently inaugurated.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Kalu said the facilitation, construction and inauguration of the road was in fulfillment of part of his 2019 campaign promises to the people.\n\n\u201cThe 3.2km Atan Ihechiowa Road is one of the 19 road projects in Abia North facilitated by me within my first term at the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cLast time I came during the campaign, my vehicles were all covered with dust, and I made a promise to all of you that I would facilitate the construction of this road, and this is what we are witnessing today. Apart from this road, the construction of a 7.9km Opkor/Arochukwu Road is also ongoing. I don\u2019t believe in politics of cash inducement or distribution of materials that are not tangible,\u201d Kalu told the people.\n\nAs the Atan Road was being launched, the first phase of the 2.5km Orir-Ikot Okpura-Arochukwu Road, which was attracted by the senator and undertaken by the NDDC, was flagged off to the admiration of the people. The flag-off was preceded by a reception hosted by the community and organized by Chief Eze Aru, a community leader.\n\nAn elated Chief Aru told Kalu: \u201cThis road is a product of Senator Kalu\u2019s ideology of sincerity in Nigerian politics. This has further proven that Senator Orji Uzor Kalu loves our community, because politics is all about meeting the needs of the people, and the senator has demonstrated this through the construction of this road.\u201d\n\nTraditional ruler of the community, Eze Livinus Nto Mba, Chief Onny Igbokwe, Dr. Chidia Maduekwe, Chief Samson Aku and Chief Chris Ajah, vice-chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia North, all eulogized the former governor, saying he was a symbol of a good representative.\n\nChairman of the APC in Arochukwu LGA, John Million, went philosophical, saying: \u201cSince the inception of the community, this is the first time we shall be seeing this type of infrastructure development like tarred road.\n\n\u201cWe have had senators previously who represented us at the National Assembly, but they did nothing for us. One of them distributed only frying pans and hair driers during his four-year tenure.\n\n\u201cBut, today, Senator Orji Kalu has proven them wrong by facilitating various infrastructure projects all over Abia North, not just Ihechiowa community. Today, Abia North stands out among other senatorial districts in Abia State and he has made us proud.\n\n\u201cHis achievements in less than two years in office have revealed to us that senators can construct roads. As a result of the road and other projects he has executed, our party, the APC, has witnessed an influx of new members.\u201d\n\nKalu has also undertaken the renovation of primary schools in Arochukwu council, one of which is the Agbagwu Primary School, Aro-Town, in Arochukwu LGA.\n\nBende LGA\n\nThe people of Bende are no less blessed in having Kalu as their senator. A good number of roads he facilitated in the area have been rehabilitated, while others are undergoing reconstruction. Some of these roads include Igbere/Umuhu Ezechi, Alayi/Ugwueke/Ezeukwu and Lohum/Nkpa roads. Others are the Ukwu Rubber/Amaokwe Item, Amaokwe-Amaeke-Akanu Item and the Amankalu-Alayi/Akoli Imenyi roads.\n\nWhile inspecting some of the road projects, the Chief Whip announced that the original stretch of the Amankalu-Alayi/Akoli Imenyi Road has been extended from two to three kilometres. The first phase of the project involves a two-kilometre asphalting of the road with drainage on both sides. He said that work was going to commence on the second phase, which will take the road reconstruction to Akoli Imenyi.\n\nKalu told the people that he had concluded arrangement with the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA) to do emergency repairs on the Alayi-Item-Nkporo Road, which he built when he was governor.\n\nChief Jones Udeogu, coordinator of Kalu\u2019s project monitoring team, urged youths in the area not to make trouble, but support the contractor to ensure the work is delivered on good time.\n\nAbia State secretary of the APC, Perfect Okorie, commended Kalu for fulfilling his campaign promises. Okorie, who is from the area, said his people will not forget Kalu in a hurry as they have been finally remembered after much neglect.\n\nEze J.K. Abba, chairman of Alayi Council of Traditional Rulers, said the event was what his people have been angling for, but have been disappointed by past representatives of the people. He added it was only Kalu that has remembered them, and promised that his people would reciprocate the senator\u2019s gesture by giving him support in all his political endeavours.\n\nKalu has not been found wanting in the educational sector in the local government area. Courtesy of his political sagacity and connection, OUK, as he is fondly called, facilitated the rehabilitation of some classroom blocks in the area. Some of the schools are Ozuitem Central School, Okafia Igbere Primary School and Item Central School, Okoko. Kalu, while inspecting the school, regretted that it was renovated last when he was governor, over 20 years ago.\n\nThe senator went further to fulfill his promises of providing furniture for the pupils of Okafia Igbere and Item Central schools. While performing the delivery of several three-seater desks to the two schools, his legislative assistant, Mbila Uma Ayi, noted that the donations were part of his principal\u2019s policy to facilitate and provide conducive academic environment for Abia North pupils and teachers.\n\nIsuikwuato LGA\n\n\u201cIn Isuikwuato LGA, we have three road projects going on at the same time with that of Ohafia. I urge all Abians to continue to join the APC, that they will never be disappointed under the leadership of Senator Orji Uzor Kalu,\u201d said Chief Ajah of the APC, while commenting on the good works of Kalu. The roads under construction in Isuikwuato are the 2km road with drainage and asphalt in Uturu Township in Isuikwuato. Also on Kalu\u2019s construction radar is the 1km extension rural road with drainage and asphalt from Ozara junction to Umuasu (junction of University Road).\n\nIsuikwuto also benefitted from Kalu\u2019s renovation of primary school blocks, which included the rehabilitation of two school blocks at Otamkpa Community School and Ahaba Imenyi Community School.\n\nOhafia LGA\n\nOhafia LGA is in no way left out of Kalu\u2019s roads rehabilitation revolution. Some of the roads under reconstruction in the area include the Akanu Ukwu-Abia, Arochukwu Road Junction-Isiugwu and Okunoaku roads as well as the Amurie Nkopro-Abiriba Road.\n\nThe former governor said, apart from roads, the APC-led Federal Government was also involved in the rehabilitation of schools and provision of other dividends in the area. He urged the people to keep faith with the government at the centre as more goodies would come their way in the days ahead.\n\nOther democracy dividends Ohafia LGA people are getting through Kalu\u2019s quality representation are the Amurie Nkporo water project, where Kalu told the people that, because of the topography of the area, he had to invite Julius Berger to sink the borehole. Kalu, who noted that another motorized borehole was being sunk at Agbaja Ndiagbo, equally informed the people that one more would be sunk in another part of the community.\n\nApart from roads, Kalu\u2019s magic wand is felt in the area of education in the council as classroom blocks at Ndi Agwu Abam primary school, Okweji Memorial School, Ozu-Abam, Ugwuafia Primary School and Kpoke Primary School have all received the senator\u2019s magic touch.\n\nUmunneochi LGA\n\nThe Lokpaukwu Road, and the 3km Uhaba-Akawa-Aroikpa roads rehabilitation are in process in Umunneochi. While a borehole is being sunk at Ezioba community, the rehabilitation of Umuelem Central School, Isuochi, and Eziama Community School, Nneato, are in progress.\n\nOutside the road and other projects that have been completed or at various stages of execution, Kalu caused many other projects, some of which had already been taken off, to be accommodated in the 2021 budget.\n\nThey are the construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Ututu to Isu in Arochukwu LGA; construction of 2km rural road with drainage and asphalt in Itumbuzo, Bende LGA; construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Apanu to Akanu in Item, Bende LGA; construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt in Uzo Rubber in Amaokwe Item in Bende LGA; and the construction of 2km rural road with drainage and asphalt, Amankalu Alayi to Akoli Imenyi, also in Bende LGA.\n\nOthers are the construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt in Amaoku Alayi in Bende LGA; construction of 2km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Abia to Akanu Ukwu, in Ohafia LGA; construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt at Isiugwu, Ohafia LGA; construction of 2km rural road with drainage and asphalt in Uturu Township in Isuikwuato LGA; construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Ozara junction to Umuasu in Isuikwuato LGA (junction of University Road); and the construction of 1km rural road with drainage and asphalt from Ndi Uduma Awaoke (Chief Awa Kalu SAN Road) in Ohafia LGA.\n\nAlso on the list is the supply of motorcycles, sewing machines and generating sets for his constituents in Arochukwu, Bende and Ohafia LGAs, as those in Isuikwuato and Umunneochi LGAs had already received theirs last year. The packages also included supply of wound gel and gynecological (cervical cancer gel) and the supply of rice and fertilizers for rural women in the five LGAs of Abia North. Investigations revealed that these projects cost over N2bn.\n\nA man not given to discrimination, the Senate Chief Whip included in this year\u2019s federal budget the construction of students\u2019 hostel in Holy Rosary Secondary school, Umuahia, which is in Abia Central senatorial district.\n\nMore constituents laud Kalu\n\nWhen Kalu toured the projects, which included roads, schools and water scheme, the people hailed, calling him such names as \u201cthe People\u2019s Senator,\u201d \u201cMan of the People,\u201d \u201cFather-Father\u201d and \u201cMaster Strategist.\u201d\n\nHear the Ezeogo of Abia-Ohafia community, Chief Emmanuel Ebere: \u201cSince the creation of the earth, this is the first time the people are seeing tarred road. The Premier of defunct Eastern Nigeria, Dr. Michael Okpara, and even the late Chief Sam Mbakwe, former governor of old Imo State, and some other governors, all came at one point or the other with promises to tar the road, but not until Kalu went to the Senate\u201d.\n\nEzeogo Ebere said his people were behind Kalu in his political endeavours.\n\nRt. Hon. Arua Arunsi, ex-Speaker, Abia House of Assembly and former member, House of Representatives, thanked Kalu for his quality representation. Commenting on the water borehole attracted by Kalu, Arunsi said it was the first time the people of Nkporo would have borehole water in commercial quantity and said the people were solidly behind Kalu.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "FG Mobilises Prosecutors Against Kanu, Considers Mass Murder Charge",
          "text": "Queries British role in bail breach\n\nAlex Enumah\n\nThe federal government is raising a crack team of lawyers to prosecute the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, who was intercepted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Friday and repatriated to Nigeria under the cover of darkness on Sunday, THISDAY learnt last night.\n\nKanu had vanished from Nigeria after Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja, where he was standing trial for a six-count charge, granted him bail in April 2017. His bail was subsequently revoked in September 2019 following his persistent absence from court.\n\nFollowing his breach of the bail conditions, the security and intelligence agencies went on his trail, eventually tracking him down to Addis Ababa on Thursday, where his arrest was made on Friday by Interpol that handed him over to the operatives of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), which arranged his repatriation to Nigeria on Sunday.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, announced to an unsuspecting nation on Tuesday, the re-arrest of Kanu and his re-arraignment in court on an 11-count charge, including a treasonable felony.\n\nBut THISDAY learnt last night from competent sources that the justice ministry spent most of Tuesday night mobilising seasoned criminal lawyers in its prosecution department to draft fresh charges that might swell the list of accusations against Kanu to include mass murder.\n\nSources told THISDAY that security and intelligence agents have credible evidence linking the IPOB leader to the murder of hundreds of people, including those killed during the multiple attacks on police, custodian centre and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) facilities in the South-east and parts of the South-south.\n\n\u201cWe have credible evidence of his instructions to IPOB hierarchy to kill security officials and other persons that are seen to be against the group\u2019s agitations,\u201d a security source said, adding: \u201cWe have direct links between his several inciting video and audio messages and the violence in the South-east that has led to the killing of more than 100 persons.\u201d\n\nFG Queries British Role in Bail Breach\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has launched further enquiries into the role of the British High Commission in Kanu\u2019s breach of his bail terms, including his escape from Nigeria.\n\nThe main issue the government and its intelligence agents are probing is how the IPOB leader, whose Nigerian and British passports were in the custody of the Federal High Court, was able to obtain another British passport to travel out of Nigeria and traverse other African countries while he was on the run from the law.\n\nSaying Kanu was unlikely to obtain another British travel document without the support of the High Commission, a top intelligence officer told THISDAY last night that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is taking the High Commission to task on the matter.\n\nTHISDAY had reported a source on Wednesday as saying: \u201cFollowing the storming of his parent\u2019s compound in Afaraukwu, Abia State, by a detachment of soldiers on 14th September 2017, Kanu \u2018disappeared\u2019 virtually into thin air, the federal government felt concerned. Since both, his Nigerian and British passports were still in the custody of the Federal High Court in Abuja, there were strong suspicions that Kanu got the support of the United Kingdom High Commission in Nigeria for his escape. That was later proved to be the case.\u201d\n\nHowever, the British High Commission in an email complaint yesterday by its Political Counsellor, Mr. Jonathan Bacon, denied the report of the involvement of the commission.\n\n\u201cWe would like to draw your attention to a reference to the UK in the front-page story of today\u2019s edition of THISDAY: \u201c\u2026 there were strong suspicions that Kanu got the support of the United Kingdom High Commission in Nigeria for his escape. That was later proved to be the case.\u201d This is a serious allegation, which is completely false. The High Commission categorically denies it. We would be grateful if the newspaper could publish a correction and amend the online copy,\u201d it said.\n\nThe newspaper\u2019s Managing Director, Mr. Eniola Bello, swiftly responded asking the commission to clarify how the fugitive got a fresh British passport to leave Nigeria and travel around Africa to perpetrate his secessionist campaign against Nigeria.\n\nHe enquired: \u201cTaking into account your categorical denial of any involvement in Mr. Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s escape from Nigeria, we would like a further clarification, if possible from your High Commissioner to Nigeria, on how:\n\na) Mr. Kanu, who had had his Nigerian and British passports impounded by a court of competent jurisdiction in Abuja, had been able to procure another British passport which he had used to travel out of Nigeria, and around the world, calling for insurrection in Nigeria and inciting violence against the Nigerian police, military and every other symbol of authority in this country; and\n\nb) Could the Home Office in London have issued or allowed to be issued another passport to anybody whose passport had been impounded by a British court?\n\n\u201cWe demand some categorical answers to these questions so as to place the publication of your denial of the British High Commission\u2019s involvement in Kanu\u2019s escape from Nigeria in proper context.\u201d\n\nBacon posted the questions, saying he would obtain a response from London today.\n\nAs THISDAY awaits the commission\u2019s response, intelligence sources told the newspaper last night that the federal government viewed with strong concern the British\u2019s possible collusion with Kanu to break the bail bond, pointing out that the moment the fugitive stepped out of the country, NIA agents put him under strict surveillance.\n\n\u201cWe knew he had obtained fresh travel documents and our strategy was to keep a close tab on him and ensure that he did not return to London,\u201d the source said, explaining that: \u201cOnce we were able to consign him to Africa, we knew it would be a matter of time before we get him.\u201d\n\nThe source said the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 greatly hampered Kanu\u2019s moves to return to Britain but that he was in the process of moving from Kenya to Ethiopia en route to London when he was intercepted and arrested.\n\nA reliable source said the NIA operations were commanded at the highest level with President Muhammadu Buhari coordinating and receiving timely briefings on developments.\n\nIt was even speculated that it was because the operation had reached a critical success point that the president suddenly postponed his medical trip to London in order to ensure the conclusion of operation.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that once the NIA agents located Kanu on Thursday, they collaborated with Interpol to have him arrested on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Interpol handed him over to NIA agents on Saturday and he was flown to Abuja from Addis Ababa in the early hours of Sunday morning,\u201d a source said.\n\nARISE NEWS Channels, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, is in possession of a video clip showing the arrival of Kanu.\n\nHooded, the IPOB leader was received by over 200 security operatives, including NIA, DSS, Police and Interpol, who had taken over the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja yet oblivious of their very important personality (VIP) guest.\n\nKanu was handed over to the NIA, which in turn handed him over to the DSS that drove him in the tick of the night to its yellow-house headquarters in Asokoro District of Abuja.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has written to the British High Commissioner in Nigeria, Catriona Laing, asking that the British authorities file a Diplomatic Note with Nigeria's Federal High Court indicating Britain's sovereign interest in his trial as a British citizen.\n\nKanu, in the letter exclusively obtained SaharaReporters and written by his legal counsel, Aloy Ejimakor, on Thursday, said the British authorities must declare that he is not a criminal but \"a person who possesses a political opinion which the Nigerian authorities are seeking to suppress using punishment of some sort.\"\n\nNnamdi Kanu\n\nThe IPOB leader was arrested and detained since Sunday with the Department of State Services in Abuja and had been taken to court in chains and handcuffs while his trial was adjourned to July 26.\n\nIn a copy of the letter to the UK High Commissioner, made available to SaharaReporters on Thursday night, Ejimakor reiterated that Kanu, being a British citizen, did not travel with a Nigerian passport to Kenya where he was abducted.\n\nEjimakor, in the letter titled, \"Re: Urgent Request for Consular Assistance to OKWU-KANU, Nwannekaenyi Nnamdi Kenny (a British Citizen)\", established legal, political and diplomatic reasons to defend the pro-Biafra secessionist Leader.\n\nHe also established that there was no extant order of extradition by any British court that was officially processed to deport Kanu from Kenya to Nigeria. He, therefore, asked the British Government to demand the release of Kanu urgently.\n\nThe letter reads, \"We are solicitors to the above-named British citizen, on whose behalf and Instruction we write this letter to request urgent Consular assistance to him. Mr. Okwu-Kanu (aka Nnamdi Kanu) is the Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Director of Radio Biafra, both of which are corporate citizens of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Mr. Kanu resides in the United Kingdom, from which soil he departed on an overseas trip on or about June 19, 2021, on a British Passport No: 556543086 (copy of biographic page attached herewith).\n\n\"We are reliably informed that while he was on said overseas travel, he was intercepted in Kenya by Nigeria's foreign security agents and brought to Nigeria against his will on or about June 27, 2021, and 'arraigned' before the Federal High Court in Abuja without the benefit of Counsel on June 29, 2031. Currently, he is being detained in the Directorate of State Security Services (DSS) custody in Abuja.\n\n\"Your Excellency, permit us to point to a few legal, political and diplomatic issues that have been implicated in this matter. They are;\n\n\"Mr Kanu is a British citizen travelling on a valid British passport when he was seized in a third country and forcibly brought to Nigeria. Such an act constitutes an unlawful rendition of a bonafide British citizen.\n\n\"He was not travelling on Nigerian passport or the passport of any other country, including that of Kenya. There is no extant Order of extradition by any British Court or any other foreign Court (including Kenya) and we are informed that no pending extradition proceedings are standing against him in Britain or Kenya.\n\n\"There is no deportation Order by any Kenyan Court or other authority that made him subject to deportation. But if there was, the country of his deportation should have been Britain on which passport he was travelling. Deporting him to Nigeria just because he was born in Nigeria, but not travelling on her passport, is unlawful under international law.\n\n\"The enterprise upon which Mr Kanu is engaged, which is: seeking the restoration of the defunct State of Biafra through a referendum is a protected political opinion (i.e. self-determination) under British and Nigerian Laws, where it is enacted at CAP A9, Article 20, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\n\n\"In our view, the manner of his interception and forcible deportation to Nigeria is extra-legal and does not comport with the pertinent international laws and treaties to which Nigeria is subject.\"\n\nEjimakor also asked the British authorities to view Kanu as a political prisoner entitled to a set of political opinions and not a criminal.\n\n\"Based on the foregoing, we hereby make the following Prayers; That Mr Kanu be granted every possible Consular assistance to which he is entitled as a British citizen; that Mr Kanu be categorized as a high profile political prisoner or a prisoner of conscience and be thus rendered the highest diplomatic protection under municipal and international laws.\n\n\"That the Nigerian authorities be prevailed upon to immediately allow access to Mr Kanu by his Lawyers, Doctors and Family members.\n\n\"That the Nigerian authorities be prevailed upon to immediately avail Mr Kanu the opportunity of being taken to any hospital of his choice for medical examination.\n\n\"That the British authorities file a Diplomatic Note or other legal processes with Nigeria's Federal High Court and the Office of the Attorney General of Nigeria indicating her sovereign interest in Mr Kanu's matter.\n\n\"That the British authorities declare that Mr Kanu is not a criminal but a person who possesses a political opinion the Nigerian authorities seek to suppress using punishment of some sort.\n\n\"That the British authorities urgently demand the unconditional release of Mr Kanu from detention. While we await your urgent and most favourable considerations of our Prayers, please be assured of our highest esteem for Your Excellency, the High Commission and the British Government,\" the letter added.\n\nDOCUMENT: Nnamdi Kanu - Consular Letter by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has launched a manhunt for Sunday Igboho, Yoruba activist, after he escaped arrest when they raided his residence in Oyo state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeter Afunanya, DSS spokesman, said the security agency recovered illegal arms \u2014 including seven AK-47 rifles \u2014 and thousands of ammunition from Igboho\u2019s house.\n\nThe agency also paraded 13 supporters of the activist, who allegedly attacked DSS operatives during the raid on Thursday morning.\n\nIgboho, a known Yoruba youth leader, has been agitating for the creation of \u2018Yoruba Nation\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had planned to hold a rally in Lagos on Saturday to drive home his secessionist objectives, before his house was raided.\n\nAfunanya said the DSS operatives killed two people at Igboho\u2019s house during a gun duel between the agency and the latter\u2019s supporters.\n\nHe said the raid was based on intelligence that the youth leader \u201chad stockpiled arms in the place\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine men, suspected to be Igboho\u2019s guards. Six of them were armed with AK-47 guns and three others with pump-action rifles,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the course of the exchange, two of Igboho\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has, however, received medical attention and is very stable.\u201d\n\nHe said the DSS team subsequently searched the house and recovered arms, ammunition, charms, foreign currency notes, laptops, among other items.\n\n\u201cAside from the items recovered from the building, about 13 suspects, including 12 males and one female were arrested and brought to Abuja,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSunday Igboho and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order. The arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by Igboho and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThe gun duel, which lasted for an hour, offered Igboho the chance to escape. Sunday Adeyemo, a.k.a., Sunday Igboho, is now on the run. Igboho may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants.\n\n\u201cHe might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him, but this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him, and the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Adeyemo or Igboho is advised to turn himself in to the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful. He should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly.\u201d",

          "title": "Faith Keza is leading Irembo to fully digitise Rwanda",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were living in Rwanda today and needed to get a government-issued certificate, you can simply fill out some forms and make your payment \u2013 all online. Your certificate will be sent to your inbox when ready.\n\nIrembo is leading this digitisation of services in Rwanda. And steering the Irembo ship is Faith Keza.\n\nIt\u2019s 2 pm in Lagos when we sit to talk over Google Meet. Due to scheduling conflicts, our conversation had been delayed for some weeks but I was excited to be speaking with her.\n\nAfter getting her degree from MIT, she worked at Oracle, Delphix, Google and is now the CEO of Irembo. Faith is also on the board of the Rwanda National Bank and the Rwanda Development Board.\n\nSo how is she able to do all this? In an interview with UNICEF, she gives a very poignant response.\n\n\u201cThe word is grit,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can persevere day in and day out, the days will be long but the years will be short and you\u2019ll get to somewhere exciting.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Rwanda to moving to the US for her university degree, her journey has been one of grit, excellence and a dedication to impacting the lives of people.\n\nHer name is Faith Keza and this is her life in tech.\n\nFor the love of math\n\nFaith Keza\u2019s mother was born away from home in Uganda and lived there until Faith was born. After the genocide in 1994, the family made their way back to Rwanda to start over.\n\nFaith was only about 3 years old at the time and she tells me she doesn\u2019t remember a lot from that time.\n\n\u201cI just have a memory of living with all my cousins in one house. And at that point, a lot of families used to live together because they were all moving. So as a kid, that was fun but I guess for the adults it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFaith started school in Rwanda and quickly discovered she loved mathematics. She liked the logic of it all. There were rules to follow and they could be replicated.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to high school, my passion for maths grew stronger. I really enjoyed it. Even in my free time, I would take on further maths.\u201d\n\nAnd while she enjoyed maths, she dreaded subjects like biology where the rule was to memorise scientific names and characteristics. No logic, just retention.\n\nAs she rounded up her O-levels, a scholarship opportunity presented itself. A Scottish billionaire had visited Rwanda around that time and had liked the country so much that he decided he wanted to sponsor one child to attend a royal school in the North of Scotland; a school his children attended.\n\nTests were done to determine the top student in the country and in the end, Faith Keza was on her way to Scotland to start a new life and see the world through different lenses.\n\nWhile in the UK, at the end of her A-levels, Faith had to choose five schools to apply to. Following advice from her counsellor, she decided against applying to top schools like Oxford or Cambridge due to their low acceptance rates and in a bid not to \u201cwaste two of her chances.\u201d\n\nHer mother was not having any of that.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom heard about it she said \u2018No, Faith, you have to go to a top tier school\u2019\u201d\n\nBut applications to schools in the UK were closed at this time and Faith let her mother know that much. This was not a deterrent.\n\n\u201cAmerica is open. You should apply to America,\u201d her mother said to her.\n\nWhen Faith tells me about this encounter, she reveals that she did apply to America but at the time it was something she had done only to make her mother happy.\n\nThe letters followed soon. Brown had waitlisted her. But MIT\u2019s letter was a glowing acceptance. She was going to Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nIf you love maths let it go\u2026\n\nWhen I ask Faith about memories linked to MIT. She tells me she doesn\u2019t have great memories.\n\n\u201cEven today, I have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,\u201d she laughs \u201cI think a lot of people [from MIT] have it to some varying degree.\u201d\n\nMIT has a reputation. The school\u2019s acceptance rate is 6.7%, which is typical of most top schools. But it is also the alma mater to many great minds including the famous astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.\n\nThis means that MIT students get into the university with a lot to prove. In the middle of studying, there is also the debilitating imposter syndrome that is often commonplace.\n\n\u201cBecause wherever you come from, you\u2019re used to being the best at something. You get there and you\u2019re really competing with kids who have done insane things and some of them are actual geniuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it was very hard to suddenly have to know how to study because most of the time [in high school] I would sit in class and get what was going on. Realising this, that was when the all-nighters and coffee addiction really began. So no, I don\u2019t have great memories.\u201d\n\nAfter a semester at MIT, Faith realized her maths major wasn\u2019t for her.\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something more practical so I asked what was the other biggest major that everyone was excited about? And at that point, I think 50% of the class of MIT was computer scientists.\u201d\n\nSo computer science it was.\n\nIt starts at Oracle in the USA and ends at Irembo in Rwanda\n\nFaith\u2019s first job out of the university was as a software engineer with the tech giant, Oracle. Here she learnt real-world applications of a lot of the coding she had been doing at MIT.\n\nAfter two years at Oracle, she wanted a taste of the startup life and took up a software engineering role at Delphix. It was at Delphix that Faith started toying with the idea of returning to Africa. She had briefly considered moving to Nigeria where her partner Obinna Ukwuani was living at the time. They had both met in college.\n\nShe took a job at Google that was supposed to bring her back to an African country. But a lot of plans were stalled and so Faith decided to return on her own to Rwanda and while there, she joined Irembo as CTO.\n\nHer task was simple \u2013 Irembo was getting software from a third party and the prices were getting too high. They needed in-house software development. Faith was on the job.\n\n\u201cSo what we have been doing for the past five years is working with the government of Rwanda to digitise all their services.\u201d\n\nIn building these solutions, there have been some uphill tasks. An experience that stands out for Faith was during the process of digitising certificates, many people questioned the security of the online method. This was a teachable moment for her. She learnt that it was necessary to carry everyone along \u2013 explain things to them, learn their concerns, just make sure everyone feels heard and is involved.\n\nSitting on boards and looking to the future\n\nFaith loves audiobooks because \u201cyou can listen to them while you do other things.\u201d And with a life as busy as hers, who can blame her for multi-tasking. In 2018 and 2019, she was nominated to be on the boards of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) and the Rwanda Development Board (RDB).\n\nOn these boards, she does a lot of things including consulting on the state of tech in the country and how the country can work towards their digital goals.\n\nBased on her hobbies, it\u2019s likely that Faith is looking forward to spending more time reading, making recipes from the internet, or watching Netflix \u2013 after they put out some new shows because she insists she has watched all the good ones.\n\nAnd now, as CEO of Irembo, the goal is to expand. With the largest growing youth population in the world, a digitised Africa will be a sight to behold.\n\nWith Faith Keza, Irembo could be at the front of that movement.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In a fashion typical of African governments, authorities in the Kingdom of Eswatini have ordered network providers in the country to cut off access to the internet as a nationwide protest continues to rock the small southern African kingdom.\n\nDemonstrations demanding reforms to the country\u2019s absolute monarchy started during the weekend and things turned violent overnight on Tuesday as security forces fired gunshots and tear gas to disperse protesters, multiple reports show.\n\nActivists in the country are demanding democratic reforms and the lifting of bans on all opposition parties. They have said they will intensify demonstrations against the government, which have been on for four consecutive days now.\n\nVideos of people burning tires, throwing stones at cars, and barricading streets in cities like Manzini and Matsapha have also been circulating on social media.\n\nProtestors block roads in Manzini, King Mswati\u2019s Government blocks internet to control situation. pic.twitter.com/Pk9ao9duio \u2014 Swazi News (@SwaziNews) June 29, 2021\n\nEswatini protestors now operating at night burning businesses linked to King Mswati and Government properties.

Banks have also closed up until the unrest subsides.\n\nGovernment has further suspended schools & introduced a 6pm-5am curfew with immediate effect.

Nigeria restricted access to Twitter on June 4, albeit under different circumstances.\n\nInternet blocks on the continent prevent access to social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. In what is a worrying trend, local activists and international observers note that these blocks curtail the democratic right of freedom of speech and expression.\n\nAnger against Africa\u2019s last absolute monarch\n\nA former British protectorate, Eswatini is Africa\u2019s last absolute monarchy and one of the few remaining in the world. King Mswati III has ruled by decree for more than three decades, with unfettered political power over his 1 million people.\n\nThe royal family has come under fire for their lavish spending while most inhabitants, who are subsistence farmers, live below the poverty line. Crowned in 1986 when he was just 18, the king currently has 15 wives who occupy several state-funded palaces.\n\nThe small landlocked country changed its name from Swaziland in 2018, a move that was seen as a step towards democracy. However, King Mswati III has reportedly been running a repressive government, with several reported cases of human rights abuse, and consistently evaded years-long calls for meaningful democratic reforms.\n\nDespite anger towards Mswati over the years, demonstrations have not been commonplace in Eswatini. This is because the kingdom has continually stifled dissent and protests, as well as banned political parties from participating in parliamentary elections since 1973. Still, the 53-year-old monarch has denied being an autocrat.\n\nSeveral opposition leaders and activists were arrested in 2019, the same year when civil servants in the country went on several strike actions, accusing the monarch of draining public coffers at the expense of his subjects.\n\nThe series of crackdowns has done little to discourage anti-monarchy sentiment among the people as they continue to demand a democratic government that will serve their interests.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Nigerian business financing startup, Payhippo announces that it has closed a $1 million pre-seed round led by Pan-Africa VCs, Ventures Platform, Future Africa, and Launch Africa. Other investors include Africa-focused VC, Sherpa Ventures; Hustle Fund; and Mercy Corps Venture.\n\nThe startup plans to use the fund to expand its reach to more Nigerian cities and also build its team of engineers. Aside from this, it plans to hire a Head of Finance to match the business current growth rate.\n\nFounded in January 2020 by Zach Bijesse (CEO), Chioma Okotcha (COO), and Uche Nnadi (CTO), Payhippo\u2019s goal is to give African small businesses access to finance while at the same time helping them to build their credit history. Since its launch, the startup claims to have disbursed over 2,600 loans to businesses and is currently making a 25% M-o-M revenue growth.\n\nInterestingly, even though the startup began disbursing its first set of loans early in 2020 when the pandemic-induced lockdown crippled many businesses \u2014 leading to lay-offs, furlongs, and salary cuts, which inadvertently resulted in more load defaulters \u2014 it claims to have had a 97% repayment rate.\n\nCurious about how the team achieved this, Okotcha reveals to Techpoint Africa that this was possible by making sure requesting businesses are not over-financed to the point that they can\u2019t pay back. There\u2019s a process for this.\n\n\u201cAs a fintech company, the tech component of what we build is so important, because that\u2019s really what drives how we can access the credit readiness of that SME and how much to give them. The tech does all this calculation in the backend, works out the underwriting, evaluates who the customer, and we\u2019re able to give a loan that is within a safe range,\u201d she explains.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how the startup is able to help businesses build their credit scores since they won\u2019t have a problem when it comes to repayment.\n\nAlso, Okotcha considers the Payhippo repayment plan a rather flexible one as businesses only have to pay at the end of the loan cycle and not in instalments. This means it allows them to use the fund for what they needed it for before returning the principal and interest.\n\nLike how several collateral-free loan apps work, businesses can access higher amounts as their credit scores increase.\n\nGiving the size of Nigeria\u2019s informal sector and MSMEs making up 96% of the country\u2019s businesses, Payhippo wants to continue to leverage the over 37-million-SMEs market in Nigeria, knowing that funding is still a major hurdle for running any form of business in the country and this group happens to be more disadvantaged.",

          "title": "Flutterwave becomes one of Y Combinator\u2019s 40 most valuable private companies",
          "text": "Almost six months after its previous publication, on July 1, 2021, Y Combinator (YC), a US seed-stage accelerator, released its YC Top Companies list.\n\nThe accelerator gives reasons for this in a statement, \u201cYC companies raise money year-round \u2014 leading to the YC Top Companies list becoming outdated almost as soon as it\u2019s published. To combat this, moving forward, the list will be refreshed every six months, in February and July,\u201d\n\nThe list, which contains startups valued at over $150m or more, now features 163 companies, with 6 and 157 of them being public and private companies, respectively. Private companies valued at over a billion dollars (Unicorns) are now over 40 in number.\n\nOverall, the list features companies with a combined valuation of $400 billion. Airbnb is its most valuable public company ($93 billion on the New York Stock Exchange as at press time), and Stripe, its most valued private company ($95 billion).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the valuations of public companies are readily available on the stock market, the popular accelerator ranks private companies based on valuations from funding rounds no older than four years.\n\nWhile YC admits that valuations are a poor way to rank companies, it argues that it is the most commonly available metric to compare companies in the startup world. Other metrics, like revenue, are often kept private.\n\nIt also points out that the list is not exhaustive as YC alumni could opt out for any reason.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s unicorn status ranks it among the very top\n\nWhen Y Combinator published the first list of its most valuable companies in 2018, no African company made the 101-company list.\n\nIn 2019, a Nigerian fintech startup, Flutterwave, having raised $20m in total, ranked 97 out of 102 YC companies. This ranking put its valuation at slightly over $150 million.\n\nIn 2020, Flutterwave was once again the only African startup on the list. Despite raising a $35m Series B, it dropped 18 places to rank 115 out of 132 companies.\n\nThe 2020 list was notable for Nigerian fintech, Paystack\u2019s omission despite a $200m acquisition from Stripe.\n\nThe accelerator\u2019s top company list also features only Flutterwave from Africa this time around, but the company has moved 75 places to 40 out of 159 private companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company tops five other unicorns like San Francisco based Sift, Sendbird, and Lattice, which are all valued at over a billion dollars.\n\nNote: Flutterwave was 39 when this list first emerged, but it weirdly shifted down one place to 40 and has remained so as at press time.\n\nThis ranking follows the company\u2019s landmark $170 million Series C, which confirmed its unicorn status.\n\nSince that massive investment, the company has been in the media on the back of various partnerships, the most notable of them being one with Paypal that would enable Nigerian merchants to receive money from other countries across the globe.\n\nLike the previous list, Paystack is absent once again, and it might be due to any of the two reasons we stated in this piece:\n\nConsequently, the money that went to Paystack\u2019s cap table, besides retention bonuses or the value founders and investors received from the acquisition, was not up to $150 million. Or Paystack chose not to be listed for reasons best known to them.\n\nTwice a year, Y Combinator invests $125k (formerly $150k) in selected startups in exchange for 7% equity.\n\nPer YC\u2019s startup directory, it has invested in 2,609 startups since its inception in 2005, with almost 20% (514) becoming inactive in this period. To date, it has invested in 56 African startups.\n\nWhile companies like Flutterwave and Paystack might be some of its most successful stories, 3 of them \u2014 Petasales, Tress, and Passerine Aircraft \u2013have become defunct.\n\nKyane Kassiri, Rally Cap Ventures Venture Partner and Lateral Capital Investor, explained in this thread that while entering YC might be an excellent feat for African startups, it is not a measure of success. It also doesn\u2019t detract from the work of those that do not get in.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint reveals that 59% of startups that raised at least $1m in the past decade did not go through an accelerator.",

          "text": "On June 19, 2021, the world commemorated the 7th edition of the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict in a bid to address the rising incidents of sexual violence cases that followed lockdowns, curfews, and quarantines caused by the pandemic, as reported by the United Nations (UN).\n\nUp until now, several global bodies have been actively involved in setting up solutions to protect millions of people, especially vulnerable groups like women, against abuse and related cases, particularly at a time when more people spend longer time online.\n\nAnnounced today, July 1, 2020, during the UN Generation Equality Forum held in Paris, is the public commitment of four of the world\u2019s largest tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Twitter \u2014 to make their platforms safer for women. This is done in a bid to tackle online abuse against women and promote gender equality.\n\nThe outcome of these commitments would be the introduction of new systems or upgrade of existing ones to make reporting abuse more effortless and improve the overall online experience for women and girls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is interesting to know that this initiative, led by the World Wide Web Foundation, kicked off over a year ago to bring together stakeholders together to design solutions to address the challenge.\n\nEve Kraicer, Policy Officer, Gender and Data Rights at World Wide Web Foundation, explains to Techpoint Africa that during this period, the Foundation converged 120 experts from tech companies, civil societies, academia, and government of 35 countries to co-create solutions and prototypes to tackle online abuse.\n\nThe Foundation also sent out an open letter \u2014 co-signed by prominent women across six continents \u2014 to the CEOs of Facebook, Google, TikTok, and Twitter insisting that these companies must be deliberate about implementing processes that can lead to real change.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook has announced updates on what it is doing concerning women\u2019s online safety. Cindy Southworth, Head of Women\u2019s Safety at Facebook, diclosed in an official post the formation of a group of 12 nonprofit leaders, activists, and academic experts to help develop new policies, products, and programs that better support women that use Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram.\n\nFollowing this, the social media company also announced the launch of Women\u2019s Safety Hub, an online space for sharing information about tools and resources \u2014 on safety, policies, training, and tools \u2014 for women. It will be specifically opened to women journalists, public figures, and abuse victims.\n\n\u201cTo keep women safe from abuse, exploitation, and harassment online and offline, we regularly update our policies, tools, and technology in consultation with experts around the world \u2014including with over 200 women\u2019s safety organizations.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with other leaders and companies in the technology space to make the internet a safer place for all women across the globe,\u201d Antigone Davis, Global Head of Safety at Facebook, states in an official statement.\n\nKraicer believes that this public announcement would make the companies accountable while making others step up to the challenge. However, she adds that her organisation will be tracking the companies against their commitments and receive reports annually on their progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile acknowledging the peculiarities associated with different regions, Kraicer assures that solutions that will be built are expected to take into consideration how women in different parts of the world interact with the Internet.",

Charles Akhigbe, at the stakeholders\u2019 sensitization meeting at the Government House, Benin City, said the port would improve economic activities in the state and create thousands of jobs for Edo people, as well as Nigerians.\n\nStakeholders at the meeting include Okomu Plc, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Rongtai Industry, ESIPO and Zanithcarex Int\u2019l Limited, among others.\n\nAccording to Akhigbe, \u201cThis is a sensitization meeting to bring all the potential port users in Edo State together under one room, to sensitize them about the AMES-Edo Inland Dry Port and the commencement of operations at the dry port because they are the ones to use the dry port and need to know the stage the dry port is and at what stage to come in and commence operation with us.\n\n\u201cIt will be a customs port, and a lot of activities at the Lagos Port will be done here at Edo State, yielding huge resources for the state and the federal government. This is the first phase and other phases will follow for bigger companies, medium-sized companies and small-scale businesses that are all over the state, to start thinking export.\u201d\n\nHe further noted: \u201cWe need to galvanise our people here in the state to take advantage of putting quality edible products together, as we are blessed with agricultural products in Edo, as the port will enable the exportation of quality, safe food products to Africa and the rest of the world directly from Edo State.\n\n\u201cA lot of Edo businessmen are going through hard times through the Lagos Port. But with the Dry Port, no need to go through the Lagos Port but the Edo Dry Port. We need to make sure that the potential port users are aware of the development.\u201d\n\nAkhigbe said AMES-Edo Dry Port was established to provide a one-stop cargo reception and clearance facility to boost exports from and imports into Edo State particularly, Nigeria\u2019s South-South, South-East and some states in the middle belt region, by by providing proper handling and logistics services.\n\n\u201cArrangements are ongoing with the relevant authority for a dedicated cargo airplane that will be able to carry a maximum of 60 tonnes using both the Edo and Delta State Airports.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Government is facilitating the Ossiomo-Power to be connected to the Dry Port for 24/7 electricity supply to reduce cost and ensure that end-users and other stakeholders benefit.\u201d\n\n...",

Deporting him to Nigeria just because he was born in Nigeria, but not traveling on her passport, is unlawful under international law,\u201d Mr Ejimakor said in the letter to the British High Commissioner.\n\nThe lawyer said Mr Kanu\u2019s agitation for the independent state of Biafra \u201cthrough a referendum\u201d is considered a \u201cprotected political opinion\u201d under British and Nigerian laws.\n\n\u201cMr Kanu (should) be categorised as a high profile political prisoner or a prisoner of conscience and be thus rendered the highest diplomatic protection under municipal and international laws,\u201d he said.\n\nThe British High Commissioner, Ms Laing, on Thursday held talks with Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, on a number of issues, including the ban on Twitter by the Nigerian government.\n\nMr Kanu\u2019s arrest and detention was not on the agenda of the meeting, it appeared.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "title": "Opinion: Where did this Zulum emerge from? \u2013 By FEMI ADESINA",
          "text": "I know he is an academic, a Professor and former Rector of Borno State College of Agriculture. He was also Commissioner for Reconstruction under the immediate past Governor Kashim Shettima. But where did this man called Babagana Umara Zulum emerge from? How come he is doing unusual, uncommon things, and being very modest about it? Do they still make them like this?\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was in Maiduguri, Borno State, a fortnight ago to commission some (just some) projects already completed by the Zulum administration. It was like streams in a desert, a breath of fresh air in a milieu once overtaken by death and destruction, caused by the Boko Haram insurgency. The snake is badly scorched, but yet to be decapitated. Soon, and very soon.\n\nWith the state in which he inherited Borno State, which has been the epicenter of insurgency since 2009, it is easy, very easy, for Governor Zulum to have done nothing in terms of development. And he would have a good excuse, a smokescreen, an alibi. We are spending all the money to provide security for our people. They need to be alive first, before we can talk of development. And he would smile daily to the bank.\n\nBut the palm frond flourishes and luxuriates amidst thorns. Despite the humongous resources being deployed to combat insecurity, great developmental strides are also being taken, because Zulum is not squirreling everything away, building a tidy nest for himself and generations unborn.\n\nIt is said that while he was the Commissioner for Reconstruction, Zulum still lived in the family house. He hadn\u2019t built a home for himself. No wonder he became Governor, and is serving with heart and might, despite the grave challenges.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was a military governor of the old Borno State, had very kind words for Zulum when he visited. A man parsimonious with praises, the President said the host was forthright, resilient, and committed to development, despite the security challenges confronting the State.\n\nThe President said the Governor takes huge personal risks to promote peace and development, spending nights with the vulnerable and displaced. And I ask again: where did this man emerge from? It\u2019s never done like that here.\n\nAsk me for one of the \u2018poster boys\u2019 for the All Progressives Congress (APC), and I\u2019ll gladly show you Governor Zulum. It takes a heart dedicated to service to build roads, schools, hospitals, mass housing, and many others, that the President commissioned when he visited Borno. And the half has never yet been told.\n\nThe APC waxes stronger by the day. While the rival People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) waxes weaker and weaker. A topic for another day, but with Governors like Zulum, I\u2019ll put my money on the APC any day.\n\nWith public officers like Zulum, confidence is rekindled in Nigeria. Not everyone is a thief. Not everyone is a plunderer. Muhammadu Buhari, honest, straight as an arrow, is replicating himself in many people. Zulum seems to be one, and it makes one glad.\n\nIf what we see in Borno now happens under the miasma of insecurity, what will then happen when peace and amity returns, which will inexorably happen? Kashim Shettima, the immediate past Governor took great strides. He has bequeathed to the State a man taking giant strides. That\u2019s the way it should be. You don\u2019t succeed without a worthy successor.\n\nI know Governor Zulum. He has no airs around him. He\u2019s just like the man next door. Simple, self-effacing. True is the saying that it\u2019s the empty barrels that make the loudest noise.\n\nHe\u2019s young, focused, achieving. I suspect that Zulum , God willing, would be around for a long time to come, growing from strength to strength. I\u2019m not a prophet, but I believe that we would be hearing from this servant of the people for a lot longer time in the political realm.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n\u2018WARRIOR OF TRUTH AND TANGIBLE DEVELOPMENT\u2019: AN AWARD OF PURE JOY\n\nI have received scores of awards in my professional life, but this one is very significant. At a time some wailing wailers choose to make me object of hateful and derisive remarks (and me I merrily pick my teeth, ignoring them), a body known as Progressive Councillors Forum (PCF) has invested me with \u2018Warrior of Truth and Tangible Development\u2019 Award.\n\nThe association of past and present elected councillors nationwide, led by its Chairman, Sunday Yusuf Achor, was at State House, Abuja, to present the Award.\n\nI never knew the organization, but was told my name came up when they were considering Nigerians of note to honor. I couldn\u2019t have solicited for the award, neither did it cost me a dime. That is why it is highly appreciated.\n\nHear Mr Achor during the award presentation: \u201cWe see you as warrior of truth and tangible development, and have decided to give you this award as an encouragement.\u201d\n\nMr Achor added that those who don\u2019t seem to appreciate my service now, will realize it later.\n\nVery pleasant! Always great to be linked with Truth.\n\nRight was William Shakespeare when he said; \u201cLove sought is good, but given unsought is better.\u201d\n\nThanks PCF.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "I know he is an academic, a Professor and former Rector of Borno State College of Agriculture. He was also Commissioner for Reconstruction under the immediate past Governor Kashim Shettima. But where did this man called Babagana Umara Zulum emerge from? How come he is doing unusual, uncommon things, and being very modest about it? Do they still make them like this?\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was in Maiduguri, Borno State, a fortnight ago to commission some (just some) projects already completed by the Zulum administration. It was like streams in a desert, a breath of fresh air in a milieu once overtaken by death and destruction, caused by the Boko Haram insurgency. The snake is badly scorched, but yet to be decapitated. Soon, and very soon.\n\nWith the state in which he inherited Borno State, which has been the epicenter of insurgency since 2009, it is easy, very easy, for Governor Zulum to have done nothing in terms of development. And he would have a good excuse, a smokescreen, an alibi. We are spending all the money to provide security for our people. They need to be alive first, before we can talk of development. And he would smile daily to the bank.\n\nBut the palm frond flourishes and luxuriates amidst thorns. Despite the humongous resources being deployed to combat insecurity, great developmental strides are also being taken, because Zulum is not squirreling everything away, building a tidy nest for himself and generations unborn.\n\nIt is said that while he was the Commissioner for Reconstruction, Zulum still lived in the family house. He hadn\u2019t built a home for himself. No wonder he became Governor, and is serving with heart and might, despite the grave challenges.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was a military governor of the old Borno State, had very kind words for Zulum when he visited. A man parsimonious with praises, the President said the host was forthright, resilient, and committed to development, despite the security challenges confronting the State.\n\nThe President said the Governor takes huge personal risks to promote peace and development, spending nights with the vulnerable and displaced. And I ask again: where did this man emerge from? It\u2019s never done like that here.\n\nAsk me for one of the \u2018poster boys\u2019 for the All Progressives Congress (APC), and I\u2019ll gladly show you Governor Zulum. It takes a heart dedicated to service to build roads, schools, hospitals, mass housing, and many others, that the President commissioned when he visited Borno. And the half has never yet been told.\n\nThe APC waxes stronger by the day. While the rival People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) waxes weaker and weaker. A topic for another day, but with Governors like Zulum, I\u2019ll put my money on the APC any day.\n\nWith public officers like Zulum, confidence is rekindled in Nigeria. Not everyone is a thief. Not everyone is a plunderer. Muhammadu Buhari, honest, straight as an arrow, is replicating himself in many people. Zulum seems to be one, and it makes one glad.\n\nIf what we see in Borno now happens under the miasma of insecurity, what will then happen when peace and amity returns, which will inexorably happen? Kashim Shettima, the immediate past Governor took great strides. He has bequeathed to the State a man taking giant strides. That\u2019s the way it should be. You don\u2019t succeed without a worthy successor.\n\nI know Governor Zulum. He has no airs around him. He\u2019s just like the man next door. Simple, self-effacing. True is the saying that it\u2019s the empty barrels that make the loudest noise.\n\nHe\u2019s young, focused, achieving. I suspect that Zulum , God willing, would be around for a long time to come, growing from strength to strength. I\u2019m not a prophet, but I believe that we would be hearing from this servant of the people for a lot longer time in the political realm.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n\u2018WARRIOR OF TRUTH AND TANGIBLE DEVELOPMENT\u2019: AN AWARD OF PURE JOY\n\nI have received scores of awards in my professional life, but this one is very significant. At a time some wailing wailers choose to make me object of hateful and derisive remarks (and me I merrily pick my teeth, ignoring them), a body known as Progressive Councillors Forum (PCF) has invested me with \u2018Warrior of Truth and Tangible Development\u2019 Award.\n\nThe association of past and present elected councillors nationwide, led by its Chairman, Sunday Yusuf Achor, was at State House, Abuja, to present the Award.\n\nI never knew the organization, but was told my name came up when they were considering Nigerians of note to honor. I couldn\u2019t have solicited for the award, neither did it cost me a dime. That is why it is highly appreciated.\n\nHear Mr Achor during the award presentation: \u201cWe see you as warrior of truth and tangible development, and have decided to give you this award as an encouragement.\u201d\n\nMr Achor added that those who don\u2019t seem to appreciate my service now, will realize it later.\n\nVery pleasant! Always great to be linked with Truth.\n\nRight was William Shakespeare when he said; \u201cLove sought is good, but given unsought is better.\u201d\n\nThanks PCF.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Here is the full statement by DSS over the raid of Sunday Igboho\u2019s home in Ibadan in what it called a \u2018joint security operation on Thursday 1 July, 2021\n\n*PRESS BRIEFING AT THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE SERVICES (DSS) ABUJA ON A JOINT SECURITY OPERATION ON 1ST JULY, 2021 AT IBADAN, OYO STATE*\n\nIn the early hours (about 0134 hours) of today, 1st July, 2021, a joint team of security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo a.k.a. SUNDAY IGBOHO at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place. On approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be IGBOHO\u2019s guards. Six of them were armed with AK-47 guns and three others, with Pump-Action rifles.\n\n2. In the course of the exchange, two (2) of IGBOHO\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and is very stable.\n\n3. Afterwards, the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered the following among others:\n\ni. Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles;\n\nii. Three (3) Pump Action guns;\n\niii. Thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines;\n\niv. Five Thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition;\n\nv. Five (5) Cutlasses, One (1) Jack knife, One (1) Pen Knife\n\nvi. Two (2) Pistol holsters;\n\nvii. One (1) binoculars\n\nviii. A wallet containing Five (5) US Dollars in one (1) Dollar denomination; local and international driver\u2019s licences in his name, ATM Cards, a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name;\n\nix. Two (2) whistles;\n\nx. Fifty (5) Cartridges;\n\nxi. Eighteen (18) Walkie-Talkies;\n\nxii. Three Voodoo charm jackets/traditional body armour;\n\nxiii. Two (2) Laptops (One (1) Toshiba and One (1) Compaq); and\n\nxiv. His International Passport and those of many others (as displayed here). Further exploitation and forensic analysis are ongoing.\n\n4. Aside the items recovered from the building, about thirteen (13) suspects including twelve (12) males and one (1) female were arrested and brought to Abuja. While one suspect is being profiled, the other twelve (12) paraded here are:\n\ni. Abdulateef OFEYAGBE\n\nii. Amoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K (female)\n\niii. Tajudeen ERINOYEN\n\niv. Diakola ADEMOLA\n\nv. Abideen SHITTU\n\nvi. Jamiu NOAH\n\nvii. Ayobami DONALD\n\nviii. Adelabe USMAN\n\nix. Oluwafelumi KUNLE\n\nx. Raji KAZEEM\n\nxi. Taiwo OPEYEMI and\n\nxii. Bamidele SUNDAY.\n\n5. Highlights of this brief are to:\n\ni. Inform Nigerians and the world that Sunday IGBOHO and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order. This, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by IGBOHO and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\n\nii. Alert foreign missions and licencing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that IGBOHO could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\n\niii. Apprise stakeholders that the Five (5) AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building are suspected to be those collected by IGBOHO\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State.\n\n6. The gun duel which lasted for an hour offered IGBOHO the chance to escape. Sunday ADEYEMO a.k.a Sunday IGBOHO is now on the run. IGBOHO may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him. But this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him. And the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\n\n7. Consequently, ADEYEMO/IGBOHO is advised to turn himself in to the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful. He should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly.\n\n*Peter Afunanya, Ph.D*\n\nPublic Relations Officer\n\nDepartment of State Services\n\nNational Headquarters\n\nAbuja.\n\n1st July, 2021",

The 12 year old JSS 2 student was said to have died from hyperglycemia triggered by sepsis resulting from infection caused by a condom found in her.\n\nKeren\u2019s mother, Mrs. Akpagher had demanded justice for her child, who she believed was sexually abused before she was withdrawn from school on June 19th for treatment after she complained of redness of the eye.\n\nAccording to reports, Mrs. Akpagher said she immediately challenged the school authorities after an hospital report showed the cause of Keren\u2019s death, but the institution only promised to look into the matter.\n\nThe social media was thus awashed on Wednesday of Keren\u2019s demise, with an alleged plot of a cover up by the school.\n\nIn a statement made available on the school\u2019s official facebook page, the school management commiserate with Keren\u2019s family, stating that the case is being investigated by the police and the school is fully cooperating with law enforcement agents to get to the root of the matter.\n\n\u201cWe deeply commiserate with the family of Keren Akpagher, who was a student of Premier Academy Lugbe, Abuja until her demise on Tuesday 22nd June, 2021. Before her death, Keren Akpagher was an easy-going student who never appeared before the academy\u2019s disciplinary committee on any issue.\n\nAs a school, we are committed to ascertaining the cause of Karen\u2019s death because the life of every student at Premier Academy matters.\n\nLast week, Thursday, (24th June 2021), the school was invited to the FCT Police Investigation Department and a full-scale investigation commenced by the Police Investigation Unit.\n\nWe wish to clearly state that we will cooperate with the police unit as we are committed to ensuring that the actual cause of Keren\u2019s death is fully determined,\u2019\u2019 the statement read.\n\nThe school also enjoined the public to desist from making unfounded statements about Keren\u2019s death. \u201cSince the demise of Karen Akpagher, there have been speculations and unfounded statements concerning her death on social media especially on Whatsapp. We hereby inform the general public that whatever message they have come across on social media is unfounded,\u201d the school said.",

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has declared Sunday Adeyemo, a self-acclaimed activist popularly called Sunday Igboho, wanted.\n\nThe DSS declared him wanted at a press briefing where it confirmed gunning down two of Igboho\u2019s allies at his Ibadan residence.\n\nBut at a press briefing in Abuja on Thursday night, the secret police confirmed that it raided Igboho\u2019s residence.\n\nSpokesman of the service, Peter Afunanya, who addressed the media, also paraded no fewer than 12 suspects arrested during the operation.\n\nHe said Igboho is presently on the run but vowed that the government will definitely track him.\n\n\u201dIn the early hours (about 01:34 hours) of today, 1st July, 2021, a joint team of security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a SUNDAY IGBOHO at Soka Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\n\u201dThis was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place. On approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be IGBOHO\u2019s guards.\n\n\u201dSix of them were armed with AK-47 gun and Three others, with Pump-Action rifles.\n\n\u201dIn the course of the exchange, two (2) of IGBOHO\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested.\n\n\u201dOnly one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has, however, received medical attention and is very stable.\u201d\n\nThe DSS spokesman added that the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered some weapons.\n\nAfunanya stressed, \u201dThe gun duel which lasted for an hour offered IGBOHO the chance to escape. Sunday ADEYEMO a.k.a Sunday IGBOHO is now on the run.\n\n\u201dIGBOHO may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him. But this will be the end of his shenanigans.\n\n\u201dSoon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him. And the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\u2019\n\n\u201dConsequently, ADEYEMO/IGBOHO is advised to turn himself in to the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful.\n\n\u201dHe should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe secret police listed weapons recovered as: Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles; Three (3) Pump Action guns; Thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines; Five Thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition; Five (5) Cutlasses, One (1) Jack knife, One (1) Pen Knife; Two (2) Pistol holsters; One (1) binoculars; A wallet containing and Five (5) US Dollars in one (1) Dollar denomination.\n\nOthers are: local and international driver\u2019s licences in his name, ATM Cards, a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name; Two (2) whistles; Fifty (5) Cartridges; Eighteen (18) Walkie-Talkies; Three Voodoo charm jackets/traditional body armour; Two (2) Laptops (One (1) Toshiba and One (1) Compaq); and His International Passport and those of many others (as displayed here).\n\nHe stated that side the items recovered from the building, about thirteen suspects including twelve males and one female were arrested and brought to Abuja.\n\nHe said while one suspect is being profiled, the other twelve (12) paraded here are: Abdulateef OFEYAGBE, Amoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K (female), Tajudeen ERINOYEN, Diakola ADEMOLA, Abideen SHITTU, Jamiu NOAH,Ayobami DONALD, Adelabe USMAN,Oluwafelumi KUNLE, Raji KAZEEM, Taiwo OPEYEMI and Bamidele SUNDAY.",

          "text": "PRESS BRIEFING AT THE NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE SERVICES (DSS) ABUJA ON A JOINT SECURITY OPERATION ON 1ST JULY, 2021 AT IBADAN, OYO STATE\n\nIn the early hours (about 0134 hours) of today, 1st July, 2021, a joint team of security operatives raided the residence of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo a.k.a. SUNDAY IGBOHO at Soka, Ibadan, Oyo State. This was based on intelligence that he had stockpiled arms in the place. On approach to the residence, the team came under heavy gun attack by nine (9) men, suspected to be IGBOHO\u2019s guards. Six (6) of them were armed with AK-47 gun and Three (3) others, with Pump-Action riffles.\n\n2. In the course of the exchange, two (2) of IGBOHO\u2019s armed men were gunned down while the rest were subdued and arrested. Only one operative who was shot by the assailants on his right hand sustained injury. He has however received medical attention and is very stable.\n\n3. Afterwards, the team procedurally searched the house and subsequently recovered the following among others:\n\ni. Seven (7) AK-47 assault rifles;\n\nii. Three (3) Pump Action guns;\n\niii. Thirty (30) fully charged AK-47 magazines;\n\niv. Five Thousand (5,000) rounds of 7.62mm ammunition;\n\nv. Five (5) Cutlasses, One (1) Jack knife, One (1) Pen Knife\n\nvi. Two (2) Pistol holsters;\n\nvii. One (1) binoculars\n\nviii. A wallet containing Five (5) US Dollars in one (1) Dollar denomination; local and international driver\u2019s licences in his name, ATM Cards, a German residence permit No. YO2N6K1NY bearing his name;\n\nix. Two (2) whistles;\n\nx. Fifty (5) Cartridges;\n\nxi. Eighteen (18) Walkie-Talkies;\n\nxii. Three Voodoo charm jackets/traditional body armour;\n\nxiii. Two (2) Laptops (One (1) Toshiba and One (1) Compaq); and\n\nxiv. His International Passport and those of many others (as displayed here). Further exploitation and forensic analysis are ongoing.\n\n4. Aside the items recovered from the building, about thirteen (13) suspects including twelve (12) males and one (1) female were arrested and brought to Abuja. While one suspect is being profiled, the other twelve (12) paraded here are:\n\ni. Abdulateef OFEYAGBE\n\nii. Amoda BABATUNDE aka Lady K (female)\n\niii. Tajudeen ERINOYEN\n\niv. Diakola ADEMOLA\n\nv. Abideen SHITTU\n\nvi. Jamiu NOAH\n\nvii. Ayobami DONALD\n\nviii. Adelabe USMAN\n\nix. Oluwafelumi KUNLE\n\nx. Raji KAZEEM\n\nxi. Taiwo OPEYEMI and\n\nxii. Bamidele SUNDAY.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Highlights of this brief are to:\n\ni. Inform Nigerians and the world that Sunday IGBOHO and his group, in the guise of campaign for self-determination, have become well-armed and determined to undermine public order. This, the arrests and seizures are, no doubt, a confirmation of a grand plan by IGBOHO and his cohorts to wage a violent insurrection against the Nigerian State.\n\nii. Alert foreign missions and licencing authorities within and outside Nigeria about this development and the possibility that IGBOHO could declare some of his personal permit and identity cards missing in order to seek their replacement.\n\niii. Apprise stakeholders that the Five (5) AK-47 assault rifles recovered from the building are suspected to be those collected by IGBOHO\u2019s men from Nigerian Customs and Immigration personnel at Idi Iroko, Ogun State.\n\n6. The gun duel which lasted for an hour offered IGBOHO the chance to escape. Sunday ADEYEMO a.k.a Sunday IGBOHO is now on the run. IGBOHO may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him. But this will be the end of his shenanigans. Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him. And the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.\n\n7. Consequently, ADEYEMO/IGBOHO is advised to turn himself in to the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful. He should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly.\n\nPeter Afunanya, Ph.D\n\nPublic Relations Officer\n\nDepartment of State Services\n\nNational Headquarters\n\nAbuja.\n\n1st July, 2021",

No one, no matter how highly placed, is bigger than the country,\u201d the Minister said during the briefing.\n\n\u201cThere have been speculations on how this re-arrest was pulled off and in which country the hitherto fugitive leader of the proscribed IPOB was nabbed. What we can tell you, once again, is that the re-arrest was made possible by the diligent efforts of our security and intelligence agencies, in collaboration with countries with which we have obligations. We continue to respect and honour the obligations.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mr Mohammed, the federal government was on Mr Kanu\u2019s trail for over two years assuring he will be treated fairly.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt will interest Nigerians to know that for over two years, our security and intelligence agencies were on the trail of the proscribed IPOB leader as he lived a five-star life across several countries, travelling on chartered private jets, living in luxury apartments, and turning out in designer clothes and shoes. Of course, as we all saw, he was wearing an attire made by Fendi, a luxury Italian fashion brand, when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cHowever, I can assure you that the fair deal that Kanu denied many of the victims of the violence which he willfully instigated through his broadcasts and tweets will not be denied him.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Nigerian security and intelligence agencies, who collaborated to re-arrest Mr Kanu in one of the \u201cmost classic operations\u201d of its type in the world.\n\n\u201cWe commend the professionalism, diligence, patriotism, and painstaking efforts of our security and intelligence agencies.
