          "text": "By Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA\u2013 A total sum of N6,396,159,060.00 has been approved by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund, TETFund, for 217 research proposals.\n\nThe approval, according to the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Professor Suleiman Bogoro,was in a\u00e7cordance with the recommended of the National Research Fund,NRF, under the 2020 grant cycle exercise.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps extend teachers retirement age\n\nHe disclosed this at the inauguration of the Fund\u2019s National Research Fund Screening and Monitoring Committee,NRFS&MC, and Technical Advisory Group,TAG, in Abuja.\n\nHe said the amount approved under the grant cycle that was concluded in January 2021, almost equalled the N6.7 billion that was disbursed for 240 research grants between 2012 to 2019.\n\nHis words : \u201cFrom 2012 to 2019, a total of 240 Research Grants have been awarded at a total cost of N6,708,367,736.25.\n\n\u201cAlso in 2020, a key development in the NRF grant administration was the introduction of an Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) to automate the hitherto manual processes associated with receiving and processing of Concept Notes and Research Proposals.\n\n\u201cThis was done with a view to entrench and sustain the culture of efficiency and effectiveness in the process of awarding the NRF Grant and in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cThe 2020 NRF Grant Cycle Exercise was concluded in January 2021 with a total of 217 Research Proposals recommended for Grant Award at a total cost of N6,396,159,060.00.\u201d\n\nBogoro, who has embarked upon a paradigm shift that has flipped the list of intervention areas in TETFund, catapulting research to the top spot, posited that Research and Development (R&D) holds the massive key for the nation\u2019s rapid development.\n\nHe said the TETFund National Research Fund intervention line was introduced in 2009 as a Special Intervention Programme, aimed at promoting the conduct of applied research and innovation by academics in public tertiary educational institutions and research institutes.\n\n\u201cIn order to actualize these objectives, the TETFund Board of Trustees set up the NRF Screening and Monitoring Committee (NRFS&MC) and charged it with the responsibility for implementing and administering the intervention.\n\n\u201cA seed fund of N3 billion was approved by the Board of Trustees in 2011 for the initial take-off, augmented with an additional N1 billion in 2015. Upon my reinstatement in 2019, we transformed the NRF into an annual intervention and enlarged the funding envelope to N5 billion. As at the 2020 iteration of the NRF Grant Cycle, we had increased the funding pot to N7.5 billion.\n\n\u201cFor 2021, we have made available N8.5 billion, indicating a clear progression and our determination to keep moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWhile saying that the NRF intervention is primarily targeted at researchers in public tertiary education institutions, Bogoro said private universities can now take advantage of the fund by teaming up with eligible beneficiary institutions to compete for research grants.\n\nHe, however, charged members of the committee to live above board, warning that TETFund\u2019s would not hesitate to wield the big stick against erring member as two members were fired from the previous committee for compromising standard.\n\nBogoro listed the terms of reference of the NRF and Monitoring Committee to include : \u201cPre-qualify applications for research grants from academics in Beneficiary Institutions to ensure that they are in compliance with the approved templates for accessing the TETFund NRF Grant.\n\n\u201d Categorize pre-qualified Research Proposals into streams and disciplines to aid the appointment Assessors/Reviewers;\n\nRecommend pre-qualified and categorized proposals; among others.\n\nThe TETFund boss also listed the term of reference of TAG as\n\n\u201cscreen proposals on manuscripts for development into academic textbooks and advise TETFund on fundable manuscripts.\n\n\u201cScreen and advise TETFund on submissions from Professional Associations to support production of Journals.\n\n\u201d Recommend reviewers for screened manuscripts for engagement by TETFund for technical assessment of the manuscripts.\n\n\u201cAdvise the Fund on how to enhance and improve the production of quality academic books, journals and other academic learning materials.\n\n\u201cReview materials for journal publication from relevant professional bodies; and advise the Fund on development and sustainability of the Academic Publishing Centres (APC) being sponsored by the Fund.\u201d\n\nInaugurating the NRFS&MC and TAG, Chairman, Board of Trustees of TETFund, Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, commended Bogoro for his passion on R&D.\n\nKashim-Imam, who said no country in the world has developed without prioritising R&D, assured that the Board of Trustees would continue to focus strategic attention on R&D as well as other areas to usher in the desired development in the country.\n\nThe TETFund\u2019s Board of Trustees chairman said apart from the various infrastructural developmental projects being executed by the agency, N30 billion would be spent on training of academic staff in 2021.\n\nHe said : \u201cThis is our 10th anniversary because TETFund is 10 years old and TETFund has impacted most positively in every aspects of the development of tertiary education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur budget for this year alone is N300 billion. The figure for R&D grew from N5 billion to N7.5 billon in 2020 to N8.5 billion for the year 2021\u2026..\n\n\u201d In the related field of academic staff training and development, TETFund is spending N30 billion this year; training universities scholars as well as scholars from polytechnics and the colleges of education for higher degrees of master\u2019s and PhDs.\u201d\n\nExpressing satisfaction on the transformation of public tertiary institutions by TETFund, Kashim-Imam said the agency would soon commit more resources to its various interventions lines following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s commitment to increase education spendings by 50 per cent during the London Education Summit.\n\nWhile saying members of the Technical Advisory Group and National Research Fund Screening and Monitoring Committee were selected on merit, Kashim-Imam however, expressed concerns on the quality of research being churned out by some beneficiaries of TETFund\u2019s grants.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough that we adequately funding research, we are concerned, and I am speaking for the Trustees in particular, about the quality of the research, about getting value for the money you have been appropriating for the research, about you spearheading the drive to take this country to the next step. It is a very critical assignment,\u201d Kashim-Imam said.\n\nResponding on behalf of the newly inaugurated National Research Fund Screening and Monitoring Committe, its chairman Professor Abubakar Kundiri, promised that the members would give their best to achieve the assigned tasks.\n\nKundiri also vowed that no stone would be left unturned to effectively strengthen the monitoring of TETFund\u2019s research grants.\n\nOn his part, the chairman of the Technical Advisory Group, Professor Charles Awo, assured the readiness of his team to serve according to its mandate.\n\nRepresented by the Vice Chairman of TAG, Professor Nasir Meturare, Awo commended TETFund for the confidence reposed on members of the group, assuring to live up to expectations.\n\nThe inaugurated National Research Fund Screening and Monitoring Committee have two years life span.",

They have, through their votes, democratically made their choice of who governs them for the next four years.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n\u201cThough the outcome of the election might not have swung the way some individuals, especially those within the political circles, desired but Ndi Anambra have spoken and their choice must be respected and accepted.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that I call on all Ndi Anambra, irrespective of political affiliations, to put politics and issues of the election behind and come together as one people that we are, and join hands with Prof. Soludo to chart a new course for our dear state.\n\n\u201cI implore contenders who are hurting over the outcome of the election to sheathe their swords and put aside all personal interests for the sake of Ndi Anambra.\n\n\u201cI urge such persons to rather put their eyes on the larger picture of the yearning of our people for peace, political stability, economic recovery, infrastructural development and security of lives in our state.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative that we avoid the distractions of election litigations. Such will be counter-productive to the aspiration of our people to get our state working again. What we need at this moment is to concentrate our energies on moving our state to greater heights.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, I charge Prof. Soludo to ensure a true Anambra leadership by running an effective administration that will efficiently galvanize and harness the best hands so as to move our state forward. We expect the return of the real expatriate community to Onitsha and other prominent cities of the state.\n\n\u201cProf. Soludo is reminded that the burden before him is a very onerous one. Ndi Anambra looks up to him to unite the people and return Anambra state to her pride of place as the flagship of development in our country.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I congratulate you, Mr. Governor-elect and wish you a successful tenure in the service of the people of Anambra State,\u201d the statement read.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Kpedi & Co, to the Deputy Inspector General of Police, FCID, Abuja, which was minuted to the AIG Enugu Annex of FCID in charge of South-East and South-South, the Ogbe family of Ugbuwangue- Warri, headed by Mr. Benson Odunometa, accused the ex-Reps member, Reyenieju of forceful entry into the land and threat of life of the head of the Ogbe family, Mr. Odunometa, in a bid to spuriously claim ownership of the land.\n\nThe Ogbe family claimed in the petition to the police that Rejenieju with his thugs forcefully entered the disputed land with swamp buggy to clear the land and fenced it despite the stiff opposition of the family and police warning for his to desist from the encroachment.\n\nMr. Odunometa alleged that Rejenieju and four other mentioned suspects have been threatening his life which has made him become afraid of the safety of his life.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, therefore, we are sincerely appealing to you to intervene in this matter by detailing some of your officers and men to get the said Hon. Daniel Reyenieju and others to your office for a thorough and discreet investigation of this matter so that our client can get justice,\u201d the law firm wrote to the Police.\n\nThe petitioners further revealed that they had earlier dragged Hon. Reyenieju to the Police Zone 5 Headquarters in Benin City, Edo State, where Reyenieju was warned by the police to steer clear from land but he resumed aggressive development on the land in January 2021.\n\n\u201cOn September 2021 our client went to the aforesaid land where Hon Daniel Reyenieju used rod to hit him several times but fortunately our client held his hands on his head and the rod hit his hands and he started using the road to hit the back of our client and other young men used sticks and planks to severally beat up our client, he almost passed out but he managed to escape to safety,\u201d part of the petition read.\n\nBut Hon. Reyenieju, when contacted, told DAILY POST that he was not aware of any petition in Enugu.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any petition,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked whether police asked both parties to maintain the status quo, he quipped: \u201cI want to ask you- is the police a court that they now adjudicate on a civil matter, a land issue? You as a professional should know that you shouldn\u2019t ask me such a question.\n\n\u201cCan the police ask me not to go into the land I have purchased? If anybody has an issue the person should go to court. Why are they making the police useless?\u201d\n\nOn the alleged threat to life, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what they are talking about. They are in court already, I\u2019m ready to face them in court; the case they are talking about has gone from one police unit to another here in Warri Delta State, two DPOs, to the Area Command here in Warri, to Asaba to the AIG\u2019s office in Benin. They keep shopping from one police unit to another, maybe they will go to Cameroun the next time to get the police.\n\n\u201cWhy will someone all the way from Warri, by-pass the Area Command, by-pass Asaba, all the way to Enugu, why didn\u2019t the police question that, if they are doing their investigation? If I were the commissioner of police in Enugu, I would ask them to take it to the Area Command in Warri or the Commissioner of Police in Delta.\n\n\u201cWhy will the police get involved in this kind of thing? The police is an institution we all ought to respect, but when people start shopping from one place to another, it is wrong.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nThe Senate, yesterday, said a joint panel recovery unit of the Ministry of Justice, comprising the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), police and Ministry of Justice, was behind the invasion of the Abuja residence of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court.\n\nIt said the establishments sought a search warrant from an FCT Magistrate for the operation after \u201ca so-called whistleblower claimed to have observed illegal activities allegedly going on in a house at Imo street, Maitama.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nIt condemned the invasion and demanded that all those involved be apprehended and prosecuted.\n\nAttorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had denied involvement in the raid. Malami and Usman Baba, inspector-general of police (IGP) have ordered probes into the incident.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nHowever, at yesterday\u2019s plenary, the upper legislative chamber condemned the invasion and mandated the IGP to make public all findings of investigation into the matter.\n\nIt commended the police for making arrests and constituting a panel to investigate the raid on Odili\u2019s residence.\n\nThese formed part of resolutions reached by the Senate, following a point of order raised by Betty Apiafi during plenary. While coming under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, she moved a motion on the \u201cUrgent need to investigate the invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s residence by security agents.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker, in her motion, noted that on October 29, 2021, security operatives invaded the home of Justice Mary Odili, the second most senior judicial officer in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe senate is worried that this incident brings back to mind similar invasion of homes of some senior judicial officers, including chief judges of the Supreme Court and judges of the Federal High Court in Abuja and other parts of the country in October 2016, which was widely condemned.\n\n\u201cFurther worried that the home of such a highly revered judicial officer could be raided in such a manner by security agents. The senate is disturbed that 11 days after the incident, though the Inspector General of Police claims some arrests have been made and investigations are still ongoing, even though the details of such arrest have not been made public.\u201d\n\nMichael Bamidele, who chairs the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, said no member of the upper chamber \u201cwas at ease hearing the news of what happened.\u201d\n\nHe said the motion presented by Apiafi represented the collective desire of members of the National Assembly in ensuring that the government takes appropriate steps to bring to book all those found culpable. He said doing so would send a clear signal on the need to respect the sanctity of the judiciary and to also protect judicial officers in Nigeria, whose rights under the law must be protected.\n\nGeorge Sekibo recalled that the Port Harcourt residence of Justice Mary Odili was invaded a couple of months ago.\n\n\u201cSeveral reasons were given why thugs invaded the house. I don\u2019t want to mention the reasons so that it does not bring in controversy. Recently, as the motion said, the house in Abuja was also invaded. (And) then after a struggle, the security agents that invaded the place left the residence. They claimed to have brought a warrant from a Magistrates Court in Abuja. They claimed the Minister of Justice was aware of it. There are several claims. The minister of justice has denied and dissociated himself from that, the chairman of EFCC has also done that. I have read statements by the Inspector General of Police that he has made some arrests and that they are investigating the matter. My problem is this; oftentimes, things happen and then police investigates, and in most cases, we don\u2019t get the result of the investigation. I pray that this investigation comes to limelight.\u201d\n\nThe senate asked the IGP to disclose the findings of the investigation as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has charged the IGP to investigate the circumstances leading to the disappearance of Mr. Tordue Salem, an Abuja-based Vanguard newspaper reporter.\n\nThis followed the adoption of a point of order by Orker-Jev Emmanuel Yisa (Benue- North).\n\nCiting order 42 and 52 of the Senate Rules, Yisa said Salem, before his disappearance, was a journalist with the Vanguard newspaper covering the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cOn October 13, between 8-9p.m, Salem went missing and all phone contact with him ceased.\u201d\n\nHe said efforts by his family, friends and colleagues to trace his whereabouts have proved abortive. He, however, expressed optimism that the intervention of the senate would persuade the police to get to the root of the matter.\n\nSimilarly, the House of Assembly charged various security agencies to probe the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the journalist.\n\nIt mandated its Committees on National Security and Intelligence, Police, Defence and Interior to interface with security chiefs and report back to the House within two weeks.\n\nThe House, while describing the journalists disappearance as worrisome, expressed dismay with the spate of insecurity in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, stating that the city had become unsafe with kidnappings and banditry becoming regular occurrences.\n\nThis followed the adoption of a motionby the minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu titled: \u201cA Case of Missing Journalist, Need to Investigate Circumstances Surrounding the Disappearance.\u201d\n\nElumelu, in his lead debate, said it was imperative for security agencies to take urgent steps to stem the disappearance of innocent Nigerians in Abuja.\n\n\u201cMr Tordue Salem is a member of the House of Representatives press corps and he reports for the Vanguard Newspaper. Mr Salem reported for work at the National Assembly premises on Wednesday the 13th of October and was last seen in Garki District of FCT before his alleged disappearance same day.\n\n\u201cHis disappearance was immediately reported to the relevant security agencies as all efforts by both friends and family to reach him have been abortive. In spite of official effort by the leadership of the House to galvanise the security agencies at promptly resolving his disappearance, there\u2019s been no headway. This sudden disappearance is an extension of the deteriorating state of insecurity in the nation\u2019s capital and again questions the efficiency of the country\u2019s security operatives.\n\n\u201cIf necessary measures are not put in place to curtail the indiscriminate disappearance of innocent Nigerians living in Abuja , the federal capital may soon become a breeding ground for kidnappers and bandits, hence the need for an urgent investigation.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "CBN Unveils Strategy to Cut Wheat Importation by 60% in Two Years",
          "text": "\u2022Initiative to save $2bn FX annually\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday flagged-off the first ever rain-fed wheat programme in the country, which aims to slash the importation of the commodity by 60 per cent in two years.\n\nThe initiative is also expected to save the country $2 billion annually in foreign exchange.\n\nSpeaking in Jos, Plateau State, during the unveiling ceremony for the Nigerian Brown Revolution, which is a central bank wheat value chain intervention, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said following the successes in the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), the apex bank decided to extend the gains recorded in the rice and maize value chains to wheat production.\n\nHe said the plan was to ultimately eliminate wheat importation or reduce it to an insignificant contributor to the country\u2019s total food import bill, adding that the wheat programme would benefit over 150,000 farmers.\n\nHe also said the programme would be implemented in 15 states on about 180,000 hectares of land.\n\nEmefiele said the programme would address the impact of wheat importation on foreign exchange.\n\nRepresented at the occasion by CBN Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Directorate, Mr. Edward Adamu, the CBN governor said the country spends about $2 billion annually importing 5.2 metric tonnes of the commodity to meet local demand.\n\nHe said the programme was expected to add about 2,000 metric tons of seeds to the nation\u2019s national seed stock and potentially add 750,000 metric tons of wheat to national output annually through rain-fed wheat cultivation in Plateau, Mambila Plateau and Obudu Plateau in the short-term.\n\nEmefiele, however, pointed out that wheat remained the third most widely consumed grain in the country after maize and rice.\n\nHe said the country only produces about one per cent (63,000 metric tons) of the 5-6 million metric tons of the commodity consumed annually in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the enormous demand-supply gap was bridged with over $2 billion spent annually on wheat importation, making wheat the second highest contributor to the country\u2019s food import bill.\n\nHe said given the high growth rate of the country\u2019s population and the demographic structure, the demand for wheat was projected to continue to rise, thereby intensifying pressure on the country\u2019s reserves unless a decisive step is taken to grow the commodity locally.\n\nEmefiele, also pointed out that over the years, the availability of low-yielding seeds variety locally and poor agronomic practices had hampered successful cultivation of wheat in the country, leading to low productivity as well as making wheat production unappealing to farmers and unattractive for private sector investment.\n\nHe added that the CBN, in order to change the narrative and leverage domestic production to bridge the demand-supply gap in the country, decided to add wheat to the list of focal commodities to be supported under the bank\u2019s agricultural intervention programmes.\n\nHe stressed that improved seeds varieties constituted the bedrock of any crop production process, adding that the country had made some progress with regards to acquisition of high yielding varieties from Mexico with potential average yield per hectare of 5-7 metric tons as against a range of 0.8-1.8 metric tons yield per hectare of those varieties previously cultivated.\n\nEmefiele said the two-pronged approach of seed multiplication and grains production already adopted is expected to sustain the propagation of seeds and guarantee availability of high-yielding seeds to farmers.\n\nHe said the CBN\u2019s strategy for the wheat value chain involved\n\nensuring availability of high-yield seeds by financing seed multiplication and establishment of seed ripple centres.\n\nOther are expanding land under cultivation for wheat to a capacity that could meet total national demand through association and collaboration with relevant federal agencies and state governments.\n\nHe said the strategy was to also pursue strategic collaboration with key stakeholders in the wheat value chain for sustained local production.\n\nEmefiele, however, said food security remained a major delivery for governments across the globe, hence the bank was supporting the efforts of the federal government by providing affordable and accessible financing options to drive domestic food production.\n\nHe said the ABP remained a game changer in financing smallholder farmers through innovative funding models centred around building an effective agro-ecosystem, hinged on the value chain approach.\n\nHe said the ABP had recorded successes in supporting smallholder farmers to increase the cultivation of different commodities across the 36 States of the federation including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe governor said through the programme, N788.035 billion had been disbursed to about four million farmers through 23 Participating Financial Institutions (PFI).\n\nHe said so far, 4.796 million hectares of farmlands had been cultivated under the programme covering 21 commodities.\n\nHe said the flag-off of the wheat programme was auspicious in a lot of ways as it heralds the commencement of the Brown Revolution Journey, which is the CBN\u2019s mantra for repositioning wheat production in the country.\n\nHe said it was also the first major wet season wheat production in the country with about 700 hectares put under cultivation in Kwall, Kassa, Jol, Kafi Abu and Sop in Jos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe CBN will not rest on its oars as we continue to work with our partners, Lake Chad Research Institute (LCRI), to expand the frontiers of wheat production in Nigeria to areas like northern Oyo, Kogi and Kwara states.\n\n\u201cThe wheat fields you are seeing here today are historic and further underscore the enormous potentials in our agricultural landscape.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that with the right technology and agronomic practices, we can change the narratives and develop two wheat cropping cycles to support an aggressive drive to bridge the wheat demand-supply gap in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I want to use this opportunity to thank the chairman of INEC and his team for this opportunity given to me and my university to partake in this Anambra 2021. I thank the service chiefs, the people of Anambra State. We remain very grateful.\n\n\u201cAllow me to read this form EC8E, which I have completed. I Prof Florence Banku Obi, hereby certify that I\u2019m the returning officer of the Anambra governorship election held on 6 and 9 of November.\n\n\u201cThat Charles Chukwuma Soludo of APGA, having satisfied the requirement of the law, is hereby declared the winner of the election,\u201d Prof. Obi said,\u201d Obi said.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Soludo, charged his competitors to accept the verdict of the Anambra people, promised never to disappoint his people.\n\n\u201cTo my fellow candidates in the election, I wish to congratulate you for the gallant contest. Our people have spoken overwhelmingly and surely, that voice is the voice of God. The ultimate winner is the Anambra people.\n\n\u201cWe are all winners. I hereby extend my hands of fellowship to all of you. I need all of you to succeed. Politics aside, we are all brothers. Let\u2019s come together for the Anambra project. There is enough room for everyone to contribute for the service of our land. I will need the guidance and contributions of everyone to succeed.\n\n\u201cWith utmost humility and gratitude to God, I accept the result of the 2021 Anambra Governorship election as declared by INEC. This reflects the supreme will of the almighty God and an overwhelming sacred mandate of the people. For 12 years since the massive clamour by the people of Anambra for us to serve them, we persevered till this divine moment.\n\n\u201cThis is a divine journey, whose time has come. To God be all the Glory and adoration. We have a very long list of persons, who God used to make this divine moment a reality.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we thank all APGA members, especially, our national leader, Willie Obiano and his wife; our national chairman, Chief Victor Oye and his wife; members of our Board of Trustees; members of our National Executive Council, state exco, etc, for availing me the opportunity to fly the APGA flag.\n\n\u201cMany thanks to our legal team and all other stakeholders that worked tirelessly to see us through. We are grateful to the clergies, the churches, traditional rulers, labour, youths and non-indigene associations, businessmen, persons with disabilities, those in the diaspora and all our donors.\n\n\u201cWe are humbled by the massive support from stakeholders across the entire country. In particular, I thank my wife and children for their love and sacrifices. As I promised, I will work hard every day never to disappoint you.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, we must remember and will continue to remember all those who died in the course of this movement, especially, the three policemen, who were killed by unknown gunmen during our town hall meeting with youths in my ward. May God continue to grant their soul eternal rest.\n\n\u201cThis election tested the resilience and integrity of our federal institutions. Many times, there were tensions, especially as one party boasted that it must \u2018take or conquer.\u2019 This has proven that this country can achieve anything. The judiciary stood for the integrity of that institution and we salute them for standing up for justice.\n\n\u201cWe thank President Buhari and our security agencies for ensuring a level-playing field. We must particularly, commend the Chairman, management of INEC for systematically striving to bequeath a legacy of free, fair and transparent electoral system to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a former chairman of APGA, Senator Victor Umeh, while reacting to the victory, said the election was transparent, and is the best election so far held in the state.\n\n\u201cWe have again won the state, despite the fact that some people boasted that they will win the state. This is to tell them that APGA is on ground, and it is not just about boasting of winning, but doing your homework well. I urge them to concede victory to our party and the candidate, because the people made a clear choice.\u201d\n\nThe Anambra governorship election was on Sunday declared inconclusive by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) after voting could not hold in Ihiala, a local government area of the state, with some 148,000 registered voters, following alleged violence.\n\nThis, however, was after Soludo, had surpassed the constitutional threshold and was on the cusp of victory, having cleared 18 out of the 21 local government areas in the state.\n\nBut, with 18 local governments in the bag for APGA and Soludo; Nnewi North for Ifeanyi Ubah and YPP, and Ogbaru for Valentine Ozigbo and PDP, Soludo had only led Ozigbo, who turned out his closest challenger, with about 45,000 votes, when Ihiala alone had over 148,000 registered voters.\n\nThe collation officer for Ihiala had, however, alleged that the election was marred by violence, a development he claimed made voting to be impossible, before it was moved to yesterday.\n\nYet, with 18 local governments to APGA\u2019s credit, Soludo not only crossed the threshold, he also led convincingly, making his win incontrovertible.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the results, local government by local government, capturing the four major parties of APC, APGA, PDP and YPP.\n\nIn Dunukofia LGA: APC, 1991; APGA, 4124; PDP, 1680 and YPP 1360.

In Ekwusigo LGA: APC, 1237; APGA, 2570; PDP, 1857 and YPP, 727. In Nnewi South LGA: APC,1307; APGA, 3243; PDP, 2226 and YPP, 1327. In Awka North LGA: APC, 755; APGA,1908;\n\nPDP, 840 and YPP, 381. In Anambra West LGA: APC, 1233; APGA, 1918; PDP, 1401 and YPP, 357.\n\nMeanwhile, the last leg of voting in the governorship election, held amid mixed occurrences.\n\nThe election had been suspended in Ihiala by the Independent National Electoral Commission ((INEC) on Saturday, when the rest of the state went to the poll. This followed reports of irregularities, which caused INEC to declare the Anambra State governorship election inconclusive, and postpone voting in the local government area, with 323 Polling Units, to today.\n\nThe election process was, however, threatened, when gunmen suspected to be operatives of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), said to be the armed wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), engaged the joint security operatives in a gun battle in Ihiala. It was gathered that the gunmen sought to enter Ihiala through Imo State, as Mbosi and Orsumoghu, where the attack happened, were border towns with communities in Imo State.\n\nIPOB Attempt to Scuttle the Vote in Ihiala\n\nA THISDAY reporter, who covered the supplementary governorship election in Ihiala, was prevented from entering the area by security operatives, who turned back journalists at Mbosi/Orsumoghu junction for their safety. After a brief search, they asked the journalists to return, on the insistence that a gun battle was on, ahead.\n\nThe joint security operatives comprised mobile policemen, Army and Navy personnel, and others security agencies. Two unidentified policemen and a soldier, told the THISDAY reporter, \u201cYou have to go back for your own good. For three hours now, we have been exchanging fire with your IPOB brothers. Our men are in the bush now, and it will be risky for you to take this route.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Anambra State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Echeng Eworo, could not confirm the development, but merely asked the reporter to call him back later.\n\nTHISDAY also noticed a team of security men loaded into 10 Toyota Hilux vans, heading to Mbosi/Orsumoghu junction as reinforcement.\n\nThe police in Anambra State have denied knowledge of the killing of anybody during the supplementary election in Ihiala. This was after claims on the social media that soldiers guarding the distribution/Collation Centre shot dead a yet-to-be-identified man.\n\nWhen THISDAY visited the local government headquarters, those interviewed denied knowledge of the incident. Even when contacted by telephone, the Zone 13 Police Headquarters Public Relations Officer, Nkeiru Nwode, said there was nothing like that before the police.\n\nNwode said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have such report and I don\u2019t think something like that happened.\u201d\n\nBut the voting process was largely peaceful, as in the main election.\n\nThe candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr. Obinna Uzor, a lawyer, voted in Umunnamehi Primary School, Ihiala Ward One. Uzor said the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, (BVAS) in the area was slow, and that caused a lot of delay.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is only VIPs that when they cannot be captured, they continue to wait to ensure that they eventually get captured and vote. But the locals among us, once they cannot be captured, they just leave. We love technology, but INEC should fine-tune it. This can affect the outcome of the process.\u201d\n\nIn Ihiala town, INEC officials depended on facials to accredit voters, using the BVAS.\n\nAn INEC official, who spoke to journalists in Eziani Primary school, Ihiala ward one, polling unit 10, on condition of anonymity, said, \u201cThe thumbprint is not functioning, but the facial verification is what we are using to issue out accreditation.\u201d\n\nThe INEC technical officer, however, said it took between 30 seconds and one minute to accredit one voter, and the process progressed speedily.\n\nDeputy Speaker of Anambra State House of Assembly, Hon Pascal Agbodike. Agbodike commended the functioning of the BVAS machine for its swiftness in accrediting voters.\n\nAgbodike, who spoke to journalists after voting at Mbosi Girls Secondary School, said the BVAS machine functioned very smoothly.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have voted, and I have also observed voting in my ward, Mbosi ward 20, and I can say that the working of the BVAS is perfect for now. Things are going well and the BVAS is working, from what I can attest for now.\n\n\u201cAnambra people are largely peaceful people, and you can see that everything is going on well. Whether election or not, our people are their brothers\u2019 keepers. Whatever you may have experienced is just because of politics. After the election, we will all go back to being brothers as we have always been.\u201d\n\nA visit to Mbosi community, ward 20, showed that voting started early.\n\nA technical officer with INEC, who preferred anonymity, said the voting went on well.\n\nThe officer said, \u201cWe started voting about 12pm, and there is satisfactory level of turnout. The Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machine is working perfectly today. We updated our software and today, it is not taking up to one minute to accredit one voter.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, security operatives also barred Umeh, from entering Ihiala, during the election.\n\nThere had been restriction of movement in and out of Ihiala, with stern looking military operatives manning the boarders of the community.\n\nUmeh, who hails from Aguluzoigbo in Anaocha Local Government Area, was said to have entered Ihiala, but when he attempted to enter the local government secretariat, where materials for the election were being distributed, security operatives barred him.\n\nUmeh, a state agent of the party, who arrived Ihiala secretariat around 10:30am in company with other party members, was turned back by the GOC, 82 Division, who said he was at the secretariat to ensure things went well.\n\nAccording to the GOC, the former lawmaker had no business being at the secretariat as he was a state agent.\n\n\u201cYou are not supposed to be here. You are a state agent, not LGA agent,\u201d the senior military officer stated.\n\nINEC had notified all stakeholders in the election that collation of results would resume at 9pm at the State Collation Centre, INEC State Office, along the House of Assembly Road, Awka.\n\nIn another breath, the immediate past convener of the Civil Society coalition, Situation Room and the Executive Director of the Policy and Legislative Advocacy Centre (PLAC), Mr. Clement Nwankwo, has urged INEC to do a review of the processes leading to the deployment of BVAS.\n\nNwankwo said the commission should consider a review of its strategies for movement of sensitive materials for election, adding that the current logistics arrangement is very disappointing.\n\nSpeaking on the ARISE Television News Channel, Morning Show, programme, Nwankwo said the introduction of BVAS was an innovative effort, which was in line with the desire of Nigerians to enthrone a transparent electoral process.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the experience wasn\u2019t nice and going forward, the shortcomings will serve a useful lesson to see what needs to be done to improve on the use of electronic means in the conduct of elections.\u201d\n\nNwankwo spoke of the security situation in Anambra State, adding that contrary to widespread fears over a possible outbreak of violence and serious breach of peace during the election, such incidents were minimal. He said it was necessary for the security agencies to review their strategy of heavy deployment of security forces in the South-east.\n\nThe Situation Room said it observed late commencement of voting in the rescheduled election.\n\nA statement issued by the Convener of the Situation Room, Mrs. Ene Obi, on Tuesday, said voting was yet to commence as at noon, and a few voters were seen arriving and leaving the polling units ahead of the arrival of the INEC ad hoc staff.\n\nObi said, \u201cReports received from Ihiala LGA indicate late deployment of materials and INEC staff from the LGA office. At 10am, which was the scheduled start time, there was no sign of INEC staff and voting materials at any of the polling units.\n\n\u201cSituation Room notes that voting is starting more than two hours late on the average due to late deployment of voting materials and INEC ad hoc staff. INEC will need to extend the time beyond 4pm to ensure all the voters, who have come out to vote actually cast their votes.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Wants IG to make outcome of investigation public\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nThe upper chamber of the National Assembly yesterday condemned the invasion of the Abuja residence of Supreme Court Justice, Mary Peter-Odili, by security operatives.\n\nThe Senate, which urged the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, to make public, all findings of investigation into the matter, commended him for making arrests and constituting a panel to investigate the raid on the Odili\u2019s jurist residence.\n\nThe resolutions followed a point of order raised by Senator Betty Apiafi, during plenary which came under order 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, to move a motion on the \u201cUrgent Need to Investigate the Invasion of Justice Mrs. Odili\u2019s Residence by Security Agents.\u201d\n\nLeading debate on the motion, Apiafi noted that on October 29, 2021, security operatives invaded the home of the Supreme Court Judge, adding that Justice Odili is the second most senior judicial officer in Nigeria.\n\nShe recalled that a joint panel recovery unit of the Ministry of Justice, comprising of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Nigerian Police and the Ministry of Justice, purportedly sought for a search warrant from an FCT Magistrate after a so called whistleblower claimed to have observed illegal activities allegedly going on in a house at Imo street, Maitama.\n\nAccording to the ranking Senator, the incident, brings back to mind the similar invasion of homes of some senior Judicial Officers, including Chief Judges of the Supreme Court, and Judges of the Federal High Court in Abuja and other parts of the country in October 2016, which was widely condemned.\n\n\u201cFurther worried that the home of such a highly revered judicial officer could be raised in such a manner by security agents.\n\n\u201cThe Senate is disturbed that eleven days after the incident, though the Inspector General of Police claims some arrests have been made and investigations are still ongoing, even though the details of such arrest have not been made public.\n\nContributing to the motion, Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele, said no member of the upper chamber \u201cwas at ease hearing the news of what happened.\u201d\n\nHe added that the motion presented by Senator Apiafi, represents the collective desire of members of the National Assembly in ensuring that the government takes appropriate steps to bring to book all those found culpable.\n\nAccording to him, doing so would send a clear signal on the need to respect the sanctity of the Judiciary and to also protect Judicial Officers in Nigeria, whose rights under the law must be protected.\n\nOn his part, Senator George Thompson Sekibo (PDP, Rivers East), recalled that the Port Harcourt residence of Justice Odili was invaded a couple of months ago.\n\nHe said: \u201cSeveral reasons were given why thugs invaded the house. I don\u2019t want to mention the reasons, so it does not bring in controversy.\n\n\u201cRecently, as the motion said, the house in Abuja was also invaded. And after a struggle, the security agents that invaded the place left the residence.\n\n\u201cThey claimed to have brought a warrant from a magistrate court in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThey claimed the Minister of Justice was aware of it. There are several claims.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Justice has denied and dissociated himself from that, the Chairman of EFCC has also done that.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve read statements by the Inspector General of Police that he has carried some arrests and that they are investigating the matter.\n\n\u201cMy problem is this, oftentimes, things happen and then police investigates and, in most cases, we don\u2019t get the result of investigation.\n\n\u201cI pray that this investigation comes to limelight.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the Senate in its resolutions condemned the invasion of the home of the second and most senior judicial officer in Nigeria, Justice Odili.\u201d\n\nHe also commended the Inspector General of Police for the arrests already made and investigation panel he has instituted and further urged him to, \u201cmake public the outcome of investigations.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How to secure funding for your early-stage startup in Africa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Ayobami Olajide and Ayobamigbe Teriba. Ayobami and Ayobamigbe work with Ingressive Capital, a venture capital firm that writes up to $400K cheques to early-stage startups.\n\nYou\u2019re a startup founder. You have overcome every self-doubt standing in the way of you launching out; you have invested painstaking hours in defining your idea and building out your solution. You are convinced your solution is what the market needs.\n\nDefinitely, without your solution in the market, the total user experience will be a notch lower. Now there\u2019s only so much you can do with your resources; you need some capital injection to supercharge your operations and expand into new markets. You are thinking of raising capital, but you\u2019re unsure of which is easier: meeting and convincing investors or getting a donkey to pass through a needle\u2019s eye?\n\nThe truth is, there has been an influx of investors and investment activity on the continent. Disrupt Africa reported a 68.4% jump in the number of investors in 2020 (370 investors) from 2019\u2019s reported number of 261 investors. This figure still doesn\u2019t capture in totality the number of angels involved in these deals. Three hundred and ninety-seven companies secured $701.5 million in investment in 2020. By the first half of 2021, African startups had raised $1.19 billion based on an index from Maxime Bayen. Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya trapped most of the capital flowing into the continent. Long story short, the uptrend continues, meaning there\u2019s capital for you.\n\nHow can you partake of this money rain?\n\nWhat are you building?\n\nCapital activities always follow momentum, simply put, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Sometimes it may be geographical (Egypt, Latin America, etc). Other times, it\u2019s sector-based: Fintech has been of serious obsession with venture capitals (VCs) and even institutions. Investors typically depend on signals like increased liquidity events in a particular geography or sector to plug into the next big thing.\n\nFor startups operating in the middle of the current market obsession, like BNPL and other startups in the fintech spectrum, it may be relatively easier to raise money than others. Well, there are thematic funds that cater to startups in specific sectors.\n\nWho should you be talking to?\n\nAt the initial stage of your company, you should connect more with other founders building infrastructure for what you are building. Also, you need to prioritise taking feedback from customers you are serving in a bid to achieve product-market fit (PMF). Once PMF is achieved, your startup should begin to see some traction.\n\nAccelerators\n\nYou can then consider applying to startup accelerators. Startup accelerators like Y Combinator and TechStars have become incredible partners to the growth of the African startup ecosystem. Y Combinator, for example, boasts of backing up to 15 African startups per batch. Edtech startups can consider applying to Injini; fintechs can apply to the African Fintech Foundry. Of general interest can be Google for Startups, Antler, xx.team, and the like.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t get into an accelerator, you can simulate an accelerator experience for yourself by talking to founders building global solutions in your space. We see this with Shola Akinlade of Paystack\u2019s engagement with Stripe leading to its eventual acquisition for $200 million. Engaging global founders is important in the sense that it would help you develop a local playbook based on global perspectives. Also, it puts you on their radar for investment opportunities from their corporate vehicle or angel checks from the founder.\n\nVenture Capital Firms\n\nWhile a lot of founders defer to this as a first option, it is important to note that VC engagement must be precluded by traction recorded in your startup, e.g., Trade Depot and its founders scaled the venture to a good traction point. VCs are unlikely to invest in idea-stage startups. For example, Ingressive Capital\u2019s investment criteria only caters for post-launch and post-revenue startups. The same goes for a number of VC firms in the ecosystem.\n\nAs a founder, it is important to familiarise yourself with the theses of venture capital firms you want to approach. Here are those of Future Africa and Ingressive Capital. You may get pointers for fit between the VC firm and your startup through a thesis alignment check or examine previous round announcements to see the kind of firms and the stage that VC firm typically invests in.\n\nYou can also evaluate your startup-VC fit based on the value-add they bring to your company beyond money. You must ask if they offer portfolio company support, follow-on investments or referrals, strategic market access, etc.\n\nYou can get the attention of VCs through their online events majorly co-hosted by the general partners of the fund\u2014Is My Idea Fundable? with FirstCheck Africa, Let\u2019s Talk with Microtraction), Invest in the Future with Future Africa), and How I Got Funded (Ingressive Capital).\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHow should you, and other founders, navigate the capital sourcing process?\n\nInteracting with investors need not inspire fear, provided that you are ready. First, it is necessary to engage and interact with investors to create a human connection. Investors invest in persons they are familiar with.\n\nIt is important to get your pitch ready. Vary your pitch to include a one-liner, an elevator pitch and an extensive one, with the aid of a deck. Your investment pitch deck should address the pivotal questions of the problem, why the problem matters, your solution, and the market opportunity (total addressable market).\n\nFurthermore, your pitch should emphasise how your solution measures against current market players. To achieve this, dedicate a section to competitive analysis in terms of product offerings and pricing.\n\nInvestors are often regarded as catalysts not creators. They use capital to supercharge your operations and help you achieve scale. It is important to show traction you have recorded in terms of user growth and financials tracked month-on-month (MoM) or quarterly growth for startups less than a year or year-on-year for older startups.\n\nHave a data room where investors can easily access your financial records, financial forecasts, incorporation documents, product demos, team bio and pitch deck. Fundraising is often a nerve-racking period in a founder\u2019s journey but it can prove to be very definitive. Founders must be willing to go all out and give it all it takes. As the legendary Yoda said, \u201cDo or do not. There is no try.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With the adoption of blockchain and the tech it creates, crypto has given rise to exciting innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFT), decentralised finance (DeFi) and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).\n\nEmerging economies have experienced an explosion in the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology, but a new startup wants to bring more people into the fold by lowering the barrier for entry.\n\nThe brainchild of Taiwo Orilogbon and Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin is a parent company that wants to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nNestcoin wants to help Nigerians first, then other Africans, \u201cexit the status quo\u201d by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi.\n\nIt wants to do this through its media publication, Breach, and other products that use crypto technology\u2014spanning across DeFi, media, digital art and gaming.\n\n\u201cThe products we build are tools of individual freedom and creative expression,\u201d said Bademosi in a call with TechCabal.\n\nTapping into Africa\u2019s deepening crypto culture\n\nBademosi and Taiwo\u2019s ambition is rooted in their rich history in Africa\u2019s crypto space. While Taiwo is a former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Bundle Africa, a Nigerian crypto exchange, Bademosi has been investing in crypto companies since 2017. He was among the earliest investors in Nigerian crypto exchange, Buycoins, which is now under a new parent company, called Helicarrier.\n\nBefore Nestcoin, Bademosi was a former director at Binance\u2019s venture capital programme. In 2019, he got seed funding from the same programme to launch a payment app in Nigeria, Bundle.\n\nAt Bundle, Bademosi said he realised the entry point is the same as the ceiling when interacting with crypto in Nigeria: trading it. So, he set out to create innovative products beyond this ceiling.\n\nBut before Binance Labs, he\u2019d begun his career in venture capital as the founding partner at Microtraction, one of the most active investors in African early-stage startups now.\n\nUsing education to drive up crypto adoption\n\nAfrica is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency among the regions, according to a survey by Chainalysis, a US-based research institute. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. This represents a 1,200% growth. Despite this, however, Africa is still the smallest crypto economy of all the regions, the institute studied. Africa received just 3% of the total value of crypto in the world.\n\nCiting data from crypto exchange, Luno, that 55% of Nigerians do not use crypto because they don\u2019t understand it, Bademosi admitted that crypto is still confusing to a lot of people.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to close that information gap in terms of trying to make crypto more relatable and familiar,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nImage source: Nestcoin\n\nAs part of efforts to drive crypto adoption using education, Nestcoin is setting up Breach to create content that explains complex crypto topics like DeFi, Blockchain, DAOs, DApps, NFTs and more to novices.\n\nBreach, officially launched today, is a platform that uses newsletters and blog posts to make easily digestible content that will help everyone make sense of the crypto world. Spearheaded by media analyst and former head of communications at Eko Atlantic City, David Adeleke, who will now be managing editor for Breach and communication lead for Nestcoin, Breach intends to make crypto mainstream and help people jumpstart their crypto careers.\n\nIncentivising the crypto community\n\nNestcoin wants to create a community of users that understands crypto, as a way to make their lives easier. Nestcoin will then harness the power of this community to create new products and embark on projects that can generate revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s a community that we want to incentivise and reward for their participation,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nNestcoin is also creating avenues for users to make money by getting them to play games on the blockchain and invest in digital art.\n\n\u201cThe community will be able to play crypto games that have the potential of helping them earn more than in their day jobs,\u201d Bademosi said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa-based MTN Group has announced plans to sell 575 million shares of its most profitable subsidiary MTN Nigeria, which went public in Lagos in 2019.\n\n\u201cToday we announce our intention to proceed with a public offer for sale of up to 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria, by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price to retail investors,\u201d the company said in a notice filed with the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe offer is anticipated to open in November 2021 with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price is expected to be announced for retail investors also in November 2021. The offer is expected to close in December 2021.\u201d\n\nThe transaction will see MTN Group rake in proceeds of about \u20a6101 billion ($245 million), based on MTN Nigeria\u2019s (MTNN) current share price of \u20a6175.60. Hours after the announcement, the stock rose around 8% to \u20a6191.\n\nA Bit of History\n\nThe planned sell-off is part of a broader intention, announced by MTN Group earlier, to sell down 14% of its current shareholding in the Nigerian unit. That will see its holdings in MTNN reduce from 76% to 62%.\n\nWhile MTN Nigeria is the group\u2019s largest and most profitable subsidiary, the telecom giant has had to deal with a number of billion-dollar disputes with the Nigerian government as well as faced significant macroeconomic challenges.\n\nLast year, the Johannesburg-based group was unable to repatriate its $280 million dividend from its Nigerian subsidiary due to the challenges of securing foreign currency, amid the country\u2019s forex liquidity crisis.\n\nThe share sale thus raises questions about the group\u2019s intentions as it appears to be a gradual exit from the Nigerian market due to a lack of confidence.\n\nAlthough the divestment helps the South African giant slightly reduce its exposure to headwinds in the Nigerian economy, the sell-down does not signal an exit from Nigeria, according to Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer.\n\n\u201cSince its 2019 listing by introduction, the group has planned to sell part of its stake but held on due to market conditions,\u201d Omole told TechCabal. \u201cThe sale is part of its asset realisation programme (ARP) meant to simplify its portfolio, focus on its pan-Africa strategy, and free up capital for improved allocation.\u201d\n\nBetween January and September 2021, MTN Group saw its revenue grow to $8.2 billion, driven by success in some of its main markets, including Nigeria.\n\nDespite the domestic challenges, MTN Nigeria has shown resilience.

          "title": "Lemonade Finance raises money to ease diaspora remittances",
          "text": "Despite multiple international remittance products available for Africans to move money in and out of the continent, processing international payments is still far from painless.\n\nThat\u2019s why Lemonade Finance, a Nigerian startup that wants to ease the payment process for Africans in North America and Europe, was founded.\n\nTo extend its services to more Africans in the diaspora, the startup has just raised $725,000 in pre-seed funding, with participation from Y Combinator and the venture capital firms, Microtraction, Ventures Platform and Acuity Venture Partners, among several other individual investors.\n\nFounded in October 2020 by Ridwan Olalere, who left his job as Country Head of Uber Nigeria, and Rian Cochran, former Director of Finance at Opera Software AS, Lemonade Finance was built to be \u201ca borderless money app for Africans\u201d.\n\nOne of its investors, Dayo Koleowo, Managing Partner at Microtraction, says \u201cLemonade\u2019s solution is very timely. As a multi-currency financial service provider, they make it easy for the African diaspora to send and receive money from their new country of residence, which is remarkable. We believe Rian and Ridwan have the technical and financial know-how to provide the number one cross-border neobank for Africans in the diaspora.\u201d\n\nDo we need yet another remittance solution?\n\nWhen Africans want to send or receive money to or from their family, dependents, children studying overseas, or businesses domiciled in Africa, they have few options and encounter problems.\n\nBefore Lemonade, Western Union, PayPal and MoneyGram are some of the products Africans already use to process payments. But these options are typically expensive, take weeks to process payments and restrict customers from certain locations from using their services. For example, PayPal allows Africans living in Africa to receive but not send money.\n\nWith Lemonade, users do not have to go to the bank, and within minutes, they can send and receive payment.\n\nAfricans need access to more than one currency\n\nTo allow Africans to use their money seamlessly, Lemonade Finance has provided them with access to currencies that matter to them, notably the currency of the country they are in and that of their home country.\n\nThis is a big deal for Africans in the diaspora who have businesses in Africa but want to move their money in foreign currencies. Currently, if an African wants to change their foreign currency to that of the home currency in order to, for example, pay for their parents\u2019 healthcare, they have to deal with unfavourable rates and the length of time it takes for the exchange to take place.\n\nOlalere and Cochran say that the flexible solution Lemonade provides is intentional and at the core of the team\u2019s thinking in building the app.\n\n\u201cBefore now, when Africans living in Africa moved to the diaspora, they could only create a bank account with the currency of their new country or the US dollar. While some can use their phone numbers to operate an African bank account, like with Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), others have to travel back home to renew their token,\u201d said Olalere.\n\nImage source: Lemonade Finance\n\nLemonade Finance wants to ensure that a Nigerian who resides in the UK, for instance, can open a Nigerian account and save money in naira as well as pounds without leaving the UK.\n\nLemonade Finance faces regulatory and compliance problems. The startup has to go the extra mile to prove they are worthy of licenses in European and North American countries. This is because global banks have put African countries on a restricted list, preventing individuals and payments companies from sending money to Africa.\n\nBut Lemonade Finance is dedicated to letting global banks know that lowering financial barriers into Africa is a beneficial and strategic move. They have been able to get some of their partner banks to green-light Nigeria, Kenya, Cameroon and some other West African countries. Yet, even as these global banks have enabled this financial access, they charge customers making transactions to African countries a higher fee. They also place restrictions on the number of days or hours it takes for the money to reach Africa.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, what we are constantly doing is fighting for everyday Africans to be globally included financially,\u201d Olalere said.\n\nOlalere revealed that the company\u2019s biggest milestone happened earlier this year when they acquired a license in the UK, approved by the FCA, without stepping foot in the UK.\n\nThis is why this funding round, according to Olalere, is important. It will help them upgrade and get new licences like the VMI license that allows them to hold wallets. This funding round will also help them hire for roles in the regulatory and compliance department, which will ultimately increase their customer base and allow them to reduce fees for customers.\n\nCurrently, Lemonade Finance is only live in Canada, where it has gained thousands of customers already. In a few weeks, it will allow users in the UK to send and receive money from Ghana and Kenya; and in December, users in the US will be able to send and receive money from over 10 African countries at once.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "What you need to know about the world\u2019s four oldest universities\n\nIt is believed that university education was first located somewhere in the territories of ancient Greece or Europe since knowledge originated from there and having renowned scholars and inventors such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle among others.\n\nBut even though knowledge originated from the Greeks or Europeans, Africa standardized it by being the first pioneer in the establishment of first world\u2019s universities.\n\nFrom a research report by Erudera, the world\u2019s first education research platform, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt and Mali are the top four countries with the oldest universities in the world that are still in operation today.\n\nFurther finding of these universities showed that they were public ones and were first built as Madrasa, an Islamic college before subsequently becoming a university.\n\nOn this note, BusinessDay will be profiling each of these universities in the particular order they were established. They are:\n\nEz-Zitouna University\n\nEz-Zitouna was first established in 737AD as a madrasa Islamic college and subsequently as a university in 1956.\n\nThe university located in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia has produced notable and renowned scholars like Ibn Khaldun, an Arab sociologist, philosopher and historian who has been described as the percussive founder of the proto-disciplines that would become historiography, sociology, economics, and demography.\n\nAlso, Aboul-Qacem Echebbi, a Tunisian poet probably best known for writing the final two verses of the current National Anthem of Tunisia, Humat al-Hima (Defenders of the Homeland).\n\nThe present-day institution has about 1,200 undergraduate students, 350 postgraduates and 90 academic staff, divided between two associated institutes \u2014 the Higher Institute of Theology and the Higher Institute of Islamic Civilization in Tunis \u2014 and a research institution, the Center of Islamic Studies Salem Bouyahia (President).\n\nStarting from the 13th century, Tunis became the capital of Ifriqiya under Almohad and Hafsid rule. This shift in power helped Ez-Zitouna to flourish and become one of the major centres of Islamic learning, and Ibn Khaldun, the first social historian in history was one of its products.\n\nThe flourishing university attracted students and men of learning from all parts of the known world at the time. Along with theology; mainly the Qur\u2019an, the university taught jurisprudence, history, grammar, science and medicine.\n\nWhen it comes to books and libraries, Ez-Zituna libraries were the richest among their North African counterparts. It had several collections totaling in the tens of thousands of books. One of its libraries, el-Abdaliyah included a large collection of rare and unique manuscripts.\n\nThe manuscripts covered almost all subjects and sciences, including grammar, logic, documentations, etiquette of research, cosmology, arithmetic, geometry, minerals, and vocational training, among others.\n\nRead also: Competence-based education way forward for Nigeria- Nwachukwu\n\nUniversity of al-Qarawiyyin\n\nUniversity of al-Qarawiyyin, located in Fez, Morocco is known to be one of the leading spiritual and educational centres of the historic Muslim world.\n\nIt was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri, an Arab woman in 859 who is believed to have used the money inherited from her father to build the Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque.\n\nThe mosque building itself is a significant complex of historical Moroccan and Islamic architecture encompassing elements from many different periods of Moroccan history.\n\nIt was later incorporated into Morocco\u2019s modern state university system in 1963 and was officially renamed University of Al Quaraouiyine two years later.\n\nThe university is attended by students from all over Morocco and Muslim West Africa, with some also coming from abroad. As at 2012, the university has about 8,120 students and 708 administrative staff.\n\nTeaching is still delivered in the traditional methods as students are seated in a semi-circle position around a sheikh who prompts them to read certain texts, asks them questions, and explains difficult points to them.\n\nEducation taught at the university concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and Maliki Sharia, although lessons on other non-Islamic subjects are also offered to students.\n\nAl-Azhar University\n\nLocated in Cairo, Egypt, this university is renowned as the most prestigious university for Islamic learning.\n\nThe university attracts 30,000 students yearly from over 100 different countries. Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian business mogul and Africa\u2019s richest man studied Business at Al-Azhar University.\n\nAl-Azhar was first built as a mosque in 970 AD during the Fatmid era, a dynasty of Arab origin and became a Sunni institution after the conquest by Saladin in 1171. Al-Azhar is inclusive of the four major Sunni schools of law, the Ashari and Maturidi schools of theology, and seven major Sufi orders.\n\nIn 1961, under Law 103, the state of Egypt turned al-Azhar into a state-owned university as this was meant to modernise al-Azhar and to introduce an up-to-date curriculum, which included subjects such as medicine, engineering and economics.\n\nSankore Mosque and University:\n\nThe Sankore University was founded in 989 AD by Mansa Musa, the richest man in history.\n\nLocated in Timbuktu, Mali, this university started off as an Islamic school inside the masjid, went on to become one of the largest universities in the world at the time, hosting in its height 25,000 students and a library of 700,000 manuscripts, making it the largest library in Africa since the library of Alexandri.\n\nThe curriculum consisted not just of Islamic subjects, but science, mathematics, philosophy, astronomy and even the occult science and medicine.\n\nFor example, recent studies have shown a mathematics test that was used to teach the students studying in this university 600 years ago.\n\nAnd when this text was translated from Arabic into French, and sent to Sorbonne University in Paris. They confirmed that the level of mathematics being taught 600 years ago at this university was equivalent to the second year of their mathematical degree programme which is one of the hardest to get into in France and in the western world.",

Five years ago, she ditched the smoke that came with it; now it is back.\n\nHigh prices for smokeless liquid petroleum gas (LPG) have forced Adunni and many like her to add wood and charcoal to their cookstands. She had dropped them in 2016 amid a government campaign to improve public health.\n\n\u201cGas is costly, that is why I am using firewood,\u201d she told Reuters in the teeming Computer Village, explaining that LPG had helped her breath more easily and cooked her food faster.\n\nBurning LPG emits around 50% less carbon than charcoal, and 20% less than heating oil, and switching to the gas is a central plank of carbon reduction plans of Africa\u2019s most populous nation, where more than 200 million people live.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari referenced cleaner cooking in his speech last week at the COP 26 climate summit, but LPG prices have risen by 60% over the past year in the biggest city Lagos, where inflation is in double-digits and unemployment is rising.\n\nMany women like 73-year-old Abdul, who spend hours inside kitchens and at roadside cooking stands, feel they have no choice but to burn wood or charcoal, even though experts say it damages their health and also drives deforestation. read more\n\nNigeria\u2019s LPG use faltered in 2020 after nearly 10 years of growth, according to World LPG Association data. In 2018, only about 5% of Nigerians used LPG for cooking, while 73% relied on charcoal or biomass like wood, according to the latest figures from the International Energy Agency.\n\nLagos charcoal seller Jerry Inyang said now sells as many as 90 packs of charcoal a day, triple last year. Household demand began faltering in 2020, according to the World LPG Association, and while data for 2021 is not yet available, the Nigeria LPG Association (NLPGA) said the country is at risk of reversing the LPG use gains it has made.\n\nNLPGA deputy president Felix Ekundayo said a global power crunch that boosted U.S., European and Middle Eastern LPG prices to a near seven-year high was a major factor behind Nigeria\u2019s rising prices.\n\nDespite having extensive gas reserves, Nigeria lacks the infrastructure to exploit much of it, and burns some 400 million cubic feet of gas as waste every year.\n\nEkundayo said a falling naira and recently added 7.5% LPG import tax was adding to the strain. NLPGA has called on the government to scrap the tax, which was added amid a government push for revenue.\n\n\u201cThe time at which gas is displacing other dirty fuel, that is not the time to have inconsistent policy,\u201d Ekundayo said.\n\nA variety of factors are discouraging LPG imports, which account for 65% of the market in Nigeria. This has resulted in excess demand for domestic supplies, the Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, said Monday.\n\nCustomers are currently paying more than triple what they were charged in January, with a 12.5-kilogram cylinder now costing up to 10,200 naira ($25), the group also known as NALPGAM said.\n\nThe \u201cgalloping prices\u201d mean Nigerians \u201care reverting to the use of kerosene, charcoal and firewood\u201d despite the \u201cobvious health and environmental implications,\u201d NALPGAM said in an open letter to the minister of state for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva.\n\nWhile Nigeria is Africa\u2019s largest crude producer, with even more abundant gas reserves, most of its gas output is burned off as a waste product or re-injected into wells due to lack of infrastructure to exploit the resource.\n\nOnly about 17% of the population cook with gas with the majority of households dependent on firewood-or charcoal-fueled stoves, according to a 2020 report by the country\u2019s statistics agency.\n\nImporters have \u201cvirtually stopped\u201d bringing in LPG due to challenges with accessing foreign-exchange, rising international gas prices and anticipation that value-added tax and customs duties will be reimposed, according to NALPGAM.

          "title": "MTN Nigeria, Airtel PSBs to create 1m direct jobs",
          "text": "Following the granting of approval in principle (AIP) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), MTN Nigeria and Airtel now have about six months to become licenced Payment Service Banks (PSBs).\n\nApart from helping to include 40 million adult Nigerians outside the financial services industry, the move could create over 1 million direct jobs in 2022.\n\nMTN Nigeria and Airtel combined boast 124.6 million voice subscribers and 96.1 data subscribers. Apart from that, MTN Nigeria through its MoMo Super Agent network has amassed 230,000 agents across the country, and given its experience as the second-largest mobile money operator in Africa, after Safaricom, deploying the same service in Nigeria would not be so difficult for the telco.\n\nThe telco is expected to grow its agent network from 230,000 in order to deepen its mobile money presence across the country. Airtel would plug into its large population of airtime resellers to quickly grow its agent network. This is the same strategy it deployed in nearly all the 14 African countries where it currently operates mobile money services.\n\nThe model would also attract hundreds of young unemployed Nigerians providing the telco with over 100,000 banking agents. MTN Nigeria and Airtel could also be the push Globacom needs to launch its mobile money operations after one year of securing the licence.\n\nThe CBN wants to provide access to financial services to 95 percent of Nigerians who are not financially included by 2024. In the past, the CBN has pushed the commercial banks to lead the financial inclusion campaign and the result has not been as the apex bank expected.\n\nRead Also: MTN, Airtel mobile money licences to benefit 40m unbanked Nigerians\n\nThe banks did make an effort with the establishment of the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) with banks like First Bank acquiring the largest agent footprint of all the banks in Nigeria and recording $16.2 billion in agency banking transaction in 2020, and Access Bank adding 4.46 million new customers through its agents over the last two years.\n\nWhere the banks were unable to close the gap, the CBN sought help from fintech companies by issuing different mobile banking licences, including payment service licences. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and Kuda are some of the companies that now command significant numbers of banking agents and presence across Nigeria.\n\nDespite the efforts, millions of Nigerians continue to exist outside the financial services system. Different experts have in the past canvassed for the participation of telecom operators like MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa in the financial services industry due to their footprints across Africa.\n\nThe CBN only bought into the idea on October 26, 2018, when it released the Guideline for Licensing and Regulation of Payment Service Banks in Nigeria. The release saw many companies including MTN and Airtel express interest. But the telcos were made to wait while several players in financial services especially were granted approval.\n\nWhat is the PSB all about?\n\nA Payment Service Bank (PSB) is defined as a category of banks with smaller-scale operations and the absence of credit risk and foreign exchange operations. In Nigeria, a PSB is allowed to accept deposits from individuals and small businesses, carry out payment and remittance services within Nigeria, issue debit and prepaid cards, operate electronic purses, and other activities prescribed by the CBN.\n\nPSBs are also expected to have not less than 50 percent physical access points in rural areas. Only a few banks have an extensive network of branches in rural places in Nigeria. Fintech companies also utilise banking agents to reach people in rural areas but very few have physical outlets due to the cost implications. However, telcos like MTN Nigeria would not only make use of agents, they also have a physical presence in many rural communities.\n\n\u201cA PSB licence is like an upgrade to the MMO or Super Agent licence, especially for telcos,\u201d Oluwaseun Ayansola, a fintech expert. \u201cWhat do I mean? MoMo already had a mobile money operation (MMO). With a PSB licence MoMo can do more including issuing debit and prepaid cards in its own name by entering into a direct agreement with a card scheme (Mastercard, Visa, etc).\u201d\n\nIt should be noted however that a PSB cannot grant any form of loans, advances, or guarantees, accept foreign exchange (forex) deposits or deal in forex except selling forex realised from inbound cross-border personal remittances to authorised forex dealers.\n\nRoad to PSB licence\n\nIn the past, bank executives and some stakeholders had expressed misgivings in telcos participating in the financial services.\n\nAt a Social Media Week session in 2019, Segun Agbaje, CEO of GTBank, suggested that telcos would do the economy a better service if they stayed focused on improving the quality of service rather than being distracted by offering banking services.\n\n\u201cWe need the telcos to bring the price of data down. Getting a PSB licence isn\u2019t a disruption because that is already being done. What is a disruption is for a telco to be bold enough to reduce the cost of data,\u201d Agbaje said.\n\nAt a breakfast meeting hosted by Unified Payment in 2018, a former executive director of Nigeria Interbank Settlement Systems (NIBSS) told the audience that telcos really had no business doing banking because they already have their hands full with telecommunication services. He also fancies a mobile money space led by financial services firms and not telcos.\n\nBut all that seems to be in the past now as the CBN began issuing licences to telecom operators in 2020. It is now over one year since 9Mobile and Globacom got the PSB licences, while the former has launched mobile money operations, the latter appears to have it focus on other things but mobile money at the moment.\n\n9Mobile, which launched 9PSB in 2020, has lacked the intensity experts had expected from a telco launch. Aside from a partnership with Flutterwave in September, there is little activity coming from the telco. Some experts say this is not surprising given 9Mobile does not have the experience of MTN and Airtel and the network of agents for widespread deployment of its service.\n\nWith an Approval in Principle granted to MTN and Airtel, the road seems clear for deployment sometime next year. An approval in principle does not mean the telcos have a PSB licence but it is the first step to getting the licence. The final licence is usually granted not later than six months after the AIP.",
          "summary": "Following the granting of approval in principle (AIP) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), MTN Nigeria and Airtel now have about six months to become licenced Payment Service Banks (PSBs).\nApart from helping to include 40 million adult Nigerians outside the financial services industry, the move could create over 1 million direct jobs in 2022.\nMTN Nigeria and Airtel combined boast 124.6 million voice subscribers and 96.1 data subscribers.\nThis is the same strategy it deployed in nearly all the 14 African countries where it currently operates mobile money services.\nMTN Nigeria and Airtel could also be the push Globacom needs to launch its mobile money operations after one year of securing the licence.",

The walk was held as part of activities to commemorate the recent International Day of the Girl Child.\n\nThe official said; \u201cIn Nigeria, according to the 2018 NDHS, an overall 20 per cent of women aged 15-49 have been circumcised, down 5 per cent from the 2013 NDHS. Across the five UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme for the elimination of FGM intervention states, FGM prevalence for women aged 15-49 is on a downward slope, although it is still unacceptably high across the states like Edo, Delta, Ekiti and Ondo.\u201d She did not indicate if the assessment is still valid for 2021.\n\nQuoting the NDHS 2013/2018 statistics, she said in Osun State, the prevalence of FGM reduced from 78 per cent to 45.9 per cent; Ebonyi: 74 per cent to 53.2 per cent; Gombe, 72 per cent to 57.9 per cent; Imo: 68 per cent to 61.7 per cent, and Oyo: 66 per cent to 31.1 per cent. Edo, Ondo, Ekiti and Delta were not included on this list.\n\nMs M\u00fcller urged Nigerian youths and the digital generation to \u201cdevelop skills to create quality contents; find, select and evaluate digital sources of information and use ICT to develop positive behavioural relationships that will contribute to the elimination of FGM in Nigeria\u201d. She added that the UNFPA is working with youth-led organisations to reach Nigerian adolescents with accurate sexual and reproductive health information through digital tools and technology.\n\nAlso present at the event was the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen. She hoped that the walk creates awareness that will reduce the rate of FGM practises. \u201cWe need to provide more education by increasing advocacy on the health danger posed on girls and women by the practice of FGM,\u201d the minister said, adding that; \u201cThe financial cost implication of treating complications on nation\u2019s economy and the degradation of women dignity is higher than investments on prevention.\u201d\n\nIn attendance also was Emmanuel Babayaro, Nigeria\u2019s football star, and 1996 Olympics Gold medalist, who urged civil society groups and non-governmental organisations to synergise, noting that collaborations would help them achieve their goals faster.\n\nThe convener of the event and President of WAVE Foundation, Lola Ibrahim, indicated measures that could help to eradicate the harmful practice in Nigeria.\n\nShe said these measures could include translation of the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (VAPP) into local languages, careful choice of words during sensitisation, and social services support for FGM survivors by the government at all levels.\n\nFGM comprises any cutting that has to do with partial or total removal of the external genitalia or related injuries to the female genital organs for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons.\n\nAccording to World Health Organisation, FGM has no health benefits and it harms girls and women causing trauma, pain, bleeding, infections, vaginal fistula and death in some cases.\n\n...",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: From Academia and Central Banking to Governor, Chukwuma Soludo\u2019s story in resilience",
          "text": "The people of Anambra State have elected Charles Chukwuma Soludo as their next governor, offering the topmost position to a man whose record of accomplishments, in academia and public policy, yielded the persuasion that he was the most auspicious candidate among his main challengers, including tainted Andy Uba and Valentine Ozigbo who has no public service experience.\n\nIn the election held on Saturday, with a supplementary poll on Tuesday, Mr Soludo, 61, of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) scored 122,229 votes to claim victory, finally achieving a goal he first set in 2009, 12 years ago, just after he left office as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nHis closest rival, Mr Ozigbo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scored 53,807 votes to emerge second, and Mr Uba, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate got a total of 43,285 votes to emerge the third position.\n\nBorn on July 28, 1960, Mr Soludo hails from Umueze Village, Isuofia in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State. Messrs Soludo, Ozigbo and Uba are from the same local government.\n\nTop of the class\n\nMr Soludo graduated with a first-class degree in Economics in 1984 from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), one of Nigeria\u2019s preeminent and first-generation universities, where he also studied and researched for his master\u2019s and doctoral degrees.\n\nNot only did he obtain first-class honours, but he was also the top-of-the-class graduate throughout his studies up to the doctoral level in 1989 when he won the Vice-Chancellor\u2019s prize for the best graduating PhD student.\n\nItinerant scholar\n\nMr Solduo honed his research capacities at some of the best institutions in the world, gaining a cumulative four years of post-doctoral scholarship in the United States, Ethiopia, and the United Kingdom. Between 1991 and 1992, he was a Visiting Fellow at The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C.; and between 1992 and 1993, Research Fellow at the UN Economic Commission for Africa, Addis Ababa.\n\nIn addition, he was a Visiting Scholar at the International Monetary Fund, Washington, D.C. in 1994; and later the University of Oxford, 1994 and 1997; the Smuts Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, 1996-1997, and a scholar at the University of Warwick, 1997.\n\nIn 1998, UNN appointed Mr Soludo Professor of Economics, a remarkable achievement for the scholar, who was then 38. \u201cI became everything in my 30s\u2026I became a professor in my 30s,\u201d Mr Soludo boasted during the Anambra governorship debate.\n\nAs he says in his CV obtained by PREMIUM TIMES, Mr Soludo travelled to 46 countries as an itinerant scholar and consultant to several multilateral finance and development institutions, including the World Bank, African Development Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the European Union, among others.\n\n\u201cConSoludotion\u201d\n\nIn July 2003, Mr Soludo made a foray into the government with an appointment as the Chief Economic Adviser to President Olusegun Obasanjo. And in the month that followed, he got an additional responsibility as the Chief Executive and Deputy Chairman of the National Planning Commission, initiating the process that birthed the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nIn May 2004, Mr Obasanjo appointed Mr Soludo to the CBN as the governor, which Mr Uba would claim he made possible. \u201cMy brother brought you to me,\u201d said Mr Uba, during the governorship debate. Mr Uba was at the time of Mr Soludo\u2019s CBN appointment a close aide to Mr Obasanjo. But Mr Soludo dismissed his rival\u2019s claim.\n\nIt was as the CBN governor that Mr Soludo made his most consequential public policy effort; the financial sector reforms, that included a regime of consolidation of 89 banks to 25 with a stronger capital base. Mr Soludo has been praised for helping to strengthen and institutionalise banking in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, towards the end of his five-year tenure at the CBN, amid the global economic meltdown of 2008, many in the government and organised private sector had started expressing doubts about the standing of Nigerian banks contrary to Mr Soludo\u2019s assurances. As described by former presidential spokesperson, Olusegun Adeniyi, in his book, Power Politics and Death, Mr Soludo\u2019s critics, including governors, believed he was \u201ceither not aware of the situation in the banks or was deliberately putting a sheen on their malaise.\u201d\n\nMr Soludo could not secure a second term. Late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua replaced him on June 1 with Lamido Sanusi, with a banking and risk management background, unlike Mr Soludo, an economist. As it turned out, the examination of the banks under Mr Sanusi validated the fears Mr Soludo\u2019s critics had expressed: some of the banks were on a \u201clife support,\u201d causing fear of financial sector instability, Mr Adesegun said in his book.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Soludo\u2019s accomplishments at the apex bank were solid and remain rarely matched. In addition to the consolidation of the banks, he helped grow the external reserve from $10 billion to an all-time high of $62 billion and inflationary pressure was low, at a time single digit for 24 consecutive months. He was a key figure in the macro-economic high scores attained by the Obasanjo administration.\n\nPolitics: from CBN to power in Anambra\n\nBy 2009, Anambra State still offered the iconic example of criminal politics phenomenon, partly a legacy of Chris Uba, the notorious brother of Mr Uba, the defeated APC candidate in the last election. It was in that context that Mr Soludo, in September 2009, announced his intention to run for the governorship election of February 2010.\n\nThough then a political greenhorn, coming from the academia and central banking to operate in a tumultuous political terrain, Mr Soludo clinched the PDP ticket. He was able to retain the ticket despite initial resistance from top members of the party citing no transparency in his nomination. He, however, lost the election to Peter Obi, then of APGA. Mr Obi now leads PDP in Anambra.\n\nAs the next election season was approaching, Mr Soludo switched from PDP to APGA in preparation for the 2014 election in the state. He did not compete in the APGA primaries as he was disqualified alongside a few other aspirants, paving the way for the incumbent governor, Willy Obiano, to clinch the APGA ticket and succeed Mr Obi.\n\nMr Soludo supported Mr Obiano\u2019s re-election in 2017. In return, Mr Obiano backed Mr Soludo to win Saturday\u2019s election.\n\nMr Soludo\u2019s story is an example of resilience, passion and persistence.\n\nIn the campaigns, Mr Soludo, who has repeatedly expressed a commitment to a united Nigeria, said he would engage with separatist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), to address tensions and insecurity in the state. He also promised to improve infrastructure, especially in the area of roads, and stimulate the economy to create jobs.\n\nWith his victory in the election, Mr Soludo will be inaugurated in March 2022 as the governor of Anambra State to succeed Mr Obiano.",
          "summary": "\u201cI became everything in my 30s\u2026I became a professor in my 30s,\u201d Mr Soludo boasted during the Anambra governorship debate.\nIn May 2004, Mr Obasanjo appointed Mr Soludo to the CBN as the governor, which Mr Uba would claim he made possible.\nMr Uba was at the time of Mr Soludo\u2019s CBN appointment a close aide to Mr Obasanjo.\nThough then a political greenhorn, coming from the academia and central banking to operate in a tumultuous political terrain, Mr Soludo clinched the PDP ticket.\nMr Soludo\u2019s story is an example of resilience, passion and persistence.",

          "text": "The acceptance of speech of Prof Chukwuma Charles Soludo, CFR, following victory in the Anambra State governorship election concluded on Tuesday, October 9, 2021.\n\nWith utmost humility and gratitude to God, I accept the results of the 2021 Anambra Governorship election as declared by INEC. This reflects the supreme will of the almighty God, and an overwhelming sacred mandate of the people. For 12 years since the massive clamour by the people of Anambra for us to serve them, we persevered to this Divine moment. This is a divine journey whose time has come. To God be all the glory and adoration!\n\nWe have a very long list of persons whom God used to make this moment a reality. In particular, we thank all members of APGA especially our national leader, HE (Sir) Willie Maduaburochukwu Obiano, our national Chairman, Ozonkpu Victor Ike Oye, members of the BOT, NEC, state Exco, etc for availing me the opportunity to fly the APGA flag and the cohesive party support. Many thanks to our able Campaign Committee, our first rate legal team, and all other stakeholders who worked tirelessly and informally to see us through. We are grateful to all the stakeholders of the Anambra project\u2014 the clergy and the church, traditional rulers, ASATU, labour, market, trade and professional unions, youth and women organizations, non-indigene associations, businessmen and captains of industry, the Diaspora community, persons with disability, etc.\n\nWe thank all our donors, especially the hundreds of thousands of members of the 41 self-funding support groups who, for two years, put in their sweat and personal funds to propel this project. Never mind that all of you could not vote. The limited number that voted is still representative of the wishes of the people.\n\nWe are humbled by the massive support of stakeholders and Nigerians across the entire country. Your donations and goodwill are treasured. In particular, I thank my wife, Queen Frances Nonye Soludo, and children: Ozonna, Ifeatu, Chinua, Ekene, Oduko and Zikora for their love and sacrifices. Despite your deep reservations, you still allowed and supported me to step out in the service of our people. As I promised, I will work hard every day never to disappoint you.\n\nAt this moment, we must remember and will continue to remember all those who died in the course of this movement, especially the three policemen who were killed by unknown gunmen during our town hall meeting with youths in my ward. May God continue to grant their souls eternal rest.\n\nThe run up to this election and the election itself tested the resilience and integrity of our federal institutions. Many times there were tensions especially as one party boasted that it must \u201ctake\u201d or \u201cconquer\u201d Anambra by all means. Our institutions proved again and again that this country can achieve eminent greatness when our institutions rise up to the occasion.\n\nThe judiciary, led by the President of the Court of Appeal and the Chief Justice of Nigeria, stood for the integrity of the judiciary. We salute the eminent justices of the Anambra High court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court for standing up for justice. Your names will be written in gold. We thank President Buhari, the presidency, and our security agencies for ensuring a level playing field. We must particularly commend the Chairman, Management and staff of INEC for systematically striving to bequeath a legacy of free, fair and transparent electoral system to Nigeria.\n\nThe use of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) represents a massive improvement over the Card Reader and manual accreditation system. With a continuous refinement of the technology, upscaling of the skills of its operators, collaboration with telecommunication companies, improvement in logistical deployment and security, and stringent punishment for anyone involved in electoral malpractice, Nigeria will be on course to a robust and exemplary electoral system. Aside from the initial glitches in the operations of the BVAS machines in some places including at my polling unit, the election has been adjudged as the most peaceful, free, fair and credible. There is joy in the land. Kudos to INEC!\n\nTo my fellow candidates in the election, I wish to congratulate you for the gallant contest. Our people have spoken overwhelmingly, and surely that loud voice is the voice of God. The ultimate winner is Anambra people: we are all winners. I hereby extend my hand of fellowship to all of you. I need all of you to succeed. Politics aside, we are all brothers. Let\u2019s come together for the \u201cProject Anambra\u201d.\n\nThere is enough room for everyone to contribute in the service of our homeland. On February 7th, 2010, INEC declared as winner of the Anambra governorship election a candidate who had described the election as a sham on Channels TV and refused to vote in protest. Two hours after the declaration, I addressed a press conference and congratulated him, and walked away without a legal challenge. I was probably the first candidate of a major political party to do that in Nigeria. In Anambra, we fight hard during elections but meet the next weekend at traditional weddings and funerals and throw banters and share drinks.\n\nThat\u2019s the Anambra way! Let\u2019s keep the \u201cspirit of Anambra\u201d alive and strong, and with it, collectively take our homeland to the moon. So far and even before the official declaration, I have received congratulatory messages from thousands of Ndi Anambra and Nigerians from around the world including some of my fellow candidates. I deeply treasure the massive goodwill.\n\nTo the estimated 17 million Ndi Anambra within and outside our homeland (state), this is your moment, seize it! This victory is your victory. My role will be that of your chief servant, and I will work every minute of the day with you to make you profoundly proud. I will need the guidance, advice and contribution of everyone to succeed. Our state is one of infinite possibilities and humungous opportunities. Working in collaboration with other states, the federal government, and the international community, we have all that it takes to make our state whatever we collectively will that it can be. As we transit to a post-oil world and into the 4th Industrial Revolution, let us work together to build upon the foundations of our founding fathers and predecessors to create that livable and prosperous homeland that is the industrial, technology and leisure hub of West Africa. This is our manifest destiny, and collectively we shall get there!\n\nFinally, let us work together to support our ably working Governor, Akpokuedike Aguleri, to finish very strong. Together, we can, and by the grace of God, we will!\n\nLong live APGA!\n\nLong live Anambra State!\n\nLong live the Federal Republic of Nigeria!",

          "title": "Nigeria has more work to do to End Tuberculosis, Aisah Buhari -NigPilot",
          "text": "On Tuesday, first lady Aisha, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari hinted that Nigeria has a lot more to do in her efforts to end Tuberculosis (TB) in Nigeria.\n\nShe said the emergence COVID-19 pandemic had reminded everyone that the fight against TB can only be won by working with relevant bodies and in isolation, thus she called on stakeholders to work together to end TB by supporting a multi-sectorial approach and effective coordination to eradicate the deadly diseases.\n\nAisha made the call at the 2021 National TB Conference with the theme:\u201d Sustaining a Resilient TB Response In Nigeria: Addressing the Impact of COVID-19 and other Diseases\u201d, yesterday in Abuja.\n\nFirst Lady of Niger State, Dr. Amina Abubakar Bello who re-presented Aisha Buhari at the occasion, said that; \u201cDespite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic , Nigeria can still make progress in case detection and treatment with intensified monitoring and identification of TB cases\n\n\u201cIt is important that we should not lose sight of TB which has been around us much longer and continue to kill people in Nigeria at an alarming rate.\n\n\u201d Since I was appointed Global TB Champion and Ambassador, I have used my position to push TB issues among stakeholders at the National, Regional and Global levels. At this forum in 2018, I promise to cascade this effort by appointing all the wives of governors as state TB champions and it has been a game-changer as it is helping to create more awareness about TB up to the community levels. This effort has increased TB advocacy and mobilisation all over Nigeria and will help to galvanise the much-needed support from the Federal, state, and Local Government levels. \u201c\n\nIn his address, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire said the COVID-19 pandemic brought 2020 global case finding levels back to 2012 level, with an 18% reduction in the number of patients diagnosed with TB dropping from 7.1 million in 2019 to 5.8 million in 2020, thus setting global case finding efforts back by 8 years.\n\n\u201cThe first COVID19 case was diagnosed on 27th February 2020 and measures to control the pandemic were introduced, with eventual lockdown in Quarter 2 (Q2), 2020. Nigeria recorded a 30% reduction in GeneXpert testing in the first week of the lockdown, the number of notified TB cases also dropped by 17% from 33,119 TB cases in Q1, 2020 to 27,353 Q2,2020. This necessitated the conceptualization and implementation of innovative interventions to ensure program sustainability and mitigate the impact on TB control efforts, the implementation of which resulted in an eventual 15% increase across the country, in the number of TB cases notified from 120,266 TB cases in 2019 to 138,591 TB cases in 2020, making us one of the few countries that recorded increased in TB notification in 2020, despite the pandemic. Key among the interventions was a strategic engagement of the private sector, the introduction of targeted, data-driven community TB case finding activities, integration of TB case finding in COVID-19 outreaches, active TB, and integrated TB/COVID-19 case finding activities in health facilities among others. Some of these helpful practices in TB case finding will be shared during this conference, so I urge participants to attend all the sessions.\n\n\u201d 9 months into this year 2021, we have already surpassed the total number of TB cases notified in all of 2020 by about 7%, and for the first time, Nigeria could be notifying up to 200,000 TB cases by the end of 2021. I like to here commend all who are making this happen, including our partners WHO, Global Fund, USAID, and other USG agencies and their partners, KNCV, Stop TB partnership, the TB network, community-based organizations, and health workers who are the foot soldiers, for their hard work in the fight to end TB in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe know that we still have a way to go to reach the targets for ending the TB epidemic and that most of our TB cases are yet undetected. We are not as close as we would like to the United Nations High-Level Meeting (UNHLM) target on TB case finding, TB Preventive Treatment (TPT), and other TB thematic areas set to be achieved by 2022 and the milestones for ending TB in Nigeria.\n\nAccordingly, the Acting Board Chairman, Stop TB Partnership Nigeria, Dr. Ayodele Awe said COVID-19 has harmed global health including TB services in Nigeria and around the world despite efforts by the partnership to continue to reach out to stakeholders both at community levels for more engagement on case finding.\n\nThis impact has severely disrupted TB responses, stalling and reversing years of progress made against TB. In 2020, COVID-19 overtook TB globally as the most common cause of death from infectious disease, but in low and middle-income countries, TB deaths remain far higher than those from COVID-19.\n\nHe commended the National TB and Leprosy Control Programme and other stakeholders who have worked tirelessly to navigate the impact of TB control efforts in Nigeria. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, Nigeria achieved about a 15% increase in case notification as the number of TB notified cases increased from 117,320 in 2019 to 138,591 in 2020. Also, the overall TB treatment coverage increased from 27% in 2019 to 30% in 2020.\n\nHe hinted that Nigeria still ranks 6th globally among the 30 high TB burden countries and 1 in Africa with about 452,000 people being infected with TB as stated in the 2021 Global TB Report.\n\nHe stressed that there is more to be done by all and sundry as such all hands must continue to be on deck to work together in eliminating the scourge of TB in Nigeria towards achieving a healthy environment for generations to come.\n\nHe further stated that there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure we tackle every challenge including finding all the missing TB cases in the country\n\nAlso speaking, United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Hon Mary Beth Leonard said the US government is keen to funding to support efforts for TB control in Nigeria has surpassed 230million dollars. This support has increased the traditional quality diagnoses and care for TB patients and their families.\n\nWhile adding that, the US government also has invested significant resources in other programs to prevent, detect and treat TB and people living with HIV.\n\nUSAID has done a lot to see that multi-sectoral public-private partnership is robust to increase public awareness and as well advocate for domestic resources to address the TB epidemic in Nigeria.\n\nMore so, USAID has invested significantly in improving access to treatment and case detection services through the provision of directly observed treatment, the optimization of G-next machines, and the introduction of new diagnosis tools established of diagnostic centres across the country.",

          "text": "United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, UNICEF, Tuesday, donated selected items and materials to six Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, camps in Benue state to ensure proper sanitation, cleanliness, and hygiene.\n\nThe items donated to the camps were detergents, disinfectants, scrubbing brushes, hand gloves, and brooms.\n\nFlagging off the donation at the Uikpam IDPs camp in Guma Local Government Area, LGA of the state, the UNICEF WASH Specialist, UNICEF Field Office, Enugu, Mr. Doutimiye Kiakubu told the IDPs that it was being done in fulfillment of an earlier promise made to them by UNICEF.\n\nMr. Kiakubu who recalled the meeting UNICEF officials held with the IDPs said \u201cnot long ago we held a meeting with you and we agreed on what the camps should look like in terms of cleanliness and hygiene; and you told us the type of toilets you want and where it should be situated in the camp. We also agreed on where the male and female toilets should be located. Women, men and even children spoke on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe told you that whatever we do would be within our budget. And we assured that we should start with the construction of women toilets and bathrooms which are almost completed.\n\nThe UNICEF WASH specialist also his organisation is working on the provision of water for the IDPs and as a result has directed the contractor handling the borehole project to ensure timely completion of the project so that there would be water in the bathrooms and toilets.\n\n\u201cAlso, we have already trained the Volunteer Hygiene Promoters, VHPs, and the Water Sanitation and Hygiene Committee, WASHCO, members in the six IDPs camps located in Ortese, Uikpam, Gbajimba, Daudu 1 and 111 as well as Abagena and they have been entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining the water and sanitation facilities as well as keeping the camps clean.\n\n\u201cAnd to enable them put to practice what they were trained in, UNICEF has come to donate detergent, scrubbing brushes, brooms, hand gloves and disinfectants which should be used to keep the toilets, and the vicinity of the camp clean.\n\n\u201cWe had to do this because you the IDPs had complained that you lacked materials that could be used to ensure the clean up of the camps, that is why we have brought all these to ensure that the camp including water tap areas, toilets and bathrooms are always neat and completely clean.\n\n\u201cYou should also watch over all these facilities and ensure that nobody vandalizes or damages them. And whoever is caught trying to damage or misuse them should be reported to the block leader, if he refuses to listen to the leader, the matter should be reported to the camp chairman and if the individual remains headstrong he should be reported to officials of State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA. That is what is obtainable at Abagena camp and it should be replicated in others.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that if you maintain cleanliness in the camps other groups might be moved to also render further assistance to your camps. Ensure that everything we have provided for you are handled with care and not damaged.\n\nMr. Kiakubu also appealed to SEMA to ensure that all the facilities are protected and maintained, stressing that if the items are exhausted, SEMA should provide more so that the camp will remain clean always.\n\n\u201cThe benefit is that if a camp is kept clean it will be difficult to record outbreak of sicknesses and diseases there.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile work on the solar powered motorized borehole is still ongoing, the tank stand would be completed soon, so please cooperate with the workers to ensure that the contractor executes his work without challenge.\u201d\n\nHe said there are supervisors from Benue Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency, BERWASSA, as well as UNICEF who would supervise the work being done to ensure that it is executed to specification.\n\n\u201cSo like I said earlier, we are making these donations to six camps in Abagena, Ortese, Gbajimba, Daudu l, Daudu lll and Uikpam. And we will always visit the camps to ensure that things are properly done,\u201d he added.\n\nReacting, the camp manager, Mr. Matthew Asaaga,\n\nsaid the intervention of UNICEF was highly commendable stressing that it would go a long way to ensure proper hygiene and cleanliness as well as check the outbreak of water borne diseases and sicknesses in the benefiting camps.\n\n\u201cWe must thank UNICEF because they are taking practical steps to ensure healthy living in Benue IDPs camps; we ask for more and urge others to emulate what they are doing in Benue state,\u201d he said.\n\nOn her part, the WASHCOM Chairman, Mrs. Regina Abaga\n\nwho expressed joy at the various UNICEF interventions in the camp said they were poised to ensure that the camp is always clean especially with the donation of items that would aid their work.\n\nAlso speaking, BERWASSA official, Mrs \u2026..said the donation by UNICEF was in fulfillment of the promise made to the IDPs during the training of VHPs about a week ago.\n\n\u201cThey requested for the cleaning materials that is why this donation is being made today to encourage them to do the work of ensuring cleanliness and hygiene in the camp, we laud UNICEF for this all important intervention,\u201d she added.",

This means that we must be at the forefront of digitalization and be better positioned to help them achieve their goals and aspirations continuously.\u201d\n\nHe further highlighted the many benefits that the industry stands to gain if digitalization is embraced quickly.

He first contested in 2009 on the platform of the PDP.\n\nThe build-up to the election was characterised by serious campaigning in an atmosphere filled with security concerns and uncertainty.\n\nAmid these concerns, the Federal Government considered declaring a state of emergency in the state to ensure the poll would proceed as scheduled.\n\nIt took the deployment of some 43,000 police officers and hundreds of other security agents, including soldiers for the election to be held.\n\nSoludo\u2019s victory means he will be succeeding Willie Obiano who is in the final months of his second term and that APGA will be retaining power in the state, which it has governed since 2006.\n\nThreats Defied\n\nAfter weeks of uncertainty and mounting tension, the election held peacefully as the electorate went to their respective polling units to vote for the candidates of their choice, defying security threats.\n\nObservers monitoring the election, however, reported incidents of vote-buying and failure of accreditation devices \u2013 Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), among others.\n\nThe device failure was also experienced at the governor-elect\u2019s polling unit in Aguata Local Government where he waited for over five hours before he could vote.\n\nThis initially sparked tension at the polling station as just one person out of the 717 registered voters was able to vote, about one and half hours into the election.\n\nElsewhere, the other frontline candidates voted without any glitch recorded.\n\nUneasy Quest\n\nIn events that led to the election, it was an uneasy quest for Soludo in his journey to succeed Obiano as the next governor of the state.\n\nFollowing a series of drama accompanied by the crisis within APGA and conflicting judgements resulting from the party\u2019s primary, INEC finally recognised Soludo as APGA candidate and Ibezim Onyekachukwu Gilbert as his running mate on August 19.\n\nThis followed a judgement of the Court of Appeal in Kano which set aside the judgement of the Jigawa State High Court on the party\u2019s leadership and nomination of candidates.\n\nMore than a month later, APGA officially flagged off its campaign for the election, and Soludo was presented the party\u2019s flag to officially recognise him as its candidate \u2013 bringing an end to all disputes relating to the party\u2019s candidacy.\n\nWatch the presentation of Soludo as APGA\u2019s flagbearer below\n\nAt the event held six weeks before the election, Soludo began his acceptance speech with a song titled \u2018Who Can Battle With The Lord?\u2019 after which he thanked the party leaders and members for their support all through the events that led to his emergence as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\n\u201cThe next thing that should happen in Anambra will be to consolidate the wonderful works that are ongoing, especially under the 16 years of APGA in Anambra State,\u201d he promised.",

          "text": "Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has adjourned the trial of the leader of the proscribed\n\nIndigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu to January 19, 2022.\n\nHowever, before the judge came into the court room, Kanu\u2019s lawyers, staged a walk-out to protest the refusal of operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) to allow some members of the legal team to come into the courtroom.\n\nKanu, who was brought into the courtroom around 9:52am, had shortly after his case was called up, complained about the refusal of security agents to allow some members of his legal team, especially his lawyer from the the United States of America, Bruce Fein, to enter the courtroom.\n\nThe IPOB leader told the court that Mr. Fein, whom he said was handling a case for him in the US, was around to witness his trial.\n\nSpeaking from the dock, Kanu said: \u201cI have an ongoing case in the US. I have not been allowed to see him. He is here to see me and to observe the proceedings.\n\n\u201cHe has been to the DSS to see me, but they denied him access to me.\u201d\n\nAsked by the judge, if he was ready to conduct the proceedings himself, in the absence of his lawyers, Kanu replied in the negative.\n\nMeanwhile, counsel to the federal government, Mr. M. D. Abubakar, who is also the Director of Public Prosecution, urged the court to proceed with the trial in the absence of Kanu\u2019s lawyers.\n\nAbubakar reminded the court that the case was fixed for hearing of an application filed by the Defendant.\n\nHe argued that since Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, Mr. Ifeanyi Ejiofor, who was initially inside the courtroom, walked out with his team shortly before the arrival of the judge, his pending application should be deemed abandoned.\n\nIn a short ruling, though Justice Nyako expressed his displeasure over the conduct of Kanu\u2019s lawyers, she declined to dismiss the pending application and rather adjourned the case till January 19 and 20, 2022, for trial.\n\nAs Kanu was being driven away from the court, his supporters started singing his praises.\n\nFrom nowhere, another group called One Nigeria Advocate carrying Nigerian flags appeared with drums, singing in support of the nation. They waved Nigerian flags. They also carried coffins with some names of people killed in the South East including Gulag\n\nWhile those supporting Kanu described him as another saviour, those protesting in support of government called him a terrorist. Some carried coffins with names of some of the people killed in the South East.\n\nThey also carried placards with inscriptions- \u201cIPOB are terrorists\u201d, \u201cIPOB stop killings our security men\u201d, \u201cOne Nigeria one nation\u201d \u201cNNAMDI Kanu is a terrorist\u201d, \u201cIPOB is a terrorist organization\u201d, \u201cRespect your country Nigeria\u201d.\n\nTension rose but did not degenerate probably because security agencies were at alert.\n\nTobi Soniyi",

          "text": "Poland\u2019s Prime Minister has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of being behind a migrant crisis at Belarus\u2019s border with Poland.\n\nMateusz Morawiecki said that Belarus\u2019s authoritarian leader, a close ally of Mr Putin, is orchestrating the crisis, but \u201cit has its mastermind in Moscow\u201d.\n\nAt least 2,000 migrants are stuck at the border in freezing conditions.\n\nBelarus\u2019s leader Alexander Lukashenko denies claims it is sending people over the border in revenge for EU sanctions.\n\nVideo footage shows crowds of people on the Belarusian side of a barbed-wire border fence with Poland. Some try to force their way through using bolt cutters, tree trunks and group force, while Polish guards fend them off with what appears to be tear gas.\n\nMany of the migrants are young men but there are also women and children, mostly from the Middle East and Asia. They are camping in tents just inside Belarus, trapped between Polish guards on one side, and Belarusian guards on the other.\n\nOvernight temperatures at the border have slumped below zero and several people have already died in recent weeks.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday at an emergency parliamentary session after visiting troops on the border, Mr Morawiecki said: \u201cThis attack which Lukashenko is conducting has its mastermind in Moscow, the mastermind is President Putin.\u201d\n\nHe accused the Russian and Belarusian leaders of trying to destabilise the European Union \u2013 which the two countries are not part of \u2013 by allowing migrants to travel through Belarus and enter the bloc.\n\nMr Morawiecki described the situation as \u201ca new type of war in which people are used as human shields\u201d, and said Poland was dealing with a \u201cstage play\u201d which is designed to create chaos in the EU.\n\nHe added that it was the first time in 30 years that Poland\u2019s border security had been so \u201cbrutally attacked\u201d.\n\nPoland has deployed extra troops to the border, and warned of a possible \u201carmed\u201d escalation, fearing that Belarus might try to provoke an incident.\n\nPoland, Lithuania and Latvia, which are all part of the EU, have seen a surge in the number of people trying to enter their countries illegally from Belarus in recent months. On Tuesday, Lithuania declared a state of emergency on its border with Belarus, which will come into effect at midnight.\n\nPoland has seen the most arrivals, especially around its major border crossing at Kuznica.\n\nPoland has been accused of pushing migrants back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. Journalists and aid agencies have been banned from accessing the area.\n\n\u201cNobody is letting us get in anywhere, Belarus or Poland,\u201d 33-year-old Shwan Kurd from Iraq told the BBC by video-call.\n\nHe described how he had arrived in Belarus\u2019s capital, Minsk, from Baghdad at the start of November, and was now in a make-shift camp metres from Poland\u2019s barbed-wire fence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to escape,\u201d he said. \u201cPoland won\u2019t let us in. Every night they fly helicopters. They don\u2019t let us sleep. We are so hungry. There\u2019s no water or food here. There are little children, old men and women, and families.\u201d\n\nThe EU, Nato and the US all accuse Belarus of coordinating the surge of migrants. The European Commission has accused Mr Lukashenko of luring migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU as part of an \u201cinhuman, gangster-style approach\u201d.\n\nBrussels says his actions are a retaliation against EU sanctions, which were imposed after his widely discredited re-election and subsequent crackdown on mass protests.\n\nActivists say the migrants are being used as pawns in a political game between Belarus and its EU neighbours.\n\nLithuania has also moved troops to its border with Belarus to prepare for a possible influx of migrants. Its government said declaring a state of emergency was a precautionary response.\n\nAbout two dozen migrants who were detained in Lithuania after illegally crossing over from Belarus were suspected of having links to terrorist organisations, Lithuania\u2019s vice interior minister Kestutis Lancinskas told the BBC.\n\nMost of them presented fake IDs when they were stopped and background checks are still ongoing, Mr Lancinskas said. He could not comment on which terrorist organisations may have links with the migrants, nor when they were detained.\n\n\u201cThere is always a certain level of risk when there\u2019s a large number of people crossing the border,\u201d Mr Lancinskas said.\n\n\u201cAll member states have a level of terrorism threat. Our intelligence services are doing their best to prevent those kinds of activities.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Belarusian state news agency, Mr Lukashenko said he wanted to avoid any military escalation on the border which could draw Russia into a conflict.\n\nHe said he was \u201cnot a madman\u201d and knew what was at stake, but remained defiant, saying \u201cwe will not kneel down\u201d.\n\nThe Belarus defence ministry has accused Warsaw of violating agreements by moving thousands of troops to the border.\n\nBelarus insists migrants are arriving there legally and that it is merely acting \u201cas a hospitable country\u201d.\n\nRussia has praised its ally\u2019s \u201cresponsible\u201d handling of the border row and said it is watching the situation closely.",

          "title": "Colombian Leader Sees Opportunity in Cannabis, But Not Coca",
          "text": "Colombian President Iv\u00e1n Duque has high hopes for the medical marijuana industry in a country that has been waging a costly war against a different drug \u2014 cocaine \u2014 for decades.\n\nBut in an interview with The Associated Press during a visit to Israel, he said the promotion of cannabis for medical and other purposes is \u201ca different story\u201d than cocaine, which among other things is terrible for the environment.\n\n\u201cIn order to plant one hectare of coca in Colombia, two hectares of tropical jungle are destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other thing is that to produce cocaine you have a very high carbon footprint. You use a lot of gasoline, a lot of cement,\u201d and processing chemicals get dumped in the forest.\n\nThere\u2019s also the murderous drug kingpins \u2014 one of whom was nabbed just last month on a U.S. warrant\u2014 cartel violence and the scattered remnants of the FARC rebel group who have fought on despite a landmark peace agreement reached five years ago.\n\nBut fresh from the U.N. climate summit, where Colombia pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2050, and the opening of a Colombian innovation center in Jerusalem, Duque was keen to discuss how Colombia and Israel \u2014 self-styled \u201cstart-up nations\u201d \u2014 could collaborate to make the world a better place.\n\n\u201cInnovation is probably the solution to most of our problems. Even those created by innovation, they will still need to be solved by innovation,\u201d said Avi Hasson, the CEO of Start-Up Nation Central, which connects governments and international businesses to Israeli entrepreneurs, and which hosted Duque for a panel discussion on Tuesday.\n\nOne opportunity is cannabis.\n\nIn July, Colombia lifted an export ban on dried cannabis flower. Duque said his country is looking to harness derivatives for everything from medical treatments and food production to cosmetics. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of international investment coming to Colombia,\u201d said Duque, who will be replaced following a presidential election next year.\n\nIsrael might be able to lend a hand. Medical marijuana was legalized years ago, and more than 100,000 Israelis \u2014 out of a population of over 9 million \u2014 are licensed users. Israel approved marijuana exports in 2019, becoming only the third country to do so.\n\nIsrael boasts more than 110 cannabis tech companies, mostly in the health sector, that have attracted nearly $350 million in investment since 2015, according to Start-Up Nation Central. Israel is also among the largest importers of medical cannabis flower.\n\nDuque says there\u2019s a difference between harnessing beneficial components from drugs and lifting prohibition completely.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not using cannabis for recreational purposes. We\u2019re using it for medical purposes,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Duque, who fashions himself a law-and-order conservative, standing up for cannabis in a country that has been the linchpin of the U.S.-led drug war for decades is more than a little out of character. He took office decrying how drugs \u201cdestroy\u201d families and as president signed a decree banning possession of drugs in public spaces, challenging a ruling by the nation\u2019s top court that allows Colombians to carry small amounts of marijuana, cocaine and other drugs.\n\nHe\u2019s also committed to resuming aerial eradication of coca crops that are behind a record surge in cocaine production, although legal challenges and protests by farmers in remote areas have prevented him from realizing that goal.\n\nIn the years since the peace deal, newly disarmed rebels have abandoned the remote areas where they sheltered for decades under the jungle canopy. Cattle ranchers, loggers, miners, subsistence farmers and criminal groups have moved into the void, according to a report earlier this month from the International Crisis Group.\n\nColombia lost 747,000 hectares (2,885 square miles) of forest during the four years that followed the 2016 peace deal \u2014 an area about 10 times the size of New York City, according to the National Institute for Environmental Studies. That compares to approximately 562,000 hectares (2,170 square miles) of forest loss in the four years leading up to 2016, when many parts of the country where the FARC was active were off limits.\n\nColombia is also among the most dangerous countries in the world for environment defenders. Some 65 were killed in 2020 alone, accounting for nearly a third of the global total of 227, according to Global Witness, a human rights group.\n\nDuque defended his record on the environment, noting that he created the country\u2019s first national anti-deforestation council, supported a bill increasing sanctions for environmental crime and has committed to zero deforestation by 2030.\n\nAt the U.N. climate change summit in Glasgow, he promised to turn 30% of the country\u2019s land into protected areas by the end of his administration. National parks and government-run reserves currently make up around 15% of the country\u2019s territory.\n\nHe blamed the attacks on environmental defenders on the cartels, including the one led by Dairo Antonio \u00dasuga, a drug lord known as Otoniel whom Duque has likened to Pablo Escobar.\n\n\u201cOne of the most dangerous criminals in the world, and especially in Colombia, who had ordered the killing of environmental leaders, was Otoniel, the kingpin we captured two weeks ago,\u201d he said.\n\nAP",
