          "text": "Civil society organisation, the Niger Delta Peoples Forum has condemned the reported surreptitious meeting between the NDDC Sole Administrator, Effiong Akwa, with a joint session of the National Assembly committees on Niger Delta Affairs.\n\nAccording to the National Chairman, Boma Ebiakpo, \u201cthis was apparently to attempt to embark upon another cycle of illegality preparatory to consider an NDDC 2021 budget (which is yet to be transmitted to the National Assembly by President Buhari) to be defended by an illegal sole administrator contraption that is alien to the NDDC Act, the law governing the operations of the Commission.\u201d\n\n\n\nREAD THE FULL STATEMENT BELOW:\n\n\n\nThe attention of Niger Delta Peoples Forum has been drawn to a story in an online news platform, Premium Times, on January 11, 2022, with the headline \u201cNational Assembly panel meets with NDDC over 2021 budget.\u201d According to the story, at a time when the National Assembly was on break, the NDDC Sole Administrator, Effiong Akwa, surreptitiously met with a joint session of the National Assembly committees on Niger Delta Affairs. This was apparently to attempt to embark upon another cycle of illegality preparatory to consider an NDDC 2021 budget (which is yet to be transmitted to the National Assembly by President Buhari) to be defended by an illegal sole administrator contraption that is alien to the NDDC Act, the law governing the operations of the Commission.\n\nIn what is certain to cause outrage in the Niger Delta region that is already agitated over the delay in inaugurating a substantive board, in compliance with the law to ensure proper corporate governance, and fair representation of the nine constituent states, this latest gambit, seen as a ploy to test the waters of patience of the region, and pliability of the Buhari Presidency, is a gamble taken too far.\n\nThe NDDC Act which explicitly states how the Commission is to be governed is clear on the process for the approval of NDDC annual Budget by the National Assembly. In Part V, 18(1) it states that \u201cthe Board shall, in each year, submit to the National Assembly through the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces an estimate of the expenditure and income of the Commission during the next succeeding year for approval.\u201d The NDDC Act also stipulates that the Board and management (comprising the MD and two EDs) shall be appointed by the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, subject to the confirmation of the Senate.\n\nBut in the past two years, the Commission has been administered in breach of the law through illegal interim managements/sole administrator contraptions administering a total of N799 Billion approved budgets by the National Assembly for the 2019 and 2020 financial years. The 2020 Financial year for NDDC\u2019s budget as approved by the National Assembly expired on December 31, 2021.\n\nRather than continue the illegality of administering NDDC with a sole administrator contraption that is not known to the NDDC Act, we urge President Buhari to halt the ongoing charade at NDDC, abide by the law and inaugurate a substantive governing board for NDDC to ensure proper corporate governance, checks and balances, probity, accountability, and equitable representation of the nine constituent states that have endured two years of the Commission being run like a personal fiefdom.\n\nWe wish to draw the attention of President Buhari to a scathing editorial by ThisDay Newspaper on Wednesday, January 12, 2022, titled \u201cTHE MERRY-GO-ROUND IN NDDC.\u201d According to the paper, \u201cThe Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is becoming an object of jokes among critical stakeholders. Almost six months after the submission of the report of its much-touted forensic report, the federal government has not been able to implement any of the recommendations or appoint a substantive board to allow the commission function effectively as stipulated by law. All that Nigerians are regaled with are tales and empty presidential threats while the Minister of Niger Delta, Godswill Akpabio continues to run the commission with some nebulous interim management committees that are unknown to law.\u201d\n\nWe urge President Buhari to resist attempts by certain officials in his government to goad him into further acts of illegality in administering NDDC by not transmitting the 2021 Budget of NDDC to the National Assembly before the inauguration of a substantive NDDC Board because doing otherwise is further breach of the law governing NDDC.\n\nIn tandem with the legitimate aspirations of a wide spectrum of Niger Delta stakeholders, and in compliance with the law, the NDDC Act, President Buhari should inaugurate the substantive Board of the Commission before transmitting the 2021 budget of NDDC to the National Assembly.\n\nThe President will also be keeping to his promise to inaugurate the board after the forensic audit.\n\nPresident Buhari promised the nation on the 24th day of June 2021, while receiving the Ijaw National Congress (INC) at the State House in Abuja that the NDDC Board would be inaugurated as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted.\n\n\n\nThe President said: \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d\n\n\n\nRegrettably, the report of the forensic audit of NDDC has since been submitted by Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, to President Buhari on September 2, 2021, but almost six months after submission of the forensic audit report, the President is yet to fulfill his own promise. The Ijaw National Congress (INC) has described the delay in inaugurating the NDDC Board as \u201ca clear betrayal of trust and display of State insensitivity on ljaw nation and Niger Delta region.\u201d\n\nIt is in breach of the NDDC Act for the current Sole Administrator or anyone else to administer the NDDC and utilise the huge funds accruing to it on a monthly basis without passing through the legal requirement of appointment as stipulated in the NDDC Act. We therefore align with other Niger Delta authentic stakeholders to reject in its entirety the reported surreptitious engagement between the joint Committees of the National Assembly on Niger Delta and the Sole Administrator of NDDC, Effiong Akwa, to seek to appear before them to defend the yet to be transmitted 2021 budget, and thereby continue to illegally administer the funds that accrue monthly to NDDC when the sole administrator position is unknown to the law setting up NDDC.\n\nPresently, the illegal NDDC Sole Administrator singularly acts as the Managing Director, the Executive Director of Finance and Administration, and Executive Director of Projects, with no checks and balances, proper corporate governance, and probity in administering the Commission.\n\nTo the detriment of the entire region, these illegal interim contraptions/sole administrator contraptions have been fleecing the NDDC of its funds in the last two years.\n\nAs pointed out by no less a person than the President of Ijaw National Congress (INC), Professor Benjamin Okaba, in an interview with a national daily on October 17, 2021, there has been unceasing irregularities and lack of due process in NDDC since October 2019 when the illegal interim management/sole administrator contraptions have been in place, administering a combined two-year budget of N799 Billion for 2019 and 2020, as approved by the National Assembly.\n\nProf. Okaba pointed out that \u201cwe are not particularly happy about the silence on the over N600bn payments made for emergency contracts; the over 1,000 persons who were allegedly employed in the NDDC between January and July, 2020 without due process. We are also aware that the 2020 budget was passed in December 2020 and N400bn was voted for the NDDC but the commission had spent over N190bn before the budget was passed. So, what happened to the Procurement Act?\u201d\n\n\n\nWe therefore urge President Buhari to halt the ongoing breach of the law governing the operation of the commission, the unfortunate disregard for the rule of law, and hearken to the unending calls, demands and peaceful agitations of youths, men and women, political and traditional leaders and civil society organisations for the inauguration of the board of NDDC. This will ensure compliance with the NDDC Act, promote and sustain peace, equity and fairness, transparency and accountability, good governance and rapid development and transformation of the Niger Delta Region.\n\n\n\nChief Boma Ebiakpo, National Chairman, Niger Delta Peoples Forum",
          "summary": "Civil society organisation, the Niger Delta Peoples Forum has condemned the reported surreptitious meeting between the NDDC Sole Administrator, Effiong Akwa, with a joint session of the National Assembly committees on Niger Delta Affairs.\nThe NDDC Act which explicitly states how the Commission is to be governed is clear on the process for the approval of NDDC annual Budget by the National Assembly.\nThe 2020 Financial year for NDDC\u2019s budget as approved by the National Assembly expired on December 31, 2021.\nThis will ensure compliance with the NDDC Act, promote and sustain peace, equity and fairness, transparency and accountability, good governance and rapid development and transformation of the Niger Delta Region.\nChief Boma Ebiakpo, National Chairman, Niger Delta Peoples Forum",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Badejo and Yetunde Afolabi\n\nA President of the Southeast extraction will ensure political balance and a sense of belonging to the region, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor, said yesterday.\n\nNigeria, he added, must create a political equilibrium that accommodates all the regions.\n\nObiozor pointed that it is only the Southeast that has not had a shot at the presidency since the return of democracy in 1999.\n\nSpeaking on Channels Politics Today, he said the Southeast has qualified candidates who can perform if elected.\n\nThe former Ambassador to the United States said history, the principle of fairness, morality and \u201call logical reasoning\u201d justify the demand for an Igbo president.\n\nHe was of the view that the Southeast was being accorded little or no significance in the sharing formulae and is usually placed last in all zonal allocations.\n\nObiozor also made a case for state police, saying it was the surest way to solve the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nHe appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to use the prerogative of mercy and not force to resolve pending issues against the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nOn Igbo President, the Ohanaeze President-General said: \u201cIt is important at this time in the history of Nigeria for each region to be given a sense of belonging for peace to reign.\n\n\u201cWe in Igboland are ready to give you candidates that are confident, with the capacity to perform.\n\n\u201cWe ask the nation to create a political balance that includes not just the South and North but the Eastern region of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to Obiozor, every zone has produced a president; therefore, the prospect of Igboland being denied again will not be accepted.\n\nOn the role of his organisation in producing a candidate, he said: \u201cOhanaeze will not be biased while selecting candidates. The country is gradually receding from nationalism.\n\n\u201cWe need someone to re-energise the nationalist spirit in Nigeria and the Igboland will produce one.\n\n\u201cMan proposes and God disposes but by all logical reasoning and judging by history, it is high time Southeast produces the next president.\n\n\u201cBy history, logic, morality and politics, it is fair for the Igbos to produce the next president.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be revealing our strategies in the public space. We have our strategies and we are united enough to produce the president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur candidates will emerge from their parties, but anybody that emerges will do that nationalistically and we need somebody from the Igbo land to do that.\n\n\u201cHowever, I can\u2019t predict the Igbo president, but from all we can see, an Igbo should be the next president. It is our time to produce the next president.\u201d\n\nOn Kanu, Obiozor said it would not be the first time such a similar case would be resolved politically.\n\n\u201cWe have made our position known that we prefer political solution through dialogue. This is the answer to the issue. The Igbos are not in a war with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMr. President has the prerogative of mercy to handle this matter. And we have made this statement several times.\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that similar treatment has been given to others in other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is certain that, if the President can do this, it will douse the tension in the Southeast and the country at large.\n\n\u201cBut, if the President does not do this, he can handle the matter in any other way other than using force.\n\n\u201cAnd as good citizens of Nigeria, we will love to meet the President again and again on this matter,\u201d Obiozor said.\n\nHe believes the security challenge in the Southeast was politically motivated, adding that the region used to be the most peaceful.\n\nHe said: \u201cSoutheast was the most peaceful region until the political season crept in.\u201d\n\nThe Ohanaeze helmsman again called for state police, saying the present centralised policing system was inadequate.\n\nAccording to him, the Nigerian security challenge has been settled by the 2014 National Conference that recommended state police.\n\n\u201cWe will not solve this challenge until we do this (have state police).\n\n\u201cIt is not a luxury but a necessity that must be done and the earlier we do it, the better for us as a nation,\u201d Obiozor added.",

Also, hundreds of kidnapped persons were unconditionally released by their\n\nHe explained that the political undertones of the banditry ravaging the State, which started yielding positive result by his administration in curtailing the menace was however, a bad news for some self-serving politicians.\n\nAccording to the Governor, such self-serving politicians whose stock in trade is inciting violence and \u201csowing discontent in our communities perfected plans to sabotage the peace process.\n\n\u201d In some cases, security reports have fingered them as having direct involvement in the planning and execution of kidnapping, ostensibly to embarrass the government.\u201d\n\nHe further said, the same crop of politicians will always try to paint a gloomy picture of the situation in Zamfara, often by exaggerating the figures of casualty in the event of attacks. For instance, based on the figures confirmed by the affected community leaders when he visited affected communities after the recent attacks, a total of 58 people were officially confirmed by both the security and emirs to have lost their lives in contrast with the outrageous figures being brandished in the media by the opposition who chose to play politics with the lives lost.\n\nIn furtherance of the government intervention, Gov Matawalle noted that under the dialogue process, the state government have also been committing enormous resources in the provision of logistics and allowances for the security forces.\n\nThis include among others, the procurement and distribution of 200 brand new Hilux pickups for the security forces barely a few months after his swearing-into office in 2019.\n\nSimilarly, with the escalation of the situation in recent months, he stated that the government adopted more stringent measures, including\n\nMatawalle, on behalf of the Government of Zamfara State, thanked Tinubu for taking time to visit and commiserate with the State, praying Allah to richly reward him and fulfill his desire for building a strong bond among Nigerians across all the divides.\n\nTinubu said he was in Zamfara to commiserate with his brother Matawalle and the entire people of the State, describing the Governor as a bridge-builder, bold and capable whose leadership acumen to lead in challenging times are unquantifiable, promising to support the Governor and security forces in their efforts to rid the state of the bedevilling insecurity.\n\nWhile donating N50 million to the victims of the recent incident, the APC leader who was accompanied by the former Governor of Borno State, Sen. Kashim Shetima; former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Malam Nuhu Ribado among others, commended President Muhammadu Buhari on his support and resilience in fighting kidnapping, banditry, and other security threats in various parts of the country.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: Why I\u2019m yet to join presidential race \u2013Orji Kalu",
          "text": "By Wilfred Eya\n\nSenate Chief Whip and Former governor of Abia State, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu has given reasons why he is hesitant to declare for the 2023 presidential race. Speaking yesterday on Arise Television, he said among others that certain variables are key to his ambition.\n\nAre you in any doubt that the presidency of 2023 would not be zoned to the South and that was why you said if your party decides to zone it to the South; is there something you know that we do not know about the possibility of the APC zoning the seat to the North or any other part of the country? Again, the emerging fashion these days is for everybody to go to the villa to inform the president formally that they are interested in the presidency of Nigeria. At least two persons from your party have done that but you did not go there; are you trying to snub the president of Nigeria or you don\u2019t think it is a good thing to go and take permission before declaring interest in the presidency?\n\nThank you Rueben; first of all I want to thank you and your crew for this opportunity. Secondly, I would like to make it clear to you that I do not own the party, neither does Tinubu or any other person own the party. This party is owned by the Nigerian people and the Nigerian people are the only ones who you know own the party; in a democratic setting, the majority always have their way. This is because unless the party zones it to us, if we go by the majority, in our next convention, if it is not properly settled and agreed upon, none of us would get it. This is why I said that there is no need going to say I want to contest or I do not want to contest until the APC National Convention Committee says it is going to go to the South most probably to the South East; a Nigerian president from the South East. Then thirdly, I cannot snub the president; how can I snub the president, the leader of the party? You cannot snub a man that sits at the right side of the chair. What I am just trying to do is to be careful in informing him. If I go and tell him I want to run for the president now and the party did not zone it to where I can have the opportunity to contest, I would not be so nice to myself. I can go and see the president and talk about other things like I have more pressing things in the South East, part of North West and North East as the Senate Chief Whip; I will be going in a couple of days to go and see him but not about the presidency. I must also not go with the Press; I might just walk in and discuss with him about the state of affairs in Nigeria. I am really not afraid about informing Nigerians. I can come out tomorrow and say from day one that I want to run but that is not a reasonable thing to do. You have the party and this party is not owned by me, neither is it owned by anybody. It is going to be owned by the majority of the Nigerian people who would be voting and saying it should go South, East North and so on. For me, the only two zones in Nigeria that have never produced the president are the North East and South East. So, let us be careful in what we are doing. I am committed to what I am doing. I am a committed person and I am committed to anything I put my heart in. I do not want to draw the dagger and go back.\n\nSo, what we have from you now is conditional declaration but let us address the elephant in the room; the fact that your trial for fraud had been adjourned to March this year, what then qualifies you to run for presidency when you have such charges hanging around you?\n\nI do not have any charges hanging around me; it is you the press that creates what you call charges and I am not supposed to talk about matters in court because you should know better that what I went to court to do is not about charges; I went to court to ask that some of my assets should be released. The matter is in court and I would not like to discuss that matter further because it is still in court. I cannot say anything; even you Rueben, you know me pre 1991, 1992 to 93,94, I bankrolled all the money politicians paid during that period. I was the one who brought the money in the PDP. So, how can I become a thief suddenly? I do not want to talk about that. People are pursuing me because they know I want to become president from Day one. They know. So, I do not want to talk about that; I have a lot of respect for our court system and talking about our court system here might not look nice. It might be looking down on the other arm of government. I am in one arm of the government and I would not like anybody looking down on the legislature. I would not want to answer any question on that further. If it is why you called me here, I am not going to answer or say anything further on that at all. So, it is a closed matter because it is before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nWho are those pursuing you; you said people are pursuing you. We would like to know?\n\nYou know them; they are Nigerians who want to be president. They are Nigerians who want to set me aside; they are Nigerians who just want to destroy me. Rueben, you knew me in 1991; I used to come to Alex Ibru; you knew where I lived in Victoria Island; you knew me where I was in Apapa where I used to do my shipping business and import sugar, rice and the rest of them. You know that there is a lot of jealousy in this system. A lot of people who think I became too successful at age 30; why must I have money and have power. Is life like that? You know that these people carelessly put me in prison for six months for doing nothing. I am not bitter about it because it is God\u2019s will. It is our court system that put me in prison.\n\nYou did nothing about the N7billion fraud; it is just these people that put you in prison; you mean you did nothing; they just put you in prison?\n\nThere were 19 witnesses in the court of competent jurisdiction. Nobody mentioned my name; nobody traced anything to me; nothing. I do not want to talk about this matter. Don\u2019t drag me into it. I do not want any court to come tomorrow and say I have violated the rules of the court please. I have obeyed the rules of the court. The court would say come back tomorrow and I would go; they would say come back next tomorrow and I would be there next tomorrow. I tried to do that because I am a Nigerian. I have the competence to stand trial anywhere because it is a process that a country should test on how people obey the rule of law.\n\nJust in case the APC decides to zone the presidency to the South and you go through the primaries and emerge, what should Nigerians expect from an Orji Uzor Kalu presidency? What would be the priorities of your administration?\n\nTo be honest with you, when I was governor, people were not going into Aba. It was a criminal setup there; there was something they called Ibu Alhaji, it was criminalized. My first priority would be to give the Nigerian people freedom from terrorism, banditry and anything you call it from Sahara desert to Atlantic ocean. I would like to give them the freedom to go to anywhere they wantbecause that is the freedom anybody needs and I am capable of doing that. My first priority would be security of lives and property of our people. When I was governor, the first thing I did was to clean the place up of criminals. The DSS saw that, the police saw that, the Army saw that from 1999 to 2007. You can leave your car in Aba, in Abia State and go anywhere; if people would say the truth. People were moving freely and I went to rescue Anambra State also; to give them a security roadmap. My wife is from Anambra State; I had to help the then governor, Mbadinuju to take the security steps. Onitsha, Nnewi and those places were no go areas. I know what to do. First would be security; secondly would be to restore the confidence of Nigerians; to give them the confidence to say they are Nigerians. The youth, elderly people, men and women need the confidence to go to the United States, UK and anywhere and say they are proudly Nigerians. That is the dress I want to wear. Confidence is everything. We have lost confidence in where we are coming from. Number three is to go back to the commercialized electricity to make sure we restore electricity to our people. Once we have electricity, we have everything. Every other thing would follow; I do not want to talk about roads. Believe me, I would create an economic miracle for the Nigerian people. This is what we need. Politics should be out of it. I would work with a good team to make sure that the banker, trader, artisan, industrialist, student and everybody has a feeling that they are Nigerians and that we can manage the economy very well. Our former formal focus would be on the economy and security.\n\nThe quest for a president of Igbo extraction as you have observed is for equity and justice; that includes anything from restructuring, self-determination to even secession. How would you handle all these yearnings if you emerge the president?\n\nI do not know what you people call restructuring because what I have always said is that there are too many loads in the other arm of the constitution. I am not going to talk about restructuring; first and foremost, you have to restructure a country when you are safe. I have to first of all face the issue of bandits and terrorism. I have to face the issue of hunger. I have to restore the confidence of the people. Those are not going to be my basic concerns. My basic concern is to go to the National Assembly, to the constitution because you cannot restructure without the National Assembly. A lot of our people are thinking that we will just wake up one day and say we do not want to use this constitution again. In which country does that happen? We have a union paper called the constitution. The constitution is what is binding all of us together. You cannot come out one day and say I want to restructure this country without properly going through amendment of the constitution. And the only authority that can do anything that you will call restructuring is the National Assembly. I will use the legal way to persuade the National Assembly to do what the Nigerian people would like us to do. That is democracy. I don\u2019t want to sit in my house or my office and be shouting restructuring. I know that the country needs some adjustments to be able to be profitable. We shall look at all those things through the National Assembly. That is the only way Nigeria can be viable to move forward.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nYou want to run for president; we would like to know more about you, your credentials, school you attended and secondly, you said you made money at a tender age, how did you make your money?\n\nWhen I was a student at the University of Maiduguri was when I started doing business; it was when I went to Maiduguri I found out that palm oil was a very lucrative business in Maiduguri. They don\u2019t have palm oil and whenever I am back for holiday, I would buy palm oil and go back; when I was coming back, I would buy dry fish from Baga in Gamboru Ngala local government and sell. I started like that and I moved on and started supplying cables to Chad River basin Authority. I built a furniture company in Maiduguri. It was very viable because all those people there were importing furniture from abroad and I felt that I should also go into the business. I entered into the business and became a very big giant. I competed with Santana furniture, Alhaji Brima and co. So, from there, when there was this war going on in Chad, there was this border problem between Chad and Nigeria, President Buhari was GOC, Jos and Babangida was Director of Army Staff Duties and he was moved from Lagos to Chad, luckily I ran into both of them and this is how I knew both of them. I started supplying food to the people in the warfront. The soldiers\u2019 food was supplied by my company. From there, when there was a problem in the University, 14 of us then were suspended. I was not expelled. I came back to the University authority led by Jibril Aminu; they wanted me back but I said no, I am part of the leadership; a leader must be a dumping ground. I said no, I would not be able to come back unless all of us are coming back. He called me because he was my father\u2019s friend that I would suffer a heavy consequence if I did not go back to school. I said no that I was not going to go back unless all of us go back together. That is the reason for the love people of that area have for me. So, I went to Lagos to start dealing on military equipment and armament and from there, we ventured into export of crude oil and all the rest of them. I started importing sugar, rice and all kinds of commodities in Lagos. By then, my office was in Calcutta crescent; Dangote\u2019s was in Creek Road. So, we were competitors in Rice and Sugar. I was one of the largest importers of rice and sugar. If Dangote is here, he would also bear me witness. For me, making money is an art. Then I started building industries in Aba; that\u2019s how those industries sprang up.\n\nYou said you were suspended in the University of Maiduguri, which school did you finally finish from? Did you eventually go back to school?\n\nYes, I finished at the Abia State University. I went to Eziama High School, Aba and from there, I went to Government College, Umuahia where I took my school certificate. I went for an Exchange programme in Barewa College, Zaria for six months to one year; with the holidays, it was about eight months. I was in the final year at the University of Maiduguri(the only exam I did not take then was PS 461 and 462); I should have graduated from there; when I was called back, I refused.\n\nMany of these things are available online; let us deal with governance issues; how would you rate the Buhari administration? How would you rate your successors after you left government since 2007? You were succeeded by Senator Theodore Orji and later Governor Ikpeazu. Have they been able to sustain what you left behind and then the Buhari administration?\n\nLet me be honest with you; Buhari administration has done very well in all facets. God brings every leader for whatever He wants to achieve. I will rate Buhari administration very highly because if he did not come in, maybe we would not have Nigeria by now. Honestly, Rueben, why I continue calling you is because you know me personally; you know I am not a sycophant. When I was living in Lagos, I discussed with you privately if you came to see me and you know my views about Nigeria. You know I believe in this country. You know I am detribilised. The Buhari administration has done very well in fighting banditry. We do not have enough resources to fight these people. The issue is not Buhari; the issue is that if the governors are putting their feet down to say you cannot do these things here, we would not be where we are. It is not about Buhari but also people knowing what they are supposed to do and doing it. I am not saying they are not doing anything. I like Governor Zulum; I like Wike even though some people might not like Wike for his ruggedness; I like Ugwuanyi, governor of Enugu State. You have to put your foot down and say these people, I do not want you there. If you do not want them, they would not be there. The thing starts from the primary area and not the secondary level. Buhari is just the president of Nigeria. When Obasanjo was president; there was a night that it was a firing point; the present DG of SSS was the Director of SSS in Abia. Throughout the night, it was a firing point. The level of fighting that night by these armed bandits in front of Government House, Umuahia was so much that I woke up President Obasanjo at about 2.30 am and I was awake with him till about 4.45 am and those people were still shooting. So, governors need to stand up and fight the war. More of the fights lie with the governors not with Buhari. Buhari is just the president. You are receiving allocations and everything. First of all, those armed bandits, the economy is suffering from it. Even the industry capacity is very low. Is it Buhari who is going to kick-start the industry capacity? The capacity utilization is very low; the input and output very low; people always believe they want to import when they have not done anything. I disagree with some policies the Buhari administration has executed like the N500billion social investment fund; it was money thrown into the Atlantic Ocean. I have said it before the president; I have said it before the late Chief of Staff. That one I don\u2019t agree with them but Buhari has done very well as a president. Some people say he hates the Igbo but I do not see that because the largest investment is done in Igbo land. Most of the things he is doing are there. He might have a problem with the Igbo but I do not see that. I see a man who is committed to fighting for Nigeria. Wherever he stops, we would choose those things he has done and continue from there because he has done very well. He is a title holder in my village and I am also a title holder in his village. Mind you I have followed Buhari not because he is the president. People are just following Buhari because he is the president. When he was campaigning in ANPP, they locked the Stadium and I brought him back and went with him to campaign as governor of PDP. I made him known to people that this was a family friend and that I had nothing to do with his party. As a former president, friend of our family and as a title holder in Igbere, I had to come with him. But when I left, the other administration after me locked the stadium against him. The APC has done very well; we have some imperfections yes; they are not perfect in economy which is where I am an expert that I am going to address. President Buhari cannot do everything in one day. We have to adjust here and there and move forward. Government is a continuum. Wherever he stops, we take over from there and improve on it. Everybody would expect that his son would be better than him. I am going to be 62 years old on April 21 and President Buhari is my father. I would work to be better than what he has done for the benefit of all Nigerians. On the issue of those who took over from me, if I am saying this, I am not a coward; only few days ago, I was in the house of my governor and I said it openly, google and see it. I said to the governor, I would never criticize you or praise you in public. I went to see him and I went upstairs and told him things. I came naked to him and he came naked to him. I blamed him where he deserved blame and praised him where he needed to be praised. I told him I would never sing his praises and when I came out, the Press asked me what did you discuss with the governor and I said you know that I can never praise or condemn the governor in public. I was a former governor of that state. Whatever I would discuss with them, I would do that inside the room because I was a former governor. Just like if God helps me and I happen to be the president of Nigeria, you want me to discuss what I saw with President Buhari or what he has done as president. No. I will not discuss it but I will go back to him to Daura even if it means every three months to see the president and discuss issues with him. We must start helping our elders to know that they are elders so that when they exit, they would still be advisers. What is happening in Nigeria is that every president, governor, minister, commissioner, whoever he succeeds would be his enemy. It is not the way to go. If the man I left office for handles me as an enemy, so be it.\n\nPresident Buhari would certainly agree with your appraisal of his performance but in his exclusive interview last June with Arise News, he said that governors cannot just sit back after winning an election and expect others to do the job of security for them. He said they should engage with community and traditional leaders. What is your take on that and his stance against state police?\n\nTo be honest with you, even when I was governor, I have always believed that we should have state police. I don\u2019t have the same opinion with the president on state police. I have always believed that if we have a bill for an act that can convince the National Assembly, why not, we could have state police but we need to put checks and balances in those state police. The state police is good and bad. So, the advantages are like the disadvantages. If you do not have enough checks and balances, to check whoever would be the commissioner of police or this and that, the governors would do what we are seeing also in local government funds. The local governments are supposed to be very independent. So, I believe in what President Buhari said. I seem to be changing my views that the state police is still very good for us but you need the amendment of the constitution. I also believe that state governors are not engaging well; most of the governors do not engage stakeholders. When I was governor, one of my commissioners of police was A.A Abubakar who passed out as IG. Him and Bichi were there with me and they can tell you that we were having regular security meetings every week. If I was not there, the deputy governor would sit in and if the deputy governor was not there, the Secretary to the government would sit in. We were talking about community, meeting with traditional rulers, youths, market women, traders and finding strategies to keep peace in our state. So, unless governors go back to start doing that, there is not going to be a change. Buhari cannot takeover security from the governors because it is in their hands. They should go back and do due diligence on the security system. On the N500 billion, I wrote a paper to the late Chief of Staff and we discussed it; I even went to see the president. I advised against using N500 billion for social development; it was worthless as far as I was concerned. First year in 2015, you would have sent N10 billion each to the senatorial districts for a business man to borrow this money at one percent. If it is in Kano, groundnut, if it is in Abia, palm, in Osun Koko and so on to the 36 states. The first year in 2015, and second year 2016, you do the same thing to the second senatorial districts and the third year, you do the same to the last Senatorial districts. You lend to business men that have land to cultivate and they would employ people and do agriculture. They should lend the money directly from the Central Bank without a middle man so that there would be no stories. The money would generate and put us back to productivity. We should have been able to produce and feed ourselves in the first three years of being president. You would see that Nigerians would be able to feed themselves because they would produce food for our consumption and export. The fourth year, we are going to put small scale industries the same way, giving different business men N10 billion each. Nigeria must go back to production if we want to survive as a nation.\n\nIf you give an Igbo man N10 billion and he starts a business in Onitsha, he is faced with the problem of sit-at-home and that brings us to the issue \u2013what did you discuss with Nnamdi Kanu and what is your take on the IPOB situation?\n\nWhat I discussed with Nnamdi Kanu is sacrosanct between me and him; it was a private discussion and I am not going to tell you. Period! I am not going to discuss that with you. This is me and this is who I am.\n\nOn the IPOB case still, how can we bring peace to the South East?\n\nThere is a court process and it has to finish. If we finish the court process, we would now see if we can ask the president to pardon Kanu. When people are asking the president for pardon, what are they asking for? I believe this case is already in court of competent jurisdiction and I don\u2019t want to discuss it. Let the court process take its course. Before, when Nnamdi Kanu was in Kuje prison, I don\u2019t want to call names, with a top security agent, I went to prison to bail him and he was given bail. It nearly took my head; I didn\u2019t bail him but I committed my person that Kanu should be bailed. That was when I entered APC in 2016. I went to the father and mother of Nnamdi Kanu; I briefed them and I said please if you can beg him to do his IPOB with care. I handled the IPOB people when I was governor. I said you could carry your flags but immediately I see you with arms, I would come after you. You can say you want Biafra; there is nothing wrong with that. You can carry your flag and say you want Biafra or you want that but you don\u2019t kill people or go harassing people.\n\nDo you have any anxieties about certain things that people may bring up if you decide eventually to run for the presidency in 2023? Are there certain things that you worry about? For example, your former deputy, Enyinnaya Abaribe wrote a book \u2018Made in Aba: A life of coincidencies\u2019 and he was not kind to you at all in that book. Do you sometimes feel uncomfortable that these are things people would bring up?\n\nNo, no. I do not have anything whatsoever; let me tell you, apart from this gang up to put me in prison, I never had any gang up against me anywhere. I am not afraid of anybody. I am only afraid of God. I am not afraid of anything and I am the most prepared presidential candidate to be on the field. Even if I am old, I am young at heart. I can go with the boys to dance disco in the night and I can come with the serious people in the afternoon to do the business of government. The most important thing is the business of the unity of the country. I have never done anything to make me not to sleep. I have never done anything that would make me to be afraid of anybody. I have been on the street for a very long time. I know my problems. You know that they conspired against me.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nThe price of Liquefied Natural Gas (LPG), popularly called cooking gas which hit the roof top about five months ago selling at N8,500 per 12.5kg is set to crash to an all time low as the Board of Directors of the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG), has approved the supply of 100 per cent of the company\u2019s LPG production(Propane and Butane) into the Nigerian domestic market.\n\nThe development may not be unconnected with strong calls and appeals from stakeholders in the gas sector that NLNG increase its supply of LPG into the domestic market which they claim accounts for about 65 per cent.\n\nThey argued that the shortfall of 35 per cent is sourced from imports which comes at a premium due to the imposition of Value Added Tax of 7.5 per cent among other added cost, leading to a sharp rise in cooking gas price.\n\nConsumers of cooking gas had in the last five months contended with the escalating price of the product, forcing many to resort to the use of dirty fuels which included; charcoal, firewood, Kerosene among others. The milestone according to NLNG is coming just three months after the Company supplied its first Propane cargo into the domestic market and has developed a scheme to sustainably supply Propane for usage in cooking gas blending as well as in agro-allied, autogas, power and petrochemical sectors of the Nigerian economy to further deepen gas utilisation in Nigeria.\n\nNLNG explained that these initiatives are designed to increase LPG availability in Nigeria, diversifying its uses and support the Federal Government\u2019s Decade of Gas initiative. NLNG is currently the highest single supplier of LPG into the domestic market, with an estimated 400,000 metric tonnes supplied in 2021.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of NLNG, Dr. Philip Mshelbila, said the announcement marked the Company\u2019s strong commitment to the continued growth of the domestic LPG market and its passion to increase utilisation of one of the most versatile energy sources in the world.\n\nHe said the Company was inclined towards helping to build a strong economy based on the gas resources that Nigeria is abundantly blessed with, and that natural gas could help drive the economy by providing cooking gas for homes, supporting industrialisation, powering mobile cell sites and complex transportation systems, impacting food supply through its usage for fertilizer production and increasing power supply to both homes and industries while reducing the country\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nAccording to Mshelbila, \u201cGas, as the cleanest of the fossil fuels, has become an essential energy source to be reckoned with during this energy transition period. Other countries are revolutionising their energy industry to cut down on carbon emissions drastically. Nigeria should not be left out in this drive, considering its abundant gas resources. Gas is essential for life and living at the moment, because it can support everything we will need to develop our economy and create better living standards for Nigerians. We need to change the narrative, and NLNG is being pragmatic about it.\n\n\u201cWe are ardently following up on the commitment we made in March 2021 at the NLNG-sponsored pre-summit conference of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS) 2021 organised by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources to support the Decade of Gas declaration by the Federal Government. We are driven by our vision to remain a globally competitive LNG company helping to build a better Nigeria and are making a reality of our collective dreams that one day we can switch all cooking fuels to gas, and power our vehicles with gas as encapsulated in the government\u2019s National Gas Expansion Program and the Autogas Policy,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "* Reveals Lagos-Ibadan, Sagamu-Benin Expressways for completion this year\n\n*Feels nostalgia for the past as young infantry officer at Lafenwa Barracks\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari said yesterday in Ogun State that he had found in Governor Dapo Abiodun a politician who lived by the dictum, promise made and promise kept. Buhari stated this during a visit to the state, where he inaugurated some landmark projects. It was his first official visit to a state in the new year.\n\nAddressing the people during the inauguration of the five strategic projects, Buhari said he was proud of the governor, who also completed two federal roads in his state. He said Abiodun exemplified constructive engagement and collaboration between the federal and state governments.\n\nBuhari said the scenes at the reception ceremony organised for him and the large crowd of residents that came out to welcome him triggered in him a wave of nostalgia for his days as a young infantry officer at the Nigerian Army barracks at Lafenwa in Abeokuta, not long after independence.\n\nHe praised Abiodun for delivering visionary projects in the state, even in the midst of challenging circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDescribing Abiodun as the \u201cPerforming Governor of Nigeria\u2019s Gateway State,\u201d the president maintained that the governor was a worthy example of promise made, promises kept.\n\nBuhari told Abiodun, \u201cYour Excellency, well done! I am proud of what you have done for your state and your people. You have made our great party, the APC, proud, too.\n\n\u201cYou are a worthy example of promises made, promises kept. These lofty projects could not have materialised without your huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property.\u201d\n\nThe projects, which the president came to inaugurate, included the Gateway City Gate, the 42-kilometre Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta Road, 14-kilometre Ijebu-Ode-Epe Expressway, and two housing estates for low, medium and high income earners at Kobape and Oke-Mosan in Abeokuta.\n\n\u201cThis has made Ogun State one of the safest and most peaceful states in the country and investors\u2019 destination of choice,\u201d Buhari stated. He also told the governor, \u201cYou have justified the mandate of the people of Ogun State. You have represented our party very well.\u201d\n\nBuhari expressed delight that the 14-kilometre Ijebu Ode-Mojoda-Epe Road commissioned by him had been reconstructed into a modern expressway by the state government, stating that the road would complement the Sagamu-Benin Expressway that the federal government is currently reconstructing.\n\nThe president said, \u201cJust across the road is the 42-kilometre Sagamu-Interchange-Abeokuta Road, which the state government has reconstructed and equipped with street lights. That road enjoys a direct linkage with the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway that the federal government is rebuilding and due for completion later this year.\n\n\u201cI am particularly impressed by the quality and standard of your road projects, and the creative way you have deployed resources to reconstruct and rehabilitate them. It is significant to note that the two road projects being commissioned today are federal roads.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the states and federal government. These roads also fit well into our rail transportation masterplan that connects Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital, to Kano, with Ogun State, having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.\u201d\n\nBuhari announced that the federal government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of these roads, as done for the 100-kilometre Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro Road. He also promised to consider the approval of the reconstruction of Sagamu-Ogijo Road by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited under the tax credit scheme.\n\nOn the housing programme of the state government, the president commended its inclusiveness, saying it is equally heart-warming that it cuts across different social strata, capturing the low, medium and high-income earners.\n\nAdmiring the Gateway City Gate Project, Buhari said, \u201cIt is not just a park beautification project. It depicts that something new is happening in Ogun State, a welcoming entrance into the state capital at the centre point of the state.\u201d\n\nResponding to requests by the governor to give priority to the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Otta-Idiroko roads, the president assured the people of Ogun State that the roads would receive the federal government\u2019s attention.\n\nThe federal government had previously approved the reconstruction of the 100 kilometres Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro Road to be handled by the Dangote Group.\n\nThe president thanked Ogun residents for the warm reception accorded him and his entourage in the state, which was his first visit to any state in the New Year.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe traditional hospitality of the people of this state has not waned a bit. Today, I am \u2018Omowale\u2019 and very happy at this homecoming to meet my brothers and sisters, whose goodwill I have always enjoyed.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the people of Ogun State were blessed to have such a focused, deliberate and inclusive administration under the watch of Abiodun. The president said, \u201cThe reward for success is more hard work to meet the increasing expectations of the people. When state governments deliver impactful projects, in consultations with stakeholders, like we have witnessed in Ogun State, the trajectory of our national development will be enhanced.\u201d\n\nBuhari, who was bestowed with \u201chonourary indigeneship\u201d of the state, said, \u201cIt is also with a sense of responsibility that I receive and cherish the honourary indigeneship bestowed on me as symbolised by the presentation of the key to the Gateway State by Governor Abiodun.\n\n\u201cI will leave Ogun State with fond memories and look forward to enjoying the privilege of my honourary indigeneship.\u201d\n\nIn his own remarks, the governor noted that the state had the highest number of federal roads in Nigeria. He called for the federal government\u2019s intervention to fix the roads, which he described as strategic.\n\nEarlier, Abiodun had highlighted some of the projects executed by his administration under the acronym \u201cISEYA\u201d and requested that the president, would before the end of the year, beinvited to the state to inaugurate more projects.\n\nReiterating that Ogun had highest number of federal roads in the country, Abiodun further requested that the state be accorded a Special Status for Federal Government Infrastructural Funding, especially, on roads.\n\nThe president was received by Abiodun and five other governors, namely, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos; Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni; Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Osun State Governor, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola; Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, and the representative of Oyo State Governor, Mr. Rauf Olaniyan.\n\nAt the reception also were Alhaji Aliko Dangote and former governors of the state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Otunba Gbenga Daniel and Chief Segun Osoba.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday said it was working with development partners to address cases of circulating mutant polio virus Type2 (cMPV2) found in some parts of the country. It blamed the cases of polio outbreak on disruptions to routine immunisation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn a statement signed by Executive Director of the National Primary HealthCare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, the agency stated that it had already acquired new tools and resources to ensure the outbreak of polio was contained through robust outbreak responses using the novel Oral Polio Vaccine (nOPV2).\n\nHe said the vaccine had been shown to be effective in halting the spread of the cMPV2.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAll 36 states and FCT have completed at least one nOPV2 Outbreak Response (OBR). Several other rounds of the OBR as well as other campaigns to improve the mucosal immunity of children aged o-5 years old using Injectable Polio Vaccine (IPV) have also been planned for this year. Efforts are also being ramped up to increase routine immunisation coverage beyond pre-COVID values,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib who said the attention of NPHCDA and development partners was drawn to some media reports, (not THISDAY) claiming that there was an outbreak of a new polio virus in some states.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, no case of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) has been reported anywhere in the country since the last case in 2016. We currently have 395 cases of Circulating Mutant Poliovirus Type 2 (cMPV2) across 27 states and the FCT.\n\n\u201cNigeria and the African region were certified Wild Polio Virus (WPV) free in 2020, following a rigorous verification and certification process by the African Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (ARCC) which spanned three years of no detection of WPV. Till date, there has been no case of WPV anywhere in the country.\u201d\n\nShuaib said the cMPV2 outbreaks were caused by immunity gaps in children due to several reasons, including low routine immunisation coverage, and missing children during immunisation campaigns.\n\nHe further said the suspension of several polio campaigns and other health programmes in 2020, as well as disruptions to routine immunisation because of the COVID-19 pandemic, created further immunity gaps which led to new and wider outbreaks, and further increased transmission of the circulating mutant poliovirus both globally and within Nigeria.\n\nShuaib added that the virus thrived in areas with poor sanitation, open defecation, and inadequate access to clean drinking water.\n\nAccording to him, these condition allows the virus to be easily transmitted from one person to another through contaminated water and poor sewage disposal.\n\nThe NPHCDA boss said malnutrition occasioned by increasing poverty was also a predisposing factor in exposed children.\n\nHe then, \u201cThese non-wild polio viruses which originated because of normal changes in the reproduction of viruses in the environment are not as virulent as WPV and are also being reported in many other countries.\n\n\u201cNPHCDA assures Nigerians that the agency and partners will continue to conduct surveillance and vaccination campaigns to prevent and contain any possible importation of the Wild Polio Virus into the country.\n\n\u201cWe use this opportunity to reiterate the importance of parents and caregivers bringing their children for routine immunisation against vaccine preventable diseases.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is expected to boost intra-African trade by transforming and facilitating payment, clearing and settlement for cross-border trade across Africa.\n\nPAPSS provides the solution to the disconnected and fragmented nature of payment and settlement systems that had long impeded intra-African trade.\n\nThe Africa Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), in collaboration with African Union (AU) and African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), officially launched the platform for commercial use.\n\nThe CBN governor described the PAPPS as a breakthrough achievement for the continent, saying it would help facilitate trade and enhance payment gateway across West Africa.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, the new payment solution would contribute towards formalising trade in the continent, adding that it would be beneficial to households, firms and financial institutions in the continent.\n\nHe estimated that intra-African trade would increase to 35 per cent, from 15 per cent in the next five years with infrastructure provided by PAPSS.\n\nHe also pointed out that with growing pace of digitalisation in financial services, the PAPSS could serve as a viable platform for supporting e-commerce in the continent.\n\n\u201cBusinesses can be assured of an efficient and reliable payment gateway that supports the instant flow of funds and relatively the use of safe payment channels that usually comes at a high cost to households and businesses.\n\n\u201cPrior to the launch of PAPSS, settlements for intra Africa trade required a third currency and a non-African correspondent bank. This resulted in an estimated loss of close to $5 billion annually and undermined trade in Africa countries.\n\n\u201cThe launch of PAPPS gives the fresh opportunity and aspiration for the African continent. It will simplify cross-border transactions, reduce third currencies for intra-African transactions and remove the need for correspondent banks and ultimately amplify intra trade significantly.\n\n\u201cCBN will ensure the financial institutions under its jurisdiction accept PAPSS and recommend it to businesses across Nigeria,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nGhana\u2019s President, Nana Akufo-Addo, who was represented by the country\u2019s Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia hosted and presided over the commercial launch of the PAPSS, saying that the platform would save Africa more than $5 billion annually in payment transaction costs, while it plays an increasingly significant role in accelerating the continent\u2019s transactions underpinning the operationalisation of the AfCFTA.\n\nAkufo-Addo complimented Afreximbank and AfCFTA Secretariat for establishing the payment system, citing PAPSS as a major leap in releasing the continent from overdependence on external players and factors in achieving a long yearned-for acceleration in intra-continental trade and investment.\n\n\u201cThis launch is a result of many months of hard work, resolve and commitment towards achieving set objectives for the growth of the continent in trade. All Central Banks in Africa must now join up and ensure seamless transfer of funds deploying this most practical and important African solution to an African problem,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his comment, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Afreximbank, Prof. Benedict Oramah said: \u201cWe are eager to build upon the African Continental Free Trade Area\u2019s creation of a single market throughout Africa, and PAPSS provides the state-of-the-art financial market infrastructure connecting African markets to each other thereby enabling instant cross-border payments in respective local African currencies for cross-border trade. \u201cAfreximbank as the main Settlement Agent for PAPSS, provides settlement guarantees on the payment system and overdraft facilities to all settlement agents, in partnership with Africa\u2019s participating Central Banks. \u201cPAPSS will effectively eliminate Africa\u2019s financial borders, formalise and integrate Africa\u2019s payment systems, and play a major role in facilitating and accelerating the huge AfCFTA-induced growth curve in intra-African trade.\u201d\n\nThe event was graced by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, former President of Nigeria and Chairman of the IAFTA Advisory Council, and Mahamadou Issoufou \u2013 former President of Republic of Niger who is acknowledged as a champion in driving the establishment of the AfCTA Initiative.\n\nIn his presentation, PAPSS CEO Mr. Mike Ogbalu emphasised that the payment system was not designed to compete with or replace existing payment systems, but to facilitate the connectivity level that brings all payments systems together into one network that is interoperable, efficient and affordable.\n\n\u201cPAPSS is designed to make our currencies regain value to domesticate intra-Africa payments in this journey towards African prosperity, while providing the superhighway which connects others to reach every part of this continent as we seek to create the Africa that We Want.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the AfCFTA Secretary General H.E Wamkele Mene appreciated the role and commitment of the Continent\u2019s Heads of States and Governments through the African Union, saying their strong political will continue to be the bedrock of progress towards a full implementation of AfCFTA.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A Nigerian lady based in Vienna, Austria, Susan Edeh, has narrated in an interview how a pastor of Omega Fire Ministries identified as Jesse, his wife and church members brutalised her after she requested a refund of a loan she gave to the church to pay up rent arrears.\n\nAccording to her, Jesse had reached out to her to support him with the payment of church rent to avoid eviction.\n\nSaharaReporters had on January 3 reported that Edeh, who is also a member of the church founded by Apostle Johnson Suleman, was brutalised by the pastor who she had agreed to support and had taken a loan from her bank for the purpose.\n\nIt had also been reported that Pastor Jesse promised to pay back the loan but refused after several years.\n\nAccording to her, anytime she requested a repayment, the pastor would start blackmailing and threatening to deal with her.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Edeh paid a visit to the church on Sunday, January 2 in a bid to clear the air on issues surrounding the loans.\n\nHowever, rather than a peaceful resolution as she had envisaged, trouble erupted as members of the church allegedly beat her, her child and the father of her children.\n\nShe said she was beaten to an extent that she lost a lot of blood but for the intervention of the police.\n\nIn an interview, Edeh said, \u201cI live in Austria in Vienna city. On Sunday 2nd January, I had prepared to go to my church so I decided to go to Omega Fire Ministries where I used to attend. I recently stopped, to talk to members and the pastor concerning the loans I loaned him which they used to pay the rent for the church. I wanted to speak with everybody so we could just have an agreement concerning it. See Also Scandal Exclusive: Pastor In Apostle Suleman's Omega Fire Ministry Allegedly Brutalises Austria-based Nigerian Lady For Asking Repayment Of Five-year-old Loan\n\n\u201cI got there with my three kids. I got to the church, we were at the altar actually dancing, they finished and the pastor said someone should give me the microphone; as I was about to talk, the problem started.\n\n\u201cI was just waving my hand and saying 'praise the Lord' when the father of my kids stood up to make a video and a lady kicked his phone off his hands and all of a sudden, they started kicking him and the pastor actually made a statement with the microphone telling them, \u2019beat Solomon, take him away from here\u2019.\n\n\u201cI walked down to where the wife was standing and told her they should stop this, this is not why we came, I just came to talk to them. There's been a lot of blackmails, issues talks that have been going on concerning me.\n\n\u201cI also heard from some people I know from Auchi. Three weeks ago, the pastor made some videos and said some things that were not right and this is a church that I've been to for six years and I have friends there, even though I've not been there for two months now.\n\n\u201cIn October 2021 when I told him they had to pay the money as agreed since 2019, he came up with a lot of text messages and voice notes threatening me. I felt it was better I speak out and bring clarity to the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time he assaulted me for requesting for the money, early last year, I felt I couldn't stay in the church anymore so I informed him and his wife that I was going to be leaving, I decided to make it official because I worked with him. I also wanted to know every other arrangement on payment because I don't think I'd come back again.\n\nWhen asked if she had any piece of evidence to show that the pastor was actually owing her, she said, \u201cWhen the money issue came, as soon as I went to collect it, I just went to his office and gave him cash at hand but he never denied the fact that he's owing me because the church is actually paying 180 Euros into my account once in a while, that's the only evidence I have.\u201d\n\nNarrating further how the January 2 event happened, Edeh stated: \u201cThe beating started with the pastor because I was standing by him, someone already started beating the father of my children, so I went towards that side, he was also there and I told him to tell them to stop and then someone pushed me to him.\n\n\u201cIt was like me resting myself on him because of the push from behind and then he immediately hit me and started beating me up, the church members also joined, I felt a lot of hands on me.\n\n\u201cI was going down on my knees and I couldn't hold him anymore but I saw the shoe of my daughter and heard her voice also, I just kind of had the strength to get up as I heard her voice.\n\n\u201cI saw the pastor's wife beside me so I grabbed her skirt to stand up so when they saw I was already up, they immediately started taking her away from me, that was how I escaped from them. An ambulance came and took me to the hospital.\u201d\n\nOn how she has been coping with the loan repayment at the bank where she reportedly took it from, Edeh said, \u201cThere's a certain amount I pay to the bank every month and every three months, I also pay a certain amount to the bank for owing and credit so this makes it two different kinds of payment, they take it automatically from my account.\u201d\n\nOn the intervention by the head church in Nigeria, Edeh said she already informed the wife to the General Overseer of the church, Lizzy Johnson Suleman of the loan in October last year and with the recent incident, she had to forward pictures and videos to her but she never got a response.",

          "text": "A Nigerian lady based in Vienna, Austria, Susan Edeh, has narrated in an interview how a pastor of Omega Fire Ministries identified as Jesse, his wife and church members brutalised her after she requested a refund of a loan she gave to the church to pay up rent arrears.\n\nAccording to her, Jesse had reached out to her to support him with the payment of church rent to avoid eviction.\n\nSaharaReporters had on January 3 reported that Edeh, who is also a member of the church founded by Apostle Johnson Suleman, was brutalised by the pastor who she had agreed to support and had taken a loan from her bank for the purpose.\n\nIt had also been reported that Pastor Jesse promised to pay back the loan but refused after several years.\n\nAccording to her, anytime she requested a repayment, the pastor would start blackmailing and threatening to deal with her.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Edeh paid a visit to the church on Sunday, January 2 in a bid to clear the air on issues surrounding the loans.\n\nHowever, rather than a peaceful resolution as she had envisaged, trouble erupted as members of the church allegedly beat her, her child and the father of her children.\n\nShe said she was beaten to an extent that she lost a lot of blood but for the intervention of the police.\n\nIn an interview, Edeh said, \u201cI live in Austria in Vienna city. On Sunday 2nd January, I had prepared to go to my church so I decided to go to Omega Fire Ministries where I used to attend. I recently stopped, to talk to members and the pastor concerning the loans I loaned him which they used to pay the rent for the church. I wanted to speak with everybody so we could just have an agreement concerning it.

I got to the church, we were at the altar actually dancing, they finished and the pastor said someone should give me the microphone; as I was about to talk, the problem started.\n\n\u201cI was just waving my hand and saying 'praise the Lord' when the father of my kids stood up to make a video and a lady kicked his phone off his hands and all of a sudden, they started kicking him and the pastor actually made a statement with the microphone telling them, \u2019beat Solomon, take him away from here\u2019.\n\n\u201cI walked down to where the wife was standing and told her they should stop this, this is not why we came, I just came to talk to them. There's been a lot of blackmails, issues talks that have been going on concerning me.\n\n\u201cI also heard from some people I know from Auchi. Three weeks ago, the pastor made some videos and said some things that were not right and this is a church that I've been to for six years and I have friends there, even though I've not been there for two months now.\n\n\u201cIn October 2021 when I told him they had to pay the money as agreed since 2019, he came up with a lot of text messages and voice notes threatening me.

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily. I\u2019ll do my best to help with some free promotions. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e \u2014 Frank Donga\u2122 (@frankdonga_) January 12, 2022\n\nMid-way through the suspension period, during his Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day anniversary presidential speech in October, President Buhari said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions.\n\nA number of notable conditions include Twitter setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.\n\nThe statement on the lifting of the suspension indicates that these conditions have been met\u2014in the first quarter of this year Twitter is expected to establish a legal entity in Nigeria and in 2023 appoint a country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tarneem Saeed: The entrepreneur at the forefront of Sudan\u2019s economic renaissance",
          "text": "She left law in the UK, returned to Sudan, and built the largest online marketplace in the country. Now, she\u2019s building the biggest fintech startup in the country. How\u2019s Saeed doing all of this in Sudan, one of Africa\u2019s most conflict-torn political landscapes?\n\nIn the media, Sudan is often portrayed as an unstable country. In October last year, it made the news again; this time, not for the civil unrest that has engulfed the Northeast-African nation for the past 40 years but for alsoug, a marketplace startup in the country, which closed a $5 million institutional funding round.\n\nThis investment is the first of its kind since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period. So, it isn\u2019t only a big deal for the startup but for the entire ecosystem. It is a milestone that marks the beginning of a new era for business in Sudan.\n\nalsoug, founded in 2016 by Tarneem Saeed, is reportedly the biggest tech startup in the country; the funding round speaks to this fact. What is surprising, however, is that, in a conservative and conflict-torn nation like Sudan, a woman-led company is at the forefront of bringing Sudan\u2019s economy back to health.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTarneem Saeed and founding alsoug\n\nSaeed left Sudan for the first time when she was 14. Her father was a successful Sudanese businessman and her mother a top professional in the humanitarian space. At the time, the Sudanese educational system had gone to shambles, so Saeed\u2019s parents shipped Saeed and her brother to Canada to continue their education. From Canada, Saeed proceeded to the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) where she studied law and served as the president of the Arabic Society.\n\nShe worked as a corporate lawyer at Allen and Overy, a global law firm present in over 60 countries, for 4 years. In 2014, she took a sabbatical to visit Sudan to help a family friend put together a collection of coffee table books focused on Sudanese\u2019s artists.\n\nUpon getting to Sudan and staying a few days, she began to see how disconnected the country was from the digital economy.\n\n\u201cSudan felt so cut off from the world. It was like in the 1990s; people and businesses weren\u2019t harnessing the full power of the internet. Coming from London, Sudan just felt really empty,\u201d Saeed said. \u201cOne thing that irked me the most was how difficult it was to find out the price of anything. You had to ask someone to get the price of a car, house, and even cattle.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t sit well with Saeed. Sudan has a staggering 64% of its population under the age of 24 and boasts a mobile penetration rate of 73%\u2014so, why was it still living in the 1990s?\n\nSaeed decided to do something about it. Throughout 2015, she and her small team were building a broker platform where people could check the prices of goods and services. In 2016, alsoug was launched as a classified marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe chose the classifieds model because Sudan was quite unstable and the internet wasn\u2019t great,\u201d said Saeed. \u201cThe beauty of the online classifieds platform, however, is that it doesn\u2019t require heavy tech, and you can do a lot on it while keeping costs fairly low.\u201d\n\nTarneem Saeed, founder/CEO of Alsoug\n\nIn 2016\u20132017, the telecommunication companies present in Sudan were in survival mode. They were cutting operation costs and not reinvesting in the country. As a result, the country\u2019s tech got old and any mass digital product had to be light so that people could access it with their 2G and not-so-strong 3G.\n\nalsoug continued as a classified platform where people would go to check out the price of things\u2014as Saeed had envisioned it\u2014and connect with sellers. Saeed and her team took to the streets to onboard offline merchants, educating them about alsoug\u2019s value. The team also doubled down on SEO since they couldn\u2019t advertise on social media because Facebook won\u2019t allow them to target Sudan. After a while, the platform started picking up momentum.\n\nAfter the success of the classifieds model, Saeed\u2019s thesis that Sudanese aren\u2019t suspicious of tech and would embrace it, if provided, was now proven, and it was time for alsoug to pivot into a scalable business model\u2014where the platform facilitates more than just discovery but also payments and fulfillment.\n\nA big problem is a big opportunity\n\nalsoug has pivoted into a marketplace that facilitates an entire e-commerce value chain, but there\u2019s a problem: there aren\u2019t any existing digital payment options to plug into. \u201cThere was no M-Pesa or Paystack,\u201d Saeed said, so the company couldn\u2019t process payments online and had to settle for cash on delivery.\n\nAfter using this model for a while, the company realised that they\u2019d have to build their own payment gateway. After all, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time they\u2019d build supporting tech from scratch: Saeed said they\u2019d earlier built their own SMS tool after a series of terrible experiences with some third parties.\n\n\u201cSo, we started looking into building our payment gateway, obtaining licenses, and talking to potential partners. Then we met Ashraf Sabry Fawry CEO and some other key shareholders, who convinced us that if we were going into the payment space, we\u2019d have to spend more money,\u201d said Saeed.\n\n\u201cWe realised we could build a payment network across Sudan. We decided to raise capital, but we were keen on bringing in adventurous VCs with high ethical standards who\u2019d understand that doing business in Sudan is a long-term play. It took a while to close, but it\u2019s worth the time.\u201d\n\nalsoug now has a payment gateway called Cashi that facilitates payments on its marketplace; and the company is also on the brink of rolling out its POS machines across the nation. What started as a buyer-seller matchmaking site has morphed into a full-blown e-commerce and fintech powerhouse.\n\nThe alsoug roadmap is very ambitious. However, building as a woman in Sudan is a tough call. This is not only true for Sudanese women, it\u2019s the reality of every female founder across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are places I can\u2019t go to and have to rely on male employees to go there. For example, I can\u2019t go to the car market because it\u2019s a male-dominated market and women aren\u2019t taken seriously there.\u201d\n\nAlsoug team at work\n\nSaeed also narrated how in most meetings with regulators or government officials, they directed their questions to her male employees rather than her. She, however, isn\u2019t deterred by this because instead of taking it as an insult, she\u2019s turned it into fuel driving her ambition. She said one way to look at it and not feel disrespected is to consider that Sudan is majorly an Islamic environment where it\u2019s believed that men should lower their gaze.\n\nAccording to Saeed, the company has managed to capture the biggest market share because of their operational strategy. Though there are some Arab marketplaces competing with them, they are not bothered. Over the years, a number of companies have come, launched, and then shut down within a short period of time. Before anyone knew what was happening Sudan had eaten them up whole and spit them out of its borders.\n\nThe Sudan market is tough, and what helped alsoug was building light as they grew; they didn\u2019t try to overweigh the market all at once. Now the market trusts them to deliver even on other fronts\u2014like fintech.\n\n\u201cNo one has managed to penetrate the offline market and sustain growth the way we have. We have gone from people throwing us out of their shops to them coming to us,\u201d Saeed said with a faint giggle. \u201cAt the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand. For example, real estate brokers thought we\u2019d come to steal their jobs, but when we encouraged them to get on the platform, they realised an increase in their sales exponentially in the course of a year.\u201d\n\nalsoug has used its empathetic offline education to turn competitors into customers and partners not only in the marketplace section, but also in the fintech division. According to Saeed, the company is not trying to compete with the banks, telecoms, and the budding fintech ecosystem; it just wants to fix the black holes by playing in a space where none of them is playing. \u201cDigital cash in and cash out,\u201d she said.\n\nSudan in retrospect\n\nTo really understand how much of a hard ground Sudan was and still is to do business in, a little context is necessary.\n\nSudan is the third-largest country in Africa: it has a landmass the size of Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, and Rwanda put together. But unlike other nations who have since moved on from their civil war days, Sudan is still stuck on hers.\n\nSince 1956 when Sudan first gained independence from the UK, there\u2019ve been only 11 years of peace. The initial attempts to build a parliamentary democracy in Sudan was met by coups in 1958 and 1969. However, in 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement enforced a peace agreement between the government and separatist southern rebels.\n\nIn 1983, another civil war broke out when the military regime tried to impose Sharia law as part of its overall policy to \u201cIslamicise\u201d all of Sudan. The policy was pushed back by a rebel force called Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army from the south.\n\nThis event marked the end of the 11 years of nationwide peace but didn\u2019t mark the beginning of the conflict-laden nation that we know today. What turned Sudan to a bonafide hotspot, therefore, was the 1989 coup led by Omar al-Bashir, a politically and religiously extreme military leader.\n\nThe then ruling government and the southern opposition were reaching a compromise, but al-Bashir overthrew the government and declared himself chief of staff, prime minister, and chief of the armed forces\u2014positions he occupied for 30 years until 2019 when he was forced to resign.\n\nThe al-Bashir administration, in 1990\u201391, supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This made Bill Clinton to blacklist and isolate the country, and christen it a rogue state. Clinton also prohibited US investment in the country and reportedly sponsored neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions.\n\nA little over 2 years since al-Bashir vacated the seat, the country is still in a mess. Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister installed to take the country back to democracy, resigned last week. The resignation that came amid further political deadlock and widespread pro-democracy protests has derailed the country\u2019s fragile transition into democratic rule.\n\nFor 50 years, the political landscape in Sudan has been everything but stable and peaceful.\n\nThis seems like a lot but no Sudanese story will be complete without the mention of years of horrific governments that performed a tribal cleansing on its people, starved and killed children, raped women, and rendered its citizens homeless in their country.\n\nSaeed returned to Sudan in 2014, the same year the international criminal court suspended its case with al-Bashir\u2014after two unsuccessful arrest warrants\u2014because of lack of support from the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSo, when Saeed says that \u201cif anybody built a thriving business in the midst of this persistent chaos that is Sudan, it is the alsoug team,\u201d she is right because it has been done and all the facts are there.\n\nThe vision that drives alsoug is bigger than any bottleneck. Apparently, the same passion that drives the CEO is what drives her employees\u2014building a company that makes life easy for every Sudanese and ushers the country into a prosperous era.\n\nalsoug has positioned itself as the answer to Sudanese intra-country commerce. It has provided a platform to sell and buy; an infrastructure that powers payment; and a logistics arm that fulfils last-mile delivery\u2014the three arms of commerce.\n\nSaeed is giving entrepreneurs in the country\u2019s nascent tech ecosystem and some government officials a fresh set of beliefs in building reputable businesses in the country. However, this is just the beginning because Saeed doesn\u2019t want alsoug to just be a champion in Sudan but also become a household name in Africa, like M-Pesa in Kenya, Flutterwave in Nigeria, Wave in Senegal, and even their major backer, Fawry in Egypt.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "ThankUCash targets the BNPL opportunity in Africa after raising $5.3m seed",
          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 9, 2021, Technext held the maiden edition of Technext Coinference, a cryptocurrency and blockchain event, in Lagos, Nigeria. Barely a month later, some of the discussions at the event are becoming very key crypto and blockchain innovations to look out for in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event kicked off with a keynote by the Nigerian Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.\n\nEven though the Nigerian government has not been particularly fond of cryptocurrencies, Agba made some interesting comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. He mentioned use cases for blockchain that could turn the tides in some sectors of the country.\n\nStoring land as NFTs\n\nThe Minister said blockchain technology \u201copens up numerous possibilities for optimisation in our current systems across industries. And could be the biggest disruptor in finance and governance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting how blockchain could be harnessed to store real estate information, he said, \u201cin real estate and trade, we can harness blockchain to create and store all lands in their base units of a plot as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\u201d\n\nThis could go a long way in tracking the historical ownership of land on the blockchain. People can own lands and list them for sale the same way they own art on OpenSea, Rarible, and other NFT marketplaces.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nA piece of land has to be tokenised, just like artworks, collectables, and music. Information about the land will be included, and it will be uploaded (minted) on a blockchain.\n\nAccording to Finextra, tokenising real estate could also mean that several people can own a property together, giving more people without the financial wherewithal the opportunity to invest in real estate.\n\nOwning real estate outside the country would also be possible. Buying a house in another country could be as easy as shopping online. Once a property is listed on a marketplace with all the necessary information stored on a blockchain, ownership details go to the buyer. And with the help of smart contracts, third parties would not be needed.\n\nWhile these sound very interesting, Agba believes regulation still has to be put in place.\n\n\u201cTo have a fruitful conversation about the regulation of any industry, it is first important to have an understanding of the structure of governance overseeing the industry .\u201d\n\nThis, however, remains a challenge. The Minister said there is the question of who has the power to regulate cryptocurrency, a decision that can only be reached based on how cryptocurrency is classified \u2014 as a security, currency, or an asset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto and naira will work together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R Uzoma Dozie, Sparkle CEO and Buchi Okoro, Quidax CEO. Source: Technext\n\nFor a while, there has been a narrative that cryptocurrencies will replace fiat currencies such as the naira and the dollar. However, Buchi Okoro, CEO of crypto exchange, Quidax, doesn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really had the thought that Bitcoin would replace the naira. I believe that it is supposed to be a collaborative system where crypto works with local currencies to make life better for everybody,\u201d Okoro said.\n\nHe believes fiat currencies will continue to be relevant to finance the same way digital communication will not replace physical communication; they will work together to enhance each other.\n\nOne area crypto will enhance fiat currencies is cross border transactions. This use case has been one of the earliest for cryptocurrencies. A trader in Nigeria, for instance, can swiftly pay his Chinese counterpart with crypto.\n\nOne of the conventional methods of cross border transfers is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Transactions on it take up to four days to be completed. Sending via crypto takes a significantly less amount of time with lower fees.\n\nSocial media is going to the metaverse\n\nThe metaverse, NFT, and Web3 were some of the biggest buzzwords of 2021 in the crypto sphere. When social media giant, Facebook, changed its name to Meta, the metaverse got even more attention, and according to Forbes, it is a trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.\n\nDuring a panel session at the Coinference, Okoro said, \u201ca lot of engagements that will happen in the future will happen in the metaverse. The things we do on Twitter and Instagram will be done in the metaverse.\u201d\n\nHe added that it will change the way we interact and how we live day-to-day life. Life as we know it could move to a virtual world. Digital platforms already play a vital role in many aspects of human life.\n\nAlthough Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, did not say Meta\u2019s social media platforms will be turned into a metaverse, he did say, \u201cFrom now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.\u201d\n\nLike most innovations, the metaverse is still at the very early stages, and only a few people have experienced it. But with the commercial perks cited by Forbes, more investments could go into the metaverse, and we could subsequently see it go mainstream.\n\nSolana is the blockchain to watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, Patricia CEO. Source: Technext\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, CEO of alternative payments solution company, Patricia, has indicated an interest in the Solana blockchain, which has been touted as the Ethereum killer.\n\nDuring his keynote address titled, Blockchain for Africa: The endless possibilities, Abodje pointed out how blockchain could disrupt African systems making them secure and more effective.\n\nWhen asked about the interesting platforms on which to build blockchain solutions, Abodje unequivocally pointed out Solana, saying it\u2019s one blockchain that should be paid a lot of attention.\n\nSolana is a decentralised blockchain platform founded in 2017. The chain has been praised for its fast transaction speed of over 2000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin that are only capable of about 15 transactions per second.\n\nDespite the rapid transaction speed, the fees are very low, with an average cost per transaction of $000.25.\n\nFast transactions and low fees aren\u2019t the only things that make Solana a blockchain to watch. It brings ease and simplicity to using crypto platforms, reducing the financial barrier of participating in activities such as NFTs and decentralised finance (DeFI).\n\nAfrican NFT project, Afrobubble, was created on the Solana blockchain because of the ease the chain brings to buying and selling NFTs.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, worldwide adoption jumped over 880%, with Nigeria and Kenya among the top ten countries with the highest adoption rate. If this trend continues, we could see some of these projections come true in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

This is because Twitter, the microblogging platform, has agreed to some conditions that must be met before the end of March 2022.\n\nSome of the conditions are:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter must register as a company in Nigeria\n\nIt must appoint a country representative to serve as a liaison between the company and the federal government\n\nIt must enrol Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals\n\nIt must comply with Nigerian tax obligations on its operations.\n\nHave we seen this before? Yes. In India, under the guise of promoting free speech and privacy, Twitter restored the accounts of some journalists and media organisations that the government had ordered suspended in 2021. This, among other things, caused Twitter to clash with the Indian government.\n\nLater that year, however, Twitter agreed to all government conditions imposed due to a lawsuit.\n\nBut now, in Nigeria, why would Twitter agree to some of the conditions imposed by the federal government? I\u2019m quite worried. Do you believe they stood to lose if they didn\u2019t compromise? Isn\u2019t this agreement cause for alarm?\n\nI think now is the right time to go over this again: #TwitterBan update: Should you worry if Twitter succumbs to Nigerian government\u2019s demands?\n\nMost importantly, what does this mean for Nigerians and the federal government in the future?\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole answered my questions and probably some of yours in this article: #Twitterban update: A precedent for future shutdowns?\n\nLipa Later\u2019s $12 million pre-Series A\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nKenyan Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) startup, Lipa Later, has raised $12 million in pre-Series A to expand into Nigeria, Ghana, and Tanzania.\n\nThe round saw participation from Cauris Finance, Lateral Frontiers VC, GreenHouse Capital, SOSV IV LLC, Sayani Investments, and Axian Financial Services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 2018 by Eric Muli and Michael Maina, the company allows retailers to sell goods and services to consumers in affordable monthly instalments.\n\nMoreso, the company\u2019s product offering allows for both online and offline integration with retailers and both online and offline sales platforms, including mobile wallets for consumers.\n\nThe company, which already exists in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda, claims it has built a reputation for delivering value for its investors right from its early days. Also, it has exclusive partnerships with retailers across their current markets, allowing shoppers to pay for products in instalments.\n\nFintech Farm\u2019s $7.4 million seed round\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Techcrunch\n\nA UK-based fintech startup, Fintech Farm, that creates digital banks in emerging markets, has raised $7.4 million in seed funding to launch neobanks in 8 countries over the next 24 months.\n\nWhile Flyer One Ventures and Solid led the seed round, TA Ventures, Jiji, u.ventures and AVentures Capital participated.\n\nFounded by Dmytro Dubilet, Nick Bezkrovnyy, and Alexander Vityaz, Fintech Farm takes a different approach to the traditional model used by the country\u2019s neobanks, which prefer to hold their banking license and offer the full range of financial services themselves.\n\nInterestingly, Fintech Farm\u2019s main product is a card that functions as a debit card and a credit card with a loan facility attached in the customer\u2019s name. The app\u2019s features include a savings account, deposits, and transfers.\n\nWhy should you care? The company plans to enter eight emerging markets in Africa and Asia, the first of which will be Nigeria, before the end of March 2022.\n\n\u201cOur next market is going to be Nigeria, we have visited Nigeria a couple of times already, and it is one of our favourite countries,\u201d said Dubilet, adding that the launch will likely take place in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhile entering Nigeria may increase competition among the country\u2019s neobanks, the company\u2019s plan to use credit cards to provide cheaper and more accessible credit appears shaky.\n\nWith the West African country lacking a sophisticated credit bureau system to detail people\u2019s credit histories, it is unclear how Fintech Farm will operate using credit cards.\n\nBut Dubilet is optimistic, citing the company\u2019s data science teams, which he describes as \u201cone of the best in the world,\u201d to perform some magic.\n\nWhat /I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nCrazily high valuations, investor FOMO, the ripple effects of Y Combinator\u2019s new deal.

From the details of the agreement, the microblogging platform has agreed to some conditions which must be fulfilled before Q1 2022 ends.\n\nTwitter has shown a willingness to register as a company in Nigeria, appoint a country representative to act as a liaison between the company and the Federal Government. In addition to enrolling Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals, the company has also agreed to applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law.\n\nUsers\u2019 reactions\n\nSince the announcement\u2026\n\nWe are pleased that Twitter has been restored for everyone in Nigeria.

Going by recent cases, it is commonplace to find these organisations severely sanctioned for violating rules with grey areas.\n\nLocal telecommunications companies are unlikely to push back when orders clearly violating citizens\u2019 fundamental right of access to information are given. Ordinarily, this does not apply to social media sites because they are not under their jurisdiction.\n\nEven though it seems the company might be giving the government too much discretionary power, it chose to negotiate rather than go the litigation route, as was the case in India.\n\nA flawed precedent?\n\nIf any other country has given Twitter a hard time, it\u2019s India. The repression started early in 2021 when, on the premise of promoting free speech and privacy, Twitter restored the accounts of some journalists and media organisations that the government gave the order to deactivate or suspend. Asides from that, the company failed to comply with the country\u2019s IT rules. In the months that followed, Twitter ran into more problems with the government, leading to the police visiting the company\u2019s office in India to serve a notice.\n\nBy July, Twitter agreed to comply with all government conditions following a legal suit fully. The court directed Twitter to issue a statement saying it intends to abide by the rules.\n\nIndia made a scapegoat of Twitter, which became an example for other Big Tech companies. As the government argued, Twitter has lost legal immunity for users\u2019 posts in India. Could this be the Nigerian government\u2019s plan?\n\nIf anything, strong-arming is common with governments that have shown authoritarian traits in the past and global company compliance might only fuel it.\n\nFar from over: Possible tales of \u2018once again\u2019\n\nWhile China is considered the region with the strictest Internet shutdowns, Africa is often regarded as the most volatile environment for social media. Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s history of Internet shutdowns dates back to 2007 with Guinea, and it was only a matter of time before other countries followed suit, with Nigeria joining the trend in 2020.\n\nCurrently, 32 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries have restricted access to the Internet for similar reasons ranging from protests to strikes. Elections, national security, and examinations also present opportunities for restrictions. Specifically, shutdowns have proven to be one of the government\u2019s tools to control information and communication.\n\nIt thus appears that a successful Internet shutdown in a country might result in many more. Ethiopia, for instance, has had 12 Internet shutdowns, and as of 2020, Chad had accumulated almost two and a half years of Internet disruptions within five years.\n\nWhile circumventing social media censorship with VPNs appears to be the easiest way out, the issue of privacy and free speech are still cause for worry. Only time will tell if there will be more cases.\n\nhttps://techpoint.africa/2021/02/26/sub-; there-africa-internet-shutdown-loses/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has applauded the current National Assembly and particularly the leadership style of it\u2019s chairman, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari\u2019s message was delivered by his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari at a birthday get-together hosted Wednesday night by the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu in honour of Lawan who clocked 63 on Wednesday.\n\nKalu and Lawan have been close friends since their school days at the University of Maiduguri in the early 80s.\n\nProfessor Gambari said the President sent him to deliver a congratulatory message and express his admiration about Lawan\u2019s personal achievements.\n\n\u201cThe third dimension of Mr President\u2019s message is to commend the celebrant for the very able manner in which he has steered the affairs of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cSome people assumed that the role of the Legislative arm of government is to oppose government. That is not the President\u2019s understanding.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly is an arm of government just as the Executive is. Just as the Judiciary is. That means the three arms of government are to work in a complimentary manner.\n\n\u201cTherefore Mr President view the kind of flare, the commitment, the passion, the constructive engagement with the Executive under his leadership, the cooperation with the Executive as a sign, not of weakness but strength.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to be critical. It is easy to be negative but it is a lot more difficult and more challenging to have a constructive engagement and cooperation with the Executive. But the beneficiary of such constructive engagement and cooperation is the nation.\n\n\u201cOne of the achievements is that we now have a budget that runs from January to December and Mr President has just signed the finance bill and budget for 2022.\n\n\u201cSo the President really commends the way in which he handles the affairs of the National Assembly and looks forward to many more periods of cooperation with your leadership,\u201d Professor Gambari said.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, the Senate President passionately appealed to politicians irrespective of their political affiliations to work towards building consensus on critical national issues.\n\n\u201cPoliticians across board must learn to arrive and achieve and sustain consensus on issues. Our country first. You can\u2019t be President, you can\u2019t be Senator, you can\u2019t be member of House of Representatives, you can\u2019t be Governor, you can\u2019t be anything unless there is a country.\n\n\u201cSo we must build and sustain a consensus on certain fundamental issues about our country, irreduceable minimum below which nobody should go.\n\n\u201cWhether you are PDP or APC or APGA or whatever you are, because that will infringe on the very fabric of our country. So it is very important that we achieve that. Democratic countries elsewhere that are successful have largely achieved those kind of consensus.\n\n\u201cWhether you are Party A or Party B, if you are voted into office, there are certain things you cannot afford to do. Political capital can be made from anything but certainly not those kind of issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the opportunity today to appeal to all of us, politicians across the country, across board, to work for our country to achieve consensus on certain fundamental issues.\n\n\u201cOur people look up to us. They do what we give them education to do. Sometime they go beyond what we think they will do. At times, it becomes much more costly to deal with the consequences or repercussions. I advise that we should build consensus.\n\n\u201cIn the Senate, we have been able to achieve some kind of formidable unity and consensus on what we must do for our country. We believe that this country can only be better if political leaders decide to do the right thing.\n\n\u201cRegardless of our political affiliations, in the ninth Senate, we have always approached issues mainly in national interest,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Idowu Olakunle\n\nNigeria\u2019s president, Muhammad Buhari on Thursday, visited Ogun State where he commissioned some monumental projects constructed by the governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun.\n\nThe president on his arrival in the State first commissioned the Ijebu-Ode-Epe Road and other four projects located in different parts of the State.\n\nThe president was received by Prince Abiodun, and five other governors, including Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State; Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi; Osun State governor, Alhaj Gboyega Oyetola; Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, as well as a representative of Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, Engr Rauf Olaniyan.\n\nAlso on ground was Alh Aliko Dangote and former Governor of the State Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, Chief Segun Osoba, among others.\n\nAddressing residents of the state, the president heaped praises on Governor Dapo Abiodun, for delivering visionary and trail-blazing projects for the people, even in the midst of prevailing and challenging circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDescribing Abiodun as the \u2018\u2018performing Governor of Nigeria\u2019s Gateway State,\u2019\u2019 the President said he is a worthy example of \u2018\u2018promises made, promises kept.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President noted that the lofty projects: the Gateway City Gate; the 42-Kilometre Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta Road; the 14km Ijebu-Ode-Epe Expressway and two Housing Estates for low, medium and high income earners at Kobape and Oke-Mosan in Abeokuta, respectively, could not have materialised without the state government\u2019s huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property.\n\n\u2018\u2018This has made Ogun State one of the safest and most peaceful states in the country and investors\u2019 destination of choice,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u2018\u2018You (Prince Abiodun) have justified the mandate of the people of Ogun State. You have represented our Party very well.\u201d\n\nThe President expressed delight that the 14km Ijebu Ode-Mojoda-Epe Road commissioned by him has been reconstructed into a modern expressway by the State government.\n\nHe noted that the impressive road would complement the Sagamu-Benin Expressway that the Federal Government is currently reconstructing, which is also due for commissioning this year.\n\n\u2018\u2018Just across the road is the 42-kilometer Sagamu-Interchange-Abeokuta Road which the state Government has reconstructed and equipped with street lights.\n\n\u2018\u2018That road enjoys a direct linkage with the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway that the Federal Government is rebuilding and due for completion later this year.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am particularly impressed by the quality and standard of your road projects, and the creative way you have deployed resources to reconstruct and rehabilitate them.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is significant to note that the two road projects being commissioned today are federal roads. This is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the States and Federal Government.\n\n\u2018\u2018These roads also fit well into our rail transportation masterplan that connects Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital to Kano, with Ogun State having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the housing programme of the Ogun Governor, the President commended its inclusiveness, saying it is equally heart-warming that it cuts across different social strata, capturing the low, medium and high income earners.\n\nAdmiring the Gateway City Gate Project, the Nigerian leader said \u2018\u2018it is not just a Park beautification project. It depicts that something new is happening in Ogun State, a welcoming entrance into the State Capital at the centre point of the State.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that the project is also iconic, depicting the joining of hands for building the future of Ogun State in togetherness.\n\n\u2018\u2018Your Excellency, well done! I am proud of what you have done for your State and your people.\n\n\u2018\u2018You have made our great Party, the APC, proud too. You are a worthy example of promises made, promises kept,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018These lofty projects could not have materialised without your huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property.\u2019\u2019\n\nResponding to requests by the state governor to give priority to the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Otta-Idiroko Roads respectively, the President assured the people of Ogun State that these roads will receive Federal Government attention.\n\nThe President announced that the Federal Government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of these roads, as done for the 100km Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro Road.\n\nSimilarly, the President promised to consider the approval of the reconstruction of Sagamu-Ogijo Road by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited under the tax credit scheme.\n\nThe President thanked the residents of the State for the warm reception accorded him and his entourage in the Gateway State.\n\n\u2018\u2018This welcome by the large crowd brings back the nostalgia of my first arrival on this soil as a young infantry officer in the Nigerian Army at the then Lafenwa Barracks in Abeokuta, not long after independence.\n\n\u2018\u2018The traditional hospitality of the people of this State has not waned a bit. Today, I am \u2018Omowale\u2019 and very happy at this homecoming to meet my brothers and sisters whose goodwill I have always enjoyed. Thank you.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President also congratulated the people of Ogun State for having such a focused, deliberate and inclusive administration under the watch of Prince Abiodun, urging them to continue to support the governor for the successful implementation of the \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda of his Administration.\n\n\u2018\u2018The reward for success is more hardwork to meet the increasing expectations of the people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018When state governments deliver impactful projects, in consultations with stakeholders, like we have witnessed in Ogun State, the trajectory of our national development will be enhanced.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President, who was bestowed with \u2018\u2018honourary indigeneship\u2019\u2019 of the state, said: \u2018\u2018It is also with a sense of responsibility that I receive and cherish the honorary indigeneship bestowed on me as symbolized by the presentation of the key to the Gateway State by Governor Abiodun.\n\n\u2018\u2018I will leave Ogun State with fond memories and look forward to enjoying the privilege of my honourary indigeneship.\u2019\u2019\n\nEarlier, Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun while speaking at the grand reception of the President, thanked him for the visit, saying that all the projects and programmes of his administration in the State are deliberate and guided by the vision to give Ogun State a focused and qualitative governance and create an enabling environment for a Public Private Sector Partnership to thrive.\n\nHe said his administration believe in the socio-economic development of the State and individual prosperity of its people.\n\nSpeaking on the five projects commissioned by the President, Prince Abiodun said \u201cthe choice of the five projects that we are commissioning today from our many landmark projects was a daunting task. These are just a few of our achievements. We have so much more to showcase. These selected few that Your Excellency will commission are however symbolic of the various types of projects across all sectors of our dear State\u2019s economy.\n\nHe said his \u201cAdministration in Ogun State has continued to fulfil all its promises to the people within the available means.\n\n\u2018It is noteworthy that all our projects have the inputs and are informed by the needs of the people as expressed by them at different engagement fora that we provide.\n\n\u201cThis is because we anchor our \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda on inclusiveness, equity, fairness, transparency, accountability, justice, and obedience to the rule of law. Under our FIVE Development Pillars with the acronym I.S.E.Y.A; that is I \u2013 for Infrastructure, S \u2013 for Social Welfare and Wellbeing, E \u2013 for Education, Y \u2013 for Youth Empowerment, A for Agriculture and Food Security, we based our choices on what the people say they want and we get their buy-in for implementation.\n\nWhile going through the importance of the roads, Ogun Governor said \u201cthe five projects is an iconic monument that not only beautifies the environment, but a reflection of the new approach to governance in the State. It symbolizes the convergence, harmony, and unity amongst all the groups and sections of the State. It is not just a physical Intersection of the three Senatorial Districts; it is a symbol of the togetherness of our people and the legendary warmth and hospitality to our visitors and guests.\n\n\u201cThe Ijebu-Ode-Epe Road, a Federal Road which Your Excellency commissioned earlier, is another strategic arterial road that links the Lekki / Epe corridor of Lagos State to the eastern corridor of Ogun State at Ijebu- Ode. With this road, socio-economic activities in the South East and South South zones of our country will receive a boost through the linkage of the road to Sagamu-Benin Expressway for easier access by motorists to Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest economy,\u201d Abiodun said.\n\nHe noted further that, \u201cthe Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta Road is 42km in length and is the main arterial road that leads to our Capital City. It is a dual carriageway with streetlights, median and other road furniture. This road, though a federal road, was redesigned and reconstructed to address the daily challenges being experienced by commuters, and to make commuting between the State Capital and other parts of the State and, indeed, the rest of the country a safe, secure and pleasant experience.\n\n\u201cTwo of our many housing projects, Housing Estate at Kobape in Abeokuta comprises of 526 units of 2 and 3-bedroom bungalows. The King\u2019s Court at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta is a middle/high income Housing Estate and has 31 of its 85 units in the first phase fully completed. The remaining 54 units are at various stages of completion.\u201d",

Six of them turned in for the screening and we screened all of them and we are satisfied with the answers they gave us.\n\n\u201cWe ensured that the process was transparent, we ensured that they were given fair hearing and we ensured that we executed the mandate given to us by the party. We also ensured that we worked with the dictates of our conscience and dictates of fairness.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with newsmen, Dele Adeleke said he was optimistic that he would be cleared by the committee.\n\nAccording to Adeleke, \u201cThe panel is made up of people of integrity. They have done this in the past. If you look, the PDP actually sustained the membership of registering committee.\n\n\u201cIn fact the national convention screening committee has been made standing committee for the party. So, I\u2019m very confident that they would be fair and justice done.\n\n\u201cLike they told us, they are not here to disqualify anybody, but at least just to assess us and whatever is their finding, they will make the recommendation to the NWC.\u201d, Adeleke explained\n\nHon. Omirin Emmanuel Oluseye, also an aspirant said he has absolute confidence in the screening committee with the caliber of the people and the conduct of the exercise, saying, \u201cthey really meant well for the party and for the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that they will do what is just and fair because they have told us that they were not here to witchhunt anybody, but to protect the image of the party,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, another aspirant, Alhaji Abdulateef Akinbade, expressed optimism that he would not be disqualified following the way the screening committee conducted the exercise.",

          "title": "Dele Momodu, PDP aspirant endorses Bola Tinubu",
          "text": "Ovation magazine publisher Dele Momodu has endorsed the presidential aspiration of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nIn an October 26, 2019 article, Momodu, who has also declared interest in the presidency, said Tinubu is eminently qualified to contest for the No.1 seat in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat gives Tinubu pre-eminence over most of the others who are contending for the crown but presently hiding behind one finger is his glittering records and achievements in both the private and public sectors\u201d, Momodu wrote in his Pendulum Column in ThisDay.\n\n\u201cI really do not care about his past because as a Christian, none of us can judge anyone, and I have ample examples of the possible transformation and transfiguration of human beings, as the Lord pleases. That is a long time ago and gone with the winds. He has done more than enough to remove that from his narrative\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is Tinubu\u2019s achievements as a two-term Governor of Lagos State that has projected him to the prominent and exalted position that he now occupies in the Nigerian political sphere\u201d, Momodu added.\n\nNow read him in full:\n\nFellow Nigerians permit me to say, it is no longer a secret that the former Governor of Lagos State and easily one of the most influential politicians in Africa, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has his gaze firmly fixed on the Nigerian Presidential seat in Abuja. Let me put it more frontally, Tinubu will love to drop the Chieftaincy title, Asiwaju, for that of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Who wouldn\u2019t, anyway? I once tried my luck despite not having ten percent of Tinubu\u2019s stupendous resources, extensive networks, public service experience and achievements and so on. I know that some will think it is too early to be talking about a successor to President Muhammadu Buhari given that his second term is barely six months old. Nevertheless, the political gladiators are already baring their fangs and showing their hands and flapping their wings. It would be silly of anyone to shut their eyes to such developments. The debate is already raging, as always. We love to talk. Don\u2019t we? That\u2019s our pastime, sadly or joyously. The naysayers are having a field day with a plethora of reasons and questions on why he cannot succeed. What does Tinubu want again? He can\u2019t win! He is not fit enough! He is too tainted and tarnished! The Hausa-Fulani will never give him power. How can he think he can attain what Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Chief Moshood Abiola failed to get? Why can\u2019t he field one of the people he empowered in the past? Too many questions begging for answers. I often wonder what exactly the matter is with us we practically groan and grumble over anything and everything. Someone once wrote that we all have the Abacha traits in us. We are all autocratic and oppressive in nature, the reason Democracy is not working here and may never work in most parts of Africa. We are just too intolerant and too dismissive. But for me and my house, I\u2019m a consummate Democrat. I believe everyone has the right to aspire to any height in life, especially in politics. Political leadership is not the personal property of any person, dynasty or group! If you ask me, I will tell you, unequivocally, and repeatedly, that Tinubu is eminently qualified to contest. If you ask me if he is a saint, I will say no. None of us is. Not even Buhari. Not you, not me. Nations are not governed by saints but by performers. That is one of the recurring theses that I regularly propagate in my musings and reflections. I have no illusions that Tinubu will definitely perform as President of Nigeria, if he ever contests and wins. He has a knack for identifying brilliant minds and fertile brains, and the ability to nurture them to greatness. He has demonstrated this repeatedly and almost endlessly. Examples abound without doubt. Does Tinubu suffer from excesses and shortcomings? Perhaps, again like all mortals, he does. This does not diminish his greatness. His excesses are mitigated by several strong and positive qualities. He is generous to a fault. He has lifted many souls, old and young, from penury and perdition. He is a classic example of the Good Samaritan. We all have our shortcomings and why should Tinubu be an exception. Too many unprintable rumours, myths and comments have been circulated in writing and also spoken about him, some bordering on character assassination and unverifiable vilification, but God chooses and anoints those he wants. And no one can challenge God. It is obvious that Tinubu has been richly blessed, despite his apparent foibles. Such is life. I have followed his trajectory for close to three decades. His story is a stuff of fairy tales. All those who have disparaged, derided, denigrated and despised him have not been able to bring him down, despite their monumental efforts to achieve this. When you think he is supine, broken and out, he rises, like the Black onyx and soars again. I witnessed this, live and direct, during our exile days. Many times, we all felt down and out but Tinubu\u2019s passion and influence re-engineered things and made us redouble our efforts. The reason is simple. Tinubu has an uncommon audacity. I believe his bravery has taken him beyond his own imagination. A man who has survived too many tribulations like him cannot be an ordinary soul. God must love him dearly and extraordinarily. He has fought many battles that he won, spectacularly. He is naturally smart and adequately fearless. A mutual friend once told a few of us that he is very sure Tinubu would still take the risk even if you say a particular venture will kill him. He has such kamikaze instincts. You can\u2019t go far in life, if you\u2019re too squeamish and Tinubu is a living proof that courage conquers all. It is wrong to say Tinubu has no right to run for the Presidency in 2023. Who are those who will run if he does not? How are they better? What qualifies them to run that disqualifies him from running? Yes, I may prefer younger people to take over but many of them we have seen have not justified the noise about \u201cnot too young to rule,\u201d by ruling senselessly and recklessly. I\u2019m now convinced that age should not be a deliberate barrier; track record of achievements should be the priority. I welcome all those who want to run and believe that they should be allowed to run without hindrance. It is wrong to muzzle the opposition, or even an opponent, because any nationalist and patriot will want the best for Nigeria and so long as the people express their preference for that person, he should be given the opportunity. Nigeria has suffered and continues to suffer because Murtala Mohammed, Chief M. K. O. Abiola and, to a lesser extent, Chief Obafemi Awolowo were not allowed to rule Nigeria by the selfish manipulations and evil machinations of incurably selfish and obviously misguided elements. Related News 2023 Aso Rock Race Will Be a Shot in the Dark\n\nJUST IN: How Buhari reacted to Tinubu's bid for 2023 presidency\n\nI am not Tinubu\u2019s driver, says senatorial aspirant Oyebade Let\u2019s now take on the issues I earlier mentioned, one by one. Those who are petrified, or just being cheeky, that the Hausa/Fulani will never hand over power to the South and, by extension, to Tinubu, and others, really baffle me. Self-doubt is one of the biggest afflictions of the Southerners. Too many people suffer from inferiority complex. They have resigned themselves to slavery and servitude, voluntarily, in their own country. This is one of the reasons the Tinubu experiment and controversy is \u2018sweeting\u2019 me. If Tinubu cannot be supported by the North, despite all he did for Muhammadu Buhari to become President, after chasing the shadows for three record times, then there is no hope for Nigeria. In any event, I must stress that it is an insult to other parts of Northern Nigeria to suggest that there is a monolithic and homogenous North. We all know that is far from the truth. There are diverse and disparate tribes in the Middle belt. Even within the core north there are several minority tribes who do not share the same aspirations as their more visible and vociferous neighbours. We must discourage the notion of master-servant relationship in this country. We must promote unity and uphold the rights of every Nigerian citizen. Personally, I don\u2019t care where the next President comes from, North, East, South or West. All aspirants are welcome. The more, the merrier. That is why I\u2019m not for zoning, in any form. I want aspirants to contest on their disastrous or meritorious records. Let the electorates be the judges. But to say someone is automatically disqualified on account of ethnicity, or even religion, is so unfortunate and so not right and definitely unacceptable, at this time and age. It is one of the reasons that we have been robbed of stellar leaders in the past and the present. Are we not tired of this intractable backwardness? On Awolowo and Abiola, it was the same myopia that made some powerful forces to gang up against them. What did the enemies of progress then gain after all? Let\u2019s concede that Awolowo did not win, what of Abiola who was robbed in broad daylight and even paid the supreme price! Who knows if Tinubu will finally cross the bridge and finish the final lap of this marathon? No one knows God\u2019s plans. Goodluck Jonathan never dreamt of being Deputy Governor, talk less of becoming President of Africa\u2019s most populous country. Yemi Osinbajo had resigned himself to Law and Pastoral work but suddenly and unexpectedly became Vice President, almost effortlessly. He was probably home, arms akimbo, when he was called and anointed from the blues. Also, his helicopter crashed one terrible afternoon on his way to some political rallies in Kogi State, yet none of the passengers died. Many have died in less chaotically dangerous circumstances, and not a scratch on these children of God. Was that not a powerful sign and testimony that these are not mere mortals to be rubbished or traduced. Some contend that Tinubu should not contest but instead allow one of his proteges to run instead. However, it is my belief that such a decision is solely his. It must always be remembered that he had the chance to be Vice-President and could have put his foot down to make the coalition work. On that occasion, for the good of his Party and the Nation, he gave up his dream and ambition and put forward another spectacular candidate, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, who has not let his mentor down and has shown admirable comportment and grace. I believe there must therefore be some cogent reasons why he feels the time has come to be the king rather than a Kingmaker in perpetuity. There is nothing wrong in him making such an informed decision. He should be allowed to exercise his franchise and bet on himself again. Tinubu is an enigmatic calculator who knows how to permutate the game and stun his opponents. Like Buhari, I want to assume that Tinubu had planned this journey for a very long time. All the steps he has taken since 1999 obviously point to this fact. The kind of political and social machinery that he has built is probably only matched and surpassed by those of great leaders that nurtured and forged our Independence, like the Owelle of Onitsha, Chief Nnamdi Azikiwe, the Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello, the Odole of Ife, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, and the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Moshood Abiola. The rest is in the hands of God. For me, Tinubu\u2019s ambition is not an impossible mission. He is a master strategist who has acquired the templates of others like Major General Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua, Chief Moshood Abiola, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, plus being one of those who ran Buhari\u2019s campaigns, substantially. He knows the Nigerian terrain very well and even his enemies respect him tremendously. For me, what gives Tinubu pre-eminence over most of the others who are contending for the crown but presently hiding behind one finger is his glittering records and achievements in both the private and public sectors. I really do not care about his past because as a Christian, none of us can judge anyone, and I have ample examples of the possible transformation and transfiguration of human beings, as the Lord pleases. That is a long time ago and gone with the winds. He has done more than enough to remove that from his narrative. Whatever his background was, he cannot be robbed of his victory and glory perpetually. Yes, it is clear that he came from very humble beginnings of deprivation and chronic need but he sought to improve himself by seeking the golden fleece. He succeeded in his quest attaining a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting. His success in this regard can be measured by the fact that he was head hunted by top accounting firms like Arthur Andersen and Deloitte, Haskins and Sells. He eventually joined Mobil in Nigeria where he excelled spectacularly and rose to become a top executive in the company. His should thus be a veritable inspiration to majority of those in similar circumstances today, that anyone can rise up from the pit of hell to any heights, by dint of hard work and uncommon sagacity and determination. His political career started in 1992. He was elected to the highest legislative house in the Nigerian Senate. When that ill-fated experiment by General Ibrahim Babangida went the way, it was programmed to go, Tinubu fled Nigeria and regrouped with like minded patriotic Nigerians to form the external wing of the pro-democracy National Democratic Coalition (NADECO). After the death of General Sani Abacha, Tinubu returned home to contest as Governor of Lagos State and won a convincing victory. It is Tinubu\u2019s achievements as a two-term Governor of Lagos State that has projected him to the prominent and exalted position that he now occupies in the Nigerian political sphere. He began the systematic and robust increase of the internally generated revenue of Lagos State which his successors have had no choice but to emulate, and sustain incrementally thus making Lagos State one of the richest self-sustaining \u2018governments\u2019 in Africa. His indomitable and indefatigable spirit led him to challenge the Federal Government headlong and succeeded in standing tall as he fought President Olusegun Obasanjo to a standstill. Despite not having access to funding for his local governments, Tinubu single-handedly revived and revamped Local Governments in Lagos State and brought tremendous developments to practically every part of Lagos State. His other great political prowess is in identifying quality and talented leaders from hitherto political obscurity and foisting them on the people to great effect. I strongly believe that Tinubu should be given a chance on the merit when, and if, he eventually proclaims his candidacy. Others will eventually come forth and should also be considered on their merits. As they do, we will have cause to revisit their suitability. Our country can only gain from such robustly healthy competition. We have a preponderance of brilliant men and women who can take Nigeria to the zenith of greatness but they are usually wasted on the altar of greed and selfishness. What is clear to me is that it is only a matter of time before events begin to unfold. In the meantime, I can only wish Tinubu all the best in his appointment with destiny.\n\n*First published in ThisDay on 26 October, 2019.\n\n*Momodu is also in the run for presidency.",

We are optimistic that the court outings of Onyendu would be impressive. Onyendu himself is in high spirit.\n\n\u201cOur discussions with him further reassured him and strengthened his determination to persevere unrelentingly. I declare to you, Umuchineke, that Onyendu is fully prepared to appear in court as from January 18 2022. He is rooting for victory and knows that, with the help of Chukwuokike Abiama, victory is assured.\n\n\u201cYou will all behold with your eyes an interesting dimension in the harmonised workable formula we have evolved. The detractors of Onyendu will be comprehensively humbled and permanently put to shame.\n\nFurther, Onyendu utilized the opportunity afforded by our visit to mandate us to admonish his teeming supporters and followers.\n\n\u201cHe advises those of them that would appear in court in demonstration of their unflinching support and loyalty to him to conduct themselves with decorum, be civil in their conduct and comportment, shun violence and deviant behaviour in any manner or form, and exercise restraint in speech.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we have caused formal correspondences to issue on responsible, sovereign, democratic governments and other international institutions to prevail on the Nigerian government to caution uncouth and overzealous security agents.\n\n\u201cWe can authoritatively declare to you, Umuchineke, that those correspondences are receiving the requisite attention they deserve. We are optimistic that there would be a positive transformation in the conduct and general approach of the said overzealous security agents at the next appearance of Onyendu in Court.\n\n\u201cWe make bold to state for the umpteenth time that Onyendu has not committed any offence known to law. For this reason, he must be released unconditionally.\n\n\u201cWe specially appeal to you, Umuchineke, to demonstrate profound understanding and fortitude in these trying times. You must remain focused, dogged, and resilient. On no account must your untiring spirit be shaken and your resolve diluted.\n\n\u201cYou must keep the peace at all times and comport yourselves with decorum. In no too distant time, you will surely savour the sweetness of victory. Celebration and jollity will resound in your respective dwellings and sorrow and sighing shall take a permanent and unremitting flight to the abyss.\n\n\u201cOnyendu expresses his profound gratitude and appreciation to millions of his followers and supporters scattered throughout the face of the earth. He declares to them never to lose hope but to hold steadfastly to that one thing that is dear to them. He promises them that with the help of Chukwuokike Abiama the present distraction would soon pass and that victory and celebration would be their lot.\u201d\n\nAlthough there has been no official statement about where and how Kanu was apprehended by INTERPOL in Kenya on June 27, 2021, his relatives and lawyers have described how he was taken into custody in Kenya under dubious circumstances and extradited to Nigeria, where he is currently facing terrorism charges before Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Baptist Convention has stated that it spent N250 million to obtain the return of students kidnapped by terrorists in 2021 from Bethel Baptist College in Kaduna.\n\nAccording to Tribune, the President of the Nigeria Baptist Convention, Rev Dr Israel Akanji, made the announcement in Gombe on Friday at the First Baptist Church in Gombe at the 2022 International General Workers Conference for the North-East.\n\nGunmen raided the school operated by the church in Damishi, Kaduna, in the early hours of Monday, July 5, 2021, abducting 121 children.\n\nIn light of the number of Nigerians who have died as a result of various acts of banditry and insurgency, Akanji also rated President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration\u2019s fight against insecurity as subpar.\n\nHe said, \u201cInitially we didn\u2019t want to spend money, we didn\u2019t believe in spending any money, that was how we began. I even said this openly that we will not spend money but I am also saying it openly now that we have had to spend money, we were forced to spend money.\n\n\u201cWhen our children spent one month and did not come and these bandits were telling us that they will start killing our children one by one, then we had to weigh between our money being in our pockets and our children dying or our children been released to us and we losing our money so, preferred to lose the money since the government will not help us we had to resort to self-help, that was what happened and we had to spend so much money.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in our minds, there is no one that convinces many of us that this administration has done enough on security. We are not saying that they have done nothing, they have been saying that they are doing their best but we are saying that their best is below the belt, far below our expectations.\n\n\u201cWhoever is going to be the next president of Nigeria must be ready to confront the insecurity in our land. For as long as some people are free to be carrying guns and be killing people while others are arrested for carrying the same thing, then there is a problem of injustice in the land.\n\n\u201cArrest is discriminatory, you can see clearly in Nigeria, you don\u2019t need to be told that someone like me will still be hiding and not saying the truth, it is a shame on the entire nation. At this level, we must say the truth to ourselves, the insecurity of this nation has been propelled by the high level of impunity.\u201d",

          "title": "Supreme Court Halts Covid Vaccine Mandate for US Businesses",
          "text": "The US Supreme Court has stopped a major push by the Biden administration to boost the nation\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination rate, a requirement that employees at large businesses get a vaccine or test regularly and wear a mask on the job.\n\nAt the same time, the court is allowing the administration to proceed with a vaccine mandate for most health care workers in the U.S. The court\u2019s orders Thursday came during a spike in coronavirus cases caused by the omicron variant.\n\nThe court\u2019s conservative majority concluded the administration overstepped its authority by seeking to impose the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\u2019s vaccine-or-test rule on U.S. businesses with at least 100 employees. More than 80 million people would have been affected and OSHA had estimated that the rule would save 6,500 lives and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations over six months.\n\n\u201cOSHA has never before imposed such a mandate. Nor has Congress. Indeed, although Congress has enacted significant legislation addressing the COVID\u201319 pandemic, it has declined to enact any measure similar to what OSHA has promulgated here,\u201d the conservatives wrote in an unsigned opinion.\n\nIn dissent, the court\u2019s three liberals argued that it was the court that was overreaching by substituting its judgment for that of health experts. \u201cActing outside of its competence and without legal basis, the Court displaces the judgments of the Government officials given the responsibility to respond to workplace health emergencies,\u201d Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a joint dissent.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he was \u201cdisappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block common-sense life-saving requirements for employees at large businesses that were grounded squarely in both science and the law.\u201d\n\nBiden called on businesses to institute their own vaccination requirements, noting that a third of Fortune 100 companies already have done so.\n\nWhen crafting the OSHA rule, White House officials always anticipated legal challenges \u2014 and privately some harbored doubts that it could withstand them. The administration nonetheless still views the rule as a success at already driving millions of people to get vaccinated and encouraging private businesses to implement their own requirements that are unaffected by the legal challenge.\n\nThe OSHA regulation had initially been blocked by a federal appeals court in New Orleans, then allowed to take effect by a federal appellate panel in Cincinnati.\n\nBoth rules had been challenged by Republican-led states. In addition, business groups attacked the OSHA emergency regulation as too expensive and likely to cause workers to leave their jobs at a time when finding new employees already is difficult.\n\nThe National Retail Federation, the nation\u2019s largest retail trade group, called the Supreme Court\u2019s decision \u201ca significant victory for employers.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine mandate that the court will allow to be enforced nationwide scraped by on a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joining the liberals to form a majority. The mandate covers virtually all health care workers in the country, applying to providers that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid funding. It affects 10.4 million workers at 76,000 health care facilities as well as home health care providers. The rule has medical and religious exemptions.\n\nBiden said that decision by the court \u201cwill save lives.\u201d\n\nIn an unsigned opinion, the court wrote: \u201cThe challenges posed by a global pandemic do not allow a federal agency to exercise power that Congress has not conferred upon it. At the same time, such unprecedented circumstances provide no grounds for limiting the exercise of authorities the agency has long been recognized to have.\u201d It said the \u201clatter principle governs\u201d in the healthcare arena.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote in dissent that the case was about whether the administration has the authority \u201cto force healthcare workers, by coercing their employers, to undergo a medical procedure they do not want and cannot undo.\u201d He said the administration hadn\u2019t shown convincingly that Congress gave it that authority.\n\nJustices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett signed onto Thomas\u2019 opinion. Alito wrote a separate dissent that the other three conservatives also joined.\n\nDecisions by federal appeals courts in New Orleans and St. Louis had blocked the mandate in about half the states. The administration already was taking steps to enforce it elsewhere.\n\nMore than 208 million Americans, 62.7% of the population, are fully vaccinated, and more than a third of those have received booster shots, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All nine justices have gotten booster shots.\n\nThe courthouse remains closed to the public, and lawyers and reporters are asked for negative test results before being allowed inside the courtroom for arguments, though vaccinations are not required.\n\nThe justices heard arguments on the challenges last week. Their questions then hinted at the split verdict that they issued Thursday.\n\nA separate vaccine mandate for federal contractors, on hold after lower courts blocked it, has not been considered by the Supreme Court.",

          "text": "Downing Street staff held two parties the night before Prince Philip\u2019s funeral \u2013 at a time when Covid restrictions banned indoor mixing.\n\nThe events, first reported by The Telegraph, took place on 16 April 2021 and went on until the early hours.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson was not at either party \u2013 but it raises further questions about a culture of rule-breaking at Downing Street.\n\nThe PM is facing calls to resign from the opposition and some senior Tories.\n\nHe has urged MPs to wait for the outcome of an investigation into lockdown parties at No 10 by senior civil servant Sue Gray, which is expected as early as next week.\n\nOne of the events on 16 April was a leaving party for the PM\u2019s then director of communications James Slack.\n\nA No 10 spokeswoman said Mr Slack \u201cgave a farewell speech\u201d to thank colleagues ahead of taking up a new role as deputy editor of The Sun newspaper.\n\nHe has apologised for the \u201canger and hurt\u201d caused by the leaving event, and acknowledged it \u201cshould not have happened at the time that it did\u201d.\n\nBut he said he could not comment further as it had been referred to Sue Gray as part of her investigation.\n\nThe latest revelation comes as the prime minister faces anger from his own party over attending a drinks gathering in the Downing Street garden during the first lockdown.\n\nCabinet ministers have rallied round Mr Johnson, but five of his own MPs have called for him to step down.\n\nLabour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said \u201cthe buck stops with the PM\u201d over the \u201cculture and behaviours\u201d inside No 10.\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, Mr Slack\u2019s leaving party coincided with another gathering in the No 10 basement for one of the PM\u2019s personal photographers.\n\nThe reported events were held at a time when the UK was in a period of national mourning, which ran from 9 April to 17 April, following the Duke of Edinburgh\u2019s death.\n\nThe Telegraph said staff were sent to a nearby shop with a suitcase, that was brought back \u201cfilled with bottles of wine\u201d.\n\nDuring the basement gathering, sources claimed there was a \u201cparty atmosphere\u201d, with a laptop placed on a photocopier with \u201cmusic blaring out\u201d.\n\nThe two parties are then said to have joined together in the No 10 garden and continued past midnight.\n\nAt the time, England was under \u201cstep two\u201d restrictions that stipulated people could not socialise indoors, except with those from their household or support bubble. People could socialise outdoors in groups of up to six people or two households.\n\nOther restrictions at the time included pubs and restaurants only being allowed to serve customers outside.\n\nA Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Slack \u201cgave a farewell speech to thank each team for the work they had done to support him, both those who had to be in the office for work and on a screen for those working from home\u201d.\n\nBut asked about the other party and whether drinking and dancing had taken place, she said No 10 had \u201cnothing further to add\u201d.\n\nMs Rayner said: \u201cThe Queen sat alone in mourning like so many did at the time with personal trauma and sacrifice to keep to the rules in the national interest.\n\n\u201cI have no words for the culture and behaviours at No 10 and the buck stops with the PM.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, also reiterated calls for the prime minister to resign over the growing list of parties, tweeting: \u201cThe Queen sitting alone, mourning the loss of her husband, was the defining image of lockdown.\n\n\u201cNot because she is the Queen, but because she was just another person, mourning alone like too many others.\n\n\u201cWhilst she mourned, No 10 partied.\u201d\n\nThis latest report adds to the growing list of alleged parties said to have taken place in Downing Street and other government departments during the pandemic.\n\nBut Mr Johnson has faced particular criticism after it emerged he had attended one on 20 May 2020 during the first lockdown.\n\nThe prime minister apologised on Wednesday in the House of Commons, saying he had joined staff for 25 minutes to thank them for their hard work. But he said he had \u201cbelieved implicitly that this was a work event\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday, backbencher Andrew Bridgen became the fifth Conservative MP to publicly say they had submitted a letter of no confidence in Mr Johnson.\n\nHe told BBC Newsnight he had submitted the letter with a \u201cheavy heart\u201d, believing there was no sign the revelations about parties in Downing Street during lockdown would end soon.\n\nMr Bridgen, who backed Mr Johnson in the 2019 Conservative leadership contest, said this was \u201cpreventing the government from functioning as normal and that\u2019s an untenable position\u201d.\n\nA minimum of 54 Conservative MPs must send letters to the 1922 committee of backbench MPs in order to trigger a leadership challenge.\n\nChris Philp, minister for technology and the digital economy, said it was right to wait for the findings of Ms Gray\u2019s investigation.\n\nHe told Newsnight: \u201cI think the public deserve to have a proper investigation with the full facts.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria: Dele Momodu Notifies PDP of Presidential Bid, Says Ambition Aimed at Reconciliation",
          "text": "Publisher of Ovation International Magazine, Bashorun Dele Momodu, on Thursday, notified the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of his intention to vie for the nation\u2019s top job, saying his decision was aimed at national reconciliation and healing.\n\nAt the same time, a pharmacist and PDP member, Sam Ohuabunwa, has also hinted of his presidential run, even as the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyiorcha Ayu, has assured them of level playing field, saying the party had no preferred candidate.\n\nMomodu, while speaking, commended the PDP national chairman for finding time to receive him at a short notice, which he said was evidence of Ayu\u2019s demonstration of his intellectual discipline, simplicity and cosmopolitan worldview.\n\nHe was of the view that the party was fortunate to have such a serious academic and patriot as national chairman at this momentous period in the life of its troubled country, praying God to lead the party from glory to glory.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe time has come for full reconciliation and forgiveness and a closure of our ugly past. Nigeria urgently requires a reset and a total redirection. With this letter, Sir, I wish to humbly put the speculations to rest by coming to you with every sense of purpose and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIn the last few days, there have been widespread speculations about my presidential bid for a second time. I have been greatly humbled by the excitement already generated, which reminds me of how it was 29 years ago, when your good friend and my own adopted father, Chief Moshood Abiola, threw his hat in the ring.\n\n\u201cIt is very obvious that Nigerians are eager to restore that promise of hope and the accompanying peace and joy that we lost,\u201d Momodu stated.\n\nHe, therefore said, \u201cAfter due consultations with my family, friends and some stakeholders, I have arrived at the decision to contest the 2023 Presidential election on the platform of our great party, PDP. If selected as the party\u2019s candidate, I hasten to add that this is my personal decision, although I have received advice, encouragement and support from diverse quarters since I started my consultations.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, offer myself to the PDP as the best aspirant to turn the fortunes of our esteemed party and our well endowed country around. In this regard, and with a deep sense of humility and profound respect, I urge the party not to consider picking its candidate based on the usual considerations, which had spectacularly failed our country in the past. The mood of the teeming youths, and indeed every patriotic Nigerian, who we need to come out en masse to vote for our party, aligns with this view.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason, that I invite our great party, PDP, to accept that it must search for a veritable flag bearer with the requisite leadership and visionary qualities that Nigerians now carnestly year for\n\n\u201cI\u2019m convinced that the time has come to seriously challenge and dislodge those politicians,who have held our country to ransom by kidnapping, hijacking and destroying the future of our younger generation and generations yet unborn. I\u2019m better prepared now than at the time of my first foray into the fray in 2011, and I am fully ready and certainly capable for the onerous tasks and responsibilities ahead.\n\n\u201cI wish to place on record, my firm promise and commitment not to be harassed, bullied or intimidated by anyone, who feels he or she can buy the whole of Nigeria with loads of cash fraudulently and illegally filched and taken from the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to follow in the best traditions of my heroic mentor, Chief Moshood Abiola, who had wanted to banish poverty in our land, but was disastrously disallowed from achieving this laudable objective. Nigeria has paid heavy price and penalty in the last 29 years and suffered untold agony and indignity as result of that tragic misadventure,\n\n\u201cNigeria deserves much better than where we are now, and my appeal to fellow Nigerians is that we should collectively rescue our dear country from the suffocating claws of slave masters, overlords and tyrants \u2013 vociferously and vehemently reject any suggestion that Nigeria should continue to tread this dangerous path. The die is cast, and we must regain and take back our country. I fully and unequivocally commit and dedicate myself to this cause,\u201d he stated.\n\nOhuabunwa, while intimating Ayu of his intention to contest for the presidential ticket of the party, said he was coming on board with his wealth of experience as an industrialist and entrepreneurs per excellence\n\n\u201cSo I am coming to lay the foundation for proper unity of our nation to create a level playing ground, where every child born in every part of this country will have the same opportunity like the other child to achieve his potential the way it happens the United States of America.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the issues in the Southeast are national issues. There\u2019s nothing unique about the Southeast. What is happening in the northwest, what is happening in the south, North East, what is happening in the middle belt \u2013 they are all symptomatic of the same problem \u2013 foundational issues with Nigeria. And all we need to do is to look at them as national problems, when you look at them as ethnic animal problem, we miss it; they are national problems.\n\n\u201cWe need to sit there and say, this was not the way our country was run by the founding fathers of this country. They organised this country in a manner that allowed for mutually satisfying relationship. A relationship that is normal, actually satisfying, including the marriage is starting to break down. So, don\u2019t pretend about it,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response, Ayu assured them that, \u201cThere will be a level playing field for all candidates. We don\u2019t have any special candidate; we don\u2019t have a preferred candidate. It is the party members, who will decide and if at the end of the day, the party members vote for you that you are the one they want, we will queue behind you.\n\n\u201cThe party welcomes all candidates. Our party is a great party that is why people like you have not just joined the party but wants to contribute your services to the country. We know the work you have done in the media over the years, you are certainly a respected media personality in the country. You tried your hands in politics in the past and I hope that you will continue to support the party.\n\n\u201cYou must work hard to build the party, because for you to run for office, you must have a strong platform, a united party, a strong platform, a focused party with which you can go into battle,\u201d he said.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",
