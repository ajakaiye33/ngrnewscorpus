          "text": "James Ogunnaike \u2013 Abeokuta\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo on Wednesday advocated for a national policy for the eradication of cervical cancer in Nigeria.\n\nThe former President, who made the call when he played host to delegates of the Cervical Cancer-Free Nigeria (CCFN), led by Senator Lanre Tejuoso, at his Penthouse located within the premises of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, said both the Federal and State governments must deploy all available resources to fight cervical cancer as they had fought polio, COVID-19 and other diseases.\n\nObasanjo who was appointed as the Presidential Ambassador for Global Oncology during the visit, urged the Federal government to invest in national-scale procurement and distribution of HPV vaccine to fight Human PapillomaVirus (HPV) the virus responsible for cervical cancer.\n\nThe former President said, the HPV vaccine must be available and accessible to every Nigerian girl child to prevent the spread of cervical cancer in the country.\n\nObasanjo said, \u201cOur first responsibility is advocacy, that yes, this is a disease that can kill and that is killing our women, but it can be prevented.\n\n\u201cThe starting point for me is that we need a policy at the national and at the State levels to eradicate this disease\u201d.\n\n\u201cVaccine was not there when I was in government, if it was, it was not brought to my notice because then we would have had a policy, now we should appeal to government at national and State levels to have a policy for this particular type of things, which is eradicating this decease which is preventable and which is treatable. That must be part of our responsibility as ambassadors\u201d.\n\n\u201cPolio was not left to government alone, but the first thing that was done was the policy, government had a policy and government used all the available means \u2013 traditional rulers, native doctors, women, community leaders, civil societies, development partners, private sector and every resource available even vaccine manufacturers, we used all the available resources\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat gladdens my heart initially is that, cervical cancer is not like malaria and the reason why we haven\u2019t made much in success in fight against malaria, is that it is something that affects the temperate zones of the world.\n\n\u201cBut this one (cervical cancer), it affects black and white, so they will make sure that whatever research they are making, is focused on women all over the world.\n\n\u201cBut our scientists have their own role to play, because there maybe variants of the virus that are particular to our own people. And if that is the case, we have to get the vaccine that will deal with our own variants of this virus.\n\n\u201cWe should make it clear that the vaccine is free of any adverse effect and in fact, rather than stop children production, it encourage it.\n\n\u201cWherever I go now, I will talk cervical cancer.\n\n\u201cI do hope that in our policy or whatever we do, we should also have a timeline something that will give us incentive to say we want to achieve this at such and such a time and then we move on in that\u201d.\n\nChief Abimbola Ogunbanjo, a Global Ambassador to the CCFN campaign said despite the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, CCFN cannot neglect other health priorities like cervical cancer.\n\nHe noted that the HPV vaccine has existed for more than 15 years and has become a standard, routine vaccine in many countries of the world, pointing out that over 270 million doses of the HPV vaccine have been distributed worldwide.\n\nHe assured that, \u201d the HPV vaccine is time-tested, effective, and, most importantly, safe.\n\n\u201cCervical cancer elimination is possible, but we need to be bold and decisive by ensuring both supply of and demand for the HPV vaccine in Nigeria\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need stakeholders from all sectors\u2013public, private, and civil\u2013to join us in this fight to work toward a future when no Nigerian daughter, mother, or sister dies from cervical cancer. We cannot achieve this ambitious goal alone. Therefore, we are thankful for the partnership of Global Oncology\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Professor Is-haq Oloyede\n\nBy Shina Abubakar, Osogbo\n\nThe Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, Professor Is-haq Oloyede has disclosed that the hue over the poor performance of students in the last Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination is not only exaggerated but also misplaced.\n\nHe added that though UTME is not an achievement test but a ranking test aimed at grading a group of candidates for equitable placement into tertiary institutions, yet, government and stakeholders should interrogate the facilities available for candidates preparing to enter higher institutions of learning in Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking at the foundation laying ceremony of JAMB\u2019s The International Talent Resort Centre, Alarape, Gbongan, Osun state on Wednesday, he said the body has substantially won the war against examination malpractices, saying no amount of blackmail would deter the body from ridding the education system of the illicit act of examination syndicates.\n\nHe also counseled tertiary institutions to pay attention to the activities of examination fraudsters parading themselves tutorial masters in charge of IJMB and JUPEB units destroying the education system.\n\nALSO READ: Gunmen abduct traditional ruler in Kogi\n\n\u201d The future of our country depends on how far we can go to improve on the standard of education. The recent uproar on the exaggerated poor performance of candidates who sat for the 2021 UTME is misplaced. Nevertheless, the 2021 UTME result offers the opportunity to all of us to interrogate the quality of preparation of and facilities for candidates into the tertiary education system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMany may not have noticed that shortly before the commencement of 2021 UTME, a cartel published a fake digital past UTME Question Papers and was circulating fake questions and answers claiming to be genuinely from JAMB. Many parents who fell for the scam must have now realised how wrong they and their not so innocent children were.\n\nThis explains why many students had to collapse in the examination hall when reality stared them in the face. This is a lesson for people to realize that the days of examination malpractice in JAMB conducted examinations is over and over forever.\n\n\u201cIt is high time, the Governments, particularly the state governments paid sufficient attention to combating the highly organized gang of examination fraudsters who in almost every city of the nation operate under the guise of tutorial classes in largely uncompleted dilapidated buildings with unqualified tutors and proprietors whose expertise is forging A/level qualifications and corrupting the education system.\n\n\u201cA recent experiment by Bayero University, Kano shows that as high as 96% of the A/level results being churned out (courtesy of these tutorial centers) are fake. The states and security agencies, therefore, need to pay sufficient attention to the fast-expanding illicit education gangsters.\n\n\u201cTertiary institutions also need to \u2013 pay particular attention to the fact that these examination fraudsters parading themselves as tutorial masters are infiltrating vastly and deeply into the institutions- IJMB and JUPEB units -wreaking untold havoc on the education system.\n\nALSO READ: Buhari swears in 5 Permanent Secretaries\n\nSpeaking on the talent resort centre, Oloyede said the edifice first phase project comprises of an office and a 550 seater CBT centre, saying, \u201cthis International Talent Resort is programmed to be an integrated ultra-modern educational facility to serve all researchers, particularly those engaged in various academic services of the Board\u201d.\n\nSpeaking, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola who was represented by the Secretary to the state government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji remarked that the center is another feather added to the many garlands that have rightfully characterized the Oloyede leadership in JAMB.\n\nHe assured JAMB of enabling an atmosphere defined by unrivaled tranquility that can facilitate serious intellectual and relaxation adventure adding that is one of the states that enjoy electricity supply the most in the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the Olufi of Gbongan, Oba (Dr) Adetoyese Oyeniyi expressed gratitude to JAMB authorities and assured the body of the support of his subjects.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

In fact, there are alleged information that the Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai had once stated in a social media post that his kinsmen, the Fulani will always carry out reprisals if any of their people are killed and that if a person is killed, almost 100 persons from the alleged guilty party and community will be killed as revenge. Going by this story, it\u2019s inconceivable that the governor would be bothered that his kinsmen are now waging a war of attrition on Christians over perceived earlier attacks, no matter how few the victims were.\u201d",

The report was submitted by a team of House members led by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the President urged leaders to respect the wishes of people and allow them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nHe also restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 states during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force. They just wanted to see who this Buhari was. People wonder why Nigerians accept me, despite not being rich. I wonder, too. I felt I just have to serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nCommending the 9th National Assembly for its cooperation with the executive, he said he tried very hard to get the 8th Assembly to do same for the sake of the country, \u201cand I didn\u2019t succeed much. But time has proved me right.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila thanked the President for endorsing the security summit conducted by the House, adding: \u201cYou were part of it from the beginning, and you were to have declared it open, if not for the exigencies of duty.\u201d\n\nHe said the summit became imperative after lawmakers were bombarded daily by their constituents on the security challenges facing the country, \u201cand motions after motions were moved by lawmakers.\u201d\n\nA committee of 50 lawmakers, across party, religious and ethnic lines, he said, was set up to plan the summit.\n\nGbajabiamila said the report was a product of inputs by traditional rulers, scholars, independent thinkers, and security chiefs, noting that it contains seven recommendations that require legislative action, and about 19 that would be implemented by the executive.\n\nSpeaking to State House Correspondents after the event, the speaker said the report suggested the creation of regional development commissions for all regions of the country and also proffered resolutions to military complexities.\n\n\u201cThere are several recommendations; we\u2019ve agreed to establish zonal commissions in all the zones like the North East Development Commission. We\u2019ll have the South West, South-South, South East, North West, and that goes a long way in resolving issues, regional and zonal issues,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Doris Obinna\n\nNigerians have told the National Assembly to throw out the controversial Nigerian Press Council (NPC) and the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Acts amendment in its entirety.\n\nThis followed the disclosure by its sponsor, Olusegun Odebunmi, yesterday, that legislative process on it has been suspended.\n\nThe federal lawmaker from Oyo State, said on a live television programme, that he initiated the suspension to allow for consultation with stakeholders in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe have suspended the process for more consultation to happen on it. They demanded for a lot of time and I said \u2018no problem, we have given you; even if you spend three, four to five weeks\u2019. So far, more consultations from critical stakeholders, and many people have been submitting their memoranda to the National Assembly even within the industry.\u201d\n\nOdebunmi said his intention is not to gag the press, saying he recognises the lapses in the practice of journalism in Nigeria, and that the amendments are aimed at fixing those problems.\n\n\u201cMy intention is not to gag the press, and unless all the practitioners can say all is well with the industry, to the best of my knowledge I know all is not well, and I know the National Assembly has the power to look into the existing Act. All is not well with the NPC agency, it is an agency of government, and you\u2019re expecting something to be given back to the society, but until now nothing has been coming from the agency.\u201d\n\nReacting, National President of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, told Daily Sun that the body was not interested in the suspension but its outright cancellation.\n\n\u201cWe do not support a suspension. What we want as a body is for the bill to be completely thrown away, and if a new bill is to be made, all the relevant stakeholders must be carried along from inception.\u201d\n\nFormer national chairman of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), Chekwas Okorie also called for the abolition of the bills.\n\n\u201cIt should be dropped completely because whatever was the intention for proposing the bill is definitely in very bad taste and has been rejected not just by the media practitioners, but Nigerians. The National Assembly should withdraw it completely without waiting for it to be rejected.\u201d\n\nNational President, Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Mustapha Isa, said the National Assembly, in the first instance, has no right to amend a bill being challenged in the Supreme Court and insisted that suspension is not enough.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is outright dropping of the bill, not suspension. If they want to do another one, let them start by first having a meeting with stakeholders, so that we would collectively decide on what should be in the bill. You don\u2019t first put such a bill together before you start discussing with stakeholders. If you mean, before you put a bill together, ensure that you meet with us and not after.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the bill is anti-people and should be dropped completely.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun, spokesperson of the party, Kola Ologbodiyan, said it did not come as a surprise that the Senate suspended further deliberations on the bill.\n\n\u201cIt portends danger for our collective freedom of speech and our constitutionally guaranteed access to information. It is very relieving that the Senate has suspended further deliberations on the satanic Bill, but we want it to be dropped permanently.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Yerima Shettima, commended the legislators for the suspension but demanded it should be thrown away because it is evil.\n\n\u201cWe should be making progress and doing the things that other developed nations are doing. We cannot go back to the analogue era when the world is going digital. We are in a global community. So, I commend them because they did well.\u201d\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, praised the Senate for suspending the bill but said they should move a step further to drop it completely.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering from all kinds of problems so much that to silence us or beat us and not allow us to cry is worsening our situation. So, the suspension is a good thing, but they should think of dropping it entirely.\u201d\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonna, said the suspension is to enable them gather more public opinion about the bill to know the next line of action. \u201cSo, what they did is in order. I commend them for that.\u201d\n\nPublicity Secretary,Middle Belt Forum, Dogo Isuwa, said instead of rejoicing over the suspension, the media should first identify those areas in the Bill that are not making sense and enlighten Nigerians on the negative effects of those clauses, otherwise the National Assembly could still reintroduce the bill and pass into law in future.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, welcomed the suspension.\n\n\u201cThough the Senate said the bill is intended to regulate the media, the real intention is to gag the media. Afenifere believes in the freedom of expression, especially in a way that reflects the right of people to express their mind, but not in a scandalous or libelous manner. The bill should not have come up in the first place because there are various bodies that regulate the media.\u201d\n\nFormer chairman, Lagos NUJ chairman, Dr. Quasim Akinreti, said the voice of reason has prevailed with the suspension.\n\n\u201cThe initiator of that Bill jumped the gun without consulting stakeholders. For me, what the government is doing is not in the interest of the people.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe N15 trillion Infrastructure Company Limited (InfraCo), created by the federal government to bridge the nation\u2019s huge infrastructure gap is to take off in the third quarter of the year, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said.\n\nEmefiele spoke yesterday at an investors\u2019 webinar designed to showcase the investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s privatisation and economic reforms programmes, organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in collaboration with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX).\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo also said at the event that although the government\u2019s economic reforms had paid off in telecommunications, pension and maritime sectors, the current administration was making efforts to address the challenges in the power sector privatisation.\n\nInvestors in the N15 trillion InfraCo include the CBN, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Africa Finance Corporation (AFC).\n\nIn his goodwill message at the webinar, Emefiele said the federal government had approved KPMG as the financial adviser to InfraCo, adding that the firm is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to attain meaningful growth, there must be huge investments in key sectors of the economy, including infrastructure such as rail and power, among others.\n\nAccording to him, InfraCo has generated huge interest in deploying private capital to for infrastructure, adding that the approval of the vice president has been secured to appoint KPMG as transaction advisers.\n\nEmefiele stated that over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic and developments in the global crude oil market had created negatively affected not only the global economy but also the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor Nigeria, we witnessed a drop in foreign exchange earnings, government revenues along with supply chain disruptions which ultimately led to the economy falling into a recession during the third quarter of 2020. Significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities in key sectors of our economy such as in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors eventually helped and led to the rebound of growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 as gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe sustenance of these measures have also helped to support growth of 0.51 per cent during the first quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, we consider this growth as fragile and therefore seek the support of those of us here at this webinar to continue to work with us to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that in June 2021, investments in the Importers and Exporters (I&E) window stood at over N3 trillion at an average rate of N412 to the dollar, adding that this meant that on an average working day of 20 working days, close to $150 million was posted in that market.\n\nIn their goodwill messages, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said Nigeria had huge gas investment potential waiting to be exploited.\n\nShe stated that despite the numerous challenges confronting the country, it still remains the premium investment destination in Africa.\n\nAhmed said the COVID-19 pandemic had provided greater need for the federal government to forge a more robust partnership with the private sector.\n\nIn his keynote address, Osinbajo said the investors\u2019 webinar was organised to showcase investment opportunities arising from Nigerians economic reforms and privatisation activities.\n\nHe said: \u201d I think that many who have observed the current Nigerian government would agree with me that an article of faith for this government is the importance of mobilising private capital and participation for improving efficiency and driving economic growth and this really explains why we have this collaboration today between the Bureau of Public Enterprises (which you know is in charge of our sectoral reform programme) with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) to host this seminar as an important platform drawing attention to investment opportunities to both our local and foreign friends and collaborators.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, privatising utilities of the size of the former PHCN simply calls for deeper intentional consideration of the right models and the right type of investors and also looking at funding for these investors over an extended period of time.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the challenges that we have seen, but I think that it\u2019s an excellent lesson and there is so much that we are learning in approaching privatisation, especially our utilities, going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome, address, the BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, said the BPE had listed over 36 assets for sale and giving them out to concessionaires under its 2021 work plan.\n\nHe stated that about N500 billion is expected to be contributed into the federal government coffers from the privatisation proceeds this year.\n\nAccording to him, 234 public assets have been sold in the last 32 years while N1 trillion was generated by the agency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says 542,576 Nigerians have completed online voter registration\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday expressed the determination of the commission to deepen democracy through the use of technology.\n\nHe also put the number of Nigerians who have completed online voters\u2019 pre-registration at 542,576.\n\nYakubu, at a meeting yesterday in Abuja with the resident electoral commissioners, said: \u201cI would like to reassure Nigerians that the commission will continue to spare no effort in deepening the use of technology to ensure electoral transparency and credibility.\u201d\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of the clamour for the inclusion of electronic transmission of election results in the 2010 Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, amidst efforts by the leadership of the National Assembly to delete the provision from the bill.\n\nYakubu said the voters\u2019 register remained at the heart of any credible election.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are working hard to ensure that just as we had a smooth take-off of the online pre-registration, the commencement of the physical registration will similarly be hitch-free.\u201d\n\nHe said the first quarter of the physical registration would commence between June 28 and September 30, while the second quarter of the exercise will start October 4 to December 30.\n\nAlso, the third quarter of the physical registration will start from January 3, 2022, to April 1, 2022, and the fourth quarter will kick off on April 11 to June 30, 2022.\n\nGiving update of the exercise, Yakubu said two weeks since the exercise began, a total of 542,576 Nigerians have completed the online pre-registration.\n\nAccording to him, out of this figure, 456,909 are fresh registrants while 85,667 have applied for voter transfer, replacement of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and update of voter information record among others.\n\nHe added that the commission is able to provide Nigerians with information on the distribution of registrants across the states and by age, occupation, gender and disability.\n\n\u201cOut of 542,576 online registrants so far, 356,777 (or 66 per cent) are young people between the ages of 18 and 34 years.\n\n\u201cThis is followed by 134,719 middle-aged registrants who fall between 35 and 49 years. The third category is elderly persons aged between 50 and 69 years of which 44,896 Nigerians have registered. Interestingly, some 6,184 senior citizens (aged 70 years and above) have taken advantage of the new online opportunity to register,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the occupational distribution of registrants, the INEC chairman said: \u201c156,446 are students; 38,217 artisans; 24,421 farmers and fishermen; 150,145 businessmen and traders; 35,831 employed as civil and public servants and 8,334 housewives.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 129,182 registrants did not specify their occupations. On gender, 321,781 are males while 220,795 are females. In our effort to serve all Nigerians better, the commission has requested registrants to indicate their disability (if any).\u201d\n\nHe explained that the essence of this will enable INEC to efficiently deploy assistive voting devices such as Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses for persons with special needs at polling units on election day.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have data for 6,558 registrants who have clearly indicated their type of disability.\u201d\n\nYakubu said a detailed information, including state and occupational distribution, had been uploaded on the commission\u2019s website and social media platforms, while the commission shall also continue to provide the weekly updates throughout the duration of the CVR exercise.\n\nAccording to him, the commission is aware that not all Nigerians have access to computers, smart phones or internet connectivity to register online.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly assured every eligible registrant that there will also be an opportunity for physical or in-person registration at designated centres. Even the online registrants will have to complete their registration physically at those centres.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to activate some 2,673 centres to which we intend to deploy 5,346 officials for in-person registration,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By John Shiklam\n\nA total of 222 people have been killed while 774 others have been kidnapped by bandits in Kaduna state in the past three months.\n\nThis was contained in the second quarter security report, presented to Governor Nasir El-Rufai by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan on Tuesday at the Government House Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the report covers the period between April 1 to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe report showed a slide reduction in the number of deaths and the number of people abducted.\n\nIn the first quarter report, present in April, a total of 323 persons were killed while 949 others were kidnapped by bandits across Kaduna State.\n\nAruwan also disclosed that a total of 8,553 heads of cattle were rustled in the period under review with most stolen from the Kaduna Central Senatorial District, which accounted for around\n\n5,715 stolen cattle.\n\nAruwan said the 222 deaths were caused by banditry attacks, communal clashes and reprisals across the state.\n\nAccording to him, 159 of the deaths, were recorded in Kaduna Central Senatorial District while Southern Kaduna Senatorial District and Northern Senatorial District recorded 54 and nine deaths respectively.\n\nThe commissioner said of the 774 people kidnapped, Kaduna Central Senatorial\n\nDistrict topped the list with 555 people abducted.\n\nBirnin Gwari, Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa and Igabi LGAs, where there are rampant cases of killings and kidnappings are in the Kaduna Central senatorial zone.\n\nHe said, \u201cSouthern Kaduna Senatorial District recorded 164 kidnapped persons, with Kachia LGA reporting the highest number of 111.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Senatorial District recorded 55 kidnapped persons, with 37 of these from Zaria LGA.\n\n\u201cIn total, 239 women, and 32 minors were kidnapped in the second quarter across the state\u201d.\n\nThe commissioner also disclosed that 20 persons were reported to have been raped across the state during the period, adding that a total of 266 were injured as a result of banditry, violent attacks, reprisals and communal clashes.\n\nAruwan also raised the alarm over looming food insecurity, threat to education and attack on health facilities in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cBanditry has hampered farming activities in the frontline areas of the state.\n\n\u201cBandits attack and abduct farmers working on or on their way to their fields. Several farmers have similarly been killed.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits have begun to extract protection levies from some communities in return for permission to cultivate their fields.\n\n\u201cMany farmers in these areas, fearing for their lives and safety, have abandoned their\n\nfields altogether.\n\n\u201cThis has already begun to affect crop yields, and the threat of food insecurity looms large.\u201d\n\nHe said the most affected communities are in the frontline Local Government\n\nAreas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia,\n\nKagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga.\u201d\n\nAruwan said attacks on some schools and mass abduction of students portends dire consequences for education in the state.\n\nHe said hospitals and other health facilities in frontline locations are equally under grave threat by armed bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBanditry has led to the near-total collapse of the local economy in frontline areas, which is mainly sustained by crop and livestock farming. \u201cThe activities of bandits in these areas have dispossessed residents of their foremost means of sustenance and disrupted the\n\noperation of the usually dynamic weekly markets.\n\n\u201cBesides the rustling of cattle, the previously highlighted targeting of farmers by armed bandits has generally eroded the economic viability of rural communities, in addition to precipitating a food crisis.\n\n\u201cThis has translated to losses running into billions of naira from the rural economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the State government\u2019s strategies to address the security challenges were being sustained.\n\nThe commissioner decried the politicization of insecurity saying \u201cpolitical mappings and strategies are now frequently being built around the unfortunate scenarios of insecurity, while real people and real communities suffer\n\ndevastation at the hands of sheer criminals.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cEthnic and religious narratives are also being built around banditry, to the further complication of security management.\n\n\u201cToo often, attacks by bandits are portrayed to the public by some quarters as ethnically or religiously motivated.\n\nSuch groups manipulate religious, ethnic and political sensitivities for their own advantage, simply to advance a cause inimical to peace and stability of the state.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks after receiving the reports, Governor Nasir El-Rufai said an unconventional approach is required to enable the state government protect its citizens.\n\nA Government House statement issued after the presentation of the report, quoted the governor as\n\ncalling on the federal government to empower the state government to make up for the manpower deficit in the security sector.\n\n\u201cThe state government must be empowered and supported by the federal government to make up the manpower deficit in the security sector\u201d, the statement quoted the governor.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccitizens who have been affected by crime and insecurity are not interested in the distinctions between the federal and state governments in terms of their powers over security.\n\n\u2018\u2019As a state government, we have also seen at close quarters how the federal security agencies are limited by manpower deficits.\n\n\u201cThere are simply not enough boots on the ground to have credible deployments in most places to protect communities, deter crime and enforce law and order.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019an unconventional approach is required to enable us better to protect our communities and we are engaging with the federal government and the leadership of the security agencies on this.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A group, American Veterans of Igbo Descent (AVID), has written a letter to Kenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta to find a means of facilitating the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAVID expressed its displeasure with Kenyatta for abducting Kanu and extraditing him to the Nigerian government for seeking liberation for his Igbo people.\n\nUhuru Kenyatta with Buhari\n\nThe group, which comprises Igbo men and women that are serving or served in different security agencies in the United States, told the Kenyan leader that a Nigerian former President, late Dr. Nnamdi Azikwe saved his father, Jomo Kenyatta who was involved in similar agitation, from the same fate he was to suffer in the hands of British authorities.\n\nThey berated the leader of the East African nation for betraying Kanu, by handing him over to the enemies that want to prosecute him for defending his people.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Nigerian Government Asked Us To Abduct You \u2013 Kenya Operatives Told Nnamdi Kanu, Chained Him To Floor For Six Days\n\nAVID said this in a letter signed by its President, Chief Sylvester Onyia, dated July 10, 2021, which was made available to SaharaReporters.\n\nRead the full letter below:\n\nThe American Veterans of Igbo Descent (AVID) just received an urgent Intel we need to explore with you bordering on the kidnap/abduction of a political activist globally known as Mazi Nnamdi Kanu \u2013 a Biafra/British citizen within your country.\n\nAVID is comprised of Igbo ethnic men and women who honorably served or are currently serving in different Armed branches of the United States Military. Under Title 38 of the U.S. Code, a veteran is defined as a \u201cperson who served in the Active Military, Naval, or Air Service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable.\n\nVeteran members of AVID are citizens from all the 50 states in the United States, born as Igbo men and women; and successfully served in the following United States Military Branches:\n\n1. The United States Army\n\n2. The United States Marine Corp\n\n3. The United States Navy SEAL \u2013 Sea, Air, and Land specialists.\n\n4. The United States Navy\n\n5. The United States Airforce\n\n6. The United States Coast Guard\n\n7. The United States National Guard\n\n8. The United States Space Force\n\n9. U. S. Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps Officers\n\n10. The United States Army Guard, Air National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve\n\n11. The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\u201d\n\nThe organization further revealed in the letter how the agitation for Biafra began a few years after Nigerian Independence and what has transpired till now.\n\nIt also informed Kenyatta of how the Nigerian government sent its security agents to invade Kanu\u2019s house in which people were killed in 2017, but the IPOB leader escaped.\n\nThe nation called Nigeria has never known peace since the amalgamation of the north and south by the British in 1914. You might be aware of the historic Biafran war which lasted from 1967-1970.\n\nThe war was a quest for self-determination of the Igbo people-an attempted emancipation from Fulani terrorist Muslims. Statistically, 2.5 plus million Igbo children, women, and defenseless men perished in that genocide.\n\nBecause of the gruesome rape of young Igbo girls and married women, unprovoked killings, land grabbing, massacre, maiming by the Fulani men with no accountability, Eastern Nigeria men pillaged, slaughtered en mass within their indigenous ancestral land with no consequences and grand plan by Nigeria Fulani Islamic-led Jihadist government to violently eliminate all Igbo Judeo-Christian ethnic people and repopulate our ancestral land with Fulani Muslims.\n\nNigeria government despicable act of support for Boko haram terrorists and Miyetti Allah Muslim Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN. This association is the leadership of Fulani terrorists\u2019 groups disguising as cattle herders in Nigeria.\n\nA credible Civil Rights Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (MNK) established the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and a security outfit called Eastern Security Network (ESN) to protect our people.\n\nMazi Nnamdi Kanu has been a target for assassination by the Nigerian Government. There has been the deployment of the Army to his home to kill him an operation (coded operation python dance.) His home was riddled with bullets, 25 young men were killed, but he miraculously escaped.\n\nWe are therefore upset and saddened by your collusion with Nigerian Terrorist Government to abduct/kidnap an unarmed son and a Liberation Political Activist (LPA) whom you should have protected and celebrated in support of democracy and freedom,\u201d the letter continued.\n\nThe group went further to compare the fate of older Kenyatta whom Azikwe saved and how younger Kenyatta decided to hand over Kanu to his enemy.\n\nHistorical Underpinning:\n\nA historical journey through memory lane shows that your father President Jomo Kenyatta was found guilty to be hanged by Britain because of his freedom agitation; same as Mazi Nnamdi Kanu whom you betrayed.\n\nDr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the premier of Eastern Nigeria, used money from the Eastern regional government, hired local and international lawyers, came to Nairobi Kenya, and pulled out the head of Jomo Kenyatta from the British hangman\u2019s noose. There is a street and market named in honor of your father in Igbo land.\n\nYour father was accused of leading a terrorist organization called Mau-Mau just as Mazi Nnamdi Kanu whom you betrayed.

Ironically, your name \u201cUhuru\u201d means Freedom, but you stand against Freedom by your betrayal of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nDo you not know that this Mazi Nnamdi Kanu whom you extradited to the Nigerian hangman is related to Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe who delivered your father from a British hangman?\u201d The letter further said.\n\nWhile closing, the group ordered the Kenyan President to find to correct his anomalies by making sure the pro-Biafra secessionist leader regain his freedom.American Veterans of Igbo Descent Understanding:\n\nYour government kidnapped a foreign Civil Political Agitator Mazi Nnamdi Kanu (MNK) and handed him over to the Terrorist Nigeria Government who embraces internationally recognized terrorist organization known as Boko Haram.\n\nYour violent abduction and extradition of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu endangered his life for political views he shares with your late father. Your action tantamount to Ad ignorantum because you quickly forgot the help your father received from Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe (brother of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu), and without that help, you may not have been born.\n\nYour government hostile and violent action of MNK\u2019s seizure and abduction within your territory is a slap on the face of all Igbo Ethnic Nationality. MNK\u2019s abduction by your security agents has affirmed the consequence, which violates MNK\u2019s United Nations stipulated Human Rights. How can you justify your dastardly action of kidnap and extraditing MNK to the Nigeria terrorist Fulani Muslim Cabal leadership?\n\nMazi Nnamdi Kanu did not violate any known Kenya law or international law. You must as a matter of urgency ameliorate this degraded condition within a reasonable time and call for the immediate and unconditional release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThank you in advance for your esteemed response, consideration, and attention to this matter.\n\nGod bless you and God bless the Kenyan people.",

          "text": "A High Court in Kenya has ordered Safaricom to pay a blind man KSh6 million ($56,000) for failing to hire him after he had gone through the entire recruitment process.\n\nWilson Macharia sued the network operator to seek compensation because his rights were violated, BusinessDaily reported. He told Justice James Makau that Safaricom declined to employ him as a customer care executive on grounds that it did not have specialised software to help him with his work.\n\nMacharia said he responded to an advert by Safaricom in August 2016 for a customer experience executive position, which invited qualified Kenyans irrespective of \u201crace, colour, religion, gender, tribal origin, disability or age\u201d.\n\nAlong with other persons living with disabilities, Macharia was shortlisted for the job, went through the oral interview and medical test, after which he was invited to sign the contract in July 2017. However, Safaricom said the invite was erroneous.\n\nIn its defense, the telecoms firm denied discriminating against the plaintiff and argued that it allowed Macharia to be interviewed for the job but that it lacked specialised software that would enable him to work.\n\nThe judge ruled that the company violated Macharia\u2019s rights and failed to treat him with dignity as it should have informed him earlier that the software was unavailable instead of making him go through the recruitment process only to later claim the letter was sent erroneously.\n\n\u201cI find that the Respondent\u2019s excuse to be an afterthought that was introduced late to the detriment of the Petitioner. The Respondent knew right from the beginning that the Petitioner\u2019s work called for software, yet they took him through all recruitment steps,\u201d Justice Makau ruled.\n\nThere\u2019s a long history of discrimination and exclusion of persons with disabilities around the world.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that there are over 650 million people around the world who live with disabilities; 98% of children with disabilities in developing countries do not attend school and the literacy rate for adults with disabilities is as low as 3%.\n\nIn addition, millions of people with disabilities want to get jobs but can\u2019t get hired. Even in developed economies, they struggle to find employment.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "Spazio Ideale designs iconic workspaces for tech companies like Paystack, uLesson, others",
          "text": "Several studies have confirmed the correlation between how a space looks and how a person lives or works. With changes in how we view our environment, there is now an increasing demand to put much thought into space designs. But this has not always been the case.\n\nPitching space designs, in Africa for instance, is more commonplace today than it was a decade ago, with more people now interested in how their spaces look. Interestingly, we are talking about a $115 billion industry projected to hit $121 billion by the end of 2021. And it gets more exciting with the various options available with innovation.\n\nThe acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\n\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers. She studied computer science for her first degree, with a masters in interior design coming after as she followed her love for designing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nIn what started as a passion, she soon decided to turn interior designing into a business. Her entrepreneurship journey started by chance.\n\nThe rise of Spazio Ideale\n\nAfter her postgraduate studies in Italy in 2014 and a stint in Ghana, she couldn\u2019t find any suitable design company to join when she returned to Nigeria. They all didn\u2019t fit into the designs she liked, among other concerns. So she started telling people about what she does.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you go to a design school, you have to create a design portfolio of your work. And when I got back, I distributed it to a few people to see. They got to see what I love to do and how I love to create.\u201d\n\nAnd she eventually convinced some of the people in her circle to patronise her.\n\nIn June 2015, she did her first project, a living space, for a friend. The startup has since grown in its scope of coverage and is currently more of a commercial space design company.\n\nProud of the progress the company has made so far, Bamgbelu reveals that it has done more than 50 projects cutting across residential, commercial, hospitality, and school facilities.\n\nHowever, most of them are in commercial spaces \u2014 over 30 clients \u2014 particularly the tech space. With most projects gotten from referrals, the startup touts itself as the first in the tech space, boasting of designing office spaces for popular startups in Nigeria.\n\nNotable mentions include Kuda Bank, Softcom, Heritage Bank, Paystack, Reliance HMO, uLesson, Techpoint Africa, and Max.ng.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterior photos of ISN Medicals at Ilupeju, Lagos. Designed by Spazio Ideale. Source: Supplied\n\nBamgbelu relives with fondness how the team came up with Paystack\u2019s iconic workspace design.\n\n\u201cIn our initial conversation with Paystack, we tried to understand how they are and what they do, and we realised that they have a friendly organisation, although small then, but they were like a family and a fun environment to work in. And we designed the space to reflect this.\u201d\n\nA customer-centric approach\n\nBetween initial contact to delivery, there are five steps the team goes through to satisfy a client \u2014 this is called the Spazio Way. First, a 60-minute meeting, then a conceptual design, detail, execution, and after-sales care.\n\nHowever, the delivery time depends on the scope of the project.\n\nAlthough Bamgbelu personally handled the startup\u2019s first set of projects, the founder\u2019s current responsibility is to provide overall creative direction from design to execution.\n\nThis is easy because she has a reliable team of 14 highly skilled individuals consisting of interior designers, architects, civil engineers, and building technologists. This fills her with confidence as they all work together to deliver on every project.\n\nSpazio Ideale team. Source: Supplied\n\nThe startup also engages partners like muralists, furniture makers, and plumbers, among others. In essence, Spazio Ideale\u2019s work can sometimes require completely changing the entire structure of a space, from ceiling to floor.\n\nBamgbelu highlights how the team comes up with the design for any project.\n\n\u201cIt depends on a few things; we design based on what the client is trying to achieve. The first thing we ask is, why aren\u2019t you doing this yourself? Why do you need an interior designer to do it for you? That\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201d\n\nBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s in trying to save cost because they don\u2019t know where to get the things they want. Others are looking for expertise because they have this idea in mind but don\u2019t know how to go about it. Some others are looking to improve employee experience or brand association.\n\n\u201cSo, every design is usually different, although they might have the same elements. Sometimes, it depends on the company\u2019s culture \u2014 fun or reserved, or the functional and aesthetic needs of the organisation.\u201d\n\nThe founder believes that the most challenging project in the past six months was creating uLesson\u2019s Abuja office with less than two months given for the design and implementation.\n\n\u201cWe did deliver it within two months. So, it was challenging to make sure that happened because of the size of the project, which is 1,000 square metres, and there were so many unique pieces.\u201d\n\nCost depends on a client\u2019s budget; however, quality is not compromised in the process. Bamgbelu is often encouraged because customers are satisfied that the projects are completed without them needing to step in after the initial discussions. And this makes the startup have repeat clients seeking a redesign or who\u2019ve either moved offices or opened new ones.\n\nIf anything, this has helped the company grow. Before 2019, the startup experienced a 50-70% revenue growth. Between 2019 and 2020, the revenue increased by 150% while working towards an equally successful 2021.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nIn a space with other interior designing businesses like Space Finish, the founder believes Spazio Ideale stands out as it doesn\u2019t set out just to make a space look good.\n\nBesides excellent execution, there is conceptualising and designing. The team comes up with unique designs that blend perfectly into the client\u2019s company structure and aid proper communication and interaction while creating an unforgettable impression on visitors.\n\nTo explain Spazio Ideale\u2019s competitive edge, Bamgbelu speaks of how Spazio Ideale got the job to design Paystack\u2019s first office in 2016, a year after the payments company launched in 2015.\n\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.\n\n\u201cWhat you usually expect in a reception is to see the company logo, lights, probably made of acrylic or glass. Understanding Paystack\u2019s culture, we saw that these guys aren\u2019t rigid. So, their first point of contact, as people enter into the reception, should reflect them. And that is why we came up with that \u2018Welcome\u2019 wall where we wrote welcome in different languages.\u201d\n\nPaystack \u2018Welcome Wall\u2019. Designed by Spazio Ideale\n\nThis decision would create an unforgettable story in Paystack\u2019s history and influence the decision to invite Spazio Ideale to design its second office.\n\nBamgbelu relates how the wall made some foreigners who visited the office see them as welcoming and heartwarming people because they felt at home after seeing \u2018Welcome\u2019 in their languages.\n\nDespite similar success stories, the startup has had its challenges, many of which are peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nBamgbelu looks forward to a time when electricity and Internet, inflation, and talent development will no longer be a clog in the wheel of creative businesses seeking to remain competitive.\n\nOther problems that come with playing in the creative industry \u201cinclude access to good quality partners that help us achieve our projects. For example, it\u2019s difficult to access very good artisans and workmen. And because we pride ourselves on excellence, we sometimes have to redo things until they are right. But regardless of all these, we\u2019re clear on what we want to deliver to our clients.\u201d\n\nChanging seasons and what the future\u2019s like\n\nWhen campaigns for social distancing and working from home (WFH) became pronounced at the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 \u2014 with the idea of having a physical office often debated \u2014 Spazio Ideale had a relatively good run, although it lost a few clients.\n\nBamgbelu reiterated how the startup experienced a 150% revenue growth. One wonders what was there to do during a lockdown and office closures.\n\n\u201cAll the time we were working from home, we had designs to churn out. And the design phase takes time,\u201d she clarifies.\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nEssentially, interior designing is a highly creative business that is yet to be fully appreciated in this part of the world because of how little people know about its influence on living and working.\n\nBamgbelu explains it this way.\n\n\u201cOrganisations provide tools, and people tend to have tools that make them productive. The space where people work is a tool to make sure the organisation achieves its objectives. So, if the staff is happy with the space, it helps them make profit.\u201d\n\nHence, she recommends educating people and organisations to see its importance. Still, only interested people approach interior designers for consultation or design and execution.\n\nBamgbelu states that the concept of remote work does not threaten the growth of the business, especially in Nigeria, pointing out that the particular challenges associated with WFH \u2014 electricity and Internet \u2014 would only encourage companies to run a hybrid model.\n\nInterestingly, Spazio Ideale\u2019s client base is still made up of mostly commercial spaces.\n\n\u201cThe truth is organisations want to get their spaces up and running. Everybody is thinking past COVID-19. Yes, there\u2019s the work from home strategy, which we recommend. But we believe the office is not going away,\u201d she submits.\n\nThe startup plans to reach more African and international markets by Q4 2021. Even though there\u2019ve been projects from foreign organisations with offices in Nigeria, getting jobs from these companies for their offices outside Nigeria would be a major step forward.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",
          "summary": "The acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers.\nSpazio Ideale team.\nThat\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201dBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new appointment\n\nVerifyMe\u2019s VeriFind launch\n\nMobile app downloads skyrocket\n\nFlutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer, Oluwabankole Falade. Source: Supplied.\n\nThe story: Nigerian fintech unicorn, Flutterwave, has announced Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. The University of Ibadan alumnus brings 18 years of experience in law, regulatory affairs, and government relations.\n\nBefore his appointment, he was the Director, Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations at IHS Towers. He has also held key leadership roles at MTN and Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this important? The fintech space where Flutterwave operates is one of the most regulated sectors of Nigeria\u2019s tech industry. In the past, government policies have affected their operations, and Falade\u2019s appointment would go a long way to strengthen the relationship between the startup and the government.\n\nSetting the pace? With the Nigerian government frequently springing policy surprises on startups, we could see similar appointments to anticipate them and engage proactively with the government.\n\nFor more context: Flutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nVerifyMe launches VeriFind\n\nEsigie Aguele, CEO, VerifyMe. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to fill out a form when opening a bank account, then you\u2019ve provided your home address. Like me, you may have wondered why they bothered since they probably never verified the address.\n\nWell, VerifyMe Nigeria, an identity verification startup, wants to change that with its geotagging solution, VeriFind. Backed by a network of 13,000 agents across the country, the product is also Anti-Money Laundering Compliant.\n\nAccording to Esigie Aguele, Co-founder and CEO of VerifyMe, \u201cMany organisations see the address verification component of KYC as a chore and the 24 to 48 hour wait period for traditional processing is simply unsuitable to the demands of today\u2019s fast-paced businesses.\u201d\n\nVeriFind was not the only product that VerifyMe unveiled as they also revealed a Nigerian Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN) verification service and a Facial Liveness Tool.\n\nWith the Facial Liveness Tool, the startup will draw on national databases such as the National Identification Number and driver\u2019s license to authenticate identities. At the same time, the NUBAN verification service will allow for the verification of financial transactions by cross-referencing datasets such as account name, mobile number, and gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentity verification in Nigeria remains a problem for businesses and individuals. Because of the stress involved in obtaining official identities, many Nigerians only bother with getting official identity documents when they need them.\n\nSince registration for the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) began in 2012, the body reports that it has registered 54 million people, which is a long way off from Nigeria\u2019s population of 200 million. With the government not capturing enough citizens, private companies have stepped up to bridge the gap.\n\nFor businesses, especially eCommerce businesses, finding locations is difficult, and this means that delivery is rarely done in rural areas.\n\nThis is not the first attempt to solve the location problem in Nigeria with the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) partnering with What3words \u2014 a British startup \u2014 to extend delivery to 90% of Nigerian homes.\n\nLast year, Google launched Plus Codes to identify locations without defined addresses.\n\nHowever, unlike these solutions, VeriFind uses a combination of software and human agents to verify addresses.\n\nNigeria leads mobile app downloads in Africa\n\nSmartphone user\n\nMobile app installs in Nigeria grew by 43% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, according to a report by Appflyer and Google. South Africa came second with 37%, and Kenya third with 29%.\n\nA word of caution: With the report focusing on app installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, it might not be representative of the entire continent especially when you consider that these are some of Africa\u2019s largest markets in terms of smartphone penetration.\n\nThere\u2019s probably no aspect of our lives that the coronavirus pandemic did not affect. From working arrangements to the way we shop, the pandemic changed the way we live.\n\nThe way we use our mobile phones were also affected, as this report shows. Tracking data from 6,000 apps and 2 billion installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, the report indicates that installs increased by 41% across the three countries.\n\nWith more people on their phones due to the lockdown, the report reveals that in-app advertising revenue increased significantly, with 213% in South Africa, 141% in Nigeria, and 74% in Kenya.\n\nIn terms of in-app purchasing revenue, Q3 2020 saw the biggest increase resulting in 33% of 2020\u2019s in-app purchasing revenue. In-app purchasing revenue increased by 136% between July and September when compared to the previous three months.\n\nUnsurprisingly, fintech apps saw an increase in downloads, with South Africa and Nigeria seeing year-on-year growth rates of 116% and 60%, respectively.\n\nWhile the pandemic undoubtedly influenced this growth, it is unlikely that the mobile app market in these countries will experience a decline provided fintech startups continue providing excellent service. This could also accelerate the move to a cashless economy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nStop Saying You Want To Bank The Unbanked.

He enjoined the Council bosses to do same.\n\nHe also urged them to look inward and make their services count in the lives of the people in the best progressive ideals that the party is known for.\n\nWhile congratulating them on their new attainments, Oyetola disclosed that their appointment was based on merit in view of their track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of the ruling party.\n\nHe also appealed to party members who did not make the final list, to put the past behind them and look forward to a brighter future in their quest to serve the people and the party, adding \u201cwe have taken note of your hard work, and I assure you, your own opportunities will come.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you all for making it thus far as this is a clear testament to your inherent leadership potential, track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of our Party.\n\n\u201cConsidering that your emergence followed a thoroughly-intense process, you should regard this invaluable opportunity as sufficiently humbling and a lifetime opportunity to not only serve our people but to also leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\n\u201cWith such defining values as humility, integrity, purposefulness, honesty, transparency, accountability and incorruptibility, you should hit the ground running and ensure that you deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to our teeming citizens.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the local government institution is the closest to our people. Therefore, your leadership will only be as meaningful and successful to the extent to which you run an administration that is not only truly inclusive, but also one fully committed to meeting the basic needs of our people.\n\n\u201cTo do this, it requires that you lead a united front, working closely with the bureaucracy to run an administration that listens to the deepest yearnings of the people and actively seeking constructive feedbacks that will aid the governance process.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that since our assumption of office, we have run an Administration that is transparent, inclusive, purposeful and absolutely pro-people. This is because ours is an Administration driven by the philosophy that governance is only meaningful to the extent that it serves the needs of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Adebayo Adeleke, lauded Governor Oyetola for appointing men and women of impeccable character to take up the mantle of leadership in all the Local Government Areas of the State.\n\nHe tasked them on dedication, loyalty and service, saying it is a thing of joy that 69 capable persons had been appointed as chairmen to head the helms of affairs at various Councils across the State.\n\nAdeleke added: \u201cToday is special because Mr. Governor was able to bring out 69 out of millions of people of the State to serve. The assignment is that you need to do proper reconciliation in your respective Local Government Areas. You will be assessed based on your ability to resolve contending matters, you must not raise imbroglio.\n\n\u201cYou must mobilise Osun citizens for the ongoing registration exercise for Permanent Voters\u2019 Card. Don\u2019t disappoint Mr Governor. Welfare and security of your people must be your priority. Don\u2019t use it to enrich yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Acting Chairman, Osun Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, urged the newly-sworn-in chairmen to take charge of their councils by being dedicated and committed to good governance.\n\nHe urged them to champion loyalty, dedication, commitment and selfless service to humanity, saying anything short of that will amount to collosal loss.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, one of the newly-sworn-in chairmen, Hon. Samuel Abiodun Idowu, hailed the Governor for counting them worthy to serve their people just as he promised their commitment to deliver.\n\nHe said \u201cI want to appreciate Mr. Governor for counting us worthy for this appointment and I promise that we will work as a team and deliver to your satisfaction.\u201d",

Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, cannot decide where the next governor of the state will come from in 2023.\n\nOkocha, who was Chief of Staff, Government House, Port Harcourt, made the declaration while speaking at the inauguration of the Obio/Akpor local government area chapter of a political pressure group, the Rivers Voice of Freedom (RVF).\n\nThe APC chieftain stated that it was not the responsibility of any individual to zone the governorship position of the state to any zone of region.\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, he spoke his mind; he didn\u2019t speak the mind of the party. I don\u2019t think he spoke for the APC. He spoke as an individual.\n\n\u201cJust like the Southern Governors that want the Presidency to come to the South and people from the North are kicking against it. That is the Honourable Minister\u2019s opinion. It has nothing to do with Rivers people.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, RVF President, Comrade Dominic Dumekpigi, said the group has began moves to ensure that more youths participate in elections in Rivers State, ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nDumekpigi said: \u201cAs a grassroot mobilization group, we owe ourselves the truth and the truth is to ensure we continue to defend what is just in a bid to enhance peaceful coexistence as members of the same family.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, RVF came up after the 2019 general election, having seen our chances and chances of our political leaders who share same vision of playing politics without bitterness and acrimony.\u201d",

Isolated cases of robbery in traffic have also been tackled.\n\n\u201cThe perennial gridlock in the city is attributable to numerous road rehabilitations that are simultaneously going on in almost all parts of the city.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this on robbery in traffic is being adequately taken care of by the command The tactical teams and other science-based units of the Command have put their resources together to reduce these menaces to their barest minimum in Lagos State, since no society is absolutely free of crimes,\u201d he said.\n\nOdumosu added that due to the general appraisal of security of the state and robust intelligence gathering, the Command has embarked on constant raid of flash points, where miscreants who terrorise innocent people of Lagos State, especially attacking them in traffic, hibernate across the state.\n\nAccording to him, the idea was to be proactive and take the fight against crimes and criminality to their dens, disclosing that the Command, is parading 1,320 miscreants/hoodlums who were raided at various locations across the state and that many dangerous weapons, suspected hard drugs and weeds suspected to be Indian hemp were recovered from them.\n\n\u201cThe Command wishes to reiterate its determination and commitment to harness all available means of reducing crimes and social vices in Lagos State as required of the Police,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "I May Die In DSS Custody Over \u2018Worsening\u2019 Health Issues \u2013 Nnamdi Kanu",
          "text": "Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) and director of Radio Biafra, has sued the Nigerian government over his ongoing confinement at the Department of State Services\u2019 national headquarters.\n\nThe IPOB leader was apprehended in Kenya in June and extradited to Nigeria on treason charges.\n\nHe was then charged and taken before Binta Nyako, a Federal High Court judge in Abuja, who requested that he be remanded in the DSS custody.\n\nIn reaction to his agitation for the Republic of Biafra, Kanu is facing accusations bordering on treasonable felony brought against him in court.\n\nIn April 2017, he was granted release on medical grounds, although he failed to comply with some of the court\u2019s terms.\n\nHowever, in a suit filed in Abuja\u2019s Federal High Court by his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the IPOB leader prayed for a court order \u201cdirecting the transfer of the Applicant from the custody of the National Headquarters of the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, where he was initially detained before the commencement of this Honourable Court, where he was initially detained before the\n\n\u201cAn order of this Honourable Court requiring the Defendant/custodian Applicant\u2019s to provide access to his medical experts/doctors to conduct out a full independent medical evaluation of the defendant/health applicant\u2019s condition/status, while in custody,\u201d his lawyer added.\n\nKanu further stated that if his health problem is not addressed quickly, he may die.\n\nRead the text of the charges below:\n\n\u201cThat this charge NO. FHC/ABJ/CR/383/2015 came up on 29th June 2021 and the Applicant was brought before the Court in Chains, handcuffs and leg-cuffs, blindfolded, and was consequently remanded in the custody of the State Security Service, even though there was no legal representation for the Defendant, and the matter was therefore adjourned to the 26th day of July 2021 for trial.\n\n\u201cThat the Counsel to the Applicant was not served with any hearing notice before the appearance of the applicant in Court, neither were they aware that any action was scheduled to take place in the criminal charge NO. FCH/ABJ/CR/383/2015 on that 29th June 2021.\n\n\u201cThat on 30th June 2021, the Applicant\u2019s Solicitors formally wrote to the State Security Service to allow the Applicant solicitors have access to the Applicant. A copy of the said letter is hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK 1. That on 2nd July 2021, at about 12:32pm, the State Security Service called me to inform me that our request to visit the Applicant has been approved and that I should come by 4:00 pm to see Defendant.\n\n\u201cThat on the said 2nd July 2021 at about 5:00pm, at the State Security Headquarters, in Abuja, the Applicant informed me of the following facts which I verily believed to be accurate and correct as follows; That he was kidnapped and/or abducted by Kenyan Security Forces on 19th June 2021, specifically at Nairobi Airport.\n\n\u201cThat he was detained by the personnel of the Kenyan Police Force for eight days, and was throughout this period of detention subjected to all forms of inhuman treatment, brutal torture, causing grave and severe heart problem that almost took his life. That he was detained in an unconventional facility, not necessarily a police detention center in Kenya.\n\n\u201cThat throughout this detention in Kenya, he was never allowed access to his relatives before he was handed over to their Nigerian Security counterparts who smuggled him into Nigeria in clear violation of his rights. That since he was smuggled into this country on 27th June 2021, he has been kept in solitary confinement without access to his family members, relatives, wife, cousins, and children, except his lawyer, who only visits after they must secure the approval and endorsement of the Director-General of the State Security Service, which approval are not usually granted as a matter of course.\n\n\u201cThat he is still being subjected to mental and psychological torture by his custodians, on account of the conditions of his solitary confinement. That an ECG examination was carried out on the Defendant, and it was discovered that the Defendant\u2019s heart had been enlarged by more than 13%, posing a serious threat and danger to Defendant\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThat there is a need for the Defendant to have access to his Medical Doctors to avert the danger looming against the life of the Defendant. That the health personnel attending to the Defendant in the custody of the State Security Service is not adequate considering the circumstances of the Defendant\u2019s health condition.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant requires the services of his medical experts as his medical records issued by the Chief Cardiologist of Nairobi Hospital who has the Defendant\u2019s medical records, mainly, before the arrest/abduction of the Applicant shows a debilitating medical condition. Copies of these medical records showing the Applicant\u2019s subsisting health condition are hereby attached and marked as Exhibit MNK.\n\n\u201cThat if the health condition of the Defendant is not addressed most promptly, the Defendant may die in custody, even before his trial. It is essential that the Defendant\u2019s Medical Experts/Consultants be allowed to carry out proper, thorough, and independent medical examinations of the Defendant to save the Defendant\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant needs regular medical observation/attention by the Defendant\u2019s Medical specialists/Consultants in Cardiology. That the Defendant\u2019s Medical Specialists (including the Chief Cardiologist of Nairobi Hospital) in Kenya have his complete medical records that will easily aid the examination of the Defendant and treatment thereof.\n\n\u201cThat the Defendant undertakes to bear any cost incidental to getting the medical experts to attend to his ill health while in custody. The defendant can only be alive to stand his trial, which cannot be guaranteed because of his rapidly deteriorating health situation.\n\n\u201cThe Defendant cannot effectively put up a defense to the charge against him, in his present deteriorating health condition. That I know that upon the arraignment of the Applicant, this Honourable Court in its wisdom initially remanded the Applicant in Kuje Correctional Service Centre, where he was held for almost two years before bail was consequently granted to the Applicant.\n\n\u201cThat for the almost two years the Applicant was in custody in Kuje Correctional Facility, there was never any complaint about any form of misconduct against him. That the State Security Service is not a detention Centre, neither does it have the requisite custodial facilities to enhance the conditions of the occupants/inmates.\n\n\u201cThat the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre is an impartial facility that has no interest whatsoever in the outcome of this charge. That the Nigerian Correctional Service Center is the only body statutorily empowered to keep custody of persons facing criminal trial in courts, hence, the necessity to transfer the Applicant to the Nigerian Correctional Service Center Kuje.\n\n\u201cThat it will serve the interest of Justice and enhance fair hearing for this Honourable Court to transfer the Applicant from the State Security Service to the Nigerian Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cThat the Applicant has very limited access to his lawyers, who can only visit him after the approval of the Director of the State Security Services has been first sought and obtained, which said approval in most cases, takes days and that the above situation would greatly impede the Defendant\u2019s preparation for his defense to the charge against him.\n\n\u201cThat the favorable consideration of this application is compelling in the circumstance of the present Notice for the resumption of the Court\u2019s Annual vacation, which would affect the hearing on the substantive charge already slated for the 26th Day of July 2021. That fair hearing can only be guaranteed when the Applicant is not remanded in the custody of his accusers.\n\n\u201cThat it is a fact that Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. That it will greatly aid and serve the interest of Justice if this application is granted. That the respondent will not be prejudiced by the grant of this application. That I depose to this affidavit in good faith believing same to be true and correct and in accordance with the oath Act.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the case.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has rejected accusations that its airstrikes killed a woman and four kids in Zamfara State.\n\nMultiple media sources indicated that an aircraft belonging to the Nigerian Air Force was targeting criminals at the wide Sububu Forest located between Shinkafi and Maradun Local Governments in the state when the wife and the four kids were slain on Monday, July 12.\n\nDenying the report, the director of Public Relations and Information, NAF, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said nothing of such transpired. According to him, such can only happen if those killed were staying with the bandits in the forest. The spokesman stated the airstrikes were done in Sububu forest and nowhere close to any village and asked why such charges will surface.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen, Gabkwet remarked;\n\n\u201cGood morning all. I feel its important I address this report. I just got off the phone with Alhaji Mohammad Ibrahim, the Director of Security, Ministry of Internal Security, Zamfara State who confirmed the happiness of the State Government over the precise nature of the strike by NAF jet.\n\nI am also aware that the State Governor has called our Commanders on ground to commend the NAF.\n\nA local contractor in the general area also confirmed the attack and its devastating effect on the bandits. Till now, the remnants of the bandits are evacuating and departing from the Sububu Forest general area.\n\nNow, the strike was in Sububu Forest and not anywhere close to any village. So stories of NAF hitting any target outside the Forest is false. Secondly, on the issue of accidental kills, I find it hard to believe except if those accidentally killed were residing in the forest. I can only continue to probe further.\u201d",

My experience with the police has been very bad since they see cases reported to them as opportunities to make wealth from them.\n\nI thank God for the success made so far, knowing how difficult and expensive it is to get justice in this country. Recently, I was at the Force Headquarters in Abuja in respect to my complaint against one Sergeant Iorember Ade who, towards the end of 2016, assaulted my sister, Queen, an assault that led to her death. This same issue was reported to the National Human Rights Commission\u2019s office in Abuja, but nothing reasonable was done to ensure that justice is served.\n\nWhile at the Force Headquarters, the IPO handling my sister\u2019s case, who refused to disclose his real name to me, maintained that I will be addressing him as IK, had a serious argument with his colleagues on who should handle my case. One among the police officers complained he has not been getting money aside from his salary, and that he won\u2019t continue to allow IK to take over cases that come to their unit. I was shocked that they could not even mind my presence.\n\nThe argument lasted for almost an hour before I was attended to by Mr. IK. While attending to me, IK made some funny requests that I would pay for the hotel accommodation for two Police Officers who would be going to Makurdi, Benue State capital to investigate my case since the incident took place there. He also demanded that I would pay for their transport fare and their feeding. Thereafter, he asked me how much I thought I could give to cover all he mentioned. I was not surprised because I knew he saw my case as an opportunity for him to make money and supplement his salary. I told him I didn\u2019t have money, and that was the end of my case. I have not heard from the police since then.\n\nI reported this attitude to the National Human Rights Commission in Abuja official who claimed to be following my case to ensure I get justice but as usual, nothing was done till now. My questions are these: how can we progress in this country with the kind of police we have? How can we get things done with the kind of government agencies that are not functioning? Human Rights exist only by name, and so other agencies of government because they are not doing anything reasonable, they collect money from the government. Sometimes in a day, I get not less than 10 calls from people in different parts of the country, reporting issues to me after reading my publications in the newspapers on similar issues that have been their problems.\n\nIf these agencies of government are working, can people be calling an ordinary person to report cases to him? A staff of FCMB came to me to assist recover his money from a Police Inspector after the police officer claimed they don\u2019t know the whereabouts of the Inspector, and they won\u2019t be able to follow him up and recover the money from him. The telephone number of the Inspector and other details about him were provided, yet, police did not know how to follow up on this case. I eventually collected the telephone number of the officer in question and spoke with him. Within Two weeks, he paid the money (N50,000) in question to the staff of FCMB, Mr. Mathew Nyoir.",

          "text": "A court filing has revealed that Britney Spears\u2019 request to remove her father from his role of overseeing her conservatorship has been denied by a US judge The singer\u2019s lawyer, Samuel Ingham, asked a court in Los Angeles to oust Jamie Spears from his position managing the multimillion-dollar estate. When calling for Mr. Spears to be removed in November last year, Mr. Ingham said Ms. Spears, 39, was scared of her father and wanted him gone from the conservatorship that has controlled her life since 2008.\n\nIn court filings, Ms. Spears said she wanted private wealth management firm the Bessemer Trust appointed as \u201csole conservator\u201d. However, documents filed in Los Angeles show Judge Brenda Penny refused the request while rubberstamping Bessemer Trust\u2019s role as co-conservator of the estate. The legal document states: \u201cThe conservatee\u2019s request to suspend James P Spears immediately upon the appointment of Bessemer Trust Company Of California, N.A. as sole conservator of the estate is denied without prejudice.\u201d The filing was dated June 30 \u2013 a week after the pop superstar delivered dramatic testimony calling for the end of the conservatorship.\n\nShe was placed under the complex legal arrangement \u2013 usually reserved for the very old and infirm \u2013 after suffering a series of mental breakdowns. Ms. Spears told a court on June 23 the conservatorship was \u201cabusive\u201d and she wanted it to end without the need for a medical assessment. The mother-of-two said she was required to use a contraceptive device and was barred from marrying boyfriend Sam Asghari. Earlier, Mr. Spears, 68, filed court documents of his own, denying he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter\u2019s private life.\n\nHe has overseen her estate for 13 years but has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health. Mr. Spears was replaced as conservator of Ms. Spears\u2019s person on a temporary basis by Jodi Montgomery, the singer\u2019s caregiver. In a court filing, lawyers for Mr. Spears said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by Mr. Ingham\u2019s request to make Ms. Montgomery\u2019s position permanent.

          "text": "The management of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) has ordered students to vacate hostels on campus over fears of COVID-19.\n\nThere were fears in the university community on Tuesday after a number of students contracted the disease. The development led the school management to convey an emergency Senate meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement issued after the meeting, the Senate said the students who tested positive for the disease, are being treated, and contact tracing already in place.\n\n\u201cThe situation is, indeed, worrisome especially noting the reluctance of the\n\nmajority of students to comply with the COV1D-19 prevention protocols,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cTo avoid the escalation of cases on campus, the University Senate at an\n\nemergency meeting held on Wednesday, 14th of July 2021 approved that all\n\nstudents vacate the halls of residence by 12.00 pm on Thursday inde\ufb01nitely.\n\nLectures for the rest of the semester will continue to be delivered virtually\n\nwith effect from 26th July 2021.\u201d\n\nSources within the school equally confirmed receiving a Whatsapp broadcast message from the Dean of Students Affairs (DSA) informing them to leave the school\u2019s hostels.\n\n\u201cLectures for the rest of the semester will be delivered virtually with effect from 26th July 2021,\u201d the message added.\n\nBefore now, UNILAG\u2019s management had raised the alarm over \u201cflu-like symptoms which are similar to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe Medical Centre hereby assures all members of the university community, that all necessary actions in line with the federal and Lagos State Government guidelines have been taken regarding this potential threat in our community.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Indonesia Imports Oxygen As COVID-19 Batters Hospitals\n\nREAD ALSO: Global COVID-19 Deaths Cross Four Million As Outbreaks Surge In Asia\n\nProtocols Abandoned As Cases Soar\n\nCOVID-19 cases have continued to soar in Nigeria amid concerns over the resurgence of a third wave of the disease.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the agency spearheading the fight against the pandemic said 154 more infections were confirmed in the country.\n\nLagos State which was the epicentre of infections during the first and second waves of the disease continues to record a higher number of cases amid concerns by the State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nOf the number of confirmed infections for the day under review, Lagos State had 119 new cases, while Akwa Ibom followed with 11 more persons contracting the disease.\n\nSix more states recorded new cases.

          "text": "Lionel Messi and Barcelona have reached an agreement for the forward to sign a new five-year deal with the Catalan club, with star accepting a significant wage reduction to prolong his stay, ESPN reports.\n\nMessi was a free agent after his contract at Barca expired and he had courted interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City since first revealing a desire to end his 20-year relationship with Barca last summer. The 34-year-old\u2019s previous contract was worth over \u20ac500 million over four years and that expired at the stroke of midnight on June 30.\n\nHowever, with the return of Joan Laporta as president in March, Messi grew more open to staying at Camp Nou. An official announcement is expected in the coming days.\n\nLaporta had hoped to finalise an agreement before Messi\u2019s previous terms expired. Barca\u2019s financial problems made that impossible, though, with their gross debt over \u20ac1 billion. Cutbacks have been essential, in terms of transferring players out, reducing the wage bill and getting Messi to accept a lower salary.\n\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas had warned Barca they would not be allowed to register Messi\u2019s new deal if they were unable to reduce spending to comply with the league\u2019s financial fair play rules. Barca\u2019s spending limit has been reduced from over \u20ac600m to \u20ac347m since the coronavirus pandemic, with further reductions expected to be imposed for the upcoming season.\n\nMessi is on holiday with his family following his Copa America glory with Argentina last weekend, which was his first senior trophy with his national team.\n\nHe will link up with Ronald Koeman\u2019s squad later in the summer, with Barca\u2019s league campaign kicking off on August 15 against Real Sociedad at Camp Nou.\n\nMessi had first expressed a desire to leave Barca last August after the 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. His relationship with then-president Josep Maria Bartomeu had reached a breaking point. In a September 2020 interview with Goal, after Barca had blocked his departure, Messi called Bartomeu a \u201cliar\u201d and said the board had been \u201cmaking things up as they go along\u201d and \u201cplugging holes\u201d for years.\n\nBartomeu, facing a vote of no confidence, resigned last October and was eventually replaced by Laporta in March. Laporta has a good relationship with Messi and his family. He was Barca\u2019s president when Messi made his first-team debut and when he signed his first professional contract with the club.\n\nThe report claims that Laporta was working on a contract renewal for Messi in April that included the option of playing in Major League Soccer before returning to Barcelona.\n\nIn public and in private, Laporta had always maintained that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d he could persuade Messi to stay. The club have already made a series of signings this summer, bringing in Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia, as well as recalling Emerson Royal.\n\nMessi first joined Barca\u2019s academy in 2000 and has gone on to play 778 games for the club, breaking Xavi Hernandez\u2019s appearance record last season. He has scored 672 goals, another club record, and has helped Barca win, among other trophies, 10 La Liga titles and the Champions League on four occasions.",

          "text": "Nigerian grammy award winning Burna Boy alongside Ed Sheeran will lead a group of artistes to perform at the Global Citizen live concert aimed at uniting the world, defending the planet and defeating poverty.\n\nGlobal Citizen, an International advocacy organization in a statement on Wednesday said the event will be a 24-hour Live broadcast with events and performances filmed across six continents and will air on several networks and as well stream on several social media platforms.\n\nOther top artistes and entertainers expected to perform at the September 25 event are Davido, Femi Kuti, Tiwa Savage appearing alongside Adam Lambert, Doja Cat, Coldplay, Usher, H.E.R., Angelique Kidjo, Andrea Bocelli, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, DJ Snake, Duran Duran, Lizzo, Lorde, Ricky Martin, The Weeknd, and more to be announced.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is powered by citizens around the world who are taking action together with governments, corporations and philanthropists to make change.\n\nThe campaign calls on businesses and philanthropists to contribute resources needed to protect and restore at least 1 billion trees by 2022 to curb climate change; and provide meals for the more than 40 million people on the brink of starvation.\n\nThe 24-hour live broadcast event will feature artists, activists, and world leaders taking the stage at iconic locations across the globe, including: live events in Central Park in New York City, and the Champ de Mars in Paris; live-crosses from London, and Los Angeles; and performances and hosted segments from Lagos, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Sydney. Additional locations and location-specific details will be announced in August.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has drastically reversed the progress toward achieving the United Nations Global Goals, pushing upwards of 160 million people back into extreme poverty and more than 40 million to the brink of starvation. Progress on climate change has halted, as the majority of the Fortune 500 fail to set science-based carbon reduction targets. We must rectify the damage done and hold world leaders accountable for ensuring that the entire world recovers from this pandemic together. \u2018Equitable recovery\u2019 is not an act of charity \u2013 it is the only way we can ensure a fighting chance at achieving a sustainable world free from extreme poverty.\u201d \u2013 Hugh Evans, CEO, Global Citizen said in a press release.\n\nThe release also quoted Nigeria\u2019s minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama as saying, \u201cAs we humans spend billions of dollars in search of newer worlds in outer space, Global Citizen Live brings us back down to earth by reminding the global community that charity should begin at home and we must preserve our earth and be our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers. We owe it to ourselves and generations yet unborn. Space can wait!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very excited to perform at the Global Citizen Live concert this year. The timing for this call for unity couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said Angelique Kidjo. \u201cThere is an urgent need for us to work together across the globe and take action to protect our planet. Mother nature has a way of warning us. We need each other now,\u201d Angelique Kidjo said.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live and the organization\u2019s Recovery Plan for the World are supported by a coalition of many of the world\u2019s leading corporations including its Global Partners: Accenture, Cisco, Citi, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G, Verizon, and campaign partner WW International, who will work together to engage support from the 8private sector in driving new commitments toward the campaign\u2019s policy objectives. Access Bank, will also support the Global Citizen Live campaign as a partner in Nigeria.\n\nFor the past decade, Global Citizen has championed the most pressing social and environmental issues and joined the fight to end COVID-19, most recently with VAX Live: The Concert To Reunite The World in May, which mobilized more than 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and $302 million to the ACT-Accelerator for equitable health access to countries most in need.\n\nSince March 2020, Global Citizen has mobilized $2 billion in cash grants to fund global pandemic relief efforts, and over 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Pope Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital and returned home to the Vatican on Wednesday, 10 days after undergoing surgery to remove half his colon.\n\nFrancis, 84, sat in the passenger seat of the Ford car, which left Rome\u2019s Gemelli Polyclinic around 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT; 4:45 a.m. EDT). He made a stop to pray at Rome\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, which has a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary which Francis always visits after returning home from a foreign trip.\n\nAfter the brief stop, Francis\u2019 small motorcade approached a side entrance to the Vatican. The Ford stopped before reaching the gate and Francis got out with the help of a bodyguard. He greeted some Italian security guards \u2014 two army soldiers standing guard and a handful of Italian police motorcycle escorts \u2014 and got back in the car, which then entered the Vatican through the Perugino gate.\n\nFrancis had half of his colon removed for a severe narrowing of his large intestine on July 4, his first major surgery since he became pope in 2013. It was a planned procedure, scheduled for early July when the pope\u2019s audiences are suspended anyway and Francis would normally take some time off.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, confirmed Francis\u2019 return from the hospital and visit to the Rome basilica. Praying before the icon, Francis \u201cexpressed his gratitude for the success of his surgery and offered a prayer for all the sick, especially those he had met during his stay in hospital,\u201d Bruni said in the statement.\n\nFrancis will have several more weeks to recover before beginning to travel again in September. There are plans for him to visit Hungary and Slovakia in a Sept. 12-15 trip, and then make a quick stop in Glasgow, Scotland, in November to participate in the COP26 climate conference. Other possible trips are also under review.\n\nThe Vatican had originally said Francis could be discharged last weekend, but later said he would stay a few days extra for further recovery and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nThe pope appeared for the first time in public since the surgery on Sunday, looking in good form as he delivered his weekly prayer from the 10th floor hospital balcony, surrounded by young cancer patients. He used the occasion to call for free health care for all.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the eve of his release, he visited the pediatric cancer ward, which is located on the same floor as the papal hospital suite.\n\nThe Argentine pope had part of one lung removed when he was a young man but has otherwise enjoyed relatively robust health.",
