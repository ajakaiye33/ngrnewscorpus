          "text": "Gbenga Adeniji and Percy Ani feel the pulse of families of heroes of democracy as Nigeria records 22 years of civil rule\n\nNigeria\u2019s return to democratic rule in 1999 was not attained on a silver platter. Many democrats and progressives endured piercing jackboots of despotic military juntas to the detriment of their lives and family safety.\n\nThe military dubiously hinged its incursion into politics on a duty to reverse what it termed the corrupt antics of civilians. But it pathetically ended up like a physician who left an ailment worse than he met it. It exhibited intense anti-democratic acts.\n\nThe dark days of the military in the country\u2019s political space was challenged by the finest of Nigeria\u2019s heroes who gave their all for a better Nigeria. They ranged from lawyers, journalists, politicians, labour leaders, activists to academicians among others. The despots dangled three dangerous options before the enigmatic heroes for daring to seek a better deal for the country. They were to choose from exile, prison or grave. While some lost their lives to the struggle for a new Nigeria, others are alive to tell tales of the excruciating moments.\n\nSome of the heroes of the democratic struggle included the late Chief MKO Abiola, acclaimed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election and his late wife, Kudirat Abiola, Nobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, Chief Frank Kokori, who served as the secretary-general of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers during the period, Colonel Abubakar Umar (retd), who also opposed the annulment despite serving under the military dictator, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who annulled the election dubbed the freest and fairest in the country\u2019s electoral space, the late Chief Gani Fawehimi, a dogged lawyer, Beko Ransome-Kuti, a human rights defender, National Democratic Coalition chieftain, Chief Ayo Opadokun, and one of Nigeria\u2019s distinguished journalists and ex-governor of Ogun State, Chief Olusegun Osoba.\n\nOther remarkable individuals who were also in the trenches were the late Pa Alfred Rewane, a NADECO financier in the post-June 12 struggle, a former president of the Nigerian Bar Association, Alao Aka-Basorun, the late Pa Abraham Adesanya, who was leader of the Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, the late Dr. Tunji Braithwaite, a lawyer, activist and politician, the late Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu (retd.), who was a NADECO leader, the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, Bolaji Akinyemi, Olisa Agbakoba, Shehu Sani, Yinka and Joe-Oke-Odumakin, Femi Falana, Debo Adeniran, Pa Anthony Enahoro, Dele Momodu, Chima Ubani, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa and James Bagauda-Kaltho among numerous others.\n\nSome of the family members of the dead heroes who spoke with Saturday PUNCH noted that the country was still sadly entangled in difficulties despite 22 years of democracy and sacrifices of their loved ones for a better and just Nigeria.\n\n22 years of civil rule\n\nThe first child of the late Chief Abraham Adesanya, Mr Adebayo Adesanya, said the current democratic experience wasn\u2019t what his father fought for.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe can\u2019t even call this democracy because devolution of power is missing across the states. The states should be able to control their resources and pay something like royalties to the Federal Government. The Federal Government is currently encumbered with many things. In fact, most of the things it takes unto itself should be for the states and local governments. There ought to be state police. Imagine posting a police officer from the North to be a Divisional Police Officer in Lagos for example. If there is a crisis in an area, it will take time for him to know the dimensions and terrains of the issues in that area. But if it\u2019s through state police, the men would have been familiar with the area and tackle any threats that arise. Each state should control their resources.\u201d\n\nThe septuagenarian noted that when he was younger he usually envisioned the height the Western Region would attain considering the developmental strides of the late Premier of the region, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe late Chief Obafemi Awolowo was prudent and cerebral. If states are not granted what they deserved through federalism, issues affecting the country will not abate.\u201d\n\nHe noted that restructuring was a way to have a workable country and solution to the challenges confronting it.\n\n\u201cWe must all come together and decide how to restructure the country. We have to restructure Nigeria. That\u2019s the only way,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn her part, Mrs Martha Bagauda-Kaltho, said the 22 years of democracy in the country had not in any way deepened her husband\u2019s dream for the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe present democracy is not what my husband fought and died for. The country my husband and his group were pushing for was a thriving country where true democracy will prevail and will be peaceful and secure for all. Instead what we have now is a country where we all live in fear \u2013 fear to go about our daily lives and fear to speak up concerning the wrongs in our society.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe added that nowhere was safe in the country insurgency, robbery, kidnapping and banditry had taken over everywhere in the country including villages.\n\nBagauda-Kaltho stated, \u201c\u201dEven the villages are not spared of the horrible development. Kidnapping is now an epidemic in Nigeria. There\u2019s no value for life anymore. My husband and others fought and desired a peaceful and just Nigeria where individuals and their ideals can live and thrive without fear.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe said if the dead could return to behold what the country they died for had become, they would weep. The woman said, \u201cThey would feel bad that they died for the country in vain. What we currently practise in Nigeria is not democracy. It should be given another name.\u201d\n\nShe further said the economic situation in the country was terrible, adding that most families were unable to afford three meals daily.\n\n\u201c\u201dThey have to skip certain meals to get by. Nobody wants this. It is not a sign of a country with a healthy democracy,\u2019\u2019 she noted.\n\nShe said the elite on the other hand were only fighting for themselves and focussed on how to further enrich themselves.\n\nBagauda-Kaltho said, \u201cWhat they do not realise is that the insecurity and type of democracy in the country will eventually get to them one day. No one is exempt from it.\u201d\n\nNoting that it would be hard to attain the ideal democracy people like her husband died for, she stated that everyone must join hands to rebuild the country since it was some Nigerians who stunted its growth.\n\nShe stated, \u201cReligious leaders from all divides have a huge role to play. They must all advance the ideals of religious tolerance. I fondly remember my husband every day. I even dreamt of him a few days ago. There\u2019s no time I do not think of him. Unless I am no more, I will always think fondly of him. He is a part of me.\u201d\n\nThe late Kanu\u2019s first child, Simone Nenna Abiona, said the current democracy didn\u2019t imbibe her father\u2019s aspirations for Nigeria.\n\nAbiona said,\u201dFrom my perspective, I don\u2019t think so. He expected and hoped for a more unified Nigeria with a more balanced sharing of power. In my opinion, he would have still been fighting for Nigeria to become a true democracy with actual representation \u2018of the people, for the people, by the people\u2019. We are still not at the point of true representation at the federal level. There is no true \u2018balance of power\u2019 where each of the groups that make up Nigeria is truly represented.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe added that she was of the opinion that her father would have liked to see better representation of all states at the federal level, equitable distribution/allocation of the tools and resources required to make Nigeria a more productive nation.\n\nShe noted, \u201cWhen everyone has a hand in building the country, there is a better chance at achieving a true democracy as everyone- or at least most people will be more interested in working on seeing that Nigeria is unified, and that the government is truly of, for, and by the people.\u2019\u2019\n\nSpeaking about Tunji Braithwaite who was a lawyer and firm believer against military oppression, his son, Olumide, said that the democratic ideals that people like his father stood for were not being represented in the country.\n\nHe said the ideals of any democracy was the constitution, adding that his father vehemently opposed the 1999 constitution because he felt it was an aberration to the freedom of the people.\n\nOlumide stated, \u201cHe felt that the constitution could not deliver true democracy because of the way it was put together by the military.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, to judge any country one only needs to examine its dividends to the people. He noted, \u201cWhat can we say are the dividends of Nigeria\u2019s democracy? All I can see is chaos and poverty. Something has drastically gone wrong with our version of democracy,\u2019\u2019\n\nOlumide stated that in any institution or government, the success or failure of an organisation was hinged primarily on the vision of the leader and the attitude of the followers.\n\nHe said, \u201cGood leadership and good followership are the ideals of a thriving and functional democracy. If you have good leadership and bad followers, there is still a lot that can be done to maintain order and even eventually harmonise the two. People are naturally drawn to leaders, especially good leaders. Unfortunately, we have never had good leaders in the country. If you look around the country, people who are not politicians may run the affairs of Nigeria better but for the fear of certain factors, they stay away. My father did not need to go into politics for its monetary rewards. He was doing fine without politics. But when you open your eyes to the sufferings of the common Nigerians, you can never close them again and that was what drove people like my father.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe explained that people deserved good leadership, noting that the country had only got self-centred and irresponsible leaders.\n\nHe said to reclaim the country, the youth were needed, adding that it was ironic that they had power but hadn\u2019t realised the power they wielded.\n\nOlumide added, \u201cThe youth are the future and if they can be better organised like what was witnessed during the #EndSARS protests, they can achieve anything. I say this all the time that the youth might not have money but they have numbers. They have youthful exuberance and intelligence. If the political parties available are not good for the youth, they can seek alternative ones. This country is too diverse to be ruled by two political parties for the last 22 years.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that his foundation had recently launched what he called Braithwaite TV to educate the youth on history and current affairs.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we teach them is how to recall a member of the House representing their constituency. There is a procedure for recalling non-performing elected representatives,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also urged Nigerians to change the values in their families, arguing that the good values were being eroded. \u201cThe fabrics of our societal morals have been eroded; we now have people who do not care how they make money. We can continue blaming leaders for as long as we want, but we have a big role to play in the achievement of an ideal society and democracy,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nIn an interview with Saturday PUNCH, Jamiu Abiola, a son of the late Chief MKO Abiola and Mrs Kudirat Abiola, said the calls for restructuring were loud, adding that what its advocates should do was to at least recognise that a form of restructuring was taking place. Jamiu said, \u201cAs you know, the Federal Government is promoting judicial and local government autonomy. To me, these are steps that should take place before a country can be ready for restructuring. With regard to the state of democracy, I think that the burning of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission has put it in danger. There is a plan to ensure that no voting takes place in certain parts of the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nCommenting on the issue, a former president of the Campaign for Democracy, Mr Mashood Erubami, said the demands of Nigerians in celebrating Democracy Day should be upgraded to call for genuine democracy and true federalism.\n\nHe stated that such fiscal federalism should authenticate control of revenues through a bottom-up approach, creation of state police and allowing states to control agriculture, health, infrastructure, education and security.\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria is dangerously moving towards the 2023 general elections, the demands for equity in the de-annulment of June 12 should interrogate the totality of its unmet expectations which reside in the denial of the inherent victories. Chief M.K.O Abiola in his vision before joining the Social Democratic Party, prepared vigorously and identified issues he believed were the bane of the country\u2019s development and was set to \u2018uplift, rebuild and restore hopes\u2019 of Nigerians with the purposes of saying \u2018farewell to poverty\u2019,\u2019\u2019 he noted.\n\nErubami further said that painfully the death of Chief M.K.O. Abiola and his wife, Alhaja Kudirat Abiola, including assassinations of many democrats who participated in the June 12 struggles were part of the irreparable losses from the annulment.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate Democracy Day, Nigerians have yet to be satisfied with what had been granted so far because the fundamental frameworks set to be achieved by June 12 in 1993 have yet to be achieved.\n\n1993 was to be a year of hope, fulfilment for the ethnic nationalities, youths, women, and every citizen, when it was planned that hunger and poverty were to be bidden farewell. Astonishingly, the hopes of Nigerians have continuously been dashed,\u2019\u2019 he stated.\n\nSaying Nigeria must be governed under true federalism with unbiased devolution of powers, fiscal federalism, with the centre thoroughly unbundled. Erubami urged Nigerians to demand for true democracy in the \u2018country where corruption shall be vigorously and non-selectively fought and defeated.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe further added, \u201cWe demand the naming of national monuments after those who lost their lives in the June 12 struggles namely, Abi\u00adola\u2019s wife, Kudirat, Alfred Re\u00adwane, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Beko Ransome Kuti, Alao-Aka Bashorun, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, Chima Ubani, Anthony Enahoro, Ola Oni, Baba Omojola and others, while those who annulled the June 12 presidential election should be consigned into the dustbin of history.\u2019\u2019\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u201cThe journey started smoothly until after about two kilometres on water when the boat began to shake and suddenly, there was a loud bang and it split into two.\n\n\u201cI struggled to rescue others because I know how to swim but the water volume overwhelmed me. Luckily, I was able to swim to safety with the aid of the cover of a food flask belonging to a food vendor.\n\n\u201cI am still traumatised anytime I recall the cries of passengers who drowned when the boat capsized,\u201d said Mallam Shehu Warrah, one of the survivors of the ill-fated boat in Yobe State that killed over 100 passengers.\n\nWarra and other passengers envisaged a safe trip when the boat loaded with goods took off from Loko Minna in Niger State. But sadly, only a few of the passengers were alive to tell their stories. The boat capsized in Tsohuwan Labata village, Ngaski Local Government Area of Kebbi State.\n\nThe Sarkin Samari of Warra, Adamu Warra, who spoke with journalists about the boat accident, said, \u201cAlmost every household has its member in the ill- fated boat. The boat carrying over 150 people capsized in the deepest part of River Niger.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Secretary, Nigerian Red Cross, Kebbi State branch, Ibrahim Ngaski, said, \u201cThough the number of passengers on the boat has yet to be ascertained, information gathered indicated that the boat was carrying about 200 passengers. The majority of the passengers were artisans, miners and traders coming from Niger State to Kebbi State.\n\n\u201cAbsence of rescue equipment is the major impediment to the rescue operation. The information at hand showed that the boat was carrying 200 people. We are waiting to hear from our men who have since joined the rescue team.\u201d\n\nA source in the National Inland Waterways Authority, who spoke with our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said the number of passengers on board had yet to be ascertained because the search operation was still ongoing.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThey had buried corpses recovered through collaborative efforts of local divers, marine police in conjunction with officials of NIWA, Kebbi State Emergency Management Agency, police and victims\u2019 family members.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Executive Director, Kebbi SEMA, Alhaji Abbas Jamba, who also spoke to our correspondent, said the recovery was a continuous process.\n\nHe stated that he couldn\u2019t say when it would end going by the presumed number of passengers on board.\n\nThe Special Adviser on Media to Governor Atiku Bagudu, Yahaya Sarki, in a statement on the incident said the state was in deep shock over the boat accident.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe state governor, Senator Atiku Bagudu condoles with the families of those affected by the unfortunate boat accident and prays to the Almighty Allah to give the families the forbearance to bear the loss in good faith.\n\n\u201cThe Kebbi State Government was already collaborating with Ngaski Local Government and other relevant authorities for search and rescue operations in the area.\u201d\n\nAt present, N155m had been donated by sympathisers who visited the state to commiserate with grieving families.\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum donated N50m followed by the Sokoto State Government which gave N40m, Zamfara State Government N30m, Jigawa State government N25m while the Senate assisted the families with N10m.\n\nThe state had yet to get over the calamity, when news filtered in that members of a vigilance group popularly called \u2018Yan Sakai\u2019 were killed by suspected bandits in the Danko/Wasagu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nIt was gathered that the vigilantes were killed last Friday when the bandits attacked seven villages in the area.\n\n\u2018Yan Sakai is a vigilance group assisting security agents deployed almost a year to secure volatile areas under siege by bandits.\n\nThe state police command confirmed the killing of 80 vigilantes in the Danko/Wasagu LGA of the state. But a source in the village said the casualty figure had risen to 92 with several others injured.\n\nThe spokesperson for the police in the state, DSP Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed the attack.\n\nIn April, suspected bandits terrorising villages in the state ambushed and killed the eight cops and a divisional police officer in Makuku village, in the Sakaba LGA of the state.\n\nAfter hoisting a flag in parts of neighbouring Niger State last month, bandits, kidnappers and cattle rustlers reportedly invaded Kebbi State. Danko/Wasagu LGA inhabited by the Dakakari people, commonly referred to as \u2018Zuru\u2019, has been under bandits\u2019 attacks.\n\nThe local government shares boundary with parts of the ungoverned spaces of Zamfara State to its North and to the East, the Kamuku Game Reserve straddling Kaduna and Niger states. Most of the forests and hilly areas are under bandits\u2019 control.\n\nUnconfirmed reports indicated that between January 2020 and January 2021, the peaceful farming communities in Danko/Wasagu lost 363 persons to bandits\u2019 attacks with 16 people severely injured. Within the same period, huge ransoms were purportedly paid to kidnappers who abducted 201 persons. The number of rustled cattle is put at 3,915 apart from 2,355 sheep and 150 camels stolen from farmers. Six women were reportedly raped and 114 motorcycles burnt or stolen.\n\nSome survivors of bandits\u2019 attacks in Danko/Wasagu LGA and part of Zuru Emirate in Kebbi State, including those who lost their loved ones to attacks had turned refugees, hibernating at internally displaced persons\u2019 camps.\n\nNarrating his ordeal, an IDP in Dabai, a suburb of Zuru town from Munhaye village in Wasagu Chiefdom, Nuhu Bitrus said, \u201cBandits recently invaded our village and after a shooting spree, we lost 33 people and they kidnapped about 20 women with little children.\n\n\u201cEver then, we have managed to pack our belongings and travelled over three hours to this place. Our village is a large one with over 500 compounds and we are prosperous farmers who could take care of our needs and sponsor our kids\u2019 education.\n\n\u201cNow we cannot go near the village. No one is talking about us. We don\u2019t want anything from the government. All we want is a secure environment so that we can return home to farm. That\u2019s all we are asking.\u201d\n\nWakala Audu is a 50-year-old farmer. He is married with two wives and is a father of 11 children. He is also an IDP from D\u2019Lombo village in Wasagu Chiefdom.\n\nWakala stated that the attackers came in large numbers, pairing in two or three on motorcycles.\n\n\u201cThey killed 17 persons that day, including our Mai Anguwa (sub-village head), Mallam Maifada Matu. They stole my 23 cows and hundreds of cows belonging to my relatives and other residents of the village.\n\n\u201cWe escaped into the bush with our wives and children. After two days, the governor came. I was not around when he came because we went to bury corpses of our people.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that his village with over 300 households with fertile farmlands had been deserted as residents escaped leaving behind valuables they could not carry in a hurry.\n\nWhen the state governor visited the Danko/Wasagu area on a condolence visit, he pleaded with the people to remain calm, noting that the government was doing everything to restore normalcy in the area.\n\nBagudu also appealed to youths in the village who protested against incessant bandits\u2019 attacks in the area.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Olufemi Olaniyi writes that a fresh attack on Igangan, Oyo State, by gunmen has caused villagers pain and left property in ruins\n\nViolence erupted again in Igangan, epicentre of herdsmen atrocities in Oyo State and one of the worst hit areas in the South-West. The gunmen who invaded one of the seven communities in Ibarapaland left tears, sorrow and blood in their trail.\n\nIt was gathered that the gunmen went on the rampage, killing and torching property before some brave but poorly armed hunters managed to halt the reign of terror.\n\nResidents told our correspondent that they were woken up by the sound of the firepower of the gunmen who struck between 11pm and 3am. It was gathered that the petrified residents hid in their houses as the hoodlums destroyed houses, vehicles and business locations.\n\nAn activist in Ibarapaland popularly known as Akowe Agbe, Mr Taiwo Adeagbo, told our correspondent through a WhatsApp chat while the attack was on around 12midnight on Sunday that war was ongoing in Igangan.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt last, notorious terrorists are now waging war on Igangan. There are shooting everywhere and at everyone. Heavy shootings were ongoing and they are burning houses and vehicles. War is going on in Igangan and it is serious.\u2019\u2019\n\nAt 2:40am, Akowe Agbe sent another chat that the \u2018war\u2019 was still raging, adding that many had been killed by the attackers. He said, \u201cI thank God almighty for protecting me and my family but they have killed many people. I cannot say how many lives have been wasted now until later this morning.\u201d\n\nAkowe Agbe chatted again at 3:12am that the shootings had reduced, stating that by 5:03, about 10 persons were killed including some of the attackers.\n\nBy Sunday morning, residents woke up to the corpses of their relatives, friends and neighbours who died in the midnight attacks.\n\nThe youth organised a search party and combed the nearby bushes for the injured and the corpses of their kinsmen. Emotions ran high as families mourned their dead, the injured were rescued and taken to the hospital. Business owners were shocked to see their goods and shops in ruins.\n\nResidents finger Seriki\u2019s sons\n\nMany residents believe the attack was a reprisal. They accused the then Sarkin Fulani of Igangan, AbdulKadir Salihu, of masterminding the attack. Salihu fled the town in January following the ultimatum given to him by Chief Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho. Many people in Igangan accused Seriki of perpetrating killings, rape, kidnappings and farm destruction in the area but he vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nIgboho went to the town on January 15 and went to the residence of Salihu to warn him to stop his alleged atrocities against the people. He returned to the town at the expiration of the seven-day ultimatum he gave to the man. Salihu was said to have left on the eve of January 22 but his residence was razed by an angry mob after Igboho visited the town on the day the ultimatum expired. Igboho had since denied having a hand in the arson.\n\nReacting to the allegation, Salihu, who spoke with journalists in Ilorin, Kwara State on Thursday, said, \u201cI want to tell the whole world that my family and I were not involved in Igangan crisis since the crisis began about four months ago, we have relocated from Igangan.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Convener Igangan Development Advocates, Oladiran Oladokun and other residents accused Salihu\u2019s sons of masterminding the attack. He said Ibrahim Salihu threatened to revenge the chasing away of his father from Igangan. He said Ibrahim issued the threat on Facebook.\n\nThe Chairman, Ibarapa North Local Government Area, Lateef Akorede, in an interview with our correspondent also said the attack on Igangan could be a reprisal as some residents were claiming.\n\nAkorede said, \u201cWe can say the attack was a reprisal but we are not sure. That is why we have to be cautious and allow security agencies to carry our thorough investigation into the attack. Our people who saw two of the corpses of the attackers killed during the invasion identified one to be one of Salihu\u2019s aides. He was not his biological son but he was one of the people he employed to herd his cattle.\n\n\u201cThe other corpse was also identified to be one of (Iskilu, a Fulani warlord) Wakili\u2019s aides. He too was not Wakili\u2019s biological son but he worked for him before he (Wakili) was arrested. If they accused the two men of being behind the attack, they could be right but the police will do their job.\u201d\n\nOne of the victims of the attack, Mu\u2019ali Oguntowo, who lost goods worth millions of naira to the attack accused Salihu\u2019s son of responsible for the attack. Speaking to Saturday PUNCH, Oguntowo said that Ibrahim threatened him and Igangan town on Facebook before he blocked him.\n\nOguntowo said, \u201cI sell gas, solar panels and accessories. My shop was one of those razed down by the attackers. I lost everything there. My loss should be about N5m. I was at home when they struck. I was woken up around 1am by calls. One of the callers told me that gunmen had invaded the town and were killing and burning houses. I heard gunshots. It was not the sound of locally-made guns, the sound of the guns indicated that they were armed with guns with rapid firepower.\n\n\u201cThis did not come as a surprise to me and others because Salihu\u2019s son, Ibrahim and his younger brother, Umoru, sent messages to me on social media that they would deal with me. He even said it on a radio station in Ibadan. He said I was behind how they were chased away from the town. I started selling gas before him and one day he brought a gas tank and said I should organise my colleagues who also sell gas to be buying in bulk from him instead of going to Ibadan to buy it.\n\nBut I told him that it would not be possible because even in Ibadan where there are many gas plants, we carefully select where to buy so that we would not run at loss. He went away but in January, he accused me of masterminding their eviction and the two of them said they would deal with me. This is the result of their threats. The resident of Igangan who tackled him on the radio programme the same day was also affected in this attack- his shop was also burnt.\u201d\n\nSeriki\u2019s son denial\n\nWhen contacted for their reactions, Ibrahim and Umoru denied masterminding the attack on villagers in Igangan.\n\nThe duo who spoke with our correspondent on the telephone said they knew nothing about the attack and they should not be blamed for whatever happened in the town.\n\nIbrahim said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about what they are saying. We are not in their community. How can they accuse the people they chased out five months ago of attacking them? We don\u2019t know anything about it. There is no Fulani man in Ibarapa North Local Government Area so, how can they accuse us of attacking them? When we were there they accused us of attacking them, they chased us out and still accused us of being the ones attacking them. How is that possible?\u201d\n\nControversy over casualty figure\n\nResidents said that about 20 lives were lost to the attack, while the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, claimed 50 persons were killed. The Oyo State Police Command said 11 persons were killed including some of the attackers.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police, Ngozi Onadeko, in a statement by the spokesperson for the police in the state, Adewale Osifeso, during a visit to the scene on Sunday, appealed to the people to remain calm and cooperate with the police in carrying out a detailed investigation into the killings.\n\nThe CP said, \u201cIn the process of the attack, 11 persons including some of the bandits were confirmed dead, while a number of vehicles and buildings including the Palace of the Asigangan of Igangan town and a filling station were torched.\u201d\n\nHorrendous tales\n\nForty-seven\u2013year-old Jamiu Raji, who lost two family members to the attack, told our correspondent that members of the family were still in shock over the killings. He, however, said the family had accepted their fate while continuing to mourn the victims who he identified as Rabiat Raji and Ibrahim Adeagbo.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy sister (Rabiat) was at home when the gunmen struck. One of her nieces who slept in her place was woken up by repeated gunshots. She woke up and ran out to her parents\u2019 house opposite her own house. She ran after the girl and after ensuring that she had entered their house, my sister returned. She was shot dead while returning to her house.\n\n\u201cIbrahim Adeagbo was my cousin. He was at home when the gunmen came. They also shot him dead at home. He was 52 years old. The two of them were buried on Sunday after the police had written their reports about the incident.\u201d\n\nThe owner of a truck loaded with yam flour, Mr Isiau Kosemani, told our correspondent that he cheated death by a whisker on the day of the attack.\n\nKosemani said, \u201cI loaded 70 bags of elubo (yam flour) to transport them to Ibadan where we usually sell them. I usually wait till around 10pm or 11pm before leaving Igangan where we normally load because of heat and to avoid the \u2018problems\u2019 of police checkpoints. I took off and I was in the truck with my assistant driver. But before we could drive for about five minutes, I saw fire at the front and some persons were shooting towards our direction.\n\n\u201cMy initial thought was that they were vigilantes but at a closer look, I discovered that they were attackers. We ran out of the vehicle and I hid somewhere. I was watching and some hunters saw me and told me not to challenge them because they would kill me. The hunters also could not challenge them at the time because the guns which the gunmen held were superior to the locally made guns by the hunters.\n\n\u201cOne of the gunmen entered into the truck and he poured petrol on the seat and goods in the truck and set fire to it. That was how I lost everything but I thank God because I am alive. The truck should be around N11m and the elubo should be around N4,550,00 because a bag is sold for N65,000.\u201d\n\nAnother victim whose shop was burnt by the attackers, Sekinat Ayandele, said her industrial sewing machines, generator, leather materials and many other goods were destroyed by the gunmen.\n\nShe said, \u201cThat is the only thing I do and my shop is gone now. Everything there is gone. I don\u2019t know where to start from and that is why I am calling on the government to come to my aid and others who suffered a similar fate.\u201d\n\nA resident, Kehinde Osintayo, also narrated how the gunmen used axes to inflict injuries on his two siblings; Adefemi Adeniyi and Kehinde Adewole, who miraculously survived.\n\nIt was gathered that they were rushed to a hospital for treatment on Sunday morning by youths who combed nearby bushes to pick up corpses and the injured. The two victims, who are still in the hospital, have bandages on the injured parts of their bodies.\n\nOsintayo, who was with them at the hospital, told our correspondent that the assailants stormed their house and attacked them while they were asleep. He said, \u201cThe two of them were inside their house close to a filling station where some were killed. They attacked them with axes and other sharp objects. They were asleep at the time. Adefemi\u2019s wrist was cut off with an axe and he was inflicted with injuries on his body. Kehinde was also attacked and he also has injuries on his body. They can hardly hear now because one has to talk close to their ears before they can hear what anyone says.\n\n\u201cGovernment officials have come to the hospital but we don\u2019t know when they will pay the bill. We just want our brothers to survive because the pain they went through was much. When the people of the town saw Adefemi when they were combing the bush on Sunday morning, he was groaning in pain and that was when he was taken to a hospital. We need the government\u2019s assistance to pay the bill and to secure our area.\u201d\n\nHe said that hunters prevented the gunmen from invading his part of the town, stating that if not for that, the town would have been wiped out by the hoodlums.\n\nIgangan group blames govt\n\nThe President, Igangan Development Advocates, Wale Oladokun, told our correspondent that the group raised the alarm and communicated to the government in April that some gunmen were planning to attack the town but they didn\u2019t pay attention to it. He also called for the arrest of Salihu and his two sons for allegedly masterminding the attack on the town.\n\nOladokun said, \u201cWe also call for immediate arrest and prosecution of Salihu and his sons, especially Ibrahim, who on traditional and social media threatened to raze down Igangan.\n\n\u201cPrior to this carnage, and precisely on April 14 and later on April 25 2021, we raised the alarm based on an intelligence report gathered by the Igangan Development Advocates. We channeled the alarm to the appropriate government quarters while it was also given a wide publicity in some media platforms that a certain sect was coordinating a plan to invade Igangan on a reprisal after the eviction of his father, Salihu.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe also appealed to the governor to establish a base for Amotekun in Igangan and to empower the vigilantes to assist security agents in securing the area and to convert the Police Post in Igangan to a Divisional Police Headquarters for better security in the town.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self- Determination, being led by Prof. Banji Akintoye, urged Ibarapa people and all Yoruba to begin to plan how to defend themselves against those attacking them in their homeland.\n\nThe Chairperson of NINAS Central Steering Committee, Chief Folashade Olukoya and the spokesman for the group, Mr Tony Nnadi, who gave this advice in a statement, stated that the 1999 constitution was designed to render governors powerless on security-related matters so that all states and regions could be at the mercy of the central government.\n\nMakinde promises to address situation\n\nThe state governor, Seyi Makinde, while addressing residents of Igangan during his visit to the town to sympathise with the people and to assess the level of destruction said he should be held responsible for the attack.\n\nHe, however, said he had identified areas where there were hitches, calling on the people to give his government the opportunity to address the situation.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cI have told your chairman that all the vigilantes and security guards, the government will be responsible for them. This is your government. Please give me the opportunity to do the needful so that a meeting like this would not come up again. I urge you to give me that chance to make the issue of insecurity here to become a thing of the past. Don\u2019t take laws into your own hands. We have identified where there are hitches. We are supposed to be going to our farms by now because of the favourable weather. But hold me accountable, I have nowhere to go.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe governor promised that it was the last time such an attack would happen in the town, adding that, \u201cIt is a promise I am making to you, and it is a promise I will come through with. Please, don\u2019t take laws into your own hands. I urge all the families that lost their loved ones to this attack, because sometimes, emotion can really be high.\u2019\u2019\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Friday passed the buck of the demands for restructuring to the National Assembly, saying that true federalism and devolution of powers were issues requiring constitutional amendment.\n\nThe President spoke while hosting members of the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), led by the Co-Chairmen, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Dr. Samson Supo Ayokunle, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nHe said the National Assembly had already gone far with the required amendments to sections of the Constitution, adding that his position on devolving more power to the people had not changed.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, President Buhari said: \u201cOn the contentious issue of restructuring or true federalism or devolution of powers, like you all know, this is a constitutional matter with which only the National Assembly can deal.\n\n\u201cI remain an unapologetic believer in devolving power to the people, and that is why I signed the Executive Order granting autonomy to state legislature and the judiciary.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this was met with some resistance at the state level and led to a more than two months strike action that has cost the country a lot of pain.\n\n\u201cLuckily, the National Assembly has nearly completed the constitution review process, which I hope would address some of the burning issues agitating the minds of our people.\u201d\n\nBuhari assured that efforts were already on to create a more conducive environment to address both direct and indirect causes of challenges, including areas of job creation and employment generation, while appreciating religious leaders for their significant roles in national development, particularly in shaping perspectives.\n\n\u201cYour role is critical in putting the correct perspective out to Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nOn security, the President told the religious leaders that the government was already going after financiers of criminal elements, who also supply them with arms, but were constrained by the strike by Judiciary workers.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this strike has been called off and prosecution of some of these people would soon commence, while our security agencies expand their network in closing in on the others,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President assured that his administration remains committed to \u201cquickly pushing this dark side of our history behind us, and we are currently making sure that funding would not hamper our efforts.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, the last Federal Executive Council meeting approved some funds for the security agencies, which he said would be put to judicious use.\n\n\u201cAs I mentioned yesterday in Lagos, we will not relent in our efforts at clearing these criminals from all parts of our land, including the forests,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said the government had the major part to play in providing security, adding: \u201cBut besides the imperative to abide by democratic processes is the important aspect of support of the citizenry to the security agencies by providing relevant and timely information.\n\n\u201cI must confess that I am more pained than anyone can imagine with the ongoing security challenges, because, like you noted during your meeting, they have increased the hunger, pain and anger in the land.\u201d\n\nThe President thanked the religious leaders for their patriotism and commitment to ensuring peace and understanding.\n\n\u201cI have listened to you and I am particularly happy that your meeting clearly identified specific and major roles for both the government and the people of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is what has been lacking for some time in the national discourse on addressing our current security challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nIn their comments, NIREC, led by the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev Dr. Samson Ayokunle, thanked the President for the onerous assignment of leading the country, advising government to fund the armed forces better to confront the myriad of security challenges facing the country, block sources of illegal arms, publish names of those funding terrorism and try them.\n\nThey also canvassed the recruitment of more policemen, strengthening of the judiciary, tackling unemployment by creating jobs for youths particularly, and on separatist agitations in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is in our togetherness that we are stronger,\u201d NIREC said.",

          "text": "By Alao Abiodun\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration will not spare those who are hellbent on destroying his administration.\n\nHe reiterated his recent riot act to arsonists, agitators and others who attack government facilities across the country.\n\nBuhari in an exclusive interview with NTA News Network on Friday monitored by The Nation, called on Nigerians to be fair with his administration.\n\nHe also urged them to reflect seriously on the time he came onboard as President.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want Nigerians to be fair to this administration, they should reflect seriously on the time we came in, especially relatively to the North East and the South South.. where we are now. How much were we producing and how much was the past administration producing?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen we came, somehow the militants in the South were unleashed on this administration\u2026 So I will like Nigerians to reflect on those in terms of resources and time.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his recent riot act to arsonists, agitators, others who attack government facilities, he stated that his administration won\u2019t allow confusion just like how the EndSARS protests.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow can you go to police station.. kill the police (if they are there), loot the armoury, and burn the place.. what do you want to achieve, go and open prison and allow criminals that have been tried through the legal system and let them loose on the society and then how can the Government sit and allow this confusion to be perpetrated. No Government can allow confusion.\u201d He stated.\n\n\u201cLook at the EndSARS incident in Lagos, the previous governor of Lagos State bought 200 buses to complement the transportation in Lagos and he built a railway but they went there and burnt them.\n\n\u201cThe present Governor made an album and came to see me, and I say thank you very much. I took the album and put in my archives and told him to tell the lagosians to work because we don\u2019t have the money after an administration bought 200 buses.

So, collectively, we are committed to a peaceful June 12 celebration. In this regard, our security agencies are catching on to this commitment and they have assured us that no stone will be left unturned in protecting the lives and properties of residents.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies have marshalled various strategies that will be deployed during this period. So, one thing I can tell the residents is to be assured of their safety in the city during the period and beyond,\u201d he added.\n\nHe thereafter called on residents to go about their normal, lawful activities.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of kidnapping in the territory, the Permanent Secretary said that there was a consensus that the joint operations of the various security agencies will pay off and revealed that the FCT Administration is supporting the various security agencies through the provision of more operational vehicles and restoring those that had had broken down to boost their operations and improve their response time.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the FCT Minister, Anthony Ogunleye, the Permanent Secretary, also revealed that the National Security and Civil Defence Corps reported on the establishment of a Special Task Force to tackle the menace of kidnapping in the Territory.\n\nRead Also: NANS suspends planned June 12 protest\n\nOn the challenge of street begging which equally constitutes security threats to residents of the FCT, the Permanent Secretary said that a multipronged approach which includes sensitization of residents on the appropriate way to give alms, intervention of our religious institutions and constructive engagements with sponsors where identified would be adopted to bring the menace to the barest minimum.\n\nHe said that even though it was in the nature of Nigerians to give alms to the needy, they should not do so on the streets as such good gestures could be used to fund purchase of illicit drugs and encourage anti-social vices.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe therefore called on residents to instead go to places of worship, hospitals, orphanages, etc to make such donations.\n\nThe permanent Secretary said: \u201cWe also discussed the issue of beggars that infiltrated the city and we have developed a multipronged approach. For instance, the use of sensitization for people to know that there are better ways to give alms rather than giving to the so-called \u201cpoor on the streets\u201d because when you give to the poor on the streets, they could use it for illegal purposes, they could use it to buy drugs.\n\n\u201cBut when you give to orphanages, to churches and mosques, you go to community activities, to hospitals to donate there, these are channels that your money, your alms will be used for purposes that are beneficial. We\u2019ll be sensitizing the citizens on this.\u201d\n\nHe also called on religious institutions to sermonize to their congregants that the war on street begging and antisocial behavior should be seen as a collective effort and not one for the government alone.\n\nThe committee also deliberated on the destruction and theft of critical public infrastructure amongst other security matters.\n\nIn attendance at the meeting were heads of the various military and paramilitary formations and agencies in the Territory, religious and traditional rulers, Area Council Chairmen as well as senior officials of the FCTA.",

But I found out that it is not about them but us. We do not know who we are. This awakening is to bring the realization to know who we are. If we and our leaders in Africa understand who we are then the change has come. Our black brothers in America are suffering for ages and it is because we the blacks do not know who we are.

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "TECNO CAMON 17 Pro: A Creative Nod to the Selfie and the Selfie Culture",
          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "text": "Owing a dedicated business account opened in the name of the business and also ensuring that all business transactions go through that account; obtaining source documents for business transactions, and getting an automated SME-focused accounting tool are steps to transforming your financial record, notes a Lagos-based accountant.\n\nThe accountant encouraged businesses to issue invoices, collect expense receipts for purchases, and keep dedicated folders for different categories of transactions.\n\nAccounting tools will also reduce errors and easily tell how you are performing, says Jovita Madojemu, managing director, Pundit Bookkeeping Services.\n\nMany solutions targeting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) usually revolve around funding. They either provide or help SMEs with seamless sources of finance. But not many solutions support this category of businesses with tracking the spending of the funds.\n\nThe lack of finance is a common challenge for SMEs, but skewed financial appropriations and budgeting could cause a bigger challenge if founders ignore the culture of consistent financial documentation and bookkeeping.\n\nBut Madojemu has been committed to this course\u2014balancing the books of SMEs\u2014for five years. She started Pundit Bookkeeping Services to look after the finances of small businesses because of her belief that every SMEs need to make financial decisions from an informed standpoint.\n\n\u201cThere are so many businesses here today and gone tomorrow because so many of them are flying blind. So, I was going to make it happen by ensuring that they have professionally prepared books of account on a monthly basis because I believe that 12 months is too long a time to realise that they have been spending money on the wrong things,\u201d she told BusinessDay.\n\nBookkeeping, as she explains, is about recording, tracking, following the money, and identifying what the money is doing for the business. It enables business owners to know how much money they are spending and how much they are receiving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d she notes.\n\nWith effective bookkeeping, SMEs get to see at a glance how their business decisions are translated to money, they are better guided in making an efficient budget in subsequent periods as it establishes a baseline.\n\nAdditionally, where there has been mismanagement of funds, bookkeeping will reveal it, and the business owner has an opportunity to change course; and also makes it easy to hand over a business\u2019 financial activities to the next generation.\n\n\u201cOr, you could sell it to a discerning investor who could probably need such records to make such a decision,\u201d she states.\n\nMadojemu calls herself an advocate for financial intelligence for the SME space. Through her company, her clients have been instilled with the prudence required in business in terms of handling money\u2014and the feedback has been encouraging.\n\nClients are happy that they can get their business performance update month-on-month for half the cost of keeping a full-time, in-house, qualified and experienced accountant. Some others now see her company as an accountability partner and it makes her \u201cfeel very fulfilled.\u201d\n\nBut the impact of COVID-19 forced some clients to break their contracts with the company, leading to a shortfall in clients for Pundit Bookkeeping Service.\n\nWhile she did not take any legal action in a bid to be empathetic, other clients just ceased communicating as the pandemic persisted.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 was a rude shock to many,\u201d she narrates the impact the virus had on her business. \u201cSome of those clients just disappeared. Some others were more courteous and called to explain the need to discontinue our services.\u201d\n\nConsequently, her company had to adjust. It became more prudent\u2014keeping expenses as low as it could. It let go of some of the staff members, as the running cost could only be sustained for a short time. With reduced clientele, it further increased communication frequency with clients who stayed on.\n\nAdditionally, the company also allowed them to pay in installments as a way for them to manage their uncertain cash flow and also kept exploring new ways to keep improving its competencies and also increase visibility.\n\nNigeria is increasingly becoming difficult to do business. Insecurity, poor power supply, corruption, rash and often poorly thought-out government policies, lack of adequate infrastructure, and access to funds constantly deprive entrepreneurs of sleep.\n\nSo, how can business thrive in such a clime?\n\n\u201cThe first thing is the mind-set of the business owner. The business owner needs to understand that the business is different from him or her. The business has a life of its own. It is important that you do not try to force the business to fund your lifestyle if it cannot.\n\n\u201cAlso, as a business owner, constantly lookout for better deals in terms of dealing with vendors. Consider installmental plan options for major expenses so that you are not stifled. Then, improve on your business competencies and transfer knowledge,\u201d she suggests.",

          "title": "June 12: Inconsistent regulation in Nigeria stifling $8bn telecom market",
          "text": "The telecommunication sector in Nigeria saw its biggest growth in the months of April, May, and June of 2020 jumping to 18.10 percent from 9.71 percent in the previous quarter. It was a cherry of hope on the Democracy Day celebration of that year that despite the COVID-19 pandemic and recession the country was in, there was a path to recovery should the sector continue on that growth trajectory.\n\nFast forward to 2021, the sector operators are no longer certain about what the outlook for the second quarter of 2021 would look like, having suffered a historic decline in the first quarter. The sector, a primary driver of Nigeria\u2019s economy, saw an era of double-digit growth reduced to single-digit. The first-quarter growth tanked to 7.69 percent from the previous quarter where it recorded 17.64 percent.\n\nThe damage to the sector was inflicted by a combination of poorly thought and executed policies and macroeconomic realities. Among them were the ban on SIM registration to accelerate the National Identification Number (NIN) registration exercise, recessive income per capita, and the growing number of people migrating to WhatsApp, Telegram, and other platforms that do not require SIM cards to stay connected.\n\nThe telecommunication market generates average revenue of $8 billion annually according to Teniola Olushola, former President of the Association of Telecommunication Companies in Nigeria (ATCON).\n\nIn the new National Broadband Plan 2020-2025, the country set ambitious goals to deliver data download speeds of about 25Mbps in urban areas and 10Mbpds in rural areas. The plan also targets covering at least 90 percent of the population and a penetration rate of 70 percent by the end of the plan\u2019s lifetime. In recent times, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy has clarified that the country is actually targeting the attainment of a 90 percent broadband rate in terms of population and a 70 percent rate in terms of the total landmass within the next two years (2023).\n\nRead Also: Network operators lose 12.4m internet subscriptions in 5 months\n\nThe latest figures released by the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) in June not only showed that the big four operators in the sector lost significantly in April, but the broadband penetration in the country has also now declined to 40.66 percent from 41.18 percent in March. At 40.66 percent, the sector has seen 4.36 percent erased from the 45.02 percent penetration it recorded in December 2020.\n\nA target of 90 percent would mean the country plans to add about 49 percent broadband penetration to the current 41 percent in 2 years. It is a very tall order considering that Nigeria needed about 3 years to add about 24 percent penetration growing from 21.69 percent in 2017 to 45.02 percent in December 2020. Interestingly, it only needed 4 months to wipe off 5 percentage points to take penetration down to 40.66 percent in April 2021. It also means the country is now 50 percent off its 90 percent broadband penetration target by 2023 as recently announced by the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Ali Isa Pantami.\n\nWhile the appointment of Isa Pantami ignited many expectations of the possible turnaround of the sector, the result so far has not lived up to those expectations.\n\nSome social projects have been executed by the minister\u2019s administration including the NCC\u2019S Emergency Communications Centre, Ado-Ekiti; the Digital Awareness Programme (DAP) for Secondary Schools, whose beneficiaries are Methodist Girls\u2019 High School, Yaba, Lagos State, and Bishop Okoye Girls\u2019 Secondary School, Ukpor, Anambra State; as well as the School Knowledge Centre (SKC) at Ijaloke Grammer School, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, executed by the USPF.\n\nThe Minister also flagged off the National Adopted Village for Smart Agriculture (NAVSA) initiative located at Jewel\u2019s Suit, Okoe Urejee, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, which was executed by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\n\nIn terms of development in network infrastructure, not much has really changed except in January 2020 when the Minister attempted to get state Governors to agree to reduce Right of Way fees for broadband fibre. That effort only changed the mind of seven state Governors including Ekiti, Imo, Plateau, and Katsina. Kaduna and Anambra waived the fees while Kwara dropped the fees to N1.\n\nHowever, 29 states have stuck to their old charges. A few have managed to give concessions. For example, in 2020, MainOne said Ogun state gave them a charge waiver to deploy fibre cables across the state. As of April, the market share by the technology of fixed wired internet \u2013 comprising fibre cables \u2013 was at 0.10 percent a position it has been for many years.\n\n\u201cThe high rates of the ROW adversely impact our business,\u201d said Uche Nnakenyi, Divisional CEO, ipNX. \u201cFibre-To-The-Home infrastructure is highly capital intensive hence with the high rates of the ROW, the total cost of ownership of our infrastructure is increased, impeding the rate of expansion of the footprint of our infrastructure within and across cities and states. Additionally, this increases the cost of service delivery.\u201d\n\nPoor fibre infrastructure deployment is responsible for the cost of data in the country. Worldwide Mobile Mobile Data Pricing 2021 ranks Nigeria 43rd among countries with exorbitant data charges. The report which surveyed 230 countries on the affordability of data, put Nigeria behind Sudan (fifth globally); Algeria (16th); Somalia (22nd); Ghana (27th); Libya (30th); Tanzania 32nd; and Mauritius (33rd).\n\nBeyond right-of-way fees, operators are also lamenting the destruction of their equipment. In 2020, Airtel said over 1400 base stations had been vandalised because there was no adequate security for equipment. Criminal elements cut fibre cables meant for internet access, remove air conditioners, generators, and other equipment at these base stations.\n\nInsecurity in the various parts of the country also means that telcos\u2019 investments are now restricted to few locations where these companies feel \u201cSafest\u201d. An official at ATCON told BusinessDay that telecom investors would not go to regions where they would potentially be killed. Telcos are also known to be relocating their workers from these regions back to Lagos where they are safe. This deepens the challenge of connectivity already existing in these hotspots.\n\nAs of 2019, The NCC confirmed that Nigeria had about 200 communities that have never seen internet connectivity. The commission also said it has come up with a programme to connect these communities, however, it required collaboration between it and the telecom operators. While insecurity is likely to ensure the state of unconnectedness continues, the NCC had pledged to provide a subsidy of N65 billion counterpart funding. It is part of a larger plan to raise N265 billion which falls under the State Accelerated Broadband Initiative designed to address the infrastructural deficits in the telecommunications sector. The infrastructural companies would raise the balance of the N200 billion. Operators say they are yet to receive the NCC pledge.\n\nA few operators who would not speak on the record said it would be impossible to commence any deployment without the support of the government. It is perhaps why the Lagos State government has embarked on an ambitious plan of deploying about 3500km of fibre infrastructure around the state. The infrastructure is expected to bring connectivity to mainly public hospitals, schools, and government offices. So far only 1800km of fibre has been completed.\n\n\u201cWe are using it to develop a mesh city and the infrastructure that is required to power your businesses. Once we complete our fibre infrastructure we would have all our public schools connected and all of our public buildings and hospitals and the telcos would have an opportunity to reach the last mile. It would mean cheaper and faster technology,\u201d Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State said recently.\n\nWhile it is commendable, it is but a drop in the ocean of what the country requires to ensure adequate connectivity and give it a chance at 90 percent penetration. Researchers at FBN Quest said one way to achieve this is for state governments to allow open access infrastructure rollout.\n\n\u201cWe understand that Anambra state has waived right-of-way (RoW) fees for telecom operators. This is part of the state\u2019s efforts to drive broadband expansion. The absence of a unified RoW fee across states within the country continuously stalls the advancement of broadband fibre networks,\u201d the researchers said. According to the NCC, the fibre requirements of the country are around 120,000km. So far, less than 40,000km has been achieved, leaving a deficit of over 80,000km. Experts say addressing insecurity would be the best place to start, however, there needs to be consistency in the policy statements that give assurance of a direction to investors.",

Due to the helplessness of the government to curb this ugly and incessant attacks on the precious lives and property of the citizens, Nigerians are taking recourse to their primordial ethnic cocoons which decimates the Nigerian state to the threshold of near collapse.\n\nThe security conundrum has put everyone in danger. The activities of these anti-state actors have imperiled farmers, traders, students, political leaders, travelers and ofcourse corps members who are entrusted with the patriotic mandate of rendering selfless service to the motherland.\n\nConcerned Nigerians are asking what the way out of the quagmire could be. It is this existential question that has birthed a precipitous bill seeking to scrap National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Sponsored by Awayi Abiante from Rivers State, the bill has now reached the second reading at the Green Chamber. This bill has brought NYSC to the stead to be a whipping boy for our insecurity as lawmakers debate it relevance to the nation after 48 years of existence.\n\nHon. Awaji-Inombek Abiante in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal, listed various reasons why the NYSC should be scrapped.One of the reasons, according to Abiante, is due to incessant killing of innocent corps members in some parts of the country due to banditry, religious extremism and ethnic violence.\n\nHon Abiante also gave economic exploitation of Corpers by private agencies as another reason for his bill seeking the discontinuation of the scheme as they \u201care no longer recruiting able and qualified Nigerian youths, thus relying heavily on the availability of corps members who have not been well remunerated and get relieved with impunity at the end of their service year without any hope of being gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nApart from serving in their various places of primary assignment, corps members are often deployed for key assignments such as working as ad hoc electoral staff during elections which he also explains endangers the safety of corps members since elections in Nigeria are most times volatile.\n\nIt is worthy to note that since the inception of nysc itself in 1973 the program has been trailed by waves of protest . Just so you know that the scheme has always been a bone of contention right from the day it\u2019s decree was promulgated in 1973. In the words of the scheme\u2019s founder, Gen. Yakubu Gowon \u201cthe establishment of the scheme was followed by a protest throughout the length and breadth of the country\u201d\n\nThe administration of Gen. Gowon established the NYSC with the promulgation of Decree No 24 of May 22, 1973, the objective was to ensure that Nigeria remained an indivisible entity that would be focused on sustainable development and four decades later the scheme can do better but it\u2019s relevance to the socio economic fabrics of Nigeria can be attested to by well meaning and patriotic citizens of Nigeria though not devoid of challenges.\n\nIt was the same General Yakubu Gowon who launched the famous 3Rs which are reconstruction, rehabilitation, reconciliation in order to galvanize the wartorned Nigeria after the devastating civil war the giant of Africa was plunged into between 1967 to 1970 and he found young graduates as one of the veritable tools of nation building. Reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation should be seen as an ongoing efforts of nation building just as government is a continuous process.\n\nThe NYSC posts Corps members to cities or villages and states far from home and states of origin, where they are expected to mix with people of other tribes, social and family backgrounds where they could learn the culture of the indigenes in the place they are posted. This of course fosters mutual understanding of the country\u2019s diverse cultures and national cohesion. What if there was no NYSC?\n\nNYSC should be seen as a work in progress. The government should strengthen the scheme to ensure it meets the current socio-economic reality of our country but scrapping it because of insecurity is like a farmer throwing away his hoe because he\u2019s unable to use it. The problem is not the hoe but the farmer\u2019s inability to use it.\n\nNigeria is one of the most terrorized countries in the world and no society can thrive in an atmosphere of severe insecurity like the one in Nigeria. Government must live up to it\u2019s primary responsibility of providing security of lives and property to citizens. This is the least citizens can ever ask of any government.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

          "text": "By Adagher Tersoo\n\nNigeria\u2019s Federal Fire Service can now boast of prompt response to any fire incident in any part of the nation.\n\nSince his appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari in March 2019 as Comptroller-General of the Service, Liman Ibrahim has consistently been expanding the scope of operations of the organization, acquiring new state-of-the-art equipment and improving on the welfare of staff of the Service.\n\nHe ensures prompt response to distress call by his men, anywhere in Nigeria and also demonstrates his willingness to protect his officials from attacks. Liman has done this by sanctioning communities that attacked officials of the Service while responding to distress calls.\n\nIn January this year, he sanctioned Nyanya community, a suburb of Abuja, after his men were attacked while putting out a fire.\n\nREAD ALSO: UN elects Ghana, 4 others to serve on Security Council\n\nLiman vowed that except the community givesassurance that such incident would never recur, the FederalFire Service would never respond to any distress call from the area.\n\nThough N32 billion was lost to fire in 2020 in Nigeria, the Service saved 1,453 lives and property worth N1.351 trillion.\n\nIn 2020 alone, the Service under Liman acquired 36 fire-fighting trucks and created more zonal and state commands. It also promoted 1,276 of its officers. Six functional zonal offices created under him were Yola, Sokoto, Minna, Owerri, Asaba, and Oshogbo.\n\nThe Service has further expanded its operations by ensuring that its offices exist in each of the 109 senatorial zones in the country.\n\nIn order to further strengthen the existing offices and provide them with the facilities they need for effective services, the Service has ordered for 89 new firefighting trucks, which include 15 water tankers, 44 water tenders, 15 rapid intervention vehicles and15 ambulances. Most of the facilities have been acquired and deployed.\n\nThe Service, under Liman, commissioned another 20 new basic life support ambulance buses and seven state-of-the-art firefighting trucks recently in its drive to make the organization ranks among world\u2019s best.\n\nNigerian government, through the Federal Executive Council had approved N10.4 billion for infrastructure upgrade for the organization.\n\nAs part of his determination to reposition the Service, the CG is interacting with the international community and other experts that will help to improve the operations of the institution.\n\nOne of such meetings took place between the management of the Service and the Ambassador of Belarus to Nigeria Mr Vyacheslav Bril in Abuja.\n\nThe Service is acquiring some of its equipment from Belarus, which the ambassador pledged would be adaptable to Nigerian climate and roads.\n\nMr Liman is also advocating for redesigning of markets roads in Nigeria to make them more accessible to his men during emergencies. He believes that with good road network, places where fire incidents occur will be easily accessible to the Fire Service officials and such fires will be easily put out.\n\nThe CG believes in consistent enlightenment of Nigerians as ways of preventing fire and preserving the equipment of the Federal Fire Service.\n\nImpressed by the ongoing transformation at the Service, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola had said at the launch of newly-acquired equipment for the Service earlier this month that the Federal Fire Service had made \u201ca phenomenal transformation from a moribund department to a vibrant organisation equipped with modern and state of the art firefighting equipment.\u201d\n\nMr Liman has also been full of praise to President Muhammadu Buhari who makes the transformation at the Service possible.\n\nLiman, who after obtaining the mandatory Basic Fire Fighting Courses holds the following:-\n\nAdvance Fire Certificate of Competency (ADFCC), Kano 2005.\n\nNigeria National Disaster Management Courses No 6 Jaji Kaduna 2007.\n\nNational Disaster/Crises Management (Defence Hqrs Abuja) \u2013 2007\n\nMalaysia Official Fire Protection and Rescue expo & Conference, Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (FIREC 2008).\n\nNigeria Executive Disaster Management Seminar, Calabar 2009.\n\nInternational Disaster Management Course, London 2010.\n\nSenior Nigerian Fire Officer\u2019s Study Visit to UK Fire Training & Command Centre, London 2011.\n\n2nd International Disaster Management Exhibition/Conference (IDME), Istanbul \u2013 Turkey.\n\nDubai (UAE) Study Tour of the Tallest Building in the World Burg-Khalifa, and other High \u2013Rise Building.",

But since 1966, this only happened once, in 2016, when Italy and the Netherlands agreed to split the 2017-2018 term.\n\nSince 2010, 78 per cent of races for Security Council seats have been uncontested.

Part of it belongs to the states, only that the Federal Government gives the guarantee.\n\n\u201cYet for us to develop the country we need to build infrastructure. What do we do to raise funds; there are several ways we are going to raise taxes; can we afford that in the current situation to raise taxes for us to fund the building of our infrastructure.\n\n\u201cSo, what are the options.

So we can\u2019t raise taxes, the option is to borrow and to borrow responsibly,\u201d Lawan stated.\n\nThe President of the Senate further explained that before the borrowing, government has to first identify those essential infrastructure that could grow the economy.\n\nOn Twitter ban, Lawan said \u201cthe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had informed Nigerians that the government and managers of Twitter were finding ways to resolve the matter.\n\n\u201dThat is what we heard. And our believe is that Nigeria needs Twitter just as much as Twitter needs Nigeria. Our expectation is that with engagement between the Federal Government and Twitter, we will resolve the dispute between Twitter and our government.\u201d\n\nOn better renumeration for journalists, Lawan said that \u201cIf you feel very strongly, about this you can sponsor a bill to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cAlso remember that most of the media houses are privately-owned. But still if you feel you are not getting a good deal, you can talk to our Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions if your employer is not giving you good wage. And of course you know the risk.\n\n\u201cAnd I can assure you that the National Assembly will look into it. I\u2019m not sure that it will be passed but we will consider it,\u201d he said. (NAN)",

Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, for his drive and tenacity towards achieving the milestone recorded today, as well as the wonderful team in the Ministry that assisted in achieving this feat.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi earlier in his remarks expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for summoning the courage to take the loan from China Exim bank to execute the rail project.\n\nHe also thanked the Chinese government for the loan with the hope that the Asian country will also approve the loan for the Ibadan to Kano axis which he said the Buhari led administration intends to start and complete before the end of its tenure.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Chinese government through the China Exim bank was able to give us the loan at a concessionary rate to construct from the seaport down to Ibadan.\n\n\u201c We hope that we get money to be able to construct from Ibadan -Kano so that we can complete the track and make sure that business takes place,\u201d he said\n\nThe Board Chairman, Nigerian Railway Commission NRC in his welcome address reiterated that the importance of the project cannot be over emphasized as it would be of great impact to the Nation\u2019s citizens and her economy.\n\nThanking President Buhari for his support in ensuring the project is a success, he stressed that the occasion is the third time of the President commissioning railway project completed during his tenure.\n\nHe equally thanked the Minister for being the chief pilot of the project in which the project wouldnt have been successful without his tenacity.\n\nDignitries at the event include Professor Wole Soyinka, Minsters of Info and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed , Works and Housing SAN Babatunde Fashola, Youth and Sports, Dr Sunday Dare, Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, Minister of State for Transport, Sen Gbemisola Saraki, Perm Sec Dr. Magdalene Ajani.

          "text": "Solomon Elusoji, Lagos\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said he hopes Nigeria will be secure, prosperous and confident by the time he leaves office in 2023.\n\nHe made the remark in a 30-minute interview with the Nigerian Television Authority, which aired on Friday.\n\nAccording to the President, he is committed to stepping down in 2023 and has no third term agenda, as the constitution allows for only two terms.\n\nHe added that the success of his administration will depend on the survival of his party, the All Progressives Congress, after 2023.\n\n\u2018Security is Key\u2019\n\nThe President argued on Friday that his administration was committed to securing the country from all forms of violence, including banditry and terrorism.\n\nHe said it was unfair to conclude that the police and military action currently ongoing in the South-East was a result of his dislike of the region.\n\n\u201cWe have been deploying police and army to deal with bandits\u201d in the North, the President said.\n\nWhile stressing that security had improved since 2015, he said his administration still faces the challenge of acquiring the required weaponry and ammunitions to fight crime in all facets.\n\nThe number one thing is security, the President said, because if you don\u2019t secure Nigeria, people will not invest.\n\nHe also condemned #EndSARS violence, noting that such actions were bound to drive off prospective investors.\n\nFighting Corruption\n\nThe President acknowledged that corruption remained a nagging problem and decried the difficulty of dealing with it under a democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult under this system,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was a bit younger, I arrested politicians and put them under restriction and told them they were guilty until proven innocent.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said majority of Nigerians believe his administration was doing its best under the circumstance.\n\nHe advocated for the creation of special courts to deal with corruption, noting that such an institution would speed up the hearing of financial misappropriation cases and ensure criminals do not cheat justice.\n\nGrateful to China\n\nThe President said his administration has focused on building public infrastructure such as railways and roads, and acknowledged China\u2019s assistance.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have agreed to help us and they are helping us.\u201d\n\nHe added that his administration has also prioritised the production of fertilizer in order to fight food insecurity.\n\nThe President said his administration\u2019s decision to close the country\u2019s borders for months has boosted agricultural production.",
