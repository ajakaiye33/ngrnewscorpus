          "title": "Why FG should remove fuel subsidy \u2014 Soludo",
          "text": "As inflation pushes 15m more Nigerians into poverty\n\nInflation projected to reach 15.5% by end of 2022\n\nBy Udeme Akpan, Emmanuel Elebeke & Fortune Eromosele\n\nAWKA\u2014Governor of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has kicked against retention of fuel subsidy in Nigeria.\n\nThis was even as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Limited said payments for petrol subsidy cost the Federation Account N1.217 trillion in the first five months of 2022.\n\nHowever, Soludo, noted that fuel subsidy should be charged from the federal government and not subnational states.\n\nHe also argued that the subsidy ought to have been removed \u2018like yesterday,\u2019 adding that its non-removal could cause the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN to spill money.\n\nSoludo, who made his intentions known at the launch of the Nigeria Development Update, NDU, by the World Bank group in Abuja yesterday, emphasised that the solutions to Nigeria\u2019s problems were obvious and not far-fetched.\n\nSpecifically, he said: \u201cFederal government decides that it wants to subsidise Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, why do you have to charge it from the subnational states? You should charge it from the revenue of the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe need to have this conversation, the politics, and structure of the government and so on. We cannot do the same thing over and over again and expect the same result; it\u2019s not going to happen. We\u2019ve had this analysis for a decade, the same analysis and conclusions of what to do.\n\n\u201cRemove this subsidy like yesterday, this ought to have been removed like yesterday. If we continue with the subsidy, Central Bank will continue to spill money. The solutions are pretty obvious. What we need to do is to be committed to it.\u201d\n\nNDU report\n\nMeanwhile, the NDU report sighted by Vanguard, disclosed that a higher inflation rate had pushed about 15 million more Nigerians into poverty between the 2020 and 2022, while eight million more Nigerians were in poverty between the 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe report noted that the war in Ukraine added to Nigeria\u2019s woes, as inflationary pressures have increased, with inflation projected to reach 15.5 percent by the end of 2022.\n\n\u201cIncreased inflationary pressures following the Ukraine war are expected to push even more Nigerians into poverty.\n\n\u201dBefore the war, higher inflation pushed an estimated eight million more Nigerians into poverty between 2020 and 2021. In 2021, inflation averaged 17 per cent, undermining Nigeria\u2019s economic recovery by eroding the purchasing power of the most vulnerable households.\n\n\u201cWe project that the added inflationary pressure emanating from the war in Ukraine could push as many as one million more Nigerians into poverty, on top of the six million already projected before the war.\n\n\u201dOverall, the \u2018inflation shock\u2019 is estimated to result in about 15 million more Nigerians living in poverty between 2020 and 2022.\n\n\u201cThe added inflationary pressure from the war in Ukraine could push as many as one million additional Nigerians into poverty in 2022. Even before the war, inflation in 2022-then projected at 13.5 percent was predicted to push around six million Nigerians into poverty in 2022.\n\n\u201cWith the war, the higher rate of inflation-projected at 15.5 percent-could push approximately seven million Nigerians into poverty, an additional one million people. The CBN\u2019s inflation target of 6-9 percent, which was not achieved in previous years, remains unlikely to be met in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe increase in May 2022 in the policy rate by the CBN is an adequate measure. Still, it has occurred in a context in which FX management and development finance at subsidized rates have reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy.\n\n\u201cMoreover, financing of the fiscal deficit and trade restrictions by the Central Bank continue fuelling inflationary pressures. Inflation in Nigeria will thus remain among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2022,\u201d the report stated.\n\nNNPC report\n\nHowever, in its May 2022 report to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee, FAAC, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited disclosed that payments for petrol subsidy cost the Federation Account N1.217 trillion in the first five months of 2022.\n\nThe Corporation showed that N271 billion was deducted from its expected remittance for the month, bringing to the total deductions for the year to N1.217 trillion for petrol subsidy.\n\nNNPC said it would further deduct N874.5 billion from its expected remittance in June.\n\nIt stated in the report: \u201cThe value shortfall on the importation of Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, otherwise known as petrol recovered from April 2022 proceeds is N271,125,127.487.58, while the outstanding balance carried forward is N371 billion.\n\n\u201cThe estimated value shortfall of N874,503,649.643.98 billion (consisting of arrears of N37I billion plus estimated April 2022 value shortfall of N503,313,767,828.14 is to be recovered from May 2022 proceeds due for sharing in the June 2022 FAAC meeting,\u201d the NNPC document said.\n\nA breakdown of the deductions so far this year showed that in January N270.83 billion was deducted, February N210.38 billion, March 219.78 billion, April N245.77 billion and May 271 billion.\n\nThe monthly data for the year for actual petrol subsidy cost showed that N143.72 billion was incurred in January, N253 billion in February, N152 billion in March and N642 billion in April bringing the total for the first four months to N1.190 trillion.\n\nThis means that in 2022, the Federation Account has not received any proceeds from the export and domestic sales of Federation crude oil.\n\nIn 2021, N1.573 trillion was deducted by the NNPC from its revenue contribution to the Federation Account for petrol subsidy which it carries in its books as PMS value shortfall or under recovery.\n\nThe Federal Government had earlier in the year received approval from the National Assembly to spend N4 trillion on petrol subsidy in 2022.",
          "summary": "This was even as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Limited said payments for petrol subsidy cost the Federation Account N1.217 trillion in the first five months of 2022.\nHowever, Soludo, noted that fuel subsidy should be charged from the federal government and not subnational states.\nEven before the war, inflation in 2022-then projected at 13.5 percent was predicted to push around six million Nigerians into poverty in 2022.\n\u201cWith the war, the higher rate of inflation-projected at 15.5 percent-could push approximately seven million Nigerians into poverty, an additional one million people.\nThe Federal Government had earlier in the year received approval from the National Assembly to spend N4 trillion on petrol subsidy in 2022.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ndahi Marama, Damaturu\n\nConcerned Stakeholders of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC \u2018Zone C\u2019 Senatorial District of Yobe state have thrown their weight behind Alhaji Bashir Sheriff Machina, who emerged as Senatorial Candidate and refused to step down for incumbent Sen. Ahmed Lawan come 2023 general elections.\n\nRecall that, Senator Lawan who aspired for the just concluded APC presidential primary election that produced Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as Candidate, has approached Machina to allow him fly the senatorial flagship.\n\nIn a press statement signed by the leader of the group, Abba Maina Yusufari, which was made available to our Correspondent in Damaturu on Tuesday said, \u201cwe are here to make these Press Release free of any sentiment but with every sense of duty for the development and unity of our political landscape, Zone C Senatorial District.\n\n\u201cFor keen observers of Yobe politics, no one is blind to the fact that our senatorial zone has enjoyed relative political peace and stability both at the House of Representative and even more at the senate with our brother, The Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan been in the saddle for a record three times. By the end of 2023, our beloved brother Sen. Ahmed Lawan will be spending 24 years at the National Assembly ie 16 years as a senator and 8 years as a member of the House of Representative.\n\n\u201cWhile we remain committed and dedicated to propagating our cherished unity and stability, we also believe that for the interest of democracy, equity, justice and fair play, our brothers from the old Nguru Emirate which now constitutes other three Emirates of Machina, Nguru, and Yusufari should equally have a feel of what our brother Emirate of Bade have been enjoying in the last 24 years\u201d. Yusufari stated.\n\nHe added that, \u201d it is against this backdrop that his group make bold to throw their support behind their brother Alhaji Bashir Sheriff Machina to take over from Sen. Ahmed Lawan come 2023.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, Alhaji Bashir Machina is the candidate that was picked as a consensus candidate of our great party, APC in the just ended primary elections. Any attempt by Sen. Ahmed Lawan to replace him from the seat will be a complete betrayal of the will of the people and a clog in the wheel of the peace, unity and stability the people.\n\n\u201cSuffice that the mandate Alhaji Bashir Machina is the mandate of the people and not that of an individual. The voice of the people is the voice of Allah.\n\n\u201cWe therefore wish to caution that, an attempt to silence the voice of the people by any individual either by his involvement of any type of machination or antics will be running against the concept of democracy and moral fairness.\n\n\u201cWe are set to work hard and achieve the success of our candidate Hon. Bashir Machina and the victory of our party at all levels.\n\n\u201cLet it be made plain that we do not subscribe, support or encourage the thought of Hon. Bashir standing aside for the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan whom we supported to emerge as the presidential candidate of our party but Allah in his infinite wisdom made it different.\n\n\u201cWe urge on our brother, Dr. Ahmed Lawan at this juncture to express thanks to the good people of Zone C for the support he has experienced from them since the revival of democracy in Nigeria in 1999 and not to be dragging a senate seat that he abandoned for an eye for the presidency. A piece of cake can\u2019t be eaten twice in the same sitting.\u201d Yusufari concluded.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nThe Clerk, Kano State House of Assembly and Head of Legislative service, Garba Bako Gezawa has backed the clamour for autonomy for local government noting that autonomy for the third tier of government will bring about an end to insecurity and other woes bedevilling the country.\n\nGezawa stated this in his remarks at a one day session with media partners on the need to follow-up on the ratification of the local government autonomy bill facilitated by the Partnership to Engage, Reform and Learn, PERL.\n\nThe Clerk who was represented by his aide, Muhd Lawal Tijjani noted that the incessant insecurity in the country has been linked to non-functionality of the local government councils across the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cit is a known fact that the local government system which is the closest to the people and saddled to take governance to the remote parts of the state has been neglected.\n\n\u201cThe incessant insecurity we are witnessing today have been largely attributed to the non-functionality of the Local Government councils across the country.\n\n\u201cConsequently, it is my firm belief that passing the Local Government autonomy bill into law will not only change the present narratives of the Local Government system in the state but also help enhance the socio-economic viability of the people and addresses some of the insecurity challenges in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nGezawa however expressed the readiness and commitment of the assembly towards attaining success in the struggle.\n\nSimilarly, a media practitioner, Maude Rabiu Gwadabe said the bill if passed into law will bring about a new dawn for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe Local Government autonomy bill is that which has been passed in the National Assembly both the Senate and House of Representatives. Now, because it concerns the constitutional amendment, we need about two-thirds of the state houses of Assembly. So far, nine out of the 36 states have passed the bill.\n\n\u201cKano being one of the leaders in the political space in Nigeria, we would like the state govt and legislature to have a by in and accept this bill.\n\n\u201cThe bill is before the house of Assembly and is in the process of ratification. We want them to fast track the process because by the law of the legislature if this tenure ends without passage then we have to start afresh again because the next legislature cannot continue with the process.\n\n\u201cIf the bill is passed into law, that would be a very good day in Nigeria. It means that democracy will be deepened and government will be brought closer to the people. It will also translate to real human development in Kano and Nigeria as a whole,\u201d Gwadabe said.\n\nEarlier, the State Partnership facilitator for Partnership to Engage, Reform and Learn, PERL, Yunusa Hamza said the essence of the meeting was to support the media partners to see to the need to take a lead and champion the call for Kano to pass the bill into law and join the league of other states who have passed the law in order to reverse current situation of the LGAs.",

Awaji Abiante, Member of the ECOWAS Parliament and Nigerian lawmaker representing Andoni-Opobi/Nkoro Federal Constituency of Rivers, said that the delay in the launch of the currency is to avoid any form of crisis.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on the sideline of the session, Abiante said that the single currency is work in progress and there is hope that sometimes it will work.\n\n\u201cEvery good thing comes with its challenges so getting the economies of the 15 member states to agree on that transaction and how it can be moved forward.\n\n\u201cIf it is hurried, definitely it could run into crisis so it is good to have every aspect of it discussed, agreement reached, such that it will be implementable,\u201d Abiante said.\n\nOn the sustainability and benefits of the currency, Abiante said that until it is implemented, one cannot say how viable it would be.\n\n\u201cWhatever anybody says, it is just going to be mere projections, it is only when it is implemented that you will see the benefits.\n\n\u201cBut simply put, it will ease transactions, it will open up the economies, it will make it freeer for people to engage in both commercial and industrial activities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that in June 2019, the Authority of ECOWAS Heads of States and Government committed to having a single currency and adopted the name \u201cECO\u201d during its Extraordinary Session in Abuja.\n\nThe currency was expected to be launched in 2020. (NAN)",
          "summary": "Mr Jean-Claude Brou, President of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Commission, has said that the community has resumed convergence to launch of the ECOWAS single currency \u201cECO\u201d in 2027.\nBrou said that the process of launching the single currency was stalled following the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic from 2020, as countries needed to focus on handling the pandemic.\nHe explained that the convergence criteria had to be thorough so that the currency once implemented will serve the citizens effectively.\nThe process of the performance criteria is always prioritised if we want to be in a very favorable condition to introduce the single currency.\nSpeaking to journalists on the sideline of the session, Abiante said that the single currency is work in progress and there is hope that sometimes it will work.",

How many Nigerians own vehicles and generators that are benefiting from this subsidy?\u201d, she quipped.\n\nAhmed recalled that subsidy removal was to take effect from June 2022, but was moved by additional 12 months to 18 months.\n\nIn his remarks, Anambra Governor, Charles Soludo declared that the scrap was long overdue.\n\nThe former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor said if N3trillion is saved, each state of the federation could be given about N50 billion to fix roads.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government will still have some N1 trillion to use. If the country continues with the subsidy, the CBN will continue to need money.\u201d\n\nSoludo added that said subsidy can be brought down to the state level so that each governor decides the best way to go about it.\n\nAtedo Peterside, Founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank, suggested an alliance by major presidential candidates.\n\nPeterside urged them to work out an emergency deal concerning subsidies and save whoever wins from inheriting more issues.\n\nThe businessman said the time of a change of government is the best to work out a solution.\n\n\u201cLet us not just surrender and say we cannot do anything about fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe World Bank has done its bit; what needs to be done is by Nigerians to make one last push\u201d, he stressed.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday held a crucial meeting with the Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum as the search for running mate to the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu begun.\n\nThe party leaders are said to be discussing the criteria for selecting a suitable person, including experience, educational credentials and geo-political balance.\n\nIt was gathered that they are also considered the possibility of fielding a running mate who has a deep knowledge of the economy.\n\nThe consultation on the choice of an acceptable candidate continues, a source said.\n\nThe parley was attended by the Chief of Staff to the President Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha, PGF Chairman and governor of Kebbi State Senator Atiku Bagudu, Governors Babagana Zulum (Borno), Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Mohammed Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), Simon Lalong (Plateau), Yahaya Bello (Kogi) and Hope Uzodimma (Imo).\n\nUzordimma, who was at the meeting, said the constitution is silent on the religion and tribe of the vice presidential candidate.\n\nHe told State House Correspondents the decision on the choice of running mate lies with Tinubu and not the governors.\n\nHe, however, said if the choice was left for him, he would consider religious denomination, ethnicity, followership, and geographical spread since the business of politics is to win election.\n\nOn the possibility of a Muslim/Muslim ticket, Uzodimma said the Nigerian Constitution does not dwell on religion as a factor.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is nowhere in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria where religion is a factor or characteristic as to who becomes the president or who becomes the running mate.\n\n\u201cBut we are looking for united Nigeria, where governance will be the issue, where a president would be adjudged by his capacity to deliver democratic dividends, develops Nigeria to look like other parts of the Western world where democracy is working.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to reduce governance in Nigeria to certain things that will encourage divisiveness. Rather, we should be a united Nigeria, be our brother\u2019s keepers, have a president of Nigeria that will be a president representing, every tribe, every religion, every denomination, and when we get there, we will cross the bridge.\n\n\u201cThe decision also to choose a running mate does not reside with any of us \u2014 the governors. It is the presidential candidate that will look at the local characteristics and factors, political and apolitical, that will make him win his election and take the decision. So, it\u2019s not a decision that we will sit here and take for the candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether a single faith ticket was desirable, he responded: \u201cI did not say it is not about single faith ticket. I said there are internal characteristics that the decision maker may consider in the process of taking his decision. The decision whether to choose Mr. A or Mr. B to be a running mate to a candidate is entirely that of the candidate.\n\n\u201cYou started by saying the governors of the Southeast are complaining of not having the opportunity of being a running mate anymore. But that is not the sole ambition of the south easterners, talkless of the governors to be a running mate. And in the business of presidential primaries, there is no election for a vice presidential candidate. The business there is just to elect a candidate.\n\n\u201cIn that ballot paper, there is no room for delegates to vote for who will be your running mate. So, that explains why it is not a decision for the public, for the people. It is a decision for the candidate. The first thing to do is to let the candidate, now a candidate has emerged.\n\n\u201cNow the candidate will factor into consideration some ideas and issues like how to create a spread. Spread is very important to be able to attract votes. So, the decision of who becomes your running mate, if I were the candidate, what will inform it is what I will do that will enable me to get the kind of votes I\u2019m looking for because the ultimate goal is to win the election.\n\n\u201cSo, maybe I\u2019ll start from the denomination, ethnicity, or followership. In this business of democracy I think number is what is very important. And there are certain things as a nation, we should not bring to the public discuss.\n\n\u201cThose things that are capable of creating divisiveness against national unity should not be encouraged. It does not mean that I will not remember that I come from a place but I must also be cautious and careful how to use where I come from in taking national decisions. That is very important.\n\n\u201cThe second question which is about running mate, Southeast is not meant for running mate. What we wanted as a zone was to be the president of Nigeria and I was convinced that it was proper for us to ask for it.\n\n\u201cBut in this business, it is partisan democracy, the minority will have their view but the majority will have their way. In the wisdom of the delegates that elected presidential candidate, a candidate has emerged, our party (APC) will come together to work for our candidate and produce the next president. Simple,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Uzodimma admonished that each section of the country requires the others to be able to produce the president, saying that the Southeast zone will work on what has so far prevented it reaching the goal.\n\nHe maintained: \u201cWhen I appeared on Channels Television in the morning of the convention I told you that one of the conventions governing our polity in Nigeria is power shift. That power comes to the North and goes to the South. When power came to the South, in 1999, we ceded it to Southwest and all of us voted as Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe next time power came to the South, it went to Southsouth and all of us voted as Nigerians. We expected that now that power came back to the South, it will go to Southeast but this is not a decision that a geopolitical zone alone can do.\n\n\u201cNo geopolitical zone can become a president without the participation of other political zones. So, when you don\u2019t get the cooperation, you begin to find out why and you work towards getting the cooperation next time, because it has to be united country for you to become a president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about president of Southeast, president Southsouth or president of Southwest. We are talking of the president of Nigeria. For a Southerner to become a president, he needs to vote for North, for northerner to become the president he needs the vote from the South.\n\n\u201cIn our constitution, you must have two third of the states you must have at least minimum of 25% votes registered in those states. Today, so we\u2019ll look at the guidelines. We\u2019ll look at the rules. Our country is a rule-driven country. And the grand norm is the constitution of the country.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re working with it. All we\u2019re saying is that for equity, for fairness for justice, that there are certain sentiments to be considered when we\u2019re taking national decisions. But, we don\u2019t think that is enough to disorganise our country. We must move forward,\u201d he said.",

Let them tell us.\n\n\u201cWe have come to this country in peace, and now people want to visit us with war. You want to maim and kill us; it is not easy.\n\n\u201cIt is a dreadful assault. I said to people that if we were at war and we were armed and faced ourselves, in one day 40 people would not die from our side. But this is not war, we were not at war.\n\n\u201cThis is an assault on us, on our psyche. We cannot continue this way. We believe in this place, we believe in the Southwestern region. We believe in Yoruba. Is Yoruba part of the Nigeria we believe in? Yes.\n\n\u201cIf you get to the scene, I\u2019m sure it will bring tears out of your eyes. These criminals, these animals in human skin, what they did was horrendous.\n\n\u201cThey did not come to kidnap, they did not come to steal, they took no dime. They went into the church and shot at everything within their sight.\u201d\n\nAbiodun, who spoke on behalf of the other governors, wondered why Akeredolu\u2019s town was targeted.\n\nHe announced the donation of N25 million each from the governors.\n\nAbiodun said: \u201cWe find this attack as not just on the good people of Owo, or the good people of Ondo State, but the entire people of the Southwest.\n\n\u201cWe know that you (Akeredolu) have been at the vanguard of ensuring peace and security for your people. You are the champion of the Amotekun in the Southwest.\n\n\u201cWe, your brothers, wonder if this is more personal because of the role you have played in ensuring that our zone is secured.\n\n\u201cOne wonders if there is a particular reason this attack was launched in your hometown of Owo.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply pained; we are deeply saddened and we commiserate with you. We pray for the lives of the departed. We pray that the almighty God forgives their sins and accepts their souls.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos State government said the decision to mourn the victims came at a Southwest Governors\u2019 June 10 virtual meeting, which reviewed the security situation in the region.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, said in a statement: \u201cThe governors condemned in very strong terms the horrendous crime perpetrated by terrorists against the people and residents of Owo, Ondo State and, by extension, the peace-loving people of the Southwest\u2026\n\n\u201cGovernor Sanwo-Olu urges Lagos residents and visitors to remain law-abiding and vigilant as the government is doing everything to ensure that peace continues to prevail in the state.\u201d\n\nThe Fellowship of Churches of Christ in Nigeria, also known as Tarayyar Ekklesiyoyin Kristi a Nijeria (TEKAN), condemned the killing of the worshippers.\n\nIt urged the government to do more to secure lives.\n\nIts President Rev. Caleb Ahima and General Secretary Moses Ebuga said in a statement: \u201cThis is a matter of great concern to the Fellowship.\n\n\u201cAs a family, we are calling on the government and the security agencies to do the needful.\u201d",

Some were arrested and they are undergoing interrogations,\u201d Eradiri said.\n\nHe explained it would take a little longer for a substantive board to be constituted for the commission due to some recommendations in the report.\n\nAccording to him, some of the recommendations and findings had rendered the Act establishing the NDDC obsolete.\n\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the recommendations of the audit report, the existing Act establishing the EFCC is obsolete. Some of the issues were found to be a result of the default nature of the Act.\n\n\u201dThese are some of the gains of the forensic exercise, which the Presidency needs to first and foremost get to a logical conclusion before it can constitute the board.\u201d.\n\nEradiri added that the report queried the validity of the office of the board chairman, whose only responsibility was simply to sign agreements reached between the commission and stakeholders.\n\n\u201dThis chairman, who has no function other than signing agreements has an entire floor to himself with a retinue of staff and a retinue of vehicles including monthly allocations. When a budget is drawn a chunk of it goes into the servicing of the chairman whereas his function is supervisory,\u201d he said.\n\nEradiri added that the review would include ensuring justice and fairness for some member states, whose oil production had increased over the years.\n\n: \u201cThe Federal Government cannot in the middle of this game begin to change the goal post. The reason the audit was ordered was because of the defective Act, which had led to a series of infringements in the management of NDDC.\n\n\u201cIt will be very unwise for anybody to think that within this period, the government will appoint a board. When the main recommendations are implemented, a proper board devoid of some of the infractions that led to the setback of the NDDC will be constituted,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Faith Yahaya and Kelvin Osa Okunbor\n\nNigeria lost N1.3 trillion last year to neighbouring countries due to the absence of aviation facility investors, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has said.\n\nIt, therefore, called for measures to entice Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) investors to enhance aviation services, boost revenue and reduce unemployment.\n\nFAAN\u2019s Managing Director, Rabiu Yadudu made this known at a conference where Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika announced that the Federal Government would soon hand over the country\u2019s airports to the private sector due to its lack of expertise in managing them.\n\nIn the same vein, Sirika told participants at the maiden national aviation conference in Abuja that the Federal Government would take over state-owned airports like Kebbi, Dutse, Bauchi, and Gombe \u201cfor a very good reason.\u201d.\n\nThe theme of the conference was \u201dAdvancing the frontiers of possibilities for safe, secure and profitable air transport\u201d.\n\nThe FAAN boss, who lamented what he called the nation\u2019s \u201dgrossly underutilised\u201d air transport industry, said the government could rake in huge revenue from the sector because Nigeria currently has the highest number of aircraft in the sub-region.\n\nHe also spoke of the link between air transportation and tourism and listed the United Kingdom, France and the United Arab Emirates as some countries earning huge incomes from such relationships.\n\nYadudu said: \u201cOur potential and capacity in the global air transport industry is grossly underutilised. If we are desirous of attaining the status of a major player in the global aviation sphere, this is the time to reposition and move the industry forward.\n\n\u201cThe focus is on Nigeria because we have the largest fleet of aircraft within the subregion. As of 2021, it was reported that Nigeria lost about N1.25 trillion in MRO investments to neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cHaving such investments here would have created more employment opportunities for Nigerians, revenue generation and training of technical personnel for maintenance of aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe interlink and value chain between the air transport, tourism and hospitality industry for economic growth cannot be overemphasised.\n\n\u201cToday, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, London Bridge, Dubai Mall, Burj Khalifa, and the British Museum in the United Kingdom have all been consciously developed into major tourist attractions that drive passenger traffic to those destinations and by implication attract businesses and generate employment for the locals and foreigners alike.\u201d\n\nAviation Minister Sirika noted that the aviation industry has a lot of investment potential that is yet to be tapped into.\n\nHe also said the key components of the aviation roadmap would be implemented before the end of the Muhammadu Buhari administration.\n\nSirika stated that in line with the objectives of the aviation roadmap, airports in the country would be run by the private sector because the government has no expertise in running them.\n\nThe minister said: \u201cAs of the last count, we have about 43 airports. Some are airstrips but so long as it is a landing and take-off point well designed for the purpose of aviation, military or civil, we consider their airports. Some of them are private and some are state-owned but the majority of them are owned by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThose in the state are also being taken over by the Federal Government. Airports like Kebbi, Dutse, Bauchi, Gombe and the rest of them and we are doing that for a very good reason.\n\n\u201cPeople have been questioning why the federal government is taking over state-owned airports. It is government to government and the wisdom behind it will be well explained later.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced that it is the right way to go. However, it will eventually turn into the private sector because the roadmap being implemented by the federal government is such that everything airport will be owned and run by the private sector for more efficiency and value for money. People will now own it, we also strongly believe that government has no business in business.\u201d\n\nOn when the roadmap would be actualised, he said: \u201cWe are determined to pursue the actualisation of every component of the roadmap. Some of the key elements like the national carrier, MRO, airport concessions, and aviation leasing company have reached advanced stages of implementation and all will be concluded before the end of this administration.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the potential in the aviation industry, the minister said: \u201cThe aviation sector in Nigeria is a goldmine with lots of potentials waiting to be explored. Our vantage position in terms of regional positioning, population and natural resources has positioned us strategically as continental leaders.\n\n\u201cThis country went into recession twice beginning in 2016, the only single source of earning; the oil plummeted from $140 to $30 per barrel and for a long time and in recession.\n\n\u201cWe were also unfortunately hit by the COVID-19 pandemic that also has an impact on the industry in Nigeria. Regardless, aviation during the period of President Buhari, 2015 till date has grown\u201d.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe first four years saw the increase in passenger number from eight to 18million and aviation became the fastest growing industry. Even with COVID-19, it is now the third fastest-growing economy.\n\n\u201cIn this country today, the rate of return on investment is 34 per cent and our four airports, for now, are being designated as a free zone for ease of business.\n\n\u201cWhether you are a foreigner or a Nigerian, we want to assure you that an aviation sector is a place where you can put your money and you will not lose.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nCatholic Secretariat of Nigeria (CSN) has joined in cautioning political parties against fielding candidates from same religion, Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian.\n\nIt described the option as most insensitive and a tacit endorsement of the negative voices of many non-state actors who have been threatening the nation\u2019s unity and peaceful coexistence without arrest.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nFr. Michael Umoh, the church noted that the decision by any political party to field candidates of same religion wouldn\u2019t have been an issue, but for the fragility and suspicion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, there would have been nothing wrong with a Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian ticket in a democratic dispensation if there is mutual trust and respect for the human person and where the overriding desire for seeking political office is the fostering of the common good. But one cannot really say so of our country at the moment.\n\n\u201cWith the present glaring crisis and division in the nation, a Muslim-Muslim ticket would be most insensitive and a tacit endorsement of the negative voices of many non-state actors who have been threatening this nation\u2019s unity and peaceful coexistence without an arrest.\n\n\u201cEven in the despotic military era, most juntas ensured a balance of the religious architecture in their regimes. For instance, we had Murtala-Obasanjo, Obasanjo-Yar\u2019adua, Babangida-Ebitu Ukiwe, Abacha \u2013 Diya. This also applied to the Heads of the various military formations and the different government parastatals like Customs, Immigrations, Finance, etc. Significantly, it was only during the General Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s era as military Head of State (31 December,1983 \u2013 27 August,1985) that we had a Muslim-Muslim military dictatorship.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, only once did we have a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 1993 democratic elections, which featured Abiola-Kingibe ticket and turned out to be one of Nigeria\u2019s freest and fairest elections. But that government never took off. Fast forward to 2022, 30 years later, some individuals have tried to suggest the Muslim-Muslim ticket for the Presidential election in a country like Nigeria that has unfortunately been badly polarised.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church, thus, advised political parties toying with divisive agenda to have a rethink by presenting a more inclusive ticket, while calling on all people of goodwill to resist the budding injustice that may be hatched against a cross section of the people.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that all Nigerians, irrespective of creed or region, are equal, as such, there must be sensitivity in the spread of political positions without compromising competence. We call on all Nigerians, individually and collectively, to do everything in their power to seek and work for peace, unity and justice in Nigeria,\u201d it said.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe report stated that petrol subsidies could cost Nigeria as much as N5.4 trillion in 2022, much higher than \u201call of the resources allocated to health, education, and social protection together\u201d.\n\nIt also projected that net oil/ gas revenue for 2022 will fall to N1.6 trillion from N2.6 trillion recorded in 2021.\n\nThe startling report was presented by the Lead Economist for Nigeria at the World Bank, Dr. Marco Hernandez, who attributed the economic nightmare to a plethora of policy distortions on the part of the Nigerian government and global shocks that have fueled inflation.\n\nHe painted a particularly worrisome picture of the Nigerian situation, that it was not just the price of imported products that were skyrocketing, but includes locally-produced goods.\n\nHernandez noted that the high inflation has crashed the value of the national minimum wage of N30,000 ($82), which is now worth N22,000 ($37).\n\nThe fast-eroding minimum wage aside, the World Bank reckoned that most Nigerian families earn N15,000 monthly which was worsening the poverty situation in the country.\n\nHe further stated that there is a nexus between foreign exchange rate and inflation, adding that when the former\u2019s rates go up at the parallel market, inflation rate follows automatically.\n\nHe said: \u201csuboptimal exchange rate management is fuelling inflation due to FX supply constraints and lack of predictability, which is ultimately leading to a rise in the parallel exchange rate which is closely associated with inflation.\n\n\u201cImport and FX restrictions reduce the supply of food and key staples, increasing their prices and those of associated goods. The monetization of fiscal deficits by the Central Bank of Nigeria (ways and means) and CBN\u2019s subsidized lending to firms add to inflationary expectations\u201d.\n\nThe report noted that despite that the rising price of crude in the international market due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Nigeria\u2019s oil production and revenue have continued to slump because of several factors.\n\nThe Bank said it was quite concerned about Nigeria\u2019s fiscal side, emphasizing that Nigeria needa to address fiscal deficits most urgently.\n\nReacting to the report, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who spoke virtually noted that the huge amount spent on petrol subsidy has put the economy on ventilators and threatening its survival.\n\nShe passed the buck on subsidy removal to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe really are at a crossroads and there are very difficult times. It is actually paradoxical. At a time when growth is accelerating there are so many other challenges that have gathered and are impacting the lives of the people.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we are going to reduce the fiscal pressures caused by the increase in our deficit caused by increase in PMS subsidies. These PMS subsidies are costing us an additional N4 trillion than was originally planned.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Lagos\n\nThe Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has revealed that Nigeria lost at least $2.5 billion (about N1.25 trillion) in the maintenance of its aircraft to foreign Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities in 2021.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday in Abuja at the inaugural National Aviation Conferences (FNAC) organised by FAAN with the theme: \u2018Advancing the Frontiers of Possibilities for Safe, Secure and Profitable Air Transport,\u2019 the Managing Director of FAAN, Capt Rabiu Yadudu, said that such capital flight would have been saved if the country had MRO facilities that could adequately cater for all types of aircraft.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nTo typically carry out C-check on Boeing 737 aircraft or its category, airlines spend at least $1.8 million and C-check is carried out on aircraft every 18 months.\n\nYadudu said that Nigeria\u2019s potential in the global air transport industry is underutilised as Nigeria has the largest fleet of aircraft within the subregion.\n\n\u201dIt was reported that Nigeria lost $2.5 billion (about N1.25 trillion) in MRO investments to neighbouring countries. Having such investments here would have created more employment opportunities for Nigerians, revenue generation and training of technical personnel for maintenance of aircraft,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dThe interlink and value chain between the air transport, tourism and hospitality industry for economic growth cannot be over-emphasised. Today, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, London bridge, Dubai Mall, Burj Khalifa, the British Museum in the United Kingdom, etc, have all been consciously developed into major tourist attractions that drive passenger traffic to those destinations and by implication attract businesses and generate employments for the locals and foreigners alike,\u201d he said.\n\nYadudu lauded the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, the Permanent Secretary, Directors of the Federal Ministry of Aviation, the Senate and House Committee Chairmen and other stakeholders for supporting the industry at all times.\n\nEarlier, Sirika in his goodwill message, disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari would at any moment from now sign into law the passed Civil Aviation Bill by the National Assembly.\n\nHe assured that with the president\u2019s assent to the bill, the Nigerian aviation industry would grow rapidly, while more opportunities would also be created for all stakeholders and investors.\n\nHe pointed out that the Aviation Industry Roadmap as approved by the Federal Government was intentionally fashioned after the Public-Private Participation (PPP) model with the plan to grow the entire sector.\n\nHe challenged investors to tap into the myriads of opportunities in the sector, especially with the recently approved 12, hectares of land for implementation of the aviation roadmap by the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nSome of the aviation roadmaps include MRO, Aviation Leasing Company, National Carrier, Aerospace University, Airport Concession and Aerorropolis amongst others.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to pursue all the components of the roadmap. Every part of the roadmap has reached advanced stages and all would be delivered before the end of this administration. The aviation industry in Nigeria is a goldmine, but it is still a virgin.\n\n\u201dGlobally, the core variables that sustain the aviation industry are safety and security. We must continue to sustain these in the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\u2022Between March 3 and April 1, production curtailment pushed the country\u2019s total loss to 5.545 million barrels\n\n\u2022Political risks may worsen ahead of elections in early 2023, says Platts Analytics\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s crude oil output has plunged to new low in recent weeks hit by pipeline closures and maintenance at major fields, an S&P Global industry report has indicated.\n\nA senior official from the country\u2019s oil ministry told S&P Global Commodity Insights the fields that feeds two major exports grade \u2014 Bonny Light and Qua Iboe \u2014 were down on maintenance in May but output was \u201cgradually returning\u201d.\n\nTHISDAY recently reported how with over 3.65 million barrels of crude oil shut-in at the Bonny Terminal during the March/April productions circle, Nigeria\u2019s total losses, month-on-month rose by over 300 per cent.\n\nAn analysis of the figures from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) indicated that the huge loss was due to a force majeure on the critical line which supplies a substantial part of the country\u2019s export.\n\nOverall, between March 3 and April 1, the production curtailment pushed the country\u2019s total loss to 5.545 million barrels of crude for the month as opposed to 1.69 million barrels previously.\n\nForce majeure refers to a clause in contracts that allows both parties to walk out of the contract when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties happens.\n\nAt the time, the 1.69 million barrels\u2019 losses, although huge, was seen as a major improvement on the January 2022 high of 7.5 million barrels lost to the phenomenon, a development that has negatively impacted the country\u2019s capacity to export the commodity.\n\nNigeria has for over a year been unable to meet the production quota allocated to it by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) due to losses to facilities\u2019 breakdown, vandalism and outright sabotage as well as community issues.\n\nThe country\u2019s upstream petroleum sector has also struggled in the last one year, due to deteriorating facilities occasioned by waning investment as well as oil theft.\n\nSince this year, the NNPC has failed to remit its statutory funding of the Federation Account, a joint pool collectively operated by the federal, state and local governments despite the rising international prices of oil.\n\nBut Bonny which lost the highest amount of oil for the period, according to the THISDAY review, was followed by Odudu terminal which experienced a whopping 937,663 barrels leakage due to what the NNPC described as maintenance work.\n\nBut the challenge appeared to have worsened in May as the S&P reported quoted other industry sources as saying that the Nembe Creek and Trans Forcados pipelines had repeatedly come under sabotage, and flow through the lines had been sporadic in the past month.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s largest oil producer has had to deal with a barrage of security, operational and technical problems at its key oil infrastructure since early 2021,\u201d it stated.\n\nAlthough OPEC is yet to release its production figures for May, S&P stated that crude and condensate production in May fell 14 per cent month on month to 1.279 million barrels per day, quoting data from the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC).\n\nThat was the lowest in more than three decades, according to estimates from S&P Global.\n\nNigeria has seen its crude and condensate production drop to almost half its production capacity of around 2.2 million bpd.\n\nA majority of key oil fields, terminals and facilities have been experiencing teething problems and a recent resurgence in attacks on oil facilities have exacerbated the situation.\n\nRising pipeline sabotage and insecurity in the Niger Delta are also hampering the growth outlook for Africa\u2019s largest oil producer.\n\nIn a recent note, Platts Analytics said it expected Nigerian crude supply to rise to 1.5 million bpd from the fourth quarter of 2022 from 1.4 million bpd in April.\n\n\u201cPolitical risks may worsen ahead of elections in early 2023,\u201d Platts Analytics said.\n\n\u201cProduction has averaged about 300,000 bpd below its OPEC+ quota since mid-2021 due to technical outages, theft and sabotage and force majeure,\u201d it added.\n\nThe declining oil production comes at a difficult time for Nigeria, which is also fighting a wave of divestments from international oil companies.\n\nThe government has had lofty targets to boost exploration and production and increase oil reserves and output to 40 billion barrels and 3 million bpd, respectively, by the mid-2020s. Those targets have started to look unachievable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "NITDA's Code of Practice to help Nigeria regulate social media",
          "text": "Months after it lifted its 7-month ban on Twitter, the Nigerian government has set out to regulate social media platforms with a new Code of Practice. Plans for the Code of Practice were announced in January by Director-General of NITDA, Mr Kashifu Inuwa.\n\nYesterday, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) announced that it had developed a draft Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries\u2014defined by the code as \u201celectronic medium or site where services are provided by means of a computer resource and on-demand and where users create, upload, share, disseminate, modify, or access information, including websites that provide reviews, gaming Platform, online sites for conducting commercial transactions.\u201d\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n13th June 2022\n\n\n\nNational Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Issues a Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries and Conditions for Operating in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/N9y3qfyCIu \u2014 NITDA Nigeria (@NITDANigeria) June 13, 2022\n\nAccording to NITDA, the draft was developed in collaboration with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC), with input from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, and TikTok.\n\nIn the statement signed by NITDA Head of Corporate Affairs and External Relationships, Hadiza Umar, the Code is supposedly aimed at \u201cprotecting the fundamental human rights of Nigerians and non-Nigerians living in the country, as well as defining guidelines for interacting on the digital ecosystem\u201d.\n\nWhat the Code instructs\n\nNITDA instructs that all Interactive Computer Service Platforms with more than 100,000 users would be required to fulfil certain conditions in order to operate in the country. While this includes US-based social media platforms, it also includes indigenous sites like Nairaland, blogs like Linda Ikeji, and newsletter platforms like Substack with over 100,000 users.\n\nThese platforms would have to register as legal entities with the country\u2019s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), pay taxes, appoint country representatives, and more notably, \u201cprovide information to the Nigerian government on harmful accounts, troll groups, and deleting all information that violates Nigerian law\u201d.\n\nThe draft Code is divided into 5 parts with the first 2 parts laying down the responsibilities of the Interactive Computer Service Platforms, while Part IV\u2014titled \u201cProhibitions\u201d\u2014lays down orders for the removal of material prohibited by Nigerian law. According to the draft, \u201cProhibited Material\u201d includes anything that threatens public interest, order, security, peace and morality\u2014content which must be taken down within 24 hours.\n\nIn Part I of the draft Code, NITDA lays down 11 primary responsibilities which include abiding by Nigerian laws, providing dedicated channels for government agencies to lodge complaints, removing any content reported by government agencies within 24 hours, disclosing identities of reported creators to the Nigerian government, and expeditiously removing non-consensual sexual content.\n\nPart II of the draft Code consigns 12 additional responsibilities including the requirement for Interactive Computer Service Platforms to file annual compliance reports that detail the numbers of [active] registered Nigerian users, deactivated accounts, and removed content, among other things. This part lists the responsibilities of the platforms to inform the users of their obligations which include abiding by all Nigerian laws.\n\nNigeria\u2019s poor regulatory history\n\nThere are few provisions within the draft Code that fulfills NITDA\u2019s aim of \u201cprotecting the fundamental human rights of Nigerians\u201d. For example, Items 4 and 5 of Part I seek to protect Nigerians from promoting revenge porn and child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), while Item 1 of Part II promotes equal distribution of information for Nigerian users.\n\nAccording to \u2018Tooni Ajiboye, a lawyer and writer, \u201cThe good part of the bill is that it tries to hold these social media platforms accountable for all the information and mechanisms promoted on their platform. There are, however, red flags in the draft Code and they unfortunately outweigh the good.\u201d\n\nAs Ajiboye explains it, the biggest red flag in the draft Code is how much information it wants to control. \u201cThere are about 5 classes of information highlighted: misinformation, disinformation, harmful content, unlawful content, and prohibited materials. While unlawful content already has legal backing, misinformation and harmful content are left to discretion. It\u2019s easy to point out where child sexual abuse materials are criminalised in Nigerian law but the same can\u2019t be said for what the draft defines as prohibited or harmful material.\u201d\n\nPart IV of the code, which examines Prohibited Material, prescribes that all content that is contrary to morality, or public interest should be deleted once a complaint is made. This brings to light the possibility of the Nigerian government going after citizens who post materials in support of LGBTQ persons, or anyone posting content deemed religiously \u201cblasphemous\u201d, a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment in many Nigerian states.\n\nPart IV of NITDA\u2019s draft Code of Practice\n\nWhile these provisions wouldn\u2019t constitute a problem in other regions, Nigeria\u2019s history is riddled with fundamental human rights infringement and the misappropriation of laws. In the events following its #EndSARS protests where Nigerian youths fighting against police brutality were thrust into the global spotlight, many faced imprisonment and financial sanctions due to their involvement on and off social media.\n\nThe #EndSARS event, which also sparked commentary from celebrities like Rihanna, Trevor Noah, and ex-US president Barack Obama, spurred numerous attempts by the Nigerian government to regulate social media. There was the social media bill of 2019, and the hate speech bill which proscribed death as the penalty for hate speech. In 2021, there was also an attempt to modify the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act to cover social media platforms.\n\nNigerians are against the bill\n\nSince the bill was announced yesterday, many Nigerians have taken to social media, specifically Twitter, to express their concerns over the bill.\n\nLawyer and satirist Elnathan John said, \u201cThis is such a dangerous thing the Nigerian government is trying to do. They want to be able to track and harass citizens on social media.\u201d\n\nThis is such a dangerous thing the Nigerian government is trying to do. They want to be able to track and harass citizens on social media. https://t.co/JPhGnQp5GT \u2014 Elnathan John (@elnathan_john) June 14, 2022\n\nAjiboye noted that the Code is still in its draft stage so there\u2019s the possibility that most of its provisions would be revised. \u201cSpeaking objectively, they\u2019re releasing the draft so they can get feedback from stakeholders and ensure that whatever is enacted is palatable to the people the Code will apply to.\u201d\n\nThe draft Code is yet to be enacted but many Nigerians have been encouraged by Digital Africa Research Labs, an NGO studying social media misuse on the continent, to send their comments to NITDA at info@nitda.gov.ng. TechCabal has reached out to Digital Africa Research Labs for more comments but is yet to receive responses at the time of publication.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kenya\u2019s controversial \u201cICT Practitioners Bill\u201d is closer to becoming law",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Kenya\u2019s 12th parliament passed the controversial 2020 proposal that seeks to regulate \u201canyone who employs technologies to collect, process, store or transfer information for a fee\u201d.\n\nFirst introduced in 2016 by majority leader, Aden Duale, and supported by Kenyan MP, Godfrey Osotsi, the wide-sweeping and vague ICT Practitioners Bill mandated the registration and licensing of vaguely defined \u201cICT practitioners\u201d by a council. According to the 2016 proposal, individuals who sought registration with the council needed to have completed a university education with at least 3 years of relevant experience and would pay an annual license fee. The proposal also outlined jail terms and fines for individuals who failed to comply.\n\nA snapshot of the amended 2020 bill. The full bill is here.\n\nNeedless to say, the proposal drew an outcry from the country\u2019s tech community and was reportedly withdrawn after Joseph Mucheru, Cabinet Secretary in Kenya\u2019s Ministry of Information and Computer Technology, rejected it, noting that proposals in the bill would affect innovative talent and alienate local youth from lucrative online jobs, educational and investment opportunities. At the time, Mucheru had said, \u201cIf enacted, the ICT Protection Bill 2016 will cause duplication in regulation and frustrate individual talents from realising their potential.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2016.\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, a member of parliament who was nominated to represent workers, Godfrey Osotsi, reintroduced the bill with an amendment that simply loosened the eligibility requirement for ICT professionals. Now instead of being required to have graduated from a university, a proposed ICT Practitioners Council would determine who got registered.\n\nIn 2018, the bill was also rejected.\n\nAgain, 2 years later in November 2020, the bill was reintroduced with superficial amendments that removed degree requirements, jail terms, and fines for people who fail to register.\n\nAlmost 2 years later, this Wednesday in a sleepy parliamentary session, and with one day to go before the 12th parliament closed shop for the term, the bill was quietly passed and now awaits presidential assent.\n\nWho is supporting this bill?\n\nWhile the bill has generated outrage from stakeholders in Kenya\u2019s tech community, there is significant support from a raft of tech professionals. In 2016, the Secretary-General of the ICT Association of Kenya (ICTAK), Kamotho Njenga, released a statement supporting the bill. \u201cOnce enacted,\u201d the statement read in part, \u201cthe various provisions enlisted will go a long way not only to elevate the standards of ICT practice in Kenya but to also avail a blueprint that will help counter multiple challenges that accompany emergent technologies. By creating a registration framework, the bill injects professionalism and introduces a culture of accountability within the industry as the country gears towards an ICT-driven economy.\u201d\n\nPaul Macharia, a health informatics consultant supports the proposal. \u201cHaving worked in the ICT space for over 15 years, I know we needed a regulatory body like yesterday.\u201d he opined. He says the bill will ensure standards of competence, allow governments to keep a register of all the professionals that meet these standards and deal with the professionals that fall short of these standards.\n\nBoth Macharia and the ICTAK\u2019s points are the standard arguments of the proponents of the bill. But Kenya already has a Computer Misuse Act and a Cyber Crimes Act\u2014both wide-sweeping laws that regulate the use of technology in Kenya, so it is not clear how or why another law is needed to stop the so-called quacks from operating. Besides this, the bill does not disclose how the council would issue accreditation for ICT professionals or provide the criteria to be used in determining if an individual is of good moral standing.\n\nThat \u201cquack\u201d classification is also problematic. Information technology is one of the most dynamic and fast-growing spaces globally. Unlike civil engineering or medical health, for example, a software developer does not need to be certified to build software. Indeed many of today\u2019s widely used tech products are built and maintained by unlicensed developers. No country has the sort of national ICT licensing programme that this bill proposes.\n\nBut Macharia contends that Kenya can lead the way, \u201cSure! Kenya being the first is a great thing,\u201d he wrote in a LinkedIn comment. \u201cWe could set the pace/standard on how ICT professionals work.\u201d\n\nA black spot for Silicon Savannah\n\nKenya\u2019s Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 depends on strong performance from its burgeoning ICT sector. Photo by Mustafa Omar on Unsplash\n\nA loose alignment of tech stakeholders and professionals who have been fighting the bill since its debut in 2016 disagree.\n\nIn a draft counter-statement to the ICTAK\u2019s 2016 declaration seen by this writer, the group wrote, \u201cRegistering of practitioners does not necessarily lead to professionalism and accountability. ICTAK has not cited any direct evidence that registering of practitioners affects the overall quality of services provided to customers by members of a regulated profession.\u201d\n\nThe statement continues, \u201cAlmost every ICT job is conducted within the confines of \u201ccontracts\u201d that define the responsibilities of parties involved, hence ensuring accountability. What values shall this bill add to the accountability of ICT practitioners, that is beyond the scope of contracts we sign today as we go about our duties?\u201d\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d\u2026 gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem.\n\nMembers of the group also organised a petition which garnered over 14,000 votes at the time and succeeded in getting the bill withdrawn twice. But the almost comical and steady 2-year-gap-march of the bill appears to have won out\u2014at least in parliament.\n\nStakeholders now fear a presidential assent on the bill could seal what has been described as rent-seeking behaviour.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I think the bill is detrimental is that innovation is about thinking outside the box,\u201d Sheena Raikundalia, Director of UK-Kenya Tech Hub told TechCabal, \u201cit\u2019s not about your degree or paper certificates. Some of the best techies I know are self-taught! Tech moves so fast, [that] by the time you finish your degree what you learnt is outdated. This is taking a step back.\u201d\n\nAffectionately described as Africa\u2019s Silicon Savannah, Kenya is one of the Big Four technology heavyweights in Africa. As recently as last month, Microsoft and Google set up new offices in Nairobi, global card payment association, Visa announced that it had opened an innovation hub\u2014one of only 6 in the world, and Amazon announced plans to open an Amazon Web Services (AWS) local zone in the country. These are all a significant testament to the East African nation\u2019s tech reputation which also ranks 4th on the list of African countries with the most professional developers only behind Nigeria, South Africa and Egypt.\n\nKenya\u2019s government says that its Long Term Development Blueprint, Vision 2030 will make the nation a globally competitive and prosperous nation by promoting \u201clocal ICT software development,\u201d and making ICT Software more affordable and accessible\u201d. But in a heating tech talent market, poorly thought out regulation that looks, to all intents, like pure gatekeeping can have serious adverse effects on its nascent tech ecosystem. Right now Kenya is distracted by its upcoming national elections, and reports of social media-fueled hate speech and misinformation are increasing. Those are important areas for regulation; deciding who is qualified to build a mobile app is not.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Economics and Politics 2023: The state of play (1)",
          "text": "The conclusion of the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential primary last week, with the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as its presidential candidate, largely marked the end of the presidential primary season. About the same time, the New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP) concluded its presidential primary, and as expected, elected Rabiu Kwankwaso as its flagbearer. In the week before, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) voted Abubakar Atiku as its presidential candidate and the Labour Party (LP) picked Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra State and until a week before then, a presidential aspirant of PDP as it flag bearer in the 2023 elections.\n\nAhead of the June 17th deadline for the upload of the candidates\u2019 details on the portal of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the most critical activity this week will be the nomination of Vice-Presidential Candidates. Both the ruling party and the PDP have a high-level political conundrum to deal with. APC will have to decide whether it feels Nigerians, especially the Christian community, will accept a Muslim \u2013 Muslim ticket, while the PDP will seek a candidate that can neutralise the growing popularity of Peter Obi across the country, especially in the Southeast, a section of the country that have largely voted PDP since 1999, and never had a presidential candidate in any major party.\n\nFor electoral purposes, it is easy to understand why the APC will want to choose a Northern Muslim as its Vice-Presidential candidate. The pool is wide, and the political capacity is robust. However, many will think it smacks of one of the greatest political insensitivities in Nigeria\u2019s political history. In the eight years since Muhammadu Buhari became President, Nigeria has become intensely polarised along ethnic, religious, and regional lines. The APC, as the ruling party, deliberately ignoring that by choosing a Northern Muslim as its Vice-Presidential Candidate will further reinforce the perception that it is a protagonist \u201cMuslim\u201d party.\n\nAs recently analysed by my colleagues here in BusinessDay, based on the work done by VIISAUS (See https://businessday.ng/big-read/article/emergence-of-voting-blocs-northern-alliance-bible-belt-and-rockies/, there are now three distinct voting blocs in Nigeria. There is the Northern Alliance, comprising 11 States \u2013 Gombe, Sokoto, Jigawa, Zamfara, Kano, Kebbi, Bauchi, Katsina, Yobe, Bornu and Osun States. Osun is the outlier. They are the country\u2019s most active voters when measured by voters turn out, with an average of 41%. There are also the Bible Belt and the Rockies, but the details are not required for this analysis. The most important thing to note is that the PDP has not won in any of these States in 19 years. What do they have in common? They largely vote on the basis of \u201cBuhari\u201d and religion. For APC therefore, given that Buhari will not be on the ballot next year, it is important for them to have a strong Muslim Vice-Presidential candidate to retain those States.\n\nFigure 2. The three voter\u2019s categories \u2013 The Northern Alliance, the bible belt, and the Rockies\n\nFor PDP, the question is about clout and a Vice Presidential Candidate that can make a difference. It is largely conclusive that the candidate will emerge from either the South South or the South East. In the South South, the most likely candidate is the current governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa. The other candidate from the region is the Rivers State Governor, Ezenwo Nyesom Wike, who came second at the primaries. Another contender is the current governor of Akwa Ibom State Udom Gabriel Emmanuel. As said before, the conundrum is how to choose a candidate that, at best, helps reinforce the PDP\u2019s position in the South East and South South by encouraging a strong turnout for the PDP in those regions.\n\nQ: In the eight years since Muhammadu Buhari became President, Nigeria has become intensely polarised along ethnic, religious, and regional lines\n\nFor Peter Obi of the Labour party and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the NNPP, the choice of Vice-Presidential Candidates will be most interesting. Particularly for Obi, it may give the strongest indication yet of how he sees his chances and the scope of his expectations for the 2023 elections. Indeed, rumours were rife after he left the PDP that he was going to team up with Kwankwaso, as that would have provided a strong platform to build on the Kwankwasiya movement in the North, starting with the about 5 million votes at stake in Kano.\n\nGiven the developments since the Presidency changed hands eight years ago, the 2023 presidential election is increasingly becoming a very critical one for Nigeria. The changes to the electoral law, especially the signed Electoral Act of 2022, replacing that of 2010, is poised to make the 2023 elections very interesting, in two major respects. First is the Permanent Voters Card (PVC). Before the PVC, the constant electoral cycle registration was a cesspit route to corruption and rigging, underscored by multiple voting. On the back of the card reader in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari beat an incumbent President and marked the first time that happened in Nigeria.\n\nFor the general elections next year, INEC has developed a new technology for the process. The Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) is touted to reduce multiple voting through improved verification of PVCs and the uploading of results real time on election day. However, reports from its use in Isoko South 1 constituency election in September 2021, the Anambra State governorship election November 2021 and the recent FCT Area council elections of February 2022, point to a slow and poorly functioning system. The system will be further tested in the Ekiti and Osun gubernatorial elections before the general elections next year.\n\nNow, in 2023, whoever becomes President, will inherit an economy that is less in size compared to that of 2015. In that year, the size of the Nigerian economy in current US dollars was US$546.68 billion and using 2021 figures, it is about US$436 billion. In eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari, he has presided over an average GDP growth of less than 1 percent, two recessions, and declining per capita income. The new President will be confronted by the largest domestic and external debt in Nigeria\u2019s history, a relentless security problem, and a polarised nation.\n\nAlso, following from Covid\u201319 and the war in Ukraine, the United Nations released a report highlighting three dimensions of the present global crisis \u2013 food, energy and tightening financial conditions. The report \u2013 Global Impact of War in Ukraine on food, energy, and finance systems released April 2022, is the latest to show the devastating effects of the ongoing crisis on many developing countries, including Nigeria. These problems will be there in 2023.\n\nIn the coming series, we will look into other dimensions of the economics and politics ahead 2023. By the end of this week, the Vice-Presidential candidates will be known. After that, the focus will move onto how each of the candidates seeks to deal with the challenges of security, economy and poverty, structural issues and federalism. We will look into the manifestos, programmes and policies of each of the candidates, and also provide some context of shifts in the Northern Alliance, the Bible Belt, and the Rockies.",

          "text": "International financial institution, the World Bank, has said rising inflation in Nigeria is likely to push an additional one million people into poverty by the end of 2022.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institution made the projection in its latest Nigeria Development Update (NDU), released on Tuesday.\n\nThe report, titled \u2018The continuing urgency of business unusual\u2019, said inflation in Nigeria, already one of the highest in the world before the war in Ukraine, is expected to increase further as a result of the rise in global fuel and food prices caused by the war.\n\n\u201cAnd that, the World Bank estimates, is likely to push an additional one million Nigerians into poverty by the end of 2022, on top of the 6 million Nigerians that were already predicted to fall into poverty this year because of the rise in prices, particularly food prices,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe bank noted that Nigeria is in a paradoxical situation where growth prospects have improved but inflationary and fiscal pressures have also increased considerably, leaving the economy much more vulnerable.\n\nThe situation, according to it, is because of the ballooning cost of gasoline subsidies at a time when oil production continues to decline.\n\n\u201cHence, Nigeria, for the first time since its return to democracy, and alone amongst major oil exporters, is unlikely to benefit fiscally from the windfall opportunity created by higher global oil prices,\u201d the World Bank warned.\n\nSpeaking on the report, Shubham Chaudhuri, World Bank country director for Nigeria, said:\n\n\u201cWhen we launched our previous Nigeria Development Update in November 2021, we estimated that Nigeria could stand to lose more than three trillion naira in revenues in 2022 because the proceeds from crude oil sales, instead of going to the federation account, would be used to cover the rising cost of gasoline subsidies that mostly benefit the rich. Sadly, that projection turned out to be optimistic.\n\n\u201cWith oil prices going up significantly, and with it, the price of imported gasoline, we now estimate that the foregone revenues as a result of gasoline subsidies will be closer to five trillion naira in 2022.\n\n\u201cAnd that five trillion is urgently needed to cushion ordinary Nigerians from the crushing effect of double-digit increases in the cost of basic commodities, to invest in Nigeria\u2019s children and youth, and in the infrastructure needed for private businesses small and large to flourish, grow and create jobs.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank said Nigeria\u2019s growing macroeconomic challenges in 2022 has shown the need for the continuing urgency of a departure from business as usual, and the need for consensus around a package of robust reforms.",

          "text": "Ahead of the forthcoming general election in 2023, the Nigerian Army has cautioned its personnel to maintain their professional ethics and shun any act of partisanship in the discharge of their duties.\n\nThe chief of army staff, Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya, who gave this warning during the second quarter of the Chief of Army Staff Conference, also ordered a review of rules of engagement and code of conduct for soldiers providing security during the 2023 general elections under Operation Safe Conduct.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe warning may not be unconnected to complaints in the past of soldiers working with certain elements in off-cycle elections in some South West states to tilt the election in favour of the party in power.\n\nThe COAS, however, asserted that all personnel, especially unit commanders and officers, must remain apolitical while providing an enabling environment for the electoral process.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, let me hasten to remind us that the nation is currently preparing for general elections. All personnel must remain apolitical while providing an enabling and secure environment for electoral processes to thrive.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I directed the review of Rules of Engagement and Code of Conduct for Operation Safe Conduct; the approved guidelines would be conveyed to you soon,\u201d Lt Gen Yahaya said, adding that the Nigerian Army will continue to enhance its civil-military relations efforts and provide the necessary support in aid of the civil authority.\n\nAccording to him, the successes achieved in military operations were facilitated by the commitment of the political leadership towards enhancing operational competences of the Nigerian Army as well as its general logistics, welfare, and wellbeing of the troops.\n\nGeneral Yahaya said troops in the North East of Operation Hadin Kai had sustained the onslaught against the terrorists leading to the clearance of several criminal enclaves and the surrendering of large numbers of insurgents and their families.\n\nHe stated that concrete effort had also been made to contain and check the secessionist activities in the South East and illegal oil bunkering activities in the South South.\n\nHe said while the South West has remained relatively calm, the Army has reinvigorated operations across North Central and North West theatres which are yielding positive results.\n\nHe, therefore, said the conference would enable the Army to reevaluate strategies and establish new benchmarks for enhancement of operations in all theatres of operations.\n\nThe COAS further assured that the Nigerian Army will continue to sustain its effort to provide the enabling environment for socio economic activities to thrive.\n\nThe Army chief further noted that the Army\u2019s training activities had also improved significantly as it continues to vigorously pursue adequate training of personnel both locally and overseas.\n\n\u201cThe current efforts by our foreign partners in bringing relevant and mission-oriented training to our personnel are yielding the desired results.\n\n\u201cThe positive feedback on the effect of the training from Restore Hope 1 and II, and Project Stinger in the theatres of operation since the deployment of the trainees is encouraging. Accordingly, we shall continue to devote premium attention to our training activities as this remains the best welfare for our troops and fundamental requirement for successful operations.\u201d\n\nHe restated that the Nigerian Army had continued to make giant strides in infrastructural development.\n\nThis, he said, is to ensure adequate accommodation as can be seen in the number of commissioned living quarters for troops and several ongoing renovation works in various barracks across the country.\n\nHe thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for his strategic guidance and the confidence he always reposes in the Nigerian Army and \u201cfor always standing with us in the provision of funds for the procurement of new platforms, and other support and requirements.\u201d",

          "title": "Presidential Running Mates: Candidates, Parties Face Hard Choices 72 Hours To Deadline",
          "text": "Barely 72 hours to the deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for political parties to supply it with the names of their presidential and vice-presidential candidates, the main parties are having a hard time choosing the running mates to their presidential candidates.\n\nEach party is considering how to balance the religion and regional divides in such a way that would help it win the general election in 2023.\n\nStakeholders in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have insisted that the running mate to the party\u2019s presidential flag bearer, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, must be a northern Christian.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe APC national stakeholders have urged the party\u2019s leadership to ensure national inclusion which, according to them, would help to manage divisive tendencies and promote national unity.\n\nThis is in spite of the fact that Kashim Shettima, Nasir El-Rufai and Abdullahi Ganduje are still on the card.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja yesterday, spokesman of the APC national stakeholders, Aliyu Audu, implored the governing party to narrow its search for the vice-presidential candidate of the party to a Christian from the North, which he said the party has in abundance.\n\nThe stakeholders noted that just as the APC was able to ensure the emergence of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a southern Muslim as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, the party leadership should also work towards the emergence of a Christian running mate from the northern part of the country.\n\nAudu stated: \u201cHaving successfully crossed the hurdle of producing a presidential candidate from the southern region, All Progressives Congress is now faced with yet another important hurdle it must cross before the deadline for the submission of nominations by political parties elapses.\n\n\u201cThe bone of contention this time around lies in which of the two dominant faiths will produce the vice presidential candidate. there have been arguments that vice presidential candidate which is primed to come from the north must be of the Christian faith, while some others have argued that for the APC to stand the chance of winning the 2023 presidential election, the person must be a Christian, since the South has already produced a Muslim as the presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe APC national stakeholders are deeply concerned about the raging controversy which has heated the polity in the last few days. While we are conscious of the fact that religion should not be a determining factor in our leadership selection process, the peculiar circumstance the nation finds itself in calls for due reflection in the decisions we take, so long as they border on our national lives.\u201d\n\nHe noted that at present the country is deeply divided along the fault lines of ethnicity and religion and these sensibilities cannot be ignored in critical decision making.\n\n\u201cThis is why we think that the All Progressives Congress must be guided by the sense of these sensibilities in the selection of the vice presidential candidate of the party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stakeholders warned that picking another Muslim as vice presidential candidate would further fuel the division in the country and give room for mischief makers to take advantage of the differences.\n\n\u201cThe northern APC has in its fold capable individuals from the Christian faith with proven track record that can deliver just like anyone from the other faith. Their capability to deliver on the ideals of the party aside, they also have the capacity to win elections for the party. Suffice to add that no individual wins elections for any political party, it is the collective effort of all and we are sure the APC can achieve this,\u201d Audu added.\n\nOn their part, youths under the auspices of North East APC Youth Stakeholders Forum insisted on special consideration for the zone in choosing a vice presidential candidate.\n\nThe chairman of the forum, Haruna Sardauna, said the VP slot should be given to anybody from North East, irrespective of whether he is a Muslim or Christian.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja, Sardauna noted that giving the VP slot to North East would neutralise the stronghold of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and help in mobilising massive support from the region and other zones to ensure victory for Tinubu and the APC.\n\nThe youth stakeholders said, \u201cThe North-East region had consistently given block votes to the APC and supported candidate from the other regions, right from its inception. We, therefore, appeal to our national, state critical and non-critical stakeholders, especially our father, President Muhammadu Buhari, our candidate, Bola Tinubu and Abdullahi Adamu-led APC National Working Committee to zone it to us.\u201d\n\nAlso, the immediate past secretary-general of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Mr Anthony Sani, has advised the APC standard bearer Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the leadership of the party to pick a Christian from the North as vice president.\n\nThis, according to him, is the surest way to have peace and unity in view of the pervading realities in the country.\n\nHe urged Tinubu not to be intimidated by anyone under any pressure to fall for what can bring disunity and increased suspicion in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the former speaker of the House of Representatives Hon. Yakubu Dogara fits perfectly into the new consideration.\n\nHe said, \u201d Dogara is a young man with sufficient public intelligence with a rich electoral asset. If you look at his electoral value, he has never lost any election.\u201d\n\nSani stated this in Jos, the Plateau State capital, yesterday while speaking to newsmen.\n\nHe argued that the former speaker was able to command national respect because of his liberal disposition.\n\n\u201cMy suggestion does not mean that I have influence on Tinubu and the leadership of APC, but Tinubu has earlier said he knows how to hunt for his first eleven and as far as\n\nI\u2019m concerned Dogara can make his first eleven.\u201d\n\nSani also wondered why the controversy on whether he should pick a Christian northerner or a Muslim, adding that the constitution is very clear on it in respect to the federal character which says \u201cNo group should dominate as such a thing will not promote unity of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as Nigeria is concerned the dividing lines today are about three \u2013 ethnicity, religion and regions \u2013 and there is no way the president can pick his running mate from his region.\n\nHe further stressed \u201cSo if there are three dividing lines, for instance, if the president comes from a region, the vice president from the other side. If the president is coming from the south, naturally the vice president should come from the North.\u201d\n\nHe argued that because religion is also part of the three dividing lines, the constitution expects that the vice president should come from the opposite side of the president\u2019s religion.\n\n\u201cSome people have been saying it should not happen that way, but the country today is divided along ethnic, regional and religious lines. So, there is no way Tinubu will pick his vice president from the south or northern Muslim\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, Tinubu has made it very clear that he is coming to unite the country and not to divide it further.\n\n\u201cWith the way I perceive Tinubu, he wants to unite the country so that it will be peaceful for the younger generation to inherit; he is not expecting Tinubu to pick a Muslim from the North as his running mate,\u201d he said.\n\nCAN, Oodua Youths Back Christian As Running Mate To Tinubu\n\nMeanwhile, Christian Youths in Nigeria have declared that they will vote against any political party that field Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAccording to the youths, they will mobilise votes against any political party that fields candidates of the same religion.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Abuja, the president of the Youth Wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (YOWICAN), Belusochukwu Enwere, said the call for a Muslim-\n\nMuslim ticket by certain individual is callous and deceptive, adding that it was a move with sinister agenda.\n\nTo this end, the youths called on the APC) to drop the idea of fielding a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 2023 election.\n\nEnwere who also described the call as a true definition of bigotry, a slap on the entire Christendom and also a ploy to destabilise the nation.\n\n\u201cThis is an insult, devalues, and dehumanises millions of Christians. Any political party that fields a Muslim/Muslim ticket or Christian/Christian ticket should know today that they are about to fail. Nigeria is a secular state.\n\n\u201cDoes it imply that northern Christians are not regarded as northerners again. If we claim that we are together, then there should be no reason not to accept a northern Christian,\u201d he said, adding that Christians are not second-class citizens.\n\nSimilarly, the Oodua Youth Parliament has enjoined Tinubu to pick a Northern Christian as his running mate in the 2023 Presidential election.\n\nIn a statement issued by the Speaker, Abdulmojeed Oyeniyi, the youths alleged that there is a conspiracy to sabotage Tinubu\u2019s mandate, adding that picking a Christian running mate from the Northern part of the country will give him the needed victory.\n\n\u201cAgainst the wishes of some northern elite holding onto divisive and extremist views, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT) emerged as the Presidential candidate of the APC.\n\n\u201cBut the same people who felt they have failed in their calculations have not given up. They have risen up again and this time, they want to scuttle the chances of Tinubu so that power will remain in the North for another eight years.\n\n\u201cThey are now using their extremist Imams and youths on social media to threaten the peace of the country and subvert the victory of Tinubu that is certain if the right Christian from the North is chosen as his running mate.\n\n\u201cSome of these northern elite who have already shown their bigotry and intolerance even on national television are conspiring to sabotage the South West chances of having power in 2023 after they ruled for eight years.\n\n\u201cThey are now bent on ensuring that power is handed over to another northerner and they won\u2019t mind undermining their own party, the APC\u2019s chances so that Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) can win in the general election.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the June 12 Democracy Day, we believe that this move by some northern oligarchy to subvert the South West of the right to have a democratically elected president must be rejected and resisted by all advocates of democracy both at the individuals\u2019 levels and institutions,\u201d the group said.\n\nThey said the malicious sabotage bears similar trade mark with the one that stopped MKO in 1993, adding that if allowed to go through, it will retard the integrity the Nigeria\u2019s democracy has built both in the eyes of Nigerians and also in the eyes of the international community particularly the bilateral friendship with Britain and the United States.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of a breakdown in bilateral relations with the West could weaken Nigeria might in defeating terrorism, which is already spreading across the country as seen in bloody attack that killed worshippers in Saint Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo, on the eve of the APC primary election.\n\n\u201cAmerica, British and friendly nations will simply withdraw all forms of supports in fight against terrorism, including economic aids and slam sanctions leading to more poverty in the land. We do not want this,\u201d they said.\n\nStakeholders Push For Afukonyo As Tinubu\u2019s Vice\n\nMeanwhile, the hope of getting a suitable running mate to the APC flagbearer, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, has taken a new dimension as intellectuals and strategists met in Abuja and agreed to chart a good course for High Chief Ezekiel Irmiya Afukonyo to be paired with Tinubu.\n\nNigerians cutting across all strata of life and from the six geopolitical zones comprising retired generals, academia and high-ranking politicians, including the APC founding members, serving and non-serving Senators met in Abuja and resolved to back Ezekiel as the most sellable candidate.\n\nIn their separate submissions, they observed that the North East of the six geopolitical zones should be the area that will produce the running mate for the APC presidential candidate.\n\nThe stakeholders also observed that the Muslim-Christian ticket is ideal for the party and in the interest of national inclusion, cohesion, unity, peaceful corporate existence, and social justice.\n\nThe Taraba-born politician, Afukonyo, in his speech said the APC had been his party of choice since its inception and played significant roles in contributing to its growth and successes with Muhammadu Buhari as a sitting president.\n\nLabour Party settles for Christian/Muslim ticket\n\nThe national chairman of the Labour Party (LP) Barr Julius Abure has declared that their presidential candidate, Peter Obi, will choose a competent Muslim from the Northern parts of the country to be his running mate.\n\nAccording to the Labour, they will fly a Christian-Muslim ticket, adding that those planning a Muslim-Muslim ticket are agents of division.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference to mark Democracy Day yesterday, Abure, who said democracy has not in effect reflected a better life for Nigerians, added that Peter Obi and the Labour Party had embarked on a movement championed by the youths for a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigerians have been divided by the current government. Anything that will further divide the people should be avoided. It was Muslim/Christian ticket and now should be Christian and Muslim ticket which the labour party will fly,\u201d Abure said, adding that Peter Obi\u2019s running mate is coming from the North.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with talking,\u201d Abure said of the ongoing discussions with Peter Obi.\n\n\u201cHe has stated categorically that he is not thinking of being a vice president and not thinking of leaving the labour party because it is a movement and we shall not play second fiddle.\n\n\u201cThe discussion ongoing is how many people will work for Peter Obi because he is spearheading a movement. Since other regions have had the presidency, the most reasonable thing to do now is to ensure that the most competent person in the South East gets it. But Obi stands out as the best among the candidates and he is not pushing for a regional card because he is eminently qualified,\u201d Abure added.\n\nAccording to Abure, the consultations that are said to be ongoing regarding Peter Obi, Atiku Abubakar and Rabiu Musa Kwankwanso only centred on how people can support their candidate to win the 2023 general elections.\n\nAccording to Abure, if Peter Obi becomes the president, he will give the country a better life.\n\n\u201cHe says Nigeria will move from consumption to production, that is why he is in the labour party. We know that a productive economy is from the work force which is labour and the Peter Obi project is in tandem with the Labour Party. Obi has the answers to the numerous Nigerian challenges.\n\n\u201cWith Peter Obi as president, it is the people that will drive the process and Nigerians should not make the mistake of voting people we already know their antecedents,\u201d Abure said, while calling on Nigerians to get their PVCs.\n\nWike Deserves To Be VP \u2013 Okah\n\nMeanwhile, former Rivers State Commissioner for Information and Communications, Hon. Emma Okah, has declared that Governor Nyesom Wike, deserves to be the running mate of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt yesterday, Okah said Wike\u2019s qualification was based on his contributions to the growth and development of the PDP in the country.\n\nHe said: *I know that people are offering him that position in view of the fact that he has been there for the party, added to the brilliant effort he put up at the convention.\n\n\u201cSo, there is a popular view that given this scenario, they should give it to him. So, whether he is asking for it or not does not matter. On the basis of merit, I think, he deserves that slot.\u201d\n\nAlthough, Atiku Abubakar is poised to unveil his running mate today, indications, as of press time indicated that the Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa; Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike and Enugu State governor, Hon Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, were the leading candidates for the position.\n\nMeanwhile, former Cross Rivers State governor, Donald Duke, was also thrown into the mix as of last week.\n\nIt was gathered that while Atiku was keen on Okowa, a section of his camp is also mindful of the rift between Okowa and his estranged political godfather, James Ibori, who is alleged to be opposing the Delta governor\u2019s candidacy.\n\nHowever, another camp rooting for Okowa was said to have urged the former vice president to press on with Okowa considering the support he has offered to him.\n\nAnother source however confided in LEADERSHIP that Wike has maintained that if the position will come to the South South, he will be interested.\n\nWike is however said to be rooting for Enugu State governor, Ugwuanyi, if it is zoned to the South East.",
          "summary": "ADVERTISEMENTThe APC national stakeholders have urged the party\u2019s leadership to ensure national inclusion which, according to them, would help to manage divisive tendencies and promote national unity.\n\u201cThe bone of contention this time around lies in which of the two dominant faiths will produce the vice presidential candidate.\n\u201cThe APC national stakeholders are deeply concerned about the raging controversy which has heated the polity in the last few days.\nThe stakeholders warned that picking another Muslim as vice presidential candidate would further fuel the division in the country and give room for mischief makers to take advantage of the differences.\nOn their part, youths under the auspices of North East APC Youth Stakeholders Forum insisted on special consideration for the zone in choosing a vice presidential candidate.",

The code of practice is aimed at protecting fundamental human rights of Nigerians and non-Nigerians living in the country as well as define guidelines for interacting on the digital ecosystem.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with international best practices as obtainable in democratic nations such as the United State of America, United Kingdom, European Union, and United Nations.\n\n\u201cThe code of practice was developed in collaboration with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), as well as input from Interactive Computer Service Platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, and TikTok amongst others.\n\n\u201cOther relevant stakeholders with peculiar knowledge in this area were consulted such as Civil Society Organizations and expert groups. The results of this consultation were duly incorporated into the Draft Code of Practice.\n\n\u201cThe new global reality is that the activities conducted on these online platforms wield enormous influence over our society, social interaction, and economic choices. Hence, the Code of Practice is an intervention to recalibrate the relationship of online platforms with Nigerians in order to maximise mutual benefits for our nation, while promoting a sustainable digital economy.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the Code of Practice sets out procedures to safeguard the security and welfare of Nigerians while interacting on these Platforms. It aims to demand accountability from Online Platforms regarding unlawful and harmful contents on their platforms.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it establishes a robust framework for collaborative efforts to protect Nigerians against online harms, such as hate speech, cyber\n\nbullying, as well as disinformation and misinformation.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, to ensure compliance with the Code of Practice, NITDA also wishes to notify all Interactive computer service platforms/Internet Intermediaries operating in Nigeria that the federal government of Nigeria has set out conditions for operating in the country. These conditions address issues around legal registration of operations, taxation, and managing prohibited publication inline with Nigerian law.\u201d Welcome\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerian American Chamber of Commerce (NACC) Abuja Chapter has called on all Shippers to take advantage of the window provided by the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Programme to boost trade between Nigeria and the United States of America\n\nThe Executive Secretary of NACC Abuja Chapter, Mr. Ayo Salaam disclosed that Nigerian companies have not taken advantage of the AGOA because they export mainly oil to the United States.\n\nThe AGOA forum is one of the key components of U.S African strategy that focuses on increasing the United States Trade and Investment in Africa as a mechanism for job creation within the continent.\n\n\u201cThe AGOA project initiated by the United States of America in 2000 was to help develop trade and facilitate exporting over 6000 goods into America with no tariff.

We\u2019ve got to move forward.\n\n\u201cWe are preparing for a big World Cup and that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\n\nEngland toothless\n\nHungary secured their first win over England for 60 years in Budapest 10 days ago and followed that up with their first victory on English soil since a famous 6-3 success at Wembley in 1953.\n\nA double from Roland Sallai and late goals from Adam Nagy and Daniel Gazdag kept Marco Rossi\u2019s side on course to reach the Nations League finals next year.\n\nHungary are not headed to the World Cup after they finished a distant fourth behind England in their qualifying group.\n\nBut they lead Germany by a point in Nations League Group A3, with European champions Italy a further point behind with two games to go.\n\nEngland are three points adrift at the bottom of the section and need a revival in September away to Italy and home to Germany to avoid relegation.\n\nHowever, of greater concern for Southgate is how he rallies his squad with just two more matches before their World Cup campaign kicks off against Iran on November 21.\n\nFatigue at the end of a long season that began just weeks after losing the Euro 2020 final to Italy has been blamed for England\u2019s lacklustre form.\n\nSouthgate has rotated his side heavily over the four matches this month and admitted his decisions have backfired.\n\n\u201cThe results are my responsibility,\u201d added Southgate.\n\n\u201cWe picked a young team with energy and when the game started to go against them, it started to look that way.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my responsibility in the end. I felt at half-time we needed to go for the game. We made changes to have a more attacking impetus, but then we were more open as well.\u201d\n\nSouthgate has bemoaned a reliance on Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling for goals and Kane\u2019s penalty remains the only goal they have scored in four games this month.\n\nHowever, there are also major defensive issues for Southgate to address before the World Cup.\n\nJohn Stones rounded off a miserable evening when he was harshly sent off for a second yellow card eight minutes from time.\n\nThe Manchester City centre-back was also at fault for the opening goal as he turned a free-kick into Sallai\u2019s path, whose shot had too much power for Aaron Ramsdale.\n\nSallai produced another deadly finish to double Hungary\u2019s lead 20 minutes from time when he latched onto Martin Adam\u2019s inch-perfect pass to fire in between Ramsdale\u2019s legs.\n\nNagy drilled home a powerful shot from the edge of the area to put the result beyond any doubt.\n\nStones was then given his marching orders before Gazdag broke clear to rub salt into England\u2019s wounds.\n\nAFP",
