          "title": "Imo communities under military siege, alleges IPOB",
          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra has condemned the attacks and killings going on in Imo State.\n\nThe group accused the Nigerian military and Ebubeagu Security Network of being behind the attacks.\n\nIPOB alleged that military personnel now go from house to house searching and killing innocent citizens because they are Biafrans.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the group\u2019s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, said the activities of the military and the ESN were being financed by state politicians and their collaborators.\n\nPowerful said Obowo and Orlu residents were facing hard times, and the security agencies, especially the military had already marked out those communities for total destruction.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOur people are under severe attack and torture anywhere they are seen. We are dying every day while the world is looking the other way.\n\n\u201cThey should stop feeding lies to the public. Nigeria Joint Security Forces, especially the Army and police, did not clash with unknown gunmen, ESN or civilians, instead soldiers invaded Orlu and Obowo LGAs and its environs, burnt 17 innocent citizens alive and destroyed property.\u201d\n\nThe group, therefore, called on the international community, Amnesty International and human rights organisations across the world to take note and prevail on the Federal Government and its security agencies to leave the Biafran territory.\n\nThe group reiterated that IPOB members were not terrorists, claiming its members were present in over 100 countries without being treated as criminals.\n\nIt claimed that the people living in Orlu and its environs were under siege and pressure to leave their ancestral lands because of the Federal Government and its security agencies.\n\nPowerful said soldiers were busy killing innocent citizens simply because of their suspicion of being IPOB members without confirmation.\n\nThe statement read in parts, \u201cIt is no longer news that the Nigeria Army, in collaboration with Ebubeagu militia, are burning down people\u2019s property and have metamorphosed into burning human beings alive in Obowo and other communities in Biafra land.\n\n\u201cTwo days ago they burnt 17 persons alive in the Orlu LGA and its environs, with many houses and property of innocent citizens destroyed completely.\n\n\u201cThe world should come and rescue Biafrans because they are facing difficulties in the hands of the Federal Government at this time. We need help from the international community to rescue us by separating us from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Army are now going from house to house, searching for and killing innocent citizens just because they are Biafrans. They should stop murdering our brothers and sisters.\n\n\u201cTerrorists have continued to kill innocent Nigerians, mostly Christians and non-Muslims in the North, but no security agency has ever moved into those theatres of war to kill innocent citizens. Is it because we are Biafrans? There is genocide going on now in Biafra land by Nigeria security agencies. The world must come to our rescue now.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Lagos State Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo\n\nTHE Lagos Government has revealed plans to increase the number of comprehensive schools across the state from the initial pilot of 12 schools to 50 by September this year to demonstrate commitment and huge investment of the government in equipping Lagos State school students to be self-reliant and skilled.\n\nDisclosing this at the sensitisation of stakeholders on Lagos State Comprehensive School Programme held at Adeyemi Bero Auditorium, Alausa, the Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo stated that the comprehensive school programme which commenced in February is poised to reduce the rate of dropout in schools as some students are disconnected with the usual academic curriculum but prefer to learn various skills.\n\nShe emphasised that this programme would give them equal opportunities to explore their interest and train them to mastery level. Mrs. Adefisayo explained to stakeholders comprising school principals, school support and education quality assurance officers across the state on the importance of integrating comprehensive school programme to the school curriculum.\n\n\u201cWe discovered and observed that out of every 10 students admitted to JS1 only three make it to SS3, while only one student will eventually excel at the transition exam,\u201d adding that it had resulted to an increase in student dropouts in Lagos State.\u201d According to the commissioner, the state government has established partnership with private and International institutions for training, internship opportunities and employment prospects for the students.\n\nAn MOU was recently signed by the Lagos State Government and City of Tampere in Finland. \u201cAlready plans are on-going for some of the teachers to travel to Finland to understudy a similar system that operates in that country\u201d, she added.\n\nThe Commissioner commended school principals for the highly impressive results in the last WASSCE stressing that the performance of students with a minimum of five credits including Mathematics and English has improved from 38.79% in 2020 to 79.64% in 2021. Adefisayo encouraged the principals for more positive results as the huge investment by the government is evident in all schools across the State.\n\nIn a welcome address, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mr. Abayomi Abolaji canvassed the commitment of stakeholders for the success of the programme. He noted that the state government has equipped the pilot schools with the various infrastructure needed to actualize the newly established programme.",

          "text": ".\n\n. As PDP stakeholders agree to work together\n\n. Supports full autonomy for LGAs\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nSenator Mao Ohuabunwa has vowed that the imposition of candidates would not be allowed again in the Arochukwu Local Government Area of Abia State.\n\nThe former Leader ECOWAS Parliament made the declaration while addressing Peoples Democratic Party, PDP stakeholders from the LGA in his country home said every member of the party would be involved in the process of choosing candidates for the party.\n\nHe regretted that Arochukwu, a stronghold of PDP, suddenly fell into the hands of the opposition party due to sabotage and backstabbing by some blacklegs in the party.\n\nHe, however, said he had put the past behind him and urged everyone to be committed to the rebuilding of the party.\n\nOhuabunwa vowed to stop at nothing in ensuring that \u201cPDP recaptures Arochukwu which has been the party\u2019s enclave\u201d.\n\nDeclaring that the era of the anointing of candidates is over, Ohuabunwa told aspirants of various political offices in the council to be ready to show their scorecards.\n\nHe said that any aspirant without the support of the masses would not be given the party\u2019s ticket as that would affect the fortunes of the party at the main election.\n\nOhuabunwa said that the House of Representatives seat should be rotated between Arochukwu and Ohafia LGAs, insisting that it will be the turn of Ohafia LGA to produce the occupant in 2023.\n\nHe said that rotation of the seat would promote equity and peace, and eliminate politics of bitterness in the constituency.\n\nSenator Ohuabunwa lent his weight behind the clamour for a power shift to Abia North in 2023, saying that \u201d we believe there is already a wheel going round, and it should continue for peace, justice and equity\u201d.\n\nOhuabunwa who said he had a knack for the Parliament vowed that nothing would stop his return bid to the red chamber in 2023 to advance the cause of Abia North.\n\nHe tasked the stakeholders with unity, stressing that if they would all remain united as a family, no party will be able to dislodge PDP in Arochukwu LGA and the entire Abia North.\n\nSenator Ohuabunwa also restated his support for full financial autonomy for LGAs in the country to fast-track development in the third tier of Government.\n\nMeanwhile, the stakeholders who blamed the loss of Senator Ohuabunwa to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu of the All Progressive Congress, APC, in 2019 on sabotage by some black legs, vowed to avoid a repeat of the \u201c2019 mistake\u201d.\n\nThe stakeholders comprising all PDP Counselors, Council and Ward Executive members as well as zonal exco members and other chieftains of the party vowed to work together to deliver the LGA to PDP at all levels of the 2023 elections.\n\nAddressing the stakeholders, PDP Chairman in the Council, Chief Sunday Okemiri, regretted that factionalisation had been the undoing of the party, and appealed to the gladiators to sheath their swords for the sake of peace.\n\nOkemiri noted that although somebody might have facilitated his emergence, he was not for anybody but for the survival and advancement of the party.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Chairmen of Wards, Ozom Peters of Aro Ward 2, vowed that any gladiator \u201cthat refuses to embrace peace will receive Oshomhole treatment\u201d.\n\n\u201d We the ward Chairmen in Arochukwu LGA have decided to de-register any stakeholder that refuses to embrace peace so that Arochukwu PDP can recover its lost grounds\u201d, Peters threatened.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Counselors, Hon. George Onwumere representing Ward 3 said the Counselors had resolved to detach themselves from the control of any gladiator but work together for the good of the entire Council.\n\nHe blamed the leadership tussle rocking the Arochukwu Legislative arm on the imposition of principal officers by certain stakeholders but added that the Counselors had resolved to put their differences behind.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the major stakeholders, former Commissioner for Joint Projects, Mr JJ Okoro, assured Ohuabunwa of the full support of Arochukwu stakeholders, saying \u201cthe mistake of 2019 will not be repeated\u201d.\n\nHe, however, urged him to continue his consultations with stakeholders in other LGAs in Abia North, \u201cbut as for Arochukwu LGA, go and sleep and leave the job for us\u201d.\n\nIn a remark, PDP Vice Chairman, Abia North, Elder Amah Abraham, said the greatest challenge he faced after his election was how to unite the various factions in Arochukwu PDP.\n\nHe, however, expressed delight at the resolve of the stakeholders to embrace peace and urged all to place the party\u2019s interest above personal interests.",

Even Governors have the right to be treated fairly under the law.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari assures the nation that nothing done here was intended to achieve a political end or send a revisionist message on the relentless war against corruption which he has ably and evidently led by personal examples.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026accuses APC of endorsing, institutionalizing godfatherism\n\n\u2026says price tags on forms exclude youth, women from internal democracy\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu\n\nABUJA-THE Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, CISLAC, Wednesday, queried the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, \u2018Who can legally afford APC\u2019s N100 million presidential forms of Nomination and Expression of Interest?\n\nCISLAC expressed dismay over fees placed on the various forms of Nomination and Interest, pointing that this will give way to corrupt politicians and money-bags to hijack the electoral process as they will dictate the tune for those they will sponsor to purchase the forms at exorbitant amounts as announced by the party.\n\nThe Executive Director of CISLAC and Chairman Transition Monitoring Group, TMG, Auwal Ibrahim Rafsanjani, in a statement issued and made available to Vanguard, described the fees as shameful.\n\nAccording to Rafsanjani, \u201cIt was unbelievable for a ruling party that the President belongs to, has endorsed the expression of interest and nomination forms for its presidential ticket at N100m.\n\n\u201cThis is especially at a time when many have expressed dissatisfaction with the level of youth participation in partisan politics and called for deliberate measures to create the enabling environment for wider inclusion and active participation of women and youth in politics and governance of the country.\n\n\u201cA key question to ask is, \u201cWho can legally afford N100 million for a Presidential ambition?\u201d This despicable decision by the APC begs this question as it only serves within the following contexts to: Marginalize youths, women and average citizens; Despite claims of a 50% reduction in nomination and expression of interest fees, the new Presidential nomination fees at (from N100 million to N50 million) remains clearly higher than the 2019 Presidential aspirant fee which was N45 million (N40 million for nomination form and N5 million for expression of interest form).\n\n\u201cThis will apparently exclude the youth, women and average Nigerians who have clamoured to improve opportunities to exercise their rights to declare their interests and contest in the elections.\n\n\u201cThe current total fee is N5 million higher than it was 3 years ago when inflation was significantly lower and the common man had a better spending power.\n\n\u201cIt has been well established that money politics has served the purposes of consolidating elite rule as well as the political exclusion of the less financially stable and marginalized groups.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Constitution by omission or commission placed an age barrier by disqualifying persons below the ages of 40 and 30 from contesting for the offices of the President, and membership for House of Representatives and Assembly, respectively.\n\nHe added that, \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the ruling party however makes a mockery of the efforts of all the stakeholders and general public that campaigned vigorously to secure the signing of the Not Too Young To Run bill into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on May 31, 2018.\n\n\u201cIt once again re-emphasizes the lack of sincerity of purpose and political inconsistencies that have plagued this administration\u2019s decisions/commitments to any cause or agenda.\u201d\n\nThe CISLAC boss also lamented and accused the ruling party of officially endorsing and institutionalizing godfatherism.\n\n\u201cWhy the APC has now chosen to be the instrument through which godfatherism has been officially institutionalised in the electoral process is baffling, especially at a time that they are battling to redeem what little trust the public has in them, is worrisome.\n\n\u201cThere are numerous instances in the past, of godfather-backed politicians who have had to defer to their political godfathers for matters such as appointment of commissioners, appointment into the board of statutory corporations, etc. or have essentially handed-over the functions of their offices to their political benefactors to the detriment of their mandates and electorates.\n\n\u201cThis alliance has been behind the characteristic electoral corruption and violence in Nigeria as Godfathers deploy enormous resources in a bid to corrupt electoral officials and the electorate and where these fail, violence will be deployed to bring about the desired result. It fuels apathy and the few electorates who turn out to vote mostly do so to benefit from the largesse at the polling units\u201d, he added.",

          "text": "Author: Grooming Centre\n\nPublisher: The Grooming Centre\n\nReviewer: Nnedinso Ogaziechi\n\nThe photo-book impressively comes in an exciting photo-album-like package that encases the hardcover book. It does not just come in an earthy calm mixture of brown, blue, red and black dominant colours; there is an alluring picture of an African woman with her unique gap-toothed effervescent smile with unmistakable sharp eyes that tell a story of a certain level of fulfilment and excitement. Under her picture comes the title of the book; Stories of Impact: Real Women, Real Lives, Real Growth.\n\nIn a global community that is now more than ever focused on gender justice, equity and empowerment of women, this photo-book title arouses both social and intellectual curiosity and the repetitiveness of \u2018REAL\u2019 aligns with the visual impact of the cover of a woman so bare of any cosmetic alterations of her womanhood and Africanness. The visual impact of the photo-book packaging and cover deftly prepares any reader for the content it encases.\n\nThe core characteristic of a good photo-book is the profound communication that authors try to achieve with visuals in pictorial format. The photo-book under review achieves this communication style from the cover deep into almost the first twenty pages of the book. The few textual insertions were mainly the preface by the Founder & Chief executive Officer, Godwin C. Nwabunka and some quotations inserted for clarity. The choice of the very symbolic first picture of a woman tending a growing agricultural plant speaks to the deeper impact of the Grooming Centre and heralds every other visual narrative and the accompanying texts. The picture of the various economic sectors with female beneficiaries of the Grooming Centre speaks to the economic and social impact the publishers intended to communicate.\n\nThe adoption of the first-person narrative style by the women was effectively done in ways that translations from local languages and Pidgin English did not affect the content of the stories/testimonies. Given the number of beneficiaries, there was an effective selection style as almost all socio-economic sector beneficiaries were represented with on-site, in-person pictures for clarity.\n\nThe photo-book is divided into five chapters and one hundred and twenty-nine pages. The first chapter, Grooming Nigerian Women in Business seems to encapsulate the core mission of the Grooming Centre. Starting with the UN statistics of the percentage of Nigerian women that have never accessed loans (73%) was a brilliantly intellectual way to start such a story.\n\nEven though there is no folkloric bent to it, it speaks to the fate of Nigerian women and the exclusion game even when other UN statistics show the potential of women as economic power houses in any economy. As an NGO that provides microfinance services for indigent women, the pictorials of the book must be a subtle indictment on other bigger financial institutions and their roles in excluding and disempowering women. The other four chapters are all stories around the success of the Grooming Centre even beyond the women to their families/communities.\n\nI love that the photo-book adhered substantially to the qualities of such an aspect of art. The packaging of the book is excellent and like such artistic materials like painting, films, and others, it is an archival material. The quality of the production is very good. There was a good use of visual effects, and the story-telling style resonates. The book speaks very loudly about women empowerment beyond the popular rhetoric without action. There is a show-and-tell style with faces, names, and states. The spread of the beneficiaries is commendable.\n\nHowever, there is an almost utopian narration that says nothing about the challenges of the Grooming Centre as an institution or even from the beneficiaries. Financial investments and businesses are not as seamless as the narration looks, but there would be room in future editions for corrections. It is a veritable tool for both a re-orientation and introspection about the value of women empowerment for a sustainable economic growth. The stories are as real as the story tellers. Good work.",

          "text": "By Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja\n\nTambuwal submits form, says I will unite Nigerians\n\nGovernor Wike: field me or we lose\n\nObi meets delegates\n\nWe will be fair to all, Ayu assures\n\nThe scramble for delegates by presidential aspirants has intensified as the submission of nomination forms ends today in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe aspirants visited many state chapters of the party yesterday to woo key leaders and delegates ahead of the proposed primary.\n\nEight aspirants have so far submitted their documents to the national secretariat of the opposition party in Abuja.\n\nHowever, more are expected to comply with the directive on today\u2019s deadline.\n\nAspirants who have submitted their forms include Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, and former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nOthers are Muhammed Hayatu-Deen, publisher Dele Momodu and Nwachukwu Anakwenze.\n\nHowever, there is no consensus among the aspirants on the proposal for a consensus candidate initiated by Tambuwal, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Bala Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen.\n\nWike yesterday pleaded with party delegates to pick him to avoid defeat in next year\u2019s election.\n\nHe urged members of the National Working Committee (NWC) to back him.\n\nThere was a flurry of activities regarding the presidential primary yesterday.\n\nSokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal submitted his presidential nomination form at the party secretariat, promising to lift the country if given the ticket and elected as president.\n\nEx-Anambra Governor Peter Obi met with the state delegates and promised to fix Nigeria if given the chance to lead.\n\nAbia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu reiterated his support for Wike.\n\nFormer Deputy Chairman South, Chief Olabode George, cautioned against jettisoning zoning.\n\nHe was also of the opinion that the party would fail if it kept the presidential ticket in the North.\n\nWike, the Rivers State governor, who met with the NWC members led by party chair Iyorchia Ayu, said: \u201cField me or lose the presidential election. I request you all to campaign for me to get the PDP presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman, since I know that members of the NWC are also delegates, I come to present myself to you and also woo you because you are entitled to vote.\n\n\u201cI am wooing you to vote for me because I have the capacity to make PDP win the election in 2023.\n\n\u201cTo show you how serious I am, I did not come here to negotiate for vice president. I came here to win this election and I will win this primary on May 28/29.\n\n\u201cPDP requires people like us to face the APC. Everybody in this country knows me because of my views on national issues.\n\n\u201cNobody can say I don\u2019t know whether Wike will do this or do that. When I see issues, I say my view and I am not going to run away from it.\u201d\n\nThe governor dismissed the call by some aspirants for a consensus presidential candidate, saying that it smacked of conspiracy.\n\nWike said he had consulted widely in his quest for the ticket, stressing that 2023 was the last chance the PDP has to bounce back to power.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf we lose this election in 2023, God forbid.\n\n\u201cThe only way God can forbid is to give the man who has the capacity to win the election the ticket. I sat down, looked at myself and checked the records. What does PDP want?\n\n\u201cYou must be courageous if you want to be a leader. You must be fearless and you must have the capacity. I am courageous and fearless and I have the capacity.\n\n\u201cIf you allow me to fly the flag of the party, which I know by the grace of God, I will be the candidate, and I become President, one of the things I will do is to address the disconnect between the party and the government.\n\n\u201cYou all know the role I played to get all of you elected at our last convention because I ensured that none of you campaigned to get to the positions you occupy today.\n\n\u201cThis is the time for you to pay me back for what I did for you. In essence, whether I get the ticket or not, I have no other place to run to other than the PDP because it is not that if I don\u2019t get the ticket, then, I will move to another party. No! You fight in the house, you settle yourselves.\u201d\n\nBut Ayu, who acknowledged Wike\u2019s request for the support of the national leadership, said party leaders had resolved to provide a level-playing ground for all aspirants.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for the services you have rendered to the PDP, which we hope you will continue to render to the party.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, you want a level-playing field from the NWC. On the other hand, you want the NWC to canvass votes for you and vote for your candidacy\n\n\u201cIn becoming President, you have to choose one; you cannot have the two.\n\n\u201cBut let me assure you that this NWC will try to uphold the tradition of the PDP.\n\n\u201cThat tradition since 1999 is running very credible, transparent conventions, starting from Jos to the last one that produced this NWC.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that there will be no foul play, no manipulation. We will certainly do better than what you did in October last year.\n\n\u201cWe will hold an absolutely transparent convention. At that stage, we will try to be the INEC of the PDP; not be partisan.\n\n\u201cWe will try as much as possible to make sure that every member of the NWC works for the party.\n\n\u201cBut I want to also assure you that once you emerge as the candidate of the party, whoever emerges from that point on, we will be aggressively partisan because you want the party to win the election.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything in our power by way of canvassing for votes from the Nigerian people to ensure that the PDP wins the next election because a victory for a PDP candidate is a victory for everybody.\n\n\u201cI particularly like your submission when you made it clear that win or lose, you will never leave the party. You will work for the party. You have done it before and we are very sure that you will do it again.\u201d\n\nThere are 17 aspirants vying for the party\u2019s presidential ticket.",

This will form the main agenda for the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe source however declined to volunteer information on how much the party plans to sell the forms to aspirants.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWait for the decision of NEC. We have made our recommendations. It is for the NEC to approve the various cost pegged to various positions. Mind you, the NWC had approved free nomination forms for all female aspirants, irrespective of the position they want to contest.\u201d\n\nLast week, APC National Woman Leader, Betta Edu, told reporters of the NWC decision to grant women aspirants free nomination forms to encourage more women in politics and for the fulfilment of the 35 per cent affirmative action in governance.\n\nOn the mode of election recommended by NWC for consideration and approval of NEC for the party\u2019s primaries, our source said the party will adopt an indirect primary.\n\nHe said: \u201cArticle 20(3and4) was clear on the mode of primary to be used at our congresses and convention, but for the primaries for the 2023 elections, we have recommended an indirect mode of election. This also will be presented to the NEC for ratification.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the NWC, who spoke in confidence, said the committee will also be seeking the approval of the NEC for the proposed reorganisation of the party\u2019s National Secretariat.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThough we have not concluded on the Transition Committee report, the Chairman will brief the NEC on the preliminary report of the committee and the proposed reorganisation plan of the party secretariat. We hope to look into the Transition Committee report on Thursday.\u201d\n\nThe youth wing of the party may be pushing for a 50 per cent discount on the cost of nomination forms for all aspiring youth at the forthcoming party primaries.\n\nThe decision was reached at a crucial meeting of some youth stakeholders across the country at the party\u2019s national secretariat on yesterday.\n\nThe source said: \u201cIf the party can grant free nomination to women, we gave resolved to push at tomorrow\u2019s (Wednesday) NEC meeting for a 50 per cent cut in purchasing the nomination forms by all our youth. This will go a long way to boost the not too young to run Act recently signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe have mandated the National Youth Leader to make this case, while some of us are reaching out to other NEC members to support this move.\u201d",

He served as a commissioner before he resigned to join the 2022 governorship race.\n\n\u201cLooking at the political architecture of that zone, Faparusi is one of the few leaders with executive and legislative experience, having at different times served as a member of the House of Representatives and commissioner.\n\n\u201cThere is a common deep-seated belief that since South Federal Constituency 1 has produced the deputy governorship slot, the Senate seat occupier should emerge from Ekiti Federal Constituency II.

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days!

He said the two have made positive impacts in the lives of the people.\n\nThe former special adviser to former president Goodluck Jonathan on Inter-Party Affairs said Ekwunife has been impressive with her performance in the Senate; saying he had no doubt she would do better if given another opportunity to serve.\n\nThe former lawmaker, who represented Anambra Central in the National Assembly, equally spoke highly about former governor Obi, saying he was very confident that Obi could fix Nigeria\u2019s problems if given the opportunity to do so.\n\nThe representative of Awka North and South Federal constituency in the National Assembly, Chinedu Onwuaso, moved a motion for the endorsement of Obi for president and it was overwhelmingly supported by the crowd in the hall.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

I have travelled to over 30 countries and I still say it that all I need is four years to position Nigeria to the path of progress,\u201d Obi said.\n\nThe former governor said he would fix insecurity, bad economy, poor electric power supply and ensure food security in the country among others within the shortest possible time as president.\n\n\u201cWho says we can\u2019t enjoy steady power supply in this country? Egypt, between 2016 and today, has doubled its power generation and distribution from 28,000 megawatts to 58,000 megawatts. Vietnam has doubled its own from 38 to 76.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening here? Why are they wasting people\u2019s time here? Let us give people conditions. If I am Mr President, if we do not have 20,000 megawatts in three years, I\u2019ll go home,\u201d Obi said.\n\nEkwunife, in her speech, thanked the people of Anambra Central for the opportunity given to her to represent them in the Senate, saying she would do more if given another chance.\n\n\u201cBeyond the discharge of my official duties as your senator, I have continued to intervene in the welfare of constituents through the Senator Uche Ekwunife Foundation. I recognise the fact that while we move motions, sponsor bills and attract projects; a lot of our constituents are passing through difficult times. Many are unable to fund their medical treatment, pay their children\u2019s school fees and so on.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that through our little effort, hundreds of constituents have received assistance. We have, through the foundation, paid medical bills and performed other charitable services \u2013 we do this in our bid to provide succour to the less privileged ones among us.\n\n\u201cWhat we have achieved in the last two and half years is a litmus test of what we can achieve if you once again grant me your mandate. I urge you to join me in this journey of building the senatorial district of our dream.

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has warned that the party is not immune to losing election to the opposition should they fail to put their house in order ahead of the forthcoming presidential poll.\n\nAdamu handed the warning in his keynote address during the emergency APC National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nHe lamentably attributed the challenges confronting the party on the endless misunderstanding between the serving and incumbent State governors, warning that the situation posses grave danger to the future and fortune of the party.\n\nAlthough he described the ruling party as unbreakable and solid, he however urged aggrieved members to take urgent step to ket into the reconciliation efforts of the party\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cAs you see it, this party has two path to take, the first path is the full and complete unity of the party, the second path is winning 2023 general elections. How we handle the first will determine how we achieve the second. We must take urgent and target steps now to unite our party at all levels; federal, states, local governments and wards.\n\n\u201cOur political party must emerge from incessant challenges in order to prepare for the coming tasks ahead. Secondly we must begin the process of banishing disagreement and build inclusivity of our past and present experiences.\n\n\u201cThe lack of unity in our party is such that none of us can pretend not to be unaware as it were, the efforts to unite this party that led the previous Caretaker Committee to set up a reconciliation committee to find lasting peace. I know Mr President is not unmindful of what happened to PDP in 2014/2015, our party is not immune to similar fate should it conduct itself in such a way that continues to undermine the legacy of the founding fathers to build this party,\u201d he appealed.\n\nWhile accusing the serving and former State governors of distabilising the party with the incessant clash, he said: \u201cI was the chairman of the reconciliation committee and came out of the assignment fully conversant of the problems. The battle rarely is a battle for supremacy between serving state governors and their predecessors in office. It is a crisis fuel by ego.\n\n\u201cSo, ego is the enemy. Ego between former and serving governors has turned them into bitter enemies. Because of ego, the two groups are putting our party in jeopardy and the effect will be in the polls next year.\n\n\u201cThe serving governors and past governors are powerful men, each of them are leaders in there own right in there states but when two elephants fight the grass suffers. Similarly, when two powerful politicians fight the party suffers. Because the speech and actions of these powerful men will bring a filthy and odious stench to our party.\n\n\u201cOur party must have the courage not to play lip-service about it but the serving governors of our party in there various states are the leaders of the party and this is in line with our party\u2019s constitution. It is important that the former governors recognize that the party structure must be respected.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday approved a whopping sum of N100 million for aspirants planning to purchase expression of interest and nomination forms for the position of president in the 2023 general elections.\n\nAPC, ractified the decision after its emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held in Abuja, pegging governorship, Senate and House of Representatives at N50 million, N20 million and N10 million respectively.\n\nBriefing newsmen after the meeting, the party\u2019s National Publicity Secretary (NPS), Barr Felix Morka, disclosed that the sale of forms will commence Saturday this week, rolling out other items in the timetable and schedule of activities ahead of the parties primary tentatively fixed to hold between Monday May 30 to Wednesday, June 1, 2022.\n\nAnnouncing the prices for the nomination forms, Morka said: \u201cthe last item which is the schedule of fees payable for these offices.

Let me say again, especially of interest fees will be paid for based on the schedule that are announced for our female aspirants or for persons living with disability will be paid for according to the fees that are announced for each of the positions. \u201cBut the nomination forms which obviously, from what I have said, costs more will be delivered to them for free at no cost to them. Now, our youth also got some very special consideration out of this meeting. And our youths are considered persons between the ages of 25 to 40. To purchase the expression of interest forms but with a discount of 50 per cent. On the nomination forms now as usual, all of the payments are to be made to banks that will be designated by the party and published in a very short while from now,\u201d he announced.

There were two important matters that were placed on the agenda of today\u2019s NEC meeting. Those items were discussed and decisions were taken. The first was a motion which was moved and adopted with a slight Amendment by the NEC, which now stands as a resolution of the NEC of our party. The resolution essentially has devolved the powers of NEC under Article 13 paragraph three, two, three, four, five and six respectively, of our Constitution. But those powers of NEC in those provisions will now be invested, or are now vested in the NWC of the party.\n\n\u201cSo, in other words, the NWC of a party is authorised, for the period specified, have 90 days to exercise the authority that is constitutionally assigned to the NEC on behalf of the behalf of the party. The NEC, also divolves its authority, as enshrined in article 13 paragraph three subparagraph two of the APC constitution to discharge all functions of the national convention as constituted in between conventions.\n\n\u201cNEC also devolved its powers to NWC as enshrined in article 13 paragraph three sub four of the APC constitution to consider reports from national, State and Local governmrnt areas and Area Council chapters of the party and to take such decisions as are necessary to protect, advance and consolidate the gains and interests of our party.\n\nNEC further devolved its powers to the NWC as enshrined in article 13, paragraph three, five of the APC Constitution, to exercise control and take disciplinary actions on all organs, officers are members of the party and determine appeals brought before it by any member or organ of the party.\n\nFinally, that NEC has devolved its powers to the NWC as enshrined in article 13, paragraph three sub six of our Constitution to create elect and appoint any committee it may deem necessary, desirable or expedient and assigned to them such powers and functions as it may deem fit and proper,\u201d he announced.",

But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country.\u201d\n\nChairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi,however, commended President Buhari for demonstrating resilience and determination at a crucial period in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cWe have a leader, who is not distracted by momentary challenges but has continued to commit to the renewal of our nation and we, governors, ministers and heads of government agencies are equally dedicated to building a better Nigeria, on your watch,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that this year\u2019s Holy month of Ramadan coincided with the just concluded Christian Lenten period, the Governor of Ekiti, said it held enormous spiritual value on the benefits of renewal, sacrifice, almsgiving, forgiveness and healing for the individual as well as the nation.\n\nOn his part, Diri, who spoke when he received the Comptroller of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Bayelsa Command, Mr Sunday James, the Bayelsa helmsman lamented the level of insecurity in the north, saying once a part of the country was in distress, other areas were also affected.\n\nHe said the spate of killings by terrorists in the country was a great setback for Nigeria, where lives could be taken at will and urged the APC-led federal government to effectively curb the killings.\n\nHis words: \u201cI use this opportunity to again call on the federal government to do something. These are the same issues that led to the APC government coming to power in 2015.\n\n\u201cI am sure that you will agree that things are worse now than in 2015. The federal government has to redouble its effort, otherwise, the joker card is with the people of Nigeria. They know what to do come 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen one part of the country is sick, it affects the other parts. Kaduna and other states in the North are sick security-wise and it is affecting other parts of the country. Nigeria is very close to the Thomas Hobbes\u2019 \u2018state of nature\u2019 where life is described as nasty, brutish and short. The federal government has to do something to keep us away from the Hobbesian state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, James, said the visit was to formally present himself as the new helmsman of the service in the state, and said as the agency in charge of giving clearance to intending foreign visitors, he was prepared to synergise to realise the state\u2019s investment drive.\n\nDiri equally charged the new Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Central Naval Command, Rear Admiral Idi Abbas, to collaborate with the state government in curbing oil theft, illegal bunkering, kidnapping and related crimes in the maritime domain of the state.\n\nHe acknowledged that having served in the Command in other capacities, Rear Admiral Abbas, would contribute significantly towards sustaining the peace and development of the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe you have distinguished and excelled in your service and will not be a pawn in the chess game of anybody or any political party.\n\n\u201cEnsure that you discharge your functions with utmost professionalism to bring about peace, security and development of Bayelsa and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cSecurity does not know ethnicity. It has no face of political parties and so, let nobody influence you and your Command on politics. We are in a political season and all kinds of characters are on display: the good, the bad and the ugly. The number one thing is to ensure safety of lives and property in our maritime domain and that is the only way we can talk about genuine development.\u201d\n\nAbbas, on his part, also said his visit was to officially present himself to the governor following his posting to head the Command on February 4 this year.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the state government for its support to the Command and appreciated it for the donation of land to build a referral hospital, adding that the secondary school allocated to the Navy would be taken over completely in no distant time.\n\nIn a related development, Diri was decorated as an ambassador against drug abuse by the state command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).\n\nThe NDLEA State Commandant, Commander Aminu Ali, conferred the honour on the governor when he led other members of the agency to formally introduce himself as the new head of the command.\n\nTerrorists Kill Three Kidnapped Victims in Kaduna, Threaten to Kill 22 Others over N20m Ransom\n\nSome terrorists operating in Kaduna State had killed three of their victims in the state, and threatened to kill 22 others if a ransom of N20 million was not delivered to them before midnight yesterday.\n\nThe victims were abducted at about 8pm on March 31, 2022, in Anguwan Bulus, a suburb near Sabon Tasha GRA in Kaduna city.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, who visited the community yesterday, the Village Head, Mr. Gideon Goni, said the terrorists called the community on telephone to inform them that three of the victims had been killed and threatened to kill the remaining 22 if by midnight yesterday N20 million ransom was not paid.\n\nHe said on March 31, 2022, the terrorists invaded the community around 8pm, killed two people and abducted 26 others, adding that one person was later released on health ground.\n\nHe said the terrorists gave them a description of a location along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, to pick the corpses of the three persons killed.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists called and said they had killed three of the 25 people being held in captivity and that if we don\u2019t pay N20 million ransom before 12pm on Tuesday (April 19, 2022), others would be killed,\u201d Goni said.\n\nAccording to him, the community was raising some money to secure the release of the victims \u201cwhen the terrorists called us and told us to pick the corpses of three of their victims at Dutse.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to them not to kill anyone. We are appealing to the state and federal governments as well as religious bodies to come to our rescue so that the killings will stop,\u201d Goni said.\n\nOne of those whose family member were kidnapped, said he had been able to raise N7 million, \u201cbut the terrorists insisted on the N20 million or they will keep killing the victims.\u201d\n\nMohammed Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command did not respond to telephone calls, when contacted.\n\nThree Dead, 19 Injured As Explosion Rocks Taraba Cattle Market\n\nThree people were yesterday killed while 19 others sustained varying degrees of injuries, when an explosions rocked Iware Cattle market in Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba State.\n\nThe incident, which occurred around 4pm at a local drinking spot, sent the entire community in pandemonium as people ran helter-skelter for safety.\n\nThe State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the incident to THISDAY in a telephone interview.\n\nA resident of Iware, Ismael Yakubu, also told THISDAY that the bomber came into the spot in company of another accomplice with the bomb hidden in a polythene bag and disguised as customers.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTwo guys came to the drinking spot as if they wanted to buy Burukutu and after they were served, the one holding the poly bag containing the bomb dropped his beer and the polythene bag and left.\n\n\u201cThe accomplice then said he was going to look for his friend and would come back. After he had also left, the bomb exploded and many people were injured while some others were killed.\u201d\n\nOne of the bombers was, however, apprehended and was killed by the angry mob before security operatives could arrive the scene.\n\nThe corpses of those killed had been deposited at the mortuary while those injured were receiving treatment at a health facility in Iware. Others in critical conditions had equally been moved to the Federal Medical Centre, Jalingo.\n\nIware cattle market is one of the biggest cattle markets in Taraba State and the economic hub of Ardo Kola Local Government Area, which operates every Tuesday.\n\nIG Orders Maximum Security in Schools, Colleges; Hard on Compliance\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, yesterday, ordered the review of police personnel and operational assets deployments to schools and colleges around the country.\n\nThe review may not be unconnected with the incessant kidnapping of school children by bandits in the North and the killing of school pupils in isolated incidents, owing to inadequate security by the affected schools in the Southern part of the country.\n\nLagos State government had yesterday shut Chrisland School over alleged sex scandal involving a 10-year-old female pupil during a trip to Dubai.\n\nA statement by Force Headquarters said the review was to ensure the protection of schools and colleges, particularly, boarding schools, tertiary institutions and its campuses in areas prone to security breaches around the country.\n\nThe statement said the IG directive was issued at a meeting of the force management team at the Force Headquarters, Abuja, while reviewing the general security in the country including the security of schools and colleges as a result of some isolated incidences reported in some schools.\n\nThe IG slso directed all Commissioners of Police in the 36 States and FCT, tactical commanders as well as their supervising Assistant Inspectors-General of Police (AIGs) to explore all available options and think outside the box to boost security in and around schools, colleges and student-based communities.\n\nThe IG, therefore, directed detectives/operatives of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID) and the Force Intelligence Bureau (FIB) to ensure sustained surveillance and intelligence gathering activities within various school environments while the Police Airwing was directed to extend its aerial patrols to the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\nThe IG, however, assured the people that all hands would be on deck to ensure a safe environment for all pupils and students in the various schools and colleges in the country, even as he reiterated the commitment of his administration to diversifying resources towards sustainable security and safety of the citizenry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Nobel laureate: This is one egg squashed against Nigerians\u2019 faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry\n\n\u2022Falana laments disparity in justice system, says influential politicians getting away with corruption\n\nGoddy Egene, Wale Igbintade in Lagos and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\n\n\nNobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, yesterday joined the growing number of eminent Nigerians and groups that have condemned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to grant a presidential pardon to former governors, Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame. Soyinka said the pardon showed that the Buhari administration\u2019s anti-corruption fight was over.\n\nEchoing the words of Jesus Christ before he breathed his last, Soyinka said regarding the president\u2019s anti-graft effort, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d signifying the end of his mission.\n\nIn a similar vein, the National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) yesterday condemned the presidential pardon granted to the two former governors convicted for corruption.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, denounced the disparity in the sentencing of rich and poor convicts in Nigeria, stressing that the justice system is often manipulated to favour influential politicians facing corruption charges.\n\nSoyinka, in a statement, likened the state pardon given to the former governors to an egg smashed against the faces of Nigerians, saying it would take a long time to wiped it off.\n\nThe former governor of Plateau State, Dariye, and erstwhile Taraba State governor, Nyame, were serving jail terms for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, while they were in office.\n\nBut to the surprise and disappointment of many Nigerians, the National Council of State last week approved that Dariye, Nyame, and 157 others serving jail terms be pardoned following the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy, as approved by Buhari.\n\nMixed reactions greeted the decision, with many condemning it.\n\nHuman rights organisation, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), specifically asked Buhari to urgently withdraw the pardon.\n\nReacting to the pardon, in a message titled, \u201cA Putrid Presidential Easter Egg,\u201d Soyinka said he aligned with Bishop Matthew Kukah, in his Easter message, where the cleric lambasted Buhari.\n\nSoyinka said, \u201cComing from a leader who had placed all his eggs in one basket, labelled Anti-corruption, this is one egg squashed against Nigerians\u2019 faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry.\n\n\u201cIt evokes the legend of Pandora\u2019s box whose contents are alleged to constitute all the ills that plague the world.\n\n\u201cPutrid to the core, allied to power provocations in numerous variations, such as catapulting a notorious player in the martyrdom of a serving Minister of Justice to the hub of governance wheel, these define the nature of bequests that have brought the nation to this moment of near dissolution. Precedents are no consolation, no excuses.\u201d\n\nSoyinka added, \u201cOne states the obvious in remarking that precedents either undermine or reinforce principles, and aspiring offenders, especially in the political domain, are encouraged or inhibited by the ease or difficulty of access to the fount of mercy.\n\n\u201cOffice holders, we presume, are constrained by the existence of that dangling Sword of Damocles \u2013 simply knowing that one day, the cloak of immunity will turn threadbare, and the awaited day of reckoning finds them answerable. Clearly, not any longer.\n\n\u201cYou will forgive, though disagree with me, I know, for clambering onto the Easter wagon myself, to echo the words of the One whose passage through the world the Easter season commemorates: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Kukah\u2019s homily, the Nobel Laureate said he was impelled not to miss an opportunity to add his own Easter drop \u201cto the overflowing vessel of pietistic sentiments, if only to reassure Christians \u2013 and also Muslims in turn \u2013 that even \u2018we, non-believers, do partake of that same ethical communion to which most humanities aspire.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso, your Easter sermon opens up yet again those sluices of juridical hypocrisy to which we dare not cease to draw attention. Such, in the immediate, remains the plight of two young men \u2013 Mubarak Bala and the musician Yahaya Sharif \u2013 one serving a sentence of twenty-five years, the other actually sentenced to death for alleged blasphemy.\n\n\u201cThat word \u2018blasphemy\u2019 comes into its authentic mode, in my view, whenever anyone violates a solemn oath of office. It penitentially becomes even redoubled when such violators are pampered with the prerogative of mercy.\n\n\u201cPermit me to call special attention to the following from your (Kukah) sermon: \u2018Religious leaders\u2026. must face the reality that here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam.\n\n\u201c\u2019While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists, but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this. We cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that he was persuaded that the recent largesse from the president had already won a few hearts and minds to the ranks, \u201cif not of outright atheism, then at least to a healthy sceptical regard of piety spouting leadership that saw nothing wrong in attempts to extinguish the life of a young man for an honest declaration of conviction, while veterans of broken pledges were let loose to further infect a world they had betrayed.\n\n\u201cNo pardon has been extended in the direction of endangered, youthful integrity. Of course, it is easy to track the trajectory of events.\n\n\u201cNettled by increasingly scabrous comments, such as those of his predecessor in office, Olusegun Obasanjo, who declared that this incumbent has run out of ideas, that he has nothing left to offer the nation, Muhammad Buhari decided to embark on the Easter train and donate an Easter egg of truly presidential proportions to his subjects.\u201d\n\nFalana Condemns Disparity in Justice System, Says Influential Politicians Getting Away with Corruption\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the Inaugural Public Lecture of Department of Public and International Law, Faculty of Law, Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, Oyo State, Falana stated that some personalities in the society seemed to be \u201cuntouchable, since they have the money, they can influence and manipulate the justice system in their favour.\u201d\n\nIn his paper titled, \u201cSentencing Rich and Poor Convicts In Nigeria: An Unbalanced Scale,\u201d Falana identified the dysfunctional justice system operated by Nigerian courts as the main problem with the justice system.\n\nHe said, \u201cOwing to the class character of the society, the courts and law enforcement agencies tend to favour rich convicts against poor convicts. This problem has caused the public to lose hope and trust in the country\u2019s judicial system.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer stated that drastic \u201csteps must be taken to address the issue of disparity in sentencing, to ensure justice, fairness, and equality before the law, for all convicts.\u201d\n\nAccording to Falana, some influential Nigerians commit crimes and get away with it, owing to corruption and the abysmally compromised system.\n\nHe stated, \u201cSome persons convicted and sentenced and jailed were never found in any correctional centre while unemployed young people serve prison terms in lieu of rich convicts.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cJudges could even be coerced into favouring those rich offenders against their own will. But there is often no one to speak for the poor, who often have no voice of their own. On the few occasions that the rich are convicted, they are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors.\n\n\u201cCorruption: this is also one of the major issues affecting the fair administration of justice in Nigeria. Oftentimes, rich defendants engage in dilatory tactics, which frustrate and compel the state to enter into plea bargain with them.\n\n\u201cJudges award lighter sentences to convicted rich defendants or resort to technicalities to free them. Otherwise, how could someone that embezzled pension funds worth billions of Naira be sentenced to only six months imprisonment, but another who stole a cheap telephone handset be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment?\n\n\u201cInjustice: there is also obvious injustice against the poor. More attention is being paid to cases involving the rich, as opposed to the poor.\n\n\u201cI will highlight a few cases to illustrate my point. First, is the case of Tafa Balogun, the former Inspector General of Police. After his arrest and arraignment by EFCC for corruptly enriching himself to the tune of N17 billion, Tafa Balogun went to court challenging the powers of the EFCC to prosecute him. He later withdrew the case from court and the EFCC\u2019s case against him was eventually decided when he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly a case of plea bargaining, as the withdrawal of his case from court led to the negotiation by which his punishment was reduced to six months imprisonment after forfeiting some of his loots to the government.\n\n\u201cAnother incident of plea bargaining was the case of former Governor of Bayelsa State, Dieprieye Alamiesiegha. He, too, was arrested and taken to court by the EFCC, who, after entering into negotiation with the accused, reduced the charges against him to six. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment while he refunded some amount of money into the government coffers.\n\n\u201cSimilar thing happened in the case of Lucky Igbinedon, the former Governor of Edo State, who was fined the sum of N3.5 million after he had entered into a plea bargain with EFCC to reduce the 191-count charge against him to just a single count. Though Igbinedion walked away a free man in Nigeria, he was effectively barred by the United States Government on January 12, 2013 from entering its territory henceforth.\n\n\u201cIn the case of John Yusuf, who embezzled N27.2 billion pension fund of retired police officers, he was sentenced to two years imprisonment or a fine of N750,000.00 that being the maximum punishment provided for in Section 309 of the Penal Code under which he was charged!\n\n\u201cMrs. Cecilia Ibru, the former Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Oceanic Bank Plc. Mrs. Ibru was arraigned before the court by the EFCC on a 25-count charge of different charges of corruption while in office. After negotiation with the anti-corruption body, the charges against her were reduced to three.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the plea bargaining between the EFCC and Mrs. Ibru, the accused decided to plead guilty to the reduced charges of mismanagement and abuse of office. Thereafter, Kola Awodein, (SAN), who appeared for the EFCC, subsequently informed the court that the commission had reached an agreement with Mrs. Ibru and the said agreement had been filed in court.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria added, \u201cOn Friday, the 8th day of October, 2010, the trial judge, Justice Dan Abutu of the Federal High Court, Lagos, delivered judegment in the matter. He sentenced the accused to six months imprisonment on each of the three counts and directed that the sentences should run concurrently. This means the convict was to spend only six months in prison.\n\n\u201cThe convict, however, forfeited N191 billion worth of properties and assets to the government, according to the judgement of the court. Among the properties so forfeited were those in Nigeria, United States of America and Dubai in United Arab Emirates, together with shares in more than 100 companies, most of them listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe judge ordered Mrs. Ibru to be taken to Reddington Hospital, Victoria Island, Lagos by the prison authorities within two hours after they receive the copy of the judgement and she is to remain in the hospital until she is certified fit to stay in prison custody.\n\n\u201cThe case of FRN v. Sarah Ochepke & 2 Ors , where the Defendant along with two other accused persons were by an Amended Charge dated 9th of February, 2018 arraigned before the Federal High Court, Jos, on three counts charge of conspiracy, to accept cash payment of the sum of N450,000,000 from one Annet Olije Gyen, Head of operations, Jos branch of Fidelity Bank Plc, and did accept and retain the said amount of N450,000,000.00, which sum exceeded the amount authorised by law to be paid to an individual(s).\n\n\u201cThe court sentenced the defendants Sarah Ochepke (being the former Minister of Water Resources), Raymond Dabo, and Leo Jitung, to three months imprisonment each, with an option to pay a fine of N1 million each. The offence contravenes the provisions of Section 16(1) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2013 (as amended), carries a minimum term of three years imprisonment or a N10 million fine. The judge, however, exercised his discretion and sentenced them to three months imprisonment each or an option N1 million naira each.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Falana said, \u201cThe case of FRN v. Abdulrasheed Maina is one of the few that made a little difference: Maina who was charged with criminal offences, punishable under sections 11(2) (a), 15(3), and 16(2) (c) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, and also acted in breach of the Advance Fee Fraud Act, was in November, 2021, convicted and sentenced to eight years imprisonment, after being found guilty on all the 12-count charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him and his company, Common Input Property and Investment Limited.\n\n\u201cThe court ordered Maina and his firm to forfeit about N2.1 billion that was traced to their bank accounts, as well as another sum of $223, 396, 30, to the federal government, after which he directed that the company should be wound up. It also ordered the forfeiture of Maina\u2019s two choice properties at Life camp and Jabi districts of Abuja, to the government, likewise the auction of a bulletproof car and a BMW 5 Series exotic car that was found in premises of the convict.\n\n\u201cOn March 18, 2022, an Abuja Upper Area Court in the Gwagwalada area council sentenced a 19-year-old student, Hillary Yunana, to four-month imprisonment for stealing spaghetti and noodles from a shop. The convict, a resident of Bassa village, along Airport Road, Abuja, was charged with burglary and theft.\n\n\u201cThe judge, Sani Umar, jailed Yunana after he pleaded guilty to the offence. Umar, however, gave the convict an option to pay N10,000 for each of the charges, or serve a jail term of two months for each of them. He said the sentence would run concurrently and warned Yunana to desist from committing crimes in the future. The judge said the sentence would serve as a deterrent to anyone who wanted to toe the depraved path in the future.\n\n\u201cOn March 31, 2022, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, discharged and acquitted the former Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Andrew Yakubu, of the money laundering charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him.\n\n\u201cThe court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Ahmed Mohammed, held that the anti-graft agency failed to prove its case against the erstwhile NNPC boss. The court ordered that monies the EFCC seized from Yakubu, who was GMD of the NNPC between 2012 and 2014, should be returned to him.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC had on the strength of a tip-off by a whistle-blower, raided Yakubu\u2019s guest house situated at Sabon Tasha, Kaduna State in 2017 and discovered the sum of $9.7million and \u00a374,000 which he hid in a fireproof safe inside the house.\u201d\n\nFalana explained further, \u201cBetween 2005 and 2006, a panel of enquiry instituted by the federal government found that 197 defendants who were tried, convicted and jailed for drug trafficking were not found in any correctional centre in the country.\n\n\u201cAt the end of their trials, members of a syndicate made of prosecution and defence lawyers, court clerks and warders collected heavy bribes from the convicts and allowed them to escape imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was found that the convicts returned to the nefarious business. I took up the matter with the authorities of the NDLEA, who assured me that the convicts would be arrested and made to serve the prison terms. But that was the end of the story.\n\n\u201cOn July 10, 2015, the then Chief Judge of Anambra State, the Honourable Justice Umeadi, visited all prisons in the state for the purpose of jail delivery to decongest the prisons. His Lordship disclosed that some prison inmates have no records in the prisons. The scandal was well reported at the material time.\n\n\u201cSince inmates are committed to prisons by warrants issued by Judges and Magistrates, the authorities of the correctional centre are challenged to explain who authorised the \u2018imprisonment\u2019 of inmates without records.\n\n\u201cAwaiting trial inmates constitute not less than 75 per cent of the prison population in the country. Majority of the inmates, including convicts, are poor people. The few rich people and members of the ruling class that are jailed are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors in exercise of their powers under section 175 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBased on the recommendation of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Council of State has just approved the pardon of a number of convicted persons, including two former state governors that were jailed for laundering billions of naira.\n\n\u201cSince the constitution provides for equality of all citizens before the law, all other persons convicted for stealing, fraud and money laundering ought to be pardoned and freed. There can be no moral or legal justification for jailing poor people who steal spaghetti and noodles to feed their family members while those who loot the treasury are granted clemency or pardon.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, permit me to call on the poor who constitute the majority of poor victims of institutionalised criminal justice system to unite and fight for socioeconomic justice and equality before the law.\n\n\u201cIn particular, indigent accused persons are advised to brief lawyers in the Legal Aid Council and the Office of the Public Defender in every state of the federation to provide them with legal practitioner whenever they are arrested, detained or charged with any criminal offence.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the state to assign lawyers, free of charge, to citizens who earn less than the national minimum wage of N30,000.00.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law is not neutral in a class society. It is made and enacted by rich legislators to serve the interests of the rich. The judges interpret the law to favour the rich and powerful people in the society.\n\n\u201cThe big lawyers hired to defend the rich exploit loopholes and technicalities in the law to free their rich clients. Hence, the poor man who stole noodle in Abuja to feed himself, was jailed by an Upper Area Court. Even though he had no more to feed himself, the judge sentenced him to six months imprisonment or N20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cBut the former top public officer who laundered $9.8 million and \u00a374,000, has been set free by the Federal High Court. The judge blamed the EFCC for not proving the case beyond reasonable doubt!\u201d\n\nPyrates Confraternity Condemns Pardon to Nyame, Dariye\n\nThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) declared that Nyame and Dariye were undeserving of the presidential pardon.\n\nThe group said the pardon had made mockery of the anti-graft law, stressing that it is manifestly undeserving, blatantly discriminatory and distasteful.\n\nFurthermore, it said the Council of State let the nation down by not rejecting the recommendation of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy to the former governors, adding that the pardon has effectively killed the anti-graft war.\n\nThe NAS Capoon, Mr. Abiola Owoaje, in a statement titled, \u201cPresidential Pardon for Corrupt Ex-governors: Buhari\u2019s death knell for the anti-graft war,\u201d and made available to THISDAY in Yenagoa, said the intention of presidential pardon ought not to be for the likes of Nyame and Dariye.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) is extremely disappointed by the unfortunate decision of the Council of State. We are saddened that the Council, which courageously, reportedly, turned down a state pardon for former Bank PHB Managing Director, Francis Atuche, also serving jail term for corruption, could not display the same courage and reject the request to pardon Nyame and Dariye.\n\n\u201cWhatever the rationale behind acquiescing to the recommendation of the committee to pardon the two corrupt former governors before serving out their prison terms, the nation has been let down by this eminent body.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the pardon had lent justifiable credence to speculations that its intention was to shore up the battered image of the ruling party and give it a bounce ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nOwoaje pointed out that the presidential pardon was inconsistent with Sections 15(5), 17(a) and 42 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended. He added that it \u201calso miserably falls below standards, measures and rules in the United Nations Convention against corruption.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that corruption in the country predated the Buhari administration, adding, however, \u201chis numerous assurances that he would fight and defeat corruption was one of the key reasons Nigerians elected him in 2015 and re-elected him in 2019.\n\n\u201cSeven years down the line, Nigerians are still bearing with the oft repeated refrain that \u2018we must kill corruption before it kills us\u2019 as the only tangible reference to demonstrate the president\u2019s acclaimed commitment to tackle corruption.\n\n\u201cWell-meaning Nigerians had hoped that President Buhari would be able to summon the courage and salvage his administration\u2019s tepid anti-graft war. Sadly, the presidential pardon has made mockery of the war against corruption. Unequivocally, the grim implication of the presidential pardon, aside the demoralising effect it would have on anti-graft officials, is the fact that it has effectively sabotaged the war against graft.\n\n\u201cIt certainly would embolden our well- heeled citizens to engage in corruption with the belief that they can be granted pardon by their friends in government. We have previously recommended to the government steps to take to tackle corruption but the administration\u2019s latest action has shown that it is not willing to lift a finger to fight corruption. In granting state pardon to corrupt individuals, President Buhari has conferred on himself the status of the Chief Undertaker that sounded the death knell for his administrations\u2019 anti-graft war.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Military claims massive air strikes, routing insurgents in North-east\n\n\u2022They\u2019re behind banditry in Imo, says Uzodinma\n\n\u2022As Zulum attributes surrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP members to divine intervention\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\n\n\nFrustrated by worsening insecurity, amid wide criticism of government\u2019s inability to protect the citizenry, Minister of Defence, Maj-Gen Bashir Magashi (rtd), yesterday, called for God\u2019s intervention in the fight against insurgents and other criminal elements in the country.\n\nThe resort to divine intervention came on the heels of reported military air strikes in the North-east, which were said to have routed scores of terrorists. The terrorists had, allegedly, fired mortar bombs at civilian targets in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, recently. That was as the security situation in the country continued to deteriorate, with armed extremists striking at will, kidnapping many, and killing scores.\n\nIn Imo State, the governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said persons blaming Buhari for insecurity were the ones behind banditry in his state. Uzodimma spoke on Monday in Owerri at the wedding ceremony of Chinedu, son of business mogul and politician, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, which held at the Cathedral Church of Transfiguration of Our Lord (CATOL).\n\nIn the continuing climate of insecurity, terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), yesterday attacked a military formation in Molai area of Maiduguri, killing two security personnel.\n\nHowever, breathing a sigh of relief, Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, said the recent mass surrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters and commanders was as a result of divine intervention following prayers from all over the world.\n\nThe air interdiction in the North-east came as Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen Farouk Yahaya, charged troops to sustain the tempo of attack on terrorists.\n\nThe Nigerian Army Headquarters also reported the killing of an alleged member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State by military troops.\n\nIn his Easter message, Magashi called for religious harmony in the country, and prayed for God\u2019s intervention to give the armed forces victory in their various campaigns against security threats across the country. He assured Nigerians of the military\u2019s commitment to defending the sovereignty of the country.\n\nMagashi said the Easter prayer should also focus on \u201cremembering members of the armed forces presently engaged in various campaigns, for God to grant them total victory over all threats to national peace.\u201d He prayed that this year\u2019s Easter celebration \u201cwill usher in the desired peace and prosperity as well as a complete turnaround for the Nigerian Armed Forces to clear the doubts of cynics and return sanity to the dark spots in the country.\n\n\u201cThe celebration of Easter, which coincides with fasting in the holy month of Ramadan by Muslims, is not a mere coincide, it underscores the need for religious harmony as well as portends spirituality and specialty of this auspicious times of festivities,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nHe urged the Islamic and Christian faithful to embrace peaceful coexistence and religious to make Nigeria a better country for all.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force said, after credible intelligence, it launched a devastating attack on Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters on four gun trucks at Kaffa, killing scores of the terrorists and destroying their trucks. This followed Sunday\u2019s midnight attack by insurgents on Goniri in Gujba Local Government Area of Yobe State, where they fired mortar bombs on civilian targets, killing many civilians and injuring others,\n\nA military update said the Nigerian Air Force also scrambled additional Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the location and inflict heavy casualties on ISWAP. It said the aircraft was, at the time of filling this report, still patrolling Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, to ensure that the city remained safe.\n\nSimilarly, the Chief of Army Staff, who was represented by Maj-Gen GM Mutkut, urged troops to avoid any unprofessional conduct while discharging thier duties. Farouk said the troops should redouble their efforts in order to sustain the current tempo in the fight against the insurgency.\n\nHe spoke at the Headquarters Sector 3 OP Hadin Kai and Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in Monguno, Borno State, as he joined the Christian faithful and troops of both commands to celebrate this year\u2019s Easter.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Nigerian Army said troops of 34 Artillery Brigade, Sunday, neutralised a member of IPOB and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network (ESN), at Ihioma community, in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\nThe army stated, \u201cTroops\u2019 on routine patrol encountered members of the irredentist group, who fired sporadically at Banana Junction to enforce the illegal sit at home order on law abiding citizens going about their legitimate businesses.\n\n\u201cThe IPOB/ESN criminals on sighting the troops withdrew in a blue Toyota Highlander towards Ihioma Community for reinforcement. In the firefight that ensued during the operation, one of the criminals was taken out, while others fled in disarray. Troops are combing the general area in a follow up operations to track down the fleeing dissidents.\n\n\u201cHaving suffered casualty and effectively denied freedom of action by the troops, the irredentist group has resorted to cheap propaganda to whip up public sentiments by circulating a doctored video on the social media alleging troops complicity in their mindless atrocities. This propaganda should be disregarded in its entirety.\u201d\n\nPeople Blaming Buhari Behind Banditry, Says Uzodinma\n\nImo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, took exception to the assumption that President Muhammadu Buhari should be blamed for the spate of insecurity in the state, saying those, who harbour such thoughts, are the ones behind banditry in the state.\n\nUzodinma stated that members of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state had become targets of attack by politicians and their collaborators, alleging that they are behind the banditry and killings in Imo State.\n\nSpeaking at the wedding ceremony in Owerri, Uzodimma said wicked politicians had decided to hold Imo State captive, killing innocent persons and burning public and private property in the name of politics. He urged the Church and the congregation to pray for such persons to repent.\n\nOn Sunday, while addressing the congregation at St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Ozuh Omuma, Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State, on Easter, Uzodimma reiterated that the killings going on in the state were politically contrived. He said it was, therefore, pointless to point fingers at Buhari or the governor, as \u201csome soulless persons\u201d were wont to do.\n\n\u201cI pray that God will touch the hearts of these people, who are sponsoring the killing of innocent ones, burning houses and destroying public property in the name of politics,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said it beat his imagination that in the incident, which took place at Ogberuru in Orlu last week, all the victims \u2013 ward chairman, ward secretary and woman leader \u2013 were of the APC.\n\n\u201cI have crosschecked since the inception of this mindless blood letting in Orlu, Orsu and other communities in the zone, not one Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) person has died, their houses burnt or attacked. It is clear to me, therefore, that these killings are the handiwork of politicians who are after the APC members,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor enjoined all men of goodwill to remain fervent in their prayers for God to touch the hearts of both the sponsors of the bandits and their collaborators to come to their senses, particularly, in the light of the occasion of Easter, when Christians remember the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn Firefight, Terrorists Kill One Soldier, Police Officer in Borno\n\nBoko Haram and ISWAP extremists attacked a military formation in Molai area of Maiduguri, and killed two security personnel.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a large number of suspected Boko Haram elements in many vehicles and motorcycles, armed with sophisticated weapons, invaded the security checkpoints manned by officers of the joint task force, Operation Hadin Kai, comprising military and men of the 30/50 Police Mobile Force (PMF).\n\nMilitary sources said sporadic gunshots rocked the area during the attack, which started about 6pm, forcing many residents of Lawanti Kura, NNPC Depot, and Molai to scamper to safety.\n\n\u201cAfter a fierce battle, one soldier, one Police Sargent, Babangida Yusuf of 50 PMF, were killed in action while one Inspector Chindo Samuel sustained injury.\n\nThe sources stated that one military gun truck and military ambulance were carted away by the terrorists. They were later burnt and abandoned as the insurgents fled on arrival of the military air support.\n\nMolai is situated along Maiduguri-Damboa- Road, which is about 10 kilometres from Maiduguri. The attack came less than 24 hours after the Islamic State spokesman, Abu Umar al-Muhajir, announced on April 17 that it would launch attacks in retaliation for the assassination of its leader.\n\nSurrender of over 35,000 Boko Haram/ISWAP Members is Through Divine Intervention, Says Zulum\n\nBorno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, said the surrender of over 35,000 fighters and commanders of Boko Haram and ISWAP was a divine intervention through endless prayers from all over the world.\n\nZulum said this in his Easter message, stressing that the surrender is a miracle towards the healing of Borno State and the North-east.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mass surrender of over 35,000 fighters and commanders is, certainly, one of Allah\u2019s many miracles towards healing Borno State and rest of the North-east.\n\n\u201cThis mass surrender is the product of the endless prayers citizens across Borno State, the North-east region, rest of Nigeria and, indeed, the world have been offering, seeking God\u2019s intervention to heal Borno State. It is the product of immense sacrifices by the armed forces and volunteers. It is product of repeated calls by political leaders, clergies, elders and traditional rulers, asking insurgents to lay down their arms and embrace peace.\n\n\u201cWe must, therefore, be optimistic in welcoming the likely benefits of disarming, demobilising, rehabilitating and reintegrating mass-surrendered insurgents.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must welcome them without disregarding the risks associated with the programme, hence, the need to sustain stringent security profiling and other Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) procedures that can ensure the overall safety of the programme.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge all citizens to fervently pray for the success of our DDR for the mass surrender of those who seek peace, and for the successes of our armed forces and volunteers in frontlines against those who insist on violence.\n\n\u201cMay God grant us enduring peace in Borno State, the North-east and rest of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nZulum added, \u201cIn over 12 years of our battles with insurgents (Boko Haram and later ISWAP) Borno State, for the first time, has a golden window that has the potential of ending the insurgency.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Discloses Addax had two extensions but failed to pay up\n\n\u2022Oil rises to $113 as Libya outages add to Russia supply fears\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\n\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe, has said under his leadership, no marginal field operator would be allowed to \u201ctrade\u201d in papers issued by the organisation.\n\nKomolafe, who spoke with the Africa Oil+Gas Report, stated that the rule of law would be strictly followed in the issuance of final licences to the winners, stating that no amount of pressure would make the commission award final documents without due process.\n\nThe NUPRC boss also spoke on the Addax issue. He disclosed that when he assumed office, he reviewed the file and observed that two extensions had been granted for payment, but the company could not come up with the money until the award lapsed.\n\nMeanwhile, oil rose yesterday, with Brent crude topping $113 a barrel, as outages in Libya deepened concern over tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis dragged on, offsetting concern over slowing Chinese demand.\n\nStating that the NUPRC \u201cwon\u2019t be arbitrary\u201d, Komolafe stressed that some of the 119 companies that had fully paid their bonuses were insisting that they could not raise funds without collecting the licences.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn many cases the moment people get a letter of award, they write to say they want to assign. Assign what? There\u2019s a phrase in law, frequently rendered in Latin: \u2018Nemo dat quod non habet\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt means \u2018You can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have\u2019. For you to get an award, you have to show the proof that you can pay the signature bonus and you can finance the field development.\n\n\u201cYou get it only because you\u2019ve met the requirements. Your award would have been consummated before you can talk of assignment. We shouldn\u2019t be encouraging people making money by trading papers.\n\n\u201cIt is better you have a regulator that abides by the rule of law than to have a genius as a regulator. If you have a judge in court and he decides to rule on the basis of his ingenuity, then, it becomes a ground for appeal.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf you have such a judge, he is a problem judge; he would be abusing discretion. I am going to ensure that our rules and processes give effect to the law. Awards of acreages will be carried out on the basis of fairness, transparency and competitiveness.\u201d\n\nKomolafe, therefore, insisted that until the process was completed, no licences would be issued, stating all decisions would be taken based on strict adherence to the rules.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnyone whose licence is revoked during my tenure will not have a space to challenge. We will take a decision such that everyone challenging it will be standing on very weak ground.\n\n\u201cNow, some of the 119 companies, who have fully paid their bonuses, have formed the required Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to operate the assets.\n\n\u201cThey are asking for their licences, without which, some say, they are neither able to raise the funds for their work programmes, nor start working relationship discussions with the oil majors, who operate the leases from which the marginal fields were ring fenced.\u201d\n\nAddressing the Addax issue, Komolafe said, \u201cIf you were granted an award, it is guided by the law of contract. If you don\u2019t meet the terms, the award reverts to the original owner. It is now the obligation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to find a viable partner to operate the asset.\u201d\n\nHe pledged that the federal government would pursue vigorously the gas flare commercialisation programme, promising, \u201cI am going to rework, rejig it to finalise the work.\u201d\n\nKomolafe hoped that the process would be wrapped up before the end of the second quarter of 2022.\n\n\u201cIn finalising the round, we will ensure fairness, transparency and competitiveness. We are going to ensure very effective regulation that will give effect to the finest spirit of competition,\u201d he pledged.\n\nReiterating that NUPRC was in the process of developing regulations for the activation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NUPRC helmsman noted that the law must be given effect by regulations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere will be public hearings of the regulator, just as you have public hearings for the law making, you must also have public hearings for the regulations of the law. You must have the stakeholders\u2019 hearings.\u201d\n\nKomolafe explained that the PIA provided robustly for abandonment, host community and award of acreages, but argued that it could not be given effect until the entire process was consummated.\n\nOn how he intended to tackle the challenges, Komolafe said, \u201cI came with a revolutionary mind-set. I am a unique person in the industry, going by my background. I intend to do things differently in terms of adhering to processes.\u201d\n\nOil Rises to $113 as Libya Outages Add to Russia Supply Fears\n\nOil rose yesterday, with Brent crude topping $113 a barrel, as outages in Libya deepened concern over tight global supply and the Ukraine crisis dragged on, offsetting concern over slowing Chinese demand.\n\nAdding to supply pressures from sanctions on Russia, Libya\u2019s National Oil Corp on warned that, \u201ca painful wave of closures\u201d had begun hitting its facilities and declared force majeure at Al-Sharara oilfield and other sites.\n\n\u201cWith global supplies now so tight, even the most minor disruption is likely to have an outsized impact on prices,\u201d said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at brokerage OANDA.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, rose $1.37, or 1.2 per cent, to $113.07 at 1332 GMT, not far from the highest since March 30 of $113.80 hit earlier in the session. United States West Texas Intermediate gained $1.48, or 1.4 per cent, to $108.43.\n\nThe Libyan developments offset concern about demand in China, where the economy slowed in March, taking the shine off first-quarter growth numbers and worsening an outlook already weakened by COVID-19 curbs.\n\n\u201cSome Asian investors booked profits as they became worried about slowing demand in China,\u201d said Satoru Yoshida, a commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities.\n\nData showed China refined two per cent less oil in March than a year earlier, with throughput falling to the lowest since October as the surge in crude prices squeezed margins and tight lockdowns hurt demand.\n\nIn March, oil surged to the highest since 2008, with Brent briefly topping $134.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that there were concerns of deeper supply losses looming as Russian production declined by 7.5 per cent in the first half of April from March and EU governments said last week the bloc\u2019s executive was drafting proposals to ban Russian crude.\n\nThose comments came before an escalation in the Ukraine war. Ukrainian authorities said missiles struck Lviv early on Monday and explosions rocked other cities as Russian forces kept up their bombardments after claiming near full control of the port of Mariupol.\n\nAuthorities claimed tribal leaders in southern Libya had shut down the county\u2019s largest oil field \u2014 the latest closure of an oil facility amid a bitter standoff between two rival governments.\n\nOil production at the Sharara field has been stopped and the state-run National Oil Corporation declared force majeure at the field, which produced around 450,000 barrels a day.\n\nForce majeure is a legal manoeuvre that enables a company to get out of its contractual obligations because of extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe corporation called the shutdown of the field an \u201cabsurd move\u201d that mirrored the ongoing standoff in the country. The closure would likely create a fuel crisis in the oil-rich country, as the field was one of the main sources of domestic fuel.\n\nThe corporation did not name those people behind the closure, but its announcement came a few hours after tribal leaders in the desert town of Ubari, about 950 kilometres (590 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli, said they shut down the field in protest against the government of embattled Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah.\n\nThey called for Tripoli-based Dbeibah to hand over power to the government of Prime Minister Fathi Bashagha, who was appointed by the parliament in February to lead a transitional administration after Libya failed to hold its first presidential election in December.\n\nLocal media also reported that residents in the south-eastern district of Whahat announced the closure of all oil facilities in their area, also to pressure Dbeibah to step aside.\n\nOver the weekend, tribal leaders and protesters shut down the al-Feel field and the Zueitina terminal on the Gulf of Sirte, forcing the national oil company to declare force majeure at the two facilities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Education is fundamental. Religion and ethnicity are out of it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said that with concerted public enlightenment, it had become clear to Nigerians that Boko Haram was a perversion of religion rather than an Islamic ideology.\n\n\u201cGod is justice.

It\u2019s either you don\u2019t know that God at all or you are simply being stupid.\n\n\u201cTo say that Western education is unacceptable (Haram) is very fraudulent. That is why we are fighting them and educating the people, and we are succeeding a lot.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSome people have just made it a lifestyle to cause confusion, destruction and death.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the ICC prosecutor said that extremism was like cancer which spreads and can also recede.\n\nHe said what Boko Haram does in collaboration with the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) is a perversion of religion.\n\nHe said that ICC believed in \u201ccomplementarity which promotes collaboration as against confrontation.\u201d\n\nKhan urged Nigeria, in concert with other Sahel/Lake Chad basin countries, to get the United Nations Security Council to refer the atrocities committed by the terrorist groups operating in the region to ICC for investigation and trial.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "For the first time in the past decade, Netflix announced that it lost subscribers in a quarter.\n\nThe announcement was made by the streaming giant during its recent earnings call where it also shocked investors by forecasting that its number of subscribers would fall by another 2 million in the current quarter, to about 219.6 million, after declining about 200,000 in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nNetflix shares plummeted over 25%, shaving $30 billion off the company\u2019s market valuation after this announcement was made.\n\nNetflix previously told shareholders it\u2019s expected to add 2.5 million net subscribers during the first quarter. During the same period a year ago, Netflix added 3.98 million paid users.\n\nThe company said it would have seen 500,000 subscriber net additions during the most recent quarter, but for the suspension of its service in Russia and the winding-down of all Russian paid memberships which resulted in a loss of 700,000 subscribers.\n\nNetflix attributed the slowdown in part to saturation in its biggest markets, it also acknowledged the impact of rising competition from streaming services launched by traditional media groups such as Disney, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount.\n\nIn the wake of its loss of subscribers, Netflix wants to maximise revenue from existing subscribers and viewers. To do this, the company is now looking into cracking down on password sharing, an act Hastings once described as \u2018a positive thing\u2019 a few years ago.\n\nOn the earnings call, Hastings said, \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of how to monetise sharing. We\u2019ve been thinking about that for a couple of years. When we were growing fast it wasn\u2019t a high priority to work on, now we\u2019re working super hard on it.\u201d\n\nNetflix estimates that there are about 100 million households that share passwords. The company has already started testing ways to prevent sharing passwords. COO Greg Peters explained on the call that Netflix is not planning to eliminate sharing passwords but most likely charge a premium on users who want to share their accounts with friends and family.\n\nTo curb the loss of subscribers Netflix is now planning to introduce lower-priced, ad-supported plans. This announcement hints that the company is open to exploring an alternative business model, considering that Netflix has raised prices 6 times in the last 8 years, making subscriptions twice as expensive as they were in 2014.\n\n\u201cThose who have followed Netflix know that I have been against the complexity of advertising and a big fan of the simplicity of subscription,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cBut as much as I am a fan of that, I am a bigger fan of consumer choice, and allowing consumers who would like to have a lower price and are advertising-tolerant to get what they want makes a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, Netflix has had a difficult time penetrating the mass market due to its high subscription price. Last year, the streaming giant introduced a $3.99 mobile-only plan that costs 50% less than the standard plan.\n\nUnlike the typical 30 days trial which gives users access to Netflix\u2019s full library for a limited time, in this free plan, Netflix is only making about one-quarter of its movies and television shows catalogue available. Even at that, the $3.99 is still a lot to ask from many Africans, as 490 million people in Africa live under the poverty line of $1.90/day according to a 2021 UN estimate.\n\nThe ad-supported model might be Netflix\u2019s best chance at unlocking growth on the African continent, which consists of an audience that might not be able to pay higher prices but is comfortable with ads.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "With a fresh $100k grant, DevCareer is plugging Africa\u2019s talent gap by providing laptops for tech newbies",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, African startups raised approximately $5 billion, almost three times what was raised in 2020. While more funding has gone into the ecosystem, technical talent has not grown at the same pace.\n\nPer the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report, professional software developers in Africa grew by 3.8% to 716,000 engineers in 2021. As with funding, most of these developers live or work for startups in Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, or Kenya.\n\nFurthermore, as the shift to remote work becomes more popular, African startups have to compete with foreign startups for an already scarce pool of developers. These startups, which can pay significantly higher wages than their African counterparts, now employ 38% of African developers.\n\nThis development is both an opportunity and a cause for concern. For Sultan Akintunde, Founder of non-profit, DevCareer, ensuring a steady supply of talent for Africa\u2019s digital landscape is vital to the ecosystem\u2019s long-term success. In addition to his work at DevCareer, Akintunde is also co-founder of technical talent accelerators, TalentQL and AltSchool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOut of a desire to support new African tech talents, Akintunde gave out free software development. Only 5 of the 200 people who got the courses gave any feedback.\n\nWorried that his effort was futile, he decided to use Twitter for a crowdfunding campaign \u2014 the plan was to give laptops to ten developers.\n\nDespite the support on the social networking site, he could not raise any money in the first week. Fortunately, the crowdfunding effort took off, and he raised enough money to get the laptops. Providing laptops is easy, but how do you ensure they are used for the intended purpose?\n\nEnter DevCareer\n\nWith support from some volunteers and generous sponsors, Akintunde launched DevCareer in 2019 to support Africa\u2019s burgeoning ecosystem. Since its inception, he says that the organisation has supported over 5,000 Africans with laptops or courses.\n\nLaptop4Developers is the organisation\u2019s most popular initiative. As its name implies, it gives laptops to a few individuals who cannot afford them yearly. With over 30 laptops given out in the past three years, the organisation plans to give out 100 laptops to 50 men and 50 women in 2022.\n\n$100k to provide laptops\n\nFor this cohort, the organisation received a $100,000 grant from non-profit organisation, Pledges; fintech startup, Kuda Bank; cloud solutions startup, Deimos; and identity verification startup, Dojah. The three-month programme provides them with enough resources and training to land their first jobs. To do this, Akintunde reveals that DevCareer is partnering with other organisations to get jobs for cohort members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevCareer has raised $100,000 to equip 100 Africans with laptops.\n\n\u201cBefore the programme starts, we\u2019re going to partner with companies, so we\u2019re pairing them with a company for a two-month internship immediately after they finish. Previously, when you finished your programme, we assisted you in getting a job for the first five months, but we don\u2019t want to do that again,\u201d says Akintunde.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Andrew Mori, Deimos CEO, \u201cDevCareers and Deimos share a focus on developing and empowering engineers. We are proud to sponsor and support their mission of helping more individuals get a start in technology.\n\n\u201cWith increased digitisation, plus a fast-growing African tech ecosystem, engineers are in high demand, which is leaving a gaping hole in supply. Even with this high demand, Africa is starting to cement itself as a region of enormous engineering capability and capacity. Today\u2019s junior software engineers are tomorrow\u2019s seniors, and we are proud to play a part in that.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that only those who are newbies get the laptops, DevCareer physically verifies applicants after they have gone through a two-step assessment.\n\n\u201cThat verification process helps us a lot because we\u2019re giving out laptops. One of the criteria is a two-step assessment before getting to the interview part of the process. People who already know this work can help others take the test, so this is a security measure.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has taken an online course knows how difficult it can be to stay committed and finish on time. However, Akintunde says everyone who has gone through the Laptop4Developers programme has completed it, with graduates getting jobs at startups like Flutterwave and Bento.\n\nEven after getting accepted, participants do not go home with the laptop for the programme\u2019s first two months. DevCareer has formed partnerships with tech hubs in some states in Nigeria where participants study and where the laptops are kept.\n\nThese hubs include Wennovation Hub, Impact Hub, and CcHUB in Lagos; Olotu Square Hub in Port Harcourt; and 720 Degree Hub in Abeokuta.\n\nBuilding a talent pipeline through partnerships\n\nThere seems to be a consensus that there are not enough talents in Africa, but Akintunde believes it is a subjective discussion.\n\n\u201cWhen we say there are not enough talents, are we talking about senior, mid-level, or junior talent? There are specific fields where we don\u2019t even have any talents in Africa. When you look at fields like game and motion design, we have very few people there.\u201d\n\nHe also believes that the low number of talents could be attributed to the growth of the local tech ecosystem. Some of the continent\u2019s most prominent startups have been running for less than seven years, and he believes that while these startups find their feet, it falls on other organisations to ensure a steady supply of talent for the tech industry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDevCareer plans to make members of its cohort commit to funding the education of one person after graduation.\n\nHowever, he believes that startups can still play a role by building partnerships with organisations that train or place talents in jobs. This focus on partnerships explains why the organisation has decided to raise funds from local businesses.\n\nEnogieru Osasenaga, Grant Portfolio Manager at Pledges, said, \u201cLaptop4Developers has brought forth an interesting model that upskills youths and ensures that they remain on the same path after the training. We understand that people get to achieve only as far as they can perceive; thus, our goal, in this case, is to broaden that horizon so our target communities see limitless possibilities.\u201d\n\nAs crucial as engineers are to startups, other roles are needed to drive growth and move from an idea to a business, and Akintunde reveals that DevCareer intends to target other roles in tech. For a start, the plan is to take in at least five designers in the current cohort, with plans for more in the future.\n\nAs a non-profit, DevCareer is dependent on individuals\u2019 donations, and Akintunde admits that such an approach could make it impossible for them to reach their goals. In response, DevCareer is launching what Akintunde calls a sustainability plan leveraging community. With this plan, graduates of each cohort commit to providing funds to train one person in the next cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because a 10-year-old Chrisland Schools student was allegedly gang-raped, and videotaped about a month ago. She was chosen to represent her school in sports in Dubai.\n\nFirst off, I\u2019m not sharing the video because it\u2019s inappropriate. Second, if you have the video, I beg you to delete it. The girl will be an adult in seven to ten years. Please tell me how you would react if you were in her shoes and saw a video of yourself from ten years ago on the Internet.\n\nFollowing this news, the keyword \u201cParenting\u201d has recently dominated my Twitter trendtables. People\u2019s reactions to the video imply that whatever happened to the girl was the result of poor parenting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut can we blame the parents? I mean, aside from parents doing their part, children are products of their environment \u2013 not excluding social media, books, music and movies.\n\nWe can only rant and argue about what is and isn\u2019t true, but parenting is difficult and there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\n\nSo, when you become a parent \u2013 or if you are already one \u2013 always give your kids sincere reasons they should or shouldn\u2019t do a thing. If you don\u2019t tell them, someone else could be doing it incorrectly or with the intent to deceive them.

We want to support Web3-based innovations and products even as we help you learn and understand Web3. We are here to help beginners and intermediates.\n\nWhat are we looking for? We\u2019re looking for unique Web3/blockchain-based solutions to problems in any industry across Africa. While clever and innovative solutions are important, design, functionality, and scalability will be closely scrutinised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn April 20, 2022, participants will pitch their ideas to judges and receive feedback and recommendations.

Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Restaurants and traditional food business models are being affected due to high startup costs, excessive regulation, and the effects of COVID-19. However, it appears that there is an alternative to the traditional kitchen: cloud kitchens.\n\nWhat is a cloud kitchen? A cloud kitchen, also known as a \u201cghost kitchen\u201d or \u201cvirtual kitchen,\u201d is a commercial kitchen space that offers food businesses the facilities and services necessary to prepare menu items for delivery and takeout.\n\nInterestingly, cloud kitchens are becoming more popular in some parts of the Middle East and North Africa. Examples of these are Comida Cloud Kitchen, Food Nation, and The Food Lab.\n\nAnd now, The Food Lab, an Egyptian cloud kitchen provider, has raised $4.5 million in a pre-seed round of funding.\n\nWho are the investors? The round was led by Africa-focused fund 4DX Ventures, Nuwa Capital and Shorooq Partner, while Al Faisaliah Group and Samurai Incubate, and others participated.\n\nThe Food Lab is a cloud kitchen platform, but it also identifies itself as an infrastructure company for Egypt\u2019s food and beverage (F&B) restaurants. It offers a comprehensive set of end-to-end services, including cloud kitchen (kitchen as a service) and procurement.\n\nLaunched by Kareem El Daly (CEO) and Ahmed Osman and Wesam Masoud (co-founders) in 2020, the company says its platform allows \u201cexisting restaurant owners to grow exponentially and new brands to go from concept to launch within just ten days.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, The Food Lab says it is used by more than 50 restaurants and food brands, and 175,000 end customers have placed orders from its kitchens. Consequently, revenues have increased by 25-35 percent month on month.\n\nExpansion plans? The pre-seed funding will allow the company to grow in Egypt and lay the groundwork for future moves into the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nETAP wants to help drivers buy insurance in 90 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of cars on the road in Lagos State, Nigeria. The total number of cars parked outside some gates in my neighbourhood is enough to make you wonder if they outnumber the population of some villages.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA), there are 13 million vehicles on Nigerian roads, with approximately 3 million insured. The maths adds up to uninsured cars reaching 77% and demonstrates how much Nigerians rate insurance. That was sarcasm, by the way.\n\nBut how do we encourage the country\u2019s adoption of auto insurance? ETAP, an insurtech startup, wants to solve this problem.\n\nNigerian insurtech startup, ETAP has raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding to expand its team and drive the adoption of much-needed car insurance throughout Africa.\n\nTangerine Insurance, Graph Ventures (which invested in Clubhouse), Newmont, and other angel investors participated in the round, which was led by Mobility 54 (the Venture Capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group).\n\nFounded by Ibraheem Babalola (CEO), the company claims it digitises the insurance purchasing and claiming process, resulting in a seamless and enjoyable insurance experience for users.\n\nETAP says it employs machine learning to create intelligent risk profiles for each driver. This allows them to be rewarded for safe driving with Safe Driving Points that can be redeemed for everyday rewards like shopping vouchers, movie tickets, and more.\n\nBesides, the company claims it has insured over 130,000 individual trips and over 500,000 kilometres in car journeys since its beta launch in November 2021.\n\nBeginning in Nigeria, the new funding will support the rollout of ETAP\u2019s app, which allows drivers to buy insurance in 90 seconds, complete claims in 3 minutes or less, and be rewarded for safe driving and avoiding accidents.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Product Development Centre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? Yesterday, Tuesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the launch of the first Product Development Centre in Africa in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nObjectives of the launch: It will assist in developing transformative products and services for people in Africa and around the world. Moreso, it will hire visionary engineers, product managers, UX designers, and researchers to lay the groundwork for significant growth in the coming years.\n\nWhat is the centre looking for? It\u2019s looking for talented, creative individuals who can assist in the resolution of difficult and important technical challenges, like improving the smartphone experience for Africans or constructing a more reliable Internet infrastructure.\n\nIn October 2021, recall that Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, announced a $1 billion investment over the next five years to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation.\n\nPer the company, the new product development centre is a continuation of that commitment, and it will work to build for Africa and the rest of the world.\n\nRecall that Amazon recently announced the launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Local Zone in Kenya. In addition, Visa revealed its first African innovation hub. And in 2019, Microsoft opened a development centre in Kenya and Nigeria. Yes, all of this is taking place in Kenya!

          "title": "#NotTooYoungToRun: Youths say APC N100m form \u2018sickening\u2019",
          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) has come under fire for fixing the cost of its presidential form at N100 million, with youths and other commentators saying it will limit the chances of young aspirants to run for president.\n\nThey described the cost of the presidential form as \u201csickening\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in 2018 signed into law the #NotTooYoungToRun Bill, which aimed at removing the age constraints that hindered youths from seeking elective offices.\n\nThe APC, at the end of its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Abuja on Wednesday, fixed the cost of forms for governorship at N50 million; Senate, N20 million; House of Representatives, N10 million; and State House of Assembly, N20 million.\n\nWhen Buhari signed into law the #NotTooYoungToRun Bill, he had told the youth not to contest with him, but to wait until he left office.\n\nIsrael Abdulahi, APC national youth leader, had said recently that he would lobby other members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) to reduce the cost of nomination forms for young people.\n\nAbdulahi made the promise upon his emergence as the national youth leader during the party\u2019s consensus national convention in Abuja last month. He had said that election would increase the number of youths that would contest for elective offices.\n\n\u201cI will go into the NWC meeting to make a case on behalf of that strong body of the youths across the nation to ensure that our young people get preference. If you are giving women 50 percent, you should be able to give young people under the age of 35 at least, if not 40, the consensus to be able to pay a discounted fee,\u201d Abdulahi had said.\n\nAlthough the APC has announced a 50 percent discount for nomination forms for members under the age of 40, it said they have to pay fully for the expression of interest forms.\n\nFelix Morka, APC national publicity secretary, who disclosed this while briefing journalists at the party\u2019s NEC, said: \u201cOur youths also got some very special consideration out of this meeting. And our youth are considered persons between the ages of 25 to 40 to purchase the expression of interest forms but with a discount of 50 percent on the nomination forms.\u201d\n\nBut out of the N100 million cost for presidential aspirants for instance, expression of interest form goes for N30 million, which must be paid in full by all aspirants, while nomination form is put at N70 million, which the youth would pay 60 percent.\n\nEven with the discount, youths who have presidential ambition must pay about N70 million for the forms, which is much higher than the N40 million charged by the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the same office.\n\nReacting to the issue, Christian Okeke, Political Science lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, said it was a ploy to shut youths out of aspirations for elective offices.\n\nOkeke, in an interview with BusinessDay, said: \u201cEven though it is the prerogative of the party to raise funds for its activities and nobody should dictate to it how much to charge her members, but the amount fixed for its presidential expression of interest and nomination forms by the APC is sickening, discriminatory, outrageous, insensitive and conspicuously alarming and out of sync with realities on ground as regards the country\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cOne may be tempted to even tag it daylight robbery. It presents a clear picture of the determination by the ruling elite to exclude rising political stars, the low, medium and honest income earners who are interested in politics from political participation.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt is a ploy by the oligarchs to retain their over-domineering influence on politics. It is bye-bye to clamour by youths to contest elections. It is poison to clamour for political reform in the country. In fact, it is tantamount to a ploy to disenfranchise aspirants.\n\n\u201cIn light of the present economy, it is absolutely impossible for millions who live on less than a dollar per day to aspire to govern this country. Except thieves, robbers, kidnappers as well as elected and appointed corrupt office holders, many honest and hard-working Nigerians cannot afford that amount for just two forms.\u201d\n\nRead also: APC fixes presidential form at N100m, convention holds May\n\nOkeke said that even if putting the form at that amount was a way to prune down the number of aspirants, the implication was that APC planned to give the party\u2019s ticket to the highest bidder.\n\n\u201cIt is bye-bye to fair playing field and hilarious welcome to deepened influence of money in Nigeria\u2019s politics, something that stakeholders were looking for ways to end. We hope that the Nigerian people have taken note of this. It is hoped that Nigerians now understand in full what the party stands for. It is hoped that the people will decide to take back power to themselves in the next election,\u201d he added.\n\nSome Nigerians took to their Twitter handles to condemn the APC\u2019s costs of nomination forms, with some alluding to the lamentation of Buhari in 2014 when he was to pay just over N20 million for the same forms.\n\nEniola Akinkuotu @ENIBOY said: \u201c8 years ago General Buhari said he could not afford the APC Presidential form which was pegged at N20 million. He said he took a bank loan to purchase the form. Today, while he is leader of the APC, the party has pegged its form at N100 million.\u201d\n\nAyobami @dondekojo said: \u201cIf true, the price for the APC form is truly insane. Then again, they live in another world; thanks to the unbridled corruption in the past 7 years.\u201d\n\nAzubike Osumili @azuosumili submitted that: \u201cAPC get mind sha! 100m for nomination form to contest in the presidential primary. 100million Mullah, for wetin na? Highest in history. Where Ngige wan get 100m now?\n\nDeborah Toluwase said: \u201cAPC\u2019s form N100 million. This is a wawu. This is one of the reasons we say politics in Nigeria does not favour the youths. Imagine a youth trying to become president.\u201d",

          "title": "IMF Chief says 20 SSA countries close to debt distress",
          "text": "Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva has raised fresh concerns that up to 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are close to debt distress, pushed by first, COVID pandemic impact and the new spillover effects of the war in Ukraine.\n\nShe raised the concerns during her press briefing Wednesday on the global policy agenda at the ongoing Spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank which are majorly holding virtually.\n\nGeorgieva is further worried that the Russia -Ukraine war is fast translating to hunger in sub-Saharan Africa, which the fund slashed its growth forecast to 3.8% on Tuesday, citing new headwinds.\n\nResponding to a particular question on Africa, she stated: \u201cWe have seen Africa push back because of the COVID- induced crisis in its development. As it was recovering, it\u2019s now hit by the consequences of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAnd these consequences are quite severe- growth projections revised down for many countries. Out of 54 countries in the Africa continent, 12 are exporters, the rest are all importers and are hit by high energy prices.\n\n\u201cBut the most troubling impact is of high food prices and food insecurity. To put it very simply, a war in Ukraine is translating to hunger in Africa.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, what must be done in terms of three avenues of action includes first of all, to protect countries and people from the risk of food crisis.\n\n\u201cWe know that bringing the international community together to provide financing and also to guarantee export of food and to build agricultural productivity in Africa, including measures right now to get farmers to produce more is absolutely paramount.\n\nRead also: COVID-19: Side effects, apathy discourage 6m from taking second dose\n\nThe second line of urgent action includes the huge burden of debt in sub-Saharan Africa. \u201cTwenty countries are already close to debt distress, and with interest rates going up, this burden of debt is intolerable, so working to get debt restructuring early is a priority for us.\u201d\n\nThe third is helping Africa on the longer term challenges \u2013 top of which is climate change. \u201cWe have seen the pictures in South Africa, we have to recognize that Africa contributes very little to the problem of climate change, but it\u2019s extremely vulnerable, so a massive approach including supporting our new resilience system sustainability trust is needed for Africa,\u201d the IMF Chief stressed.\n\nBut earlier in her opening speech, she recognized that the world is now in what she called \u2018a consequential moment.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are facing a crisis upon a crisis- a war, on top of a pandemic. It\u2019s like we have been hit by another storm before we have recovered from the last one.\u201d\n\nShe said the result is a massive setback for the global Economy, as indicated in the IMF cut of its earlier global growth forecast to 3.6% for 2022.\n\nAccording to her, the downgrade of supply to 143 countries, caused largely by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the shock wave it has sent around the world, is troubling.\n\nBut there are other significant consequences going far beyond Ukraine \u2013 accelerated inflation \u2013 which has become a clear and present danger for many countries with rising food and fuel prices straining the budgets of ordinary families to a breaking point; financial tightening because of the need to counter inflation, hitting countries with high debt the hardest; and frequent wide ranging lockdowns in China causing bottlenecks in global supply chains.\n\n\u201cThese are additional dark clouds weighing on the global economy and there is one more important crisis hanging over our head \u2013 the risk of geopolitical fragmentation which could jeopardize the development gains of the world\u2019s 75 years and also leave us unable to deal with the current crisis and address other global challenges such as climate change.\u201d\n\nShe said that in dealing with the present global storm, the IMF has presented its Global Policy Agenda, and is analyzing the repercussions of the crisis, and also offers a way forward in terms of immediate response and longer term efforts to boast resilience to shocks to still come.\n\nAccording to Georgieva, the \u201cimmediate hope must be for the war to end.\n\n\u201cThat would have the single most positive effect on the global recovery right now.\u201d\n\nBut in the meantime, everything must be done to help Ukraine and other heavily affected countries.\n\nShe said the Fund has already provided $1.4 billion in emergency financing to Ukraine, and created a special account through which others can securely contribute.\n\nShe also disclosed her talks just a few days ago, with Ukrainian President Zelensky on a massive reconstruction effort that will be needed as well as the immediate financial gap for the functioning of the economy that has to be filled.\n\nThe IMF is also working to help the impact on Ukraine neighbors which are generously hosting a large number of refugees.\n\nAnd of course because COVID has not disappeared, she urged that the fight against the pandemic must not be relaxed.\n\n\u201cWith our partners, we have proposed comprehensive tools to include vaccines, testing and antiviral treatments which can be deployed everywhere at the modest cost of $50billion this year, $10 billion in subsequent years..\n\nOn the issue of global inflation concerns, Georgieva said this must be tackled under three pressing priorities. First is that it requires decisive actions by Central banks, which must focus on a positive economy and adjust policies as needed. \u201cAnd as they tighten, major central banks should communicate clearly, mindful of the spillover risks to vulnerable emerging and developing economies,\u201d she urged.\n\nSecond, is the high rising global food prices which are particularly concerning especially in poor countries where there is a growing risk of food crisis and food insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe need International action and we need it now.\u201d\n\nThe third is tackling inflation through monetary policy targeting which raises the cost of servicing debt for low income countries, as the burden has reached 50 percent of GDP and that places 70 percent of countries at or near that distressed situation.\n\nTo address that, countries need policies that help their budget back on track, while providing targeted assistance to the most vulnerable and they can do that with more equitable tax policies.\n\nAt the same time, international support is essential. Here the IMF has urged that the G20 common framework for that treatment must be improved with clear procedures and timelines for debtors and creditors. It should also be expanded to other highly indebted vulnerable countries.\n\nThese immediate responses will not only lessen the impact of today\u2019s double crisis, but to be ready for tomorrow\u2019s challenges, we need reforms to build resilience, she stated.\n\nFor the economy, by implementing far reaching structural reforms to secure the foundation for sustainable growth and job creation, the IMF is stepping up to help its members on all these fronts with policy advice and capacity development and with its financial capacity, has deployed around $300 billion, and has some extra $700billion available to deploy.\n\nOn top of that is the $650 billion in SDR, which it disbursed to its members last summer to enable them respond to the current crisis.\n\n\u201cDespite the storms overhead, we will work together to bring all safely towards the shore,\u201d she assured.",

          "title": "Late Dick Kramer, tireless builder, inspired BusinessDay",
          "text": "The Oxford English dictionary defines an era as a long and distinct period of history, especially one marked by distinct events.\n\nThe life of Richard \u2018Dick\u2019 Kramer was remarkable enough that it he was once described as a \u2018modern-day pioneer and management missionary.\u2019 That was what immediately came to mind when the death of Dick on April 18, 2022, after a brief illness, filtered in. He was 88 years old.\n\nHis death marked the end of an era that was defined, for the purposes of written record and literature, by many firsts when it comes to management principles and its application, not only in corporate Nigeria and academia, but also globally.\n\n\u201cJust heard Dick Kramer has passed away. He didn\u2019t touch my life as much as he touched many others in Nigeria (especially the Arthur Andersen gang) but he had a very positive impact on me. His impact on Nigeria surpasses that of many \u2018leaders\u2019. May he rest in peace and in power,\u201d Andrew Alli said on Twitter.\n\nWe consider the time of Dick an era because it was a fixed point in time from which a series of applicable management principles, through several years, were reckoned. His walk and works can be seen through some memorable dates and events, especially on how they touched individuals and corporations.\n\nUsing a system of chronological commentary computed from some given dates as basis, Frank Aigbogun, CEO/publisher, BusinessDay Media Limited, said, \u201cDick was a father, teacher, friend and mentor to us at BusinessDay.\n\nHe inspired the setting up of BusinessDay and told me if I ever made the decision to launch BusinessDay, I should count on his support. Not surprising, he became both a director on BusinessDay\u2019s Board of Directors and served for many years as chair of our Editorial Advisory Board to which he singlehandedly attracted brilliant talents as members and thereafter working tirelessly to hand hold our people for many years. We will all miss him sorely.\u201d\n\nOn hearing of his death, Uduimo Itsueli, chairman of BusinessDay Editorial Advisory Board, described Dick as a pioneer, visionary, and a giant who will be greatly missed, saying he had known him since 1979 as a gentleman who was central to the establishment of many great companies.\n\n\u201cI had a great relationship with him and those of us that worked with him on the Vision 2010 for Nigeria saw that he was very passionate about the country\u2019s growth and development. He will be greatly missed,\u201d Itsueli said.\n\nLaoye Jaiyeola, CEO of Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), described Dick as one of the founding fathers of the NESG and he remained at the forefront of its activities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NESG cannot talk about the role of public-private partnership without mentioning him. He helped us see the need for regular dialogue with the government as he focused on how Nigeria can have good governance in place.\n\n\u201cAlthough he will be sorely missed, Kramer has left his footprints in the sands of time.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chuka Mordi, CEO/MD at Ellah Lakes plc, said throughout the course of his long stay in Nigeria, Dick touched and inspired numerous people in the most positive fashion, contributing a significant amount to the development of Nigeria in so many important aspects.\n\n\u201cI was privileged to work with him for a few years, and I had a great deal of respect for his clarity of thought, his perspicacity, and his willingness, whatever the circumstances, to ask difficult questions in order to uncover truth,\u201d Mordi added.\n\nIn an earlier write-up in BusinessDay to celebrate him, \u2018Dick Kramer: Modern-day pioneer and management missionary,\u2019 it was noted that Dick grew up in Kansas, where he watched his parents and grandparents, who were pioneers, built farms, schools, businesses and communities from the scratch.\n\nIt was from them and from the vast plains of Kansas he learned hard work, honesty, discipline and commitment to building communities for posterity.\n\nRead also: BusinessDay set to host PRINVEST 2022 to drive real estate development\n\nHe spent his entire life living tirelessly these lifelong principles and devoted just as much to imbibing them in others. Dick, as was known to friends and even first time acquaintances, strove to do right consistently.\n\nProt\u00e9g\u00e9s, friends, colleagues and business partners all can remember him firmly footed in his beliefs, even decades after their first encounter. He was a down-to-earth, straight talker, patient listener, mentor, father, friend and lover of Nigeria.\n\nHe was the pioneer and management missionary that led the startup of Arthur Andersen offices in Buenos Aires, Brussels and Lagos from the scratch.\n\nDick, in a book \u2018Making Change Happen: Partnering to Build Nigeria,\u2019 published to mark his 80th birthday, said the parents of he and Wanda, his teenage sweetheart and wife of over 70 years, were children of \u201cthe strong pioneer families who built vibrant communities throughout rural America\u201d.\n\nThe idea of modern-day pioneers comes from Wanda. In the book, she likens their decision to come to Nigeria in 1978 as a late response to the call missionaries of their church made to them as teenagers to come to Africa.\n\nIn an interview with BusinessDay to mark his 80th birthday, Dick related how his background shaped his tireless commitment to building a better Nigeria long after retiring as managing partner at Arthur Andersen, Nigeria in 1994.\n\n\u201cYou have to realise this is the result of the way I was born and raised. My grandparents were pioneers who settled in the part of Kansas that I grew up in. There were no school systems; there were no towns, nothing at all.\n\nAnd then they started the process. It was my parents\u2019 generation that renovated a lot of those buildings and we were raised with the idea that we are supposed to leave the world better than we found it.\u201d\n\nHow then does a modern pioneer work to leave a better world? In the case of Dick, it was through management, as a leader, mentor and investor.\n\nIn the book, Ernest Shonekan, his friend and business partner for decades, called Dick a \u201cmissionary manager.\u201d\n\nOther management-related pioneer works of Dick in Nigeria, apart from the startup of Arthur Andersen, include the Lagos Business School, NESG, African Capital Alliance (ACA), American Business Council, Harvard Business School Alumni Nigeria, and BusinessDay.\n\nOne way to depict Dick, the leader, mentor and investor, is through his involvement in the founding of BusinessDay.\n\nDuring the early years of NESG, he got Aigbogun, who was then Editor of the Vanguard newspaper, involved. Dick recognised the role of the media in pushing ideas for reform in a military era, particularly when, as Aigbogun narrated, soldiers and businesspeople were considered the twin enemies of Nigeria.\n\nLater on, Dick inspired Aigbogun to set up BusinessDay in 2000 and ACA invested in it. Dick, as chairman of the Editorial Advisory Board of the BusinessDay (long after the private equity firm he co-founded divested), was pivotal in its journey to become Nigeria\u2019s first and leading daily business and financial newspaper.\n\nEvery first Monday of the month for 14 years, the board met without fail at his house.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nDivine providence did a lot in the life of great men in the world, men who make up their minds to make great impact and to stand out in their fields of learning no matter what.\n\nThe is the story of a young boy who dreamt of building world class Hospital and Medical Clinics in Africa that will be accessible to all. People in Africa especially Nigeria will be able to enjoy good Healthcare facilities.\n\nIndeed, good things are achieved through hard work, determination, resilience and perseverance in order to thread the path of honour. Yes, success is not for lazy men but for the hardworking and intelligent once. All these statements could best be used to describe the personality of Dr Nosa Aigbe lebarty who became an achiever through seriousness and steadfastness, making his way to progress and greatness in the field of Medicine.\n\nMeeting Dr Nosa Aigbe lebarty, MD CEO and Chief Medical Officer Centralmed Urgent and Primary Care, Founder, Lebarty Medical PLLC, President, Project Health Africa for the first time gives one the impression that this young and vibrant Medical doctor knows exactly what he is doing and want to do.\n\nThe Health situation in Nigeria is gradually turning into something else; hence the need for this young Edo man reaching out to the people requires commendation.\n\nHearing Dr Nosa speak about his passion and dreams for the African man especially his place of birth (Edo State), one will begin to wonder. Dr Nosa has an evidence based holistic approach and training in urgent care, primary care and specialized addiction Medicine. He has more than 20 years of combined experience in medical treatment; he is setting up a world class hospital in Africa that will be accessible to all and give people in Africa access to quality Healthcare.\n\nAccording to him, he saw that a lot of people especially the elderly and children find it difficult to access the health facilities mostly because of funds. And as a medical doctor in the US (United States of America) he has seen the way the medical Healthcare is done here in Africa so different from the way it\u00eds done abroad. That is the reason why he is coming to build a hospital in Benin City and nearby villages. And as a general Practitioner, he said he decided to come home to help the people. Dr. Nosa said what is driving his desire to build this project is his love and passion for the place of his birth, Edo State Nigeria where his heart is.\n\nA proud Bini man, he feels concern about the less privileged, knowing fully well that in Africa, the first thing people worry about is what to eat instead of taking care of their health, just as the saying goes that \u00ecHealth is Wealth\u00ee.\n\nThat is why he wants to set up a hospital where people can afford to go and get what they need to help their condition health wise. According to Dr. Nosa, another significant part of his hospital is to take care of the old and elderly. He said that section will be named after his grandmother. Most of the old and elderly who have children overseas usually don\u00edt like or want to travel and so at the end of the day house helps are hired to attend to their needs. But most people prefers institutions like the care home because some of these hired helps don\u00edt usually take adequate care of them. But if institutions like a care home attached to the hospital is provided, the aged can have a place to stay, where they will be well taken care of by professionals including their medical care and everything they need. The goal according to Dr. Nosa is to inspire the people.\n\nThe monetary aspect to be able to access the Facility will be very minimal compared to what is presently paid in our health institutions. And the reason according to Dr. Nosa is because of maintenance to keep the place going.\n\nThe good thing about this project is that the state governor Mr. Godwin Obaseki is seriously interested in investors coming in to the state to develop it. Anything that will help make Edo State shine out to the world is what brings joy to the governor and people of the state, Edo state is going to be great again.\n\nAs the dream becomes a reality, the people of Edo State are waiting patiently to welcome and be part of this wonderful Healthcare facilities which Dr. Nosa Aigbe lebarty will use to bring hope to the hopeless and courage to the downtrodden to now be able to access health care in improved standard of health facilities in the state.\n\nIndeed, it is a welcome development.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

All politics is local.\n\n\u201cAs an advocate of transparency, accountability and continuous entrenchment of popular will, Senator Kaita cannot afford to continue sharing the tent of undemocratic merchandise clearly being executed against his people by the state government and party leadership.\n\n\u201cA clear stock taking of where Katsina state stands today, is already enough burden on good conscience. Our good people, in their millions have excused deprivation, poverty and hunger for too long.\n\n\u201cThey have endured the risk to their lives and wellbeing imposed by the incapacity of the state government to tackle insecurity head on.\n\n\u201cThey have been denied enough, already, by the state government. We cannot deny them their right of choice. The serial denial of the people\u2019s mandate at the recent Congresses among other related developments has finally found expression in our answer to the clarion call of our people to vacate the APC following very wide consultations.\n\n\u201cSenator Ahmad Babba Kaita is not a bandwagon politician. His exemplary and robust representation in the Nigerian Senate is to the admiration of all, and with significant, visible impacts in the areas of infrastructural and human capital development across the three Senatorial zones of the state.

All bidders seat in their office and watch as each of the bids were evaluated until the software automatically generated an award letter to the winner.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we will be having something of this magnitude in Osun and it also herald for the State the digitalization of the entire procurement process going forward, something which we are so proud of as a government,\u201d Oyebamiji stated.\n\nAlso speaking, the General Manager, Osun Public Procurement Agency, Mr Bello Adegboyega said every contractor now knows that they stand a better chance of participating in procurement process as soon as they register on the data base, stressing that time wasting and paper work are now completely eliminated.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Wednesday in Abuja warned the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) members to be more mindful of the pitfalls that led to the ouster of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015.\n\nHe spoke at a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party, which held at Trancorp Hilton Hotel.\n\n\u201cThe PDP thought that only time could remove them, and the time actually came. They thought it was impossible to lose elections,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the APC was formed by a merger of Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), some members from All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the new PDP, which was a faction of the then ruling party.\n\n\u201cWe put together a committee with clear terms of reference on how to remove the PDP from power. The PDP thought it wasn\u2019t going to be possible. But it happened,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari told new members of the National Working Committee (NWC), which had been delegated powers of NEC for a period, to work towards keeping the party together by creating more room for discussions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to develop differences among ourselves. We have no time for that,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe President commended Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and all its members for offering themselves to serve the party at a critical moment in utmost satisfaction despite all the attendant challenges, and for organizing the National Convention that produced the NWC.\n\n\u201cI must also sincerely thank all the aspirants for their desire to serve but had to withdraw their aspirations for the over-all interest of our Party. I consider it an honour to my person and an unwavering sacrifice for the unity of our great party as we approach the coming elections.\n\n\u201cI plead with all aspirants who were not elected to put in efforts in support of the leaderships of the Party to achieve our goal of success in the forthcoming elections. Furthermore I am pleading with all litigants to withdraw cases against the Party and put faith in party mechanisms.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also advised party leaders against imposing unpopular candidates on the APC.\n\n\u201cI enjoin you all to follow due process in all the party processes and more importantly to develop more mechanisms against corruption. I call on all party members to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to leaders of our party to avoid imposition of candidates that cannot win popular elections.\n\n\u201cThis dictatorial behavior cost us many strategic seats in the past. In the recent past this led to some of our strong members unfortunately opting to go elsewhere because of unfairly oppressive behavior of party leaders at state level.\n\n\u201cI must caution strongly against any tendency towards developing cliques, in\u2013fighting within the party. We want to win well not succumb to factions on account of personal acerbities and desire to retain control at all costs. That surely is not the road to win,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also congratulated the new National Chairman of APC, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, and the entire NWC members.\n\n\u201cYou came in at a critical time and the entire party has a high expectation from you. The critical task ahead of you remains to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needful compromises in the interest of our great party,\u2019\u2019 the President noted.\n\nPresident Buhari felicitated with party leaders and members for successfully conducting the Ward, Local Government, State Congresses, and the National Convention, in compliance with the Party Constitution.\n\n\u201cI enjoin you all to recognize the place of due process in all our tasks as managers of the party. We must develop party in-built mechanisms against corruption. Our success in 2023 will depend more on our capacity to respect our own extant rules, and regulations.\n\n\u201cNow that NEC has vested its powers in NWC for the time being, as requested, and in compliance with the Party Constitution in the overall interest of the Party, I want to assure Mr. Chairman and the entire NWC members of my full support,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remark, the APC Chairman appreciated President Buhari for always working for the unity and survival of the party, assuring that the NWC will further unite the party, and ensure victory at the polls.\n\n\u201cWe must succeed, failure is not an option,\u2019\u2019 the APC Chairman said.\n\nThe NEC meeting was attended by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, other principal officers of the National Assembly, APC governors and state party chairmen.\n\nHe also warned of tougher security measures in restive parts of the country, with review of operations and strategy, reassuring Nigerians that the efforts that resulted in relative peace in South-South, and rescuing of North-East from the hold of terrorists will be ramped up.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe President noted that the major security challenges have remained in the North Central and North West, saying, \u201cWe are going to be very tough.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI will like us to reflect on what the situation was before we came in. How many Local Government Areas were under the control of terrorists in the North-East?\n\n\u201cIn the South-South, we all know what the situation was; now we have relative peace. With the resources at our disposal, we have done very well.\n\n\u201cPeople are very forgetful. Our main problem now is in the North West and North Central. People are killing one another in these places, what for? We are going to be very tough,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has warned leaders of the All Progressives Congress at both national and state levels against factions and imposing unpopular candidates as the 2023 general election approaches.\n\nThe president gave the warning at the 11th meeting of the National Executive Committee of the All Progressives Congress on Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nThis is as the party reached agreements on the form it would use to select a presidential candidate and other matters relating to the 2023 general election.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cI enjoin you all to follow due process in all the party processes and more importantly to develop more mechanisms against corruption.\n\n\u201cI call on all party members to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to leaders of our party to avoid the imposition of candidates that cannot win popular elections.\n\n\u201cThis dictatorial behaviour cost us many strategic seats in the past. In the recent past, this led to some of our strong members, unfortunately, opting to go elsewhere because of the unfairly oppressive behaviour of party leaders at the state level.\n\n\u201cI must caution strongly against any tendency towards developing cliques, in\u2013fighting within the party.\n\n\u201cWe want to win well not succumb to factions on account of personal acerbities and desire to retain control at all costs. That surely is not the road to win,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAPC NEC transfers power to NWC for 90 days\n\nThe National Executive Council of the All Progressives Congress has transferred power to the Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee until July 2022.\n\nThe party\u2019s secretary, Dr Iyiola Omisore, disclosed this to delegates at the 11th National Executive Committee meeting of the APC holding at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja.\n\nThe president also told new members of the National Working Committee, which had been delegated powers of NEC to work towards keeping the party together by creating more room for discussions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no time to develop differences among ourselves. We have no time for that,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\n2023: Internal crisis threat to victory, says Adamu\n\nOn forthcoming general elections in 2023, National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress , Senator Abdullahi Adamu, says the internal crisis in the party may affect the success of the party in the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWe must succeed, failure is not an option,\u2019\u2019 the APC Chairman said.\n\nAlso, Buhari urged party members to be more mindful of the pitfalls that led to the ouster of the Peoples Democratic Party in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe PDP thought that only time could remove them, and the time actually came. They thought it was impossible to lose elections,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe said the APC was formed by a merger of Action Congress of Nigeria, Congress for Progressive Change, All Nigeria Peoples Party, some members from All Progressives Grand Alliance and the new PDP, which was a faction of the then ruling party.\n\n\u201cWe put together a committee with clear terms of reference on how to remove the PDP from power. The PDP thought it wasn\u2019t going to be possible. But it happened,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cFurthermore I am pleading with all litigants to withdraw cases against the Party and put faith in party mechanisms.\n\n\u201cNow that NEC has vested its powers in NWC for the time being, as requested, and in compliance with the Party Constitution in the overall interest of the Party, I want to assure Mr. Chairman and the entire NWC members of my full support,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAPC pegs presidential nomination form at N100m\n\nAPC has pegged its presidential nomination and expression of interest forms at N100 million.\n\nThe party\u2019s national publicity secretary, Felix Morka, who disclosed this said the nomination form would go for N70 million while expression of interest forms would go for N30 million.\n\nThe ruling party said it would begin selling nomination and expression of interest forms for various electoral offices on Saturday, April 23, 2022.\n\nAccording to Morka, the sale of forms will run from April 23 until May 6, 2022.\n\nAPC settles for indirect primary, rules out consensus\n\nAPC says it would choose its presidential candidate through an indirect primary election.\n\nAmong those who will be contesting the APC Presidential primary are Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu; the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi; and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State.\n\nOthers in the APC who are rumoured to be nursing Presidential ambitions include Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum, Kayode Fayemi; the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige. The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, is also considered a contender.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nETAP, an insurtech startup that makes it easier to buy and claim insurance, has secured $1.5 million in pre-seed funding to grow its team and drive the adoption of much-needed car insurance across Africa. Starting in Nigeria, the new funding will support the roll-out of ETAP\u2019s game-changing app which allows drivers to buy insurance in 90 seconds, complete claims in 3 minutes or less and get rewarded for good driving and avoiding accidents.\n\nThe pre-seed funding round was led by Mobility 54 (the Venture Capital arm of Toyota Tsusho and CFAO Group), with participation from Tangerine Insurance, Graph Ventures (invested in Clubhouse), Newmont and other angel investors. Working with a wide range of automotive value chain players, ETAP will also explore other opportunities to deliver much-needed insurance services for car owners in other countries across the continent.\n\nDespite longstanding regulation making car insurance compulsory and more than 100,000 car accidents reported between January 2019 and December 2021, only one in five cars in Nigeria are currently insured. The complexities of buying and claiming insurance has led to widespread apathy for traditional insurance companies and products, with many car owners opting to go without insurance. With ETAP, the entire process of buying and claiming insurance happens exclusively on a smartphone, enabling a seamless and enjoyable insurance experience for users.\n\nETAP uses machine learning to build intelligent risk profiles that determine appropriate premiums for each driver, allowing them to achieve lower premiums by driving safely. Using advanced telematics, the driving experience is gamified to improve driving behaviour and drivers can earn Safe Driving Points that can be exchanged for shopping vouchers for the most in-demand retail outlets, fuel, cinema and concert tickets, and other exciting experiences. Drivers also have flexible coverage options, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual plans depending on their needs. In the unfortunate event of an accident, they simply need to take a picture of the affected part of the car via the app and the artificial intelligence processes the claim based on previously uploaded images. The app comes with geolocation tags, timestamps and other features to prevent fraudulent claims, as well as crash notification, emergency support and more.\n\nSince launching in beta in November 2021, ETAP has insured more than 130,000 individual trips and over 500,000 kilometres in car journeys, which represents more than eight times the total distance of paved roads in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Ibraheem Babalola, CEO and founder of ETAP, \u201cJust like any other digital service, we believe Nigerians should be able to buy and claim car insurance without having to \u2018call a guy\u2019. We also believe that rewarding good drivers can be a catalyst for better driving and making our roads safer. This is why we have created Africa\u2019s most powerful car insurance app and we are excited to have raised these funds to bring more users on board. Too often, the process of buying and claiming insurance in Africa is so out of touch with the everyday reality of most people but we are changing the game and making the process just as enjoyable as any other experience that consumers access on the mobile phone.\u201d\n\nYumi Takagi, Project Manager at Mobility 54 said, \u201cETAP is addressing many challenges that impact the automotive experience in Africa and we are excited to support and work with them to bring their innovation to more drivers across the continent. We believe that ETAP will engage with this important role and revolutionize the automotive insurance industry with their powerful technology.",

          "text": "Former three-time Prime Minister R\u00f3bert Fico and former Interior Minister R\u00f3bert Kali\u00e1k, who have dominated Slovakian politics for the past 15 years, were on Wednesday charged with organised crime offenses.\n\nKali\u00e1k was apprehended by police while fishing with his wife and sons near Bratislava on Wednesday morning.\n\nFico, who is still a member of parliament for the opposition Smer party, cannot be arrested without the legislature\u2019s permission. They could each face up to 12 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe charges against Fico and Kali\u00e1k, according to David Lindtner, a lawyer for Fico and Kali\u00e1k, pertain to crimes they allegedly performed as Cabinet members between 2012 and 2018, while Smer anchored successive ruling coalitions. Former President Andrej Kiska and Boris Koll\u00e1r, the current speaker of Slovakia\u2019s parliament, are among those accused of using confidential tax information to run smear campaigns against them.\n\nFico was accused of being the leader of a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that includes former police director Tibor Gap\u00e1r and Slovak oligarch Norbert Bodor, according to the indictment.\n\nHe stood for president in 2014, while serving his second term as Prime Minister of Slovakia, but was defeated by Kiska by nearly 20 percentage points. Fico accused Kiska of \u201cmaking his money from usury on impoverished people,\u201d \u201cmisusing his charity for political goals,\u201d and having \u201cclose ties to Scientology\u201d during an exceptionally acrimonious campaign.\n\nFico and Kali\u00e1k allegedly acquired unlawful access to tax documents in 2017, and the prime minister, then in his third term, began referring to President Kiska as a \u201ctax cheat.\u201d\n\nHowever, the 2018 murders of investigative journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak, 28, and his fianc\u00e9e Martina Kunirov\u00e1 brought Fico\u2019s premiership and government to an end. The release of thousands of private messages between Kuciak\u2019s alleged killers and police, judges, and ruling-coalition politicians galvanized voters, propelling the anti-corruption Ordinary People movement to power in 2020.",

          "text": "Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka, on Tuesday joined the growing number of eminent Nigerians and groups that have condemned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision to grant a presidential pardon to former governors, Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame. Soyinka said the pardon showed that the Buhari administration\u2019s anti-corruption fight was over.\n\nEchoing the words of Jesus Christ before he breathed his last, Soyinka said regarding the president\u2019s anti-graft effort, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d signifying the end of his mission.\n\nIn a similar vein, the National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) on Tuesday condemned the presidential pardon granted to the two former governors convicted for corruption.\n\nHuman rights activist and lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, denounced the disparity in the sentencing of rich and poor convicts in Nigeria, stressing that the justice system is often manipulated to favour influential politicians facing corruption charges.\n\nSoyinka, in a statement, likened the state pardon given to the former governors to an egg smashed against the faces of Nigerians, saying it would take a long time to wiped it off.\n\nThe former governor of Plateau State, Dariye, and erstwhile Taraba State governor, Nyame, were serving jail terms for stealing N1.16 billion and N1.6 billion, respectively, while they were in office.\n\nBut to the surprise and disappointment of many Nigerians, the National Council of State last week approved that Dariye, Nyame, and 157 others serving jail terms be pardoned following the recommendations of the Presidential Advisory Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy, as approved by Buhari.\n\nMixed reactions greeted the decision, with many condemning it.\n\nHuman rights organisation, Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), specifically asked Buhari to urgently withdraw the pardon.\n\nReacting to the pardon, in a message titled, \u201cA Putrid Presidential Easter Egg,\u201d Soyinka said he aligned with Bishop Matthew Kukah, in his Easter message, where the cleric lambasted Buhari.\n\nSoyinka said, \u201cComing from a leader who had placed all his eggs in one basket, labelled Anti-corruption, this is one egg squashed against Nigerians\u2019 faces that they shall not forget \u2013 or wipe off \u2013 in a hurry.\n\n\u201cIt evokes the legend of Pandora\u2019s box whose contents are alleged to constitute all the ills that plague the world.\n\n\u201cPutrid to the core, allied to power provocations in numerous variations, such as catapulting a notorious player in the martyrdom of a serving Minister of Justice to the hub of governance wheel, these define the nature of bequests that have brought the nation to this moment of near dissolution. Precedents are no consolation, no excuses.\u201d\n\nSoyinka added, \u201cOne states the obvious in remarking that precedents either undermine or reinforce principles, and aspiring offenders, especially in the political domain, are encouraged or inhibited by the ease or difficulty of access to the fount of mercy.\n\n\u201cOffice holders, we presume, are constrained by the existence of that dangling Sword of Damocles \u2013 simply knowing that one day, the cloak of immunity will turn threadbare, and the awaited day of reckoning finds them answerable. Clearly, not any longer.\n\n\u201cYou will forgive, though disagree with me, I know, for clambering onto the Easter wagon myself, to echo the words of the One whose passage through the world the Easter season commemorates: \u201cIt is finished.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Kukah\u2019s homily, the Nobel Laureate said he was impelled not to miss an opportunity to add his own Easter drop \u201cto the overflowing vessel of pietistic sentiments, if only to reassure Christians \u2013 and also Muslims in turn \u2013 that even \u2018we, non-believers, do partake of that same ethical communion to which most humanities aspire.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso, your Easter sermon opens up yet again those sluices of juridical hypocrisy to which we dare not cease to draw attention. Such, in the immediate, remains the plight of two young men \u2013 Mubarak Bala and the musician Yahaya Sharif \u2013 one serving a sentence of twenty-five years, the other actually sentenced to death for alleged blasphemy.\n\n\u201cThat word \u2018blasphemy\u2019 comes into its authentic mode, in my view, whenever anyone violates a solemn oath of office. It penitentially becomes even redoubled when such violators are pampered with the prerogative of mercy.\n\n\u201cPermit me to call special attention to the following from your (Kukah) sermon: \u2018Religious leaders\u2026. must face the reality that here in Nigeria and elsewhere around the world, millions of people are leaving Christianity and Islam.\n\n\u201c\u2019While we are busy building walls of division with the blocks of prejudice, our members are becoming atheists, but we prefer to pretend that we do not see this. We cannot pretend not to hear the footsteps of our faithful marching away into atheism and secularism. No threats can stop this, but dialogue can open our hearts.\u2019\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that he was persuaded that the recent largesse from the president had already won a few hearts and minds to the ranks, \u201cif not of outright atheism, then at least to a healthy sceptical regard of piety spouting leadership that saw nothing wrong in attempts to extinguish the life of a young man for an honest declaration of conviction, while veterans of broken pledges were let loose to further infect a world they had betrayed.\n\n\u201cNo pardon has been extended in the direction of endangered, youthful integrity. Of course, it is easy to track the trajectory of events.\n\n\u201cNettled by increasingly scabrous comments, such as those of his predecessor in office, Olusegun Obasanjo, who declared that this incumbent has run out of ideas, that he has nothing left to offer the nation, Muhammad Buhari decided to embark on the Easter train and donate an Easter egg of truly presidential proportions to his subjects.\u201d\n\nFalana Condemns Disparity in Justice System, Says Influential Politicians Getting Away with Corruption\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday at the Inaugural Public Lecture of Department of Public and International Law, Faculty of Law, Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, Oyo State, Falana stated that some personalities in the society seemed to be \u201cuntouchable, since they have the money, they can influence and manipulate the justice system in their favour.\u201d\n\nIn his paper titled, \u201cSentencing Rich and Poor Convicts In Nigeria: An Unbalanced Scale,\u201d Falana identified the dysfunctional justice system operated by Nigerian courts as the main problem with the justice system.\n\nHe said, \u201cOwing to the class character of the society, the courts and law enforcement agencies tend to favour rich convicts against poor convicts. This problem has caused the public to lose hope and trust in the country\u2019s judicial system.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer stated that drastic \u201csteps must be taken to address the issue of disparity in sentencing, to ensure justice, fairness, and equality before the law, for all convicts.\u201d\n\nAccording to Falana, some influential Nigerians commit crimes and get away with it, owing to corruption and the abysmally compromised system.\n\nHe stated, \u201cSome persons convicted and sentenced and jailed were never found in any correctional centre while unemployed young people serve prison terms in lieu of rich convicts.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cJudges could even be coerced into favouring those rich offenders against their own will. But there is often no one to speak for the poor, who often have no voice of their own. On the few occasions that the rich are convicted, they are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors.\n\n\u201cCorruption: this is also one of the major issues affecting the fair administration of justice in Nigeria. Oftentimes, rich defendants engage in dilatory tactics, which frustrate and compel the state to enter into plea bargain with them.\n\n\u201cJudges award lighter sentences to convicted rich defendants or resort to technicalities to free them. Otherwise, how could someone that embezzled pension funds worth billions of Naira be sentenced to only six months imprisonment, but another who stole a cheap telephone handset be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment?\n\n\u201cInjustice: there is also obvious injustice against the poor. More attention is being paid to cases involving the rich, as opposed to the poor.\n\n\u201cI will highlight a few cases to illustrate my point. First, is the case of Tafa Balogun, the former Inspector General of Police. After his arrest and arraignment by EFCC for corruptly enriching himself to the tune of N17 billion, Tafa Balogun went to court challenging the powers of the EFCC to prosecute him. He later withdrew the case from court and the EFCC\u2019s case against him was eventually decided when he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was clearly a case of plea bargaining, as the withdrawal of his case from court led to the negotiation by which his punishment was reduced to six months imprisonment after forfeiting some of his loots to the government.\n\n\u201cAnother incident of plea bargaining was the case of former Governor of Bayelsa State, Dieprieye Alamiesiegha. He, too, was arrested and taken to court by the EFCC, who, after entering into negotiation with the accused, reduced the charges against him to six. He was sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment while he refunded some amount of money into the government coffers.\n\n\u201cSimilar thing happened in the case of Lucky Igbinedon, the former Governor of Edo State, who was fined the sum of N3.5 million after he had entered into a plea bargain with EFCC to reduce the 191-count charge against him to just a single count. Though Igbinedion walked away a free man in Nigeria, he was effectively barred by the United States Government on January 12, 2013 from entering its territory henceforth.\n\n\u201cIn the case of John Yusuf, who embezzled N27.2 billion pension fund of retired police officers, he was sentenced to two years imprisonment or a fine of N750,000.00 that being the maximum punishment provided for in Section 309 of the Penal Code under which he was charged!\n\n\u201cMrs. Cecilia Ibru, the former Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Oceanic Bank Plc. Mrs. Ibru was arraigned before the court by the EFCC on a 25-count charge of different charges of corruption while in office. After negotiation with the anti-corruption body, the charges against her were reduced to three.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the plea bargaining between the EFCC and Mrs. Ibru, the accused decided to plead guilty to the reduced charges of mismanagement and abuse of office. Thereafter, Kola Awodein, (SAN), who appeared for the EFCC, subsequently informed the court that the commission had reached an agreement with Mrs. Ibru and the said agreement had been filed in court.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria added, \u201cOn Friday, the 8th day of October, 2010, the trial judge, Justice Dan Abutu of the Federal High Court, Lagos, delivered judegment in the matter. He sentenced the accused to six months imprisonment on each of the three counts and directed that the sentences should run concurrently. This means the convict was to spend only six months in prison.\n\n\u201cThe convict, however, forfeited N191 billion worth of properties and assets to the government, according to the judgement of the court. Among the properties so forfeited were those in Nigeria, United States of America and Dubai in United Arab Emirates, together with shares in more than 100 companies, most of them listed on Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\u201cThe judge ordered Mrs. Ibru to be taken to Reddington Hospital, Victoria Island, Lagos by the prison authorities within two hours after they receive the copy of the judgement and she is to remain in the hospital until she is certified fit to stay in prison custody.\n\n\u201cThe case of FRN v. Sarah Ochepke & 2 Ors , where the Defendant along with two other accused persons were by an Amended Charge dated 9th of February, 2018 arraigned before the Federal High Court, Jos, on three counts charge of conspiracy, to accept cash payment of the sum of N450,000,000 from one Annet Olije Gyen, Head of operations, Jos branch of Fidelity Bank Plc, and did accept and retain the said amount of N450,000,000.00, which sum exceeded the amount authorised by law to be paid to an individual(s).\n\n\u201cThe court sentenced the defendants Sarah Ochepke (being the former Minister of Water Resources), Raymond Dabo, and Leo Jitung, to three months imprisonment each, with an option to pay a fine of N1 million each. The offence contravenes the provisions of Section 16(1) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2013 (as amended), carries a minimum term of three years imprisonment or a N10 million fine. The judge, however, exercised his discretion and sentenced them to three months imprisonment each or an option N1 million naira each.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Falana said, \u201cThe case of FRN v. Abdulrasheed Maina is one of the few that made a little difference: Maina who was charged with criminal offences, punishable under sections 11(2) (a), 15(3), and 16(2) (c) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, and also acted in breach of the Advance Fee Fraud Act, was in November, 2021, convicted and sentenced to eight years imprisonment, after being found guilty on all the 12-count charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him and his company, Common Input Property and Investment Limited.\n\n\u201cThe court ordered Maina and his firm to forfeit about N2.1 billion that was traced to their bank accounts, as well as another sum of $223, 396, 30, to the federal government, after which he directed that the company should be wound up. It also ordered the forfeiture of Maina\u2019s two choice properties at Life camp and Jabi districts of Abuja, to the government, likewise the auction of a bulletproof car and a BMW 5 Series exotic car that was found in premises of the convict.\n\n\u201cOn March 18, 2022, an Abuja Upper Area Court in the Gwagwalada area council sentenced a 19-year-old student, Hillary Yunana, to four-month imprisonment for stealing spaghetti and noodles from a shop. The convict, a resident of Bassa village, along Airport Road, Abuja, was charged with burglary and theft.\n\n\u201cThe judge, Sani Umar, jailed Yunana after he pleaded guilty to the offence. Umar, however, gave the convict an option to pay N10,000 for each of the charges, or serve a jail term of two months for each of them. He said the sentence would run concurrently and warned Yunana to desist from committing crimes in the future. The judge said the sentence would serve as a deterrent to anyone who wanted to toe the depraved path in the future.\n\n\u201cOn March 31, 2022, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, discharged and acquitted the former Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Andrew Yakubu, of the money laundering charge the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred against him.\n\n\u201cThe court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Ahmed Mohammed, held that the anti-graft agency failed to prove its case against the erstwhile NNPC boss. The court ordered that monies the EFCC seized from Yakubu, who was GMD of the NNPC between 2012 and 2014, should be returned to him.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC had on the strength of a tip-off by a whistle-blower, raided Yakubu\u2019s guest house situated at Sabon Tasha, Kaduna State in 2017 and discovered the sum of $9.7million and \u00a374,000 which he hid in a fireproof safe inside the house.\u201d\n\nFalana explained further, \u201cBetween 2005 and 2006, a panel of enquiry instituted by the federal government found that 197 defendants who were tried, convicted and jailed for drug trafficking were not found in any correctional centre in the country.\n\n\u201cAt the end of their trials, members of a syndicate made of prosecution and defence lawyers, court clerks and warders collected heavy bribes from the convicts and allowed them to escape imprisonment.\n\n\u201cIt was found that the convicts returned to the nefarious business. I took up the matter with the authorities of the NDLEA, who assured me that the convicts would be arrested and made to serve the prison terms. But that was the end of the story.\n\n\u201cOn July 10, 2015, the then Chief Judge of Anambra State, the Honourable Justice Umeadi, visited all prisons in the state for the purpose of jail delivery to decongest the prisons. His Lordship disclosed that some prison inmates have no records in the prisons. The scandal was well reported at the material time.\n\n\u201cSince inmates are committed to prisons by warrants issued by Judges and Magistrates, the authorities of the correctional centre are challenged to explain who authorised the \u2018imprisonment\u2019 of inmates without records.\n\n\u201cAwaiting trial inmates constitute not less than 75 per cent of the prison population in the country. Majority of the inmates, including convicts, are poor people. The few rich people and members of the ruling class that are jailed are usually granted pardon by the president and state governors in exercise of their powers under section 175 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBased on the recommendation of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Council of State has just approved the pardon of a number of convicted persons, including two former state governors that were jailed for laundering billions of naira.\n\n\u201cSince the constitution provides for equality of all citizens before the law, all other persons convicted for stealing, fraud and money laundering ought to be pardoned and freed. There can be no moral or legal justification for jailing poor people who steal spaghetti and noodles to feed their family members while those who loot the treasury are granted clemency or pardon.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, permit me to call on the poor who constitute the majority of poor victims of institutionalised criminal justice system to unite and fight for socioeconomic justice and equality before the law.\n\n\u201cIn particular, indigent accused persons are advised to brief lawyers in the Legal Aid Council and the Office of the Public Defender in every state of the federation to provide them with legal practitioner whenever they are arrested, detained or charged with any criminal offence.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the state to assign lawyers, free of charge, to citizens who earn less than the national minimum wage of N30,000.00.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe law is not neutral in a class society. It is made and enacted by rich legislators to serve the interests of the rich. The judges interpret the law to favour the rich and powerful people in the society.\n\n\u201cThe big lawyers hired to defend the rich exploit loopholes and technicalities in the law to free their rich clients. Hence, the poor man who stole noodle in Abuja to feed himself, was jailed by an Upper Area Court. Even though he had no more to feed himself, the judge sentenced him to six months imprisonment or N20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cBut the former top public officer who laundered $9.8 million and \u00a374,000, has been set free by the Federal High Court. The judge blamed the EFCC for not proving the case beyond reasonable doubt!\u201d\n\nPyrates Confraternity Condemns Pardon to Nyame, Dariye\n\nThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) declared that Nyame and Dariye were undeserving of the presidential pardon.\n\nThe group said the pardon had made mockery of the anti-graft law, stressing that it is manifestly undeserving, blatantly discriminatory and distasteful.\n\nFurthermore, it said the Council of State let the nation down by not rejecting the recommendation of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy to the former governors, adding that the pardon has effectively killed the anti-graft war.\n\nThe NAS Capoon, Mr. Abiola Owoaje, in a statement titled, \u201cPresidential Pardon for Corrupt Ex-governors: Buhari\u2019s death knell for the anti-graft war,\u201d and made available to THISDAY in Yenagoa, said the intention of presidential pardon ought not to be for the likes of Nyame and Dariye.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe National Association of Seadogs (Pyrates Confraternity) is extremely disappointed by the unfortunate decision of the Council of State. We are saddened that the Council, which courageously, reportedly, turned down a state pardon for former Bank PHB Managing Director, Francis Atuche, also serving jail term for corruption, could not display the same courage and reject the request to pardon Nyame and Dariye.\n\n\u201cWhatever the rationale behind acquiescing to the recommendation of the committee to pardon the two corrupt former governors before serving out their prison terms, the nation has been let down by this eminent body.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the pardon had lent justifiable credence to speculations that its intention was to shore up the battered image of the ruling party and give it a bounce ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nOwoaje pointed out that the presidential pardon was inconsistent with Sections 15(5), 17(a) and 42 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended. He added that it \u201calso miserably falls below standards, measures and rules in the United Nations Convention against corruption.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that corruption in the country predated the Buhari administration, adding, however, \u201chis numerous assurances that he would fight and defeat corruption was one of the key reasons Nigerians elected him in 2015 and re-elected him in 2019.\n\n\u201cSeven years down the line, Nigerians are still bearing with the oft repeated refrain that \u2018we must kill corruption before it kills us\u2019 as the only tangible reference to demonstrate the president\u2019s acclaimed commitment to tackle corruption.\n\n\u201cWell-meaning Nigerians had hoped that President Buhari would be able to summon the courage and salvage his administration\u2019s tepid anti-graft war. Sadly, the presidential pardon has made mockery of the war against corruption. Unequivocally, the grim implication of the presidential pardon, aside the demoralising effect it would have on anti-graft officials, is the fact that it has effectively sabotaged the war against graft.\n\n\u201cIt certainly would embolden our well- heeled citizens to engage in corruption with the belief that they can be granted pardon by their friends in government. We have previously recommended to the government steps to take to tackle corruption but the administration\u2019s latest action has shown that it is not willing to lift a finger to fight corruption. In granting state pardon to corrupt individuals, President Buhari has conferred on himself the status of the Chief Undertaker that sounded the death knell for his administrations\u2019 anti-graft war.\u201d\n\nGoddy Egene, Wale Igbintade in Lagos and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa",

          "title": "Nigeria: With Advancement in Technology, No One Can Claim Millions of Votes Again, Buhari Says",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, assured the Nigerian people that with advancement in technology by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the 2023 elections would be different and prevent individuals from claiming millions of votes at elections.\n\nBuhari, who met with governors, ministers and heads of government agencies at the State House, Abuja, over Iftar, however advised Nigerians to resist agents bent on causing breakdown of law and order, in the country, assuring them also that no individual or group would be allowed to destabilise the country.\n\nBut the Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri on Tuesday, bemoaned the increasing insecurity in Nigeria and said the situation was worse than it was in 2015, when the All Progressives Congress (APC) took over power in the country.\n\nThe governor, who stated this at Government House, Yenagoa, during separate courtesy visits by new heads of some security agencies, therefore, called on the federal government to redouble its effort at combating insecurity, particularly, in the northern part of the country.\n\nThis is as some terrorists have killed three of their victims in Kaduna State, threatening to kill 22 others if a ransom of N20 million was not delivered to them before midnight Tuesday.\n\nAt the same time, three people were killed while 19 others sustained varying degrees of injuries, when an explosions rocked Iware Cattle market in Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba State.\n\nIn similar breath, the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Usman Baba, has ordered a review of police personnel and operational assets deployments to schools and colleges around the country.\n\nBuhari, in a release issued by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, thanked the governors and ministers for honouring his invitation to break fast with, and expressed confidence that in spite of the current security challenges, the country would succeed.\n\nSpecifically on the 2023 elections, the president affirmed that being beneficiary of free, fair and credible elections, the introduction of technology and the Permanent Voters Card (PVCs), would make it impossible for anyone to claim millions of votes again in the country.\n\nHe however, noted that, \u201cWe have the land, we have the resources, and we have the people. But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country.\u201d\n\nChairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi,however, commended President Buhari for demonstrating resilience and determination at a crucial period in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cWe have a leader, who is not distracted by momentary challenges but has continued to commit to the renewal of our nation and we, governors, ministers and heads of government agencies are equally dedicated to building a better Nigeria, on your watch,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that this year\u2019s Holy month of Ramadan coincided with the just concluded Christian Lenten period, the Governor of Ekiti, said it held enormous spiritual value on the benefits of renewal, sacrifice, almsgiving, forgiveness and healing for the individual as well as the nation.\n\nOn his part, Diri, who spoke when he received the Comptroller of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Bayelsa Command, Mr Sunday James, the Bayelsa helmsman lamented the level of insecurity in the north, saying once a part of the country was in distress, other areas were also affected.\n\nHe said the spate of killings by terrorists in the country was a great setback for Nigeria, where lives could be taken at will and urged the APC-led federal government to effectively curb the killings.\n\nHis words: \u201cI use this opportunity to again call on the federal government to do something. These are the same issues that led to the APC government coming to power in 2015.\n\n\u201cI am sure that you will agree that things are worse now than in 2015. The federal government has to redouble its effort, otherwise, the joker card is with the people of Nigeria. They know what to do come 2023.\n\n\u201cWhen one part of the country is sick, it affects the other parts. Kaduna and other states in the North are sick security-wise and it is affecting other parts of the country. Nigeria is very close to the Thomas Hobbes\u2019 \u2018state of nature\u2019 where life is described as nasty, brutish and short. The federal government has to do something to keep us away from the Hobbesian state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, James, said the visit was to formally present himself as the new helmsman of the service in the state, and said as the agency in charge of giving clearance to intending foreign visitors, he was prepared to synergise to realise the state\u2019s investment drive.\n\nDiri equally charged the new Flag Officer Commanding (FOC) Central Naval Command, Rear Admiral Idi Abbas, to collaborate with the state government in curbing oil theft, illegal bunkering, kidnapping and related crimes in the maritime domain of the state.\n\nHe acknowledged that having served in the Command in other capacities, Rear Admiral Abbas, would contribute significantly towards sustaining the peace and development of the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cI believe you have distinguished and excelled in your service and will not be a pawn in the chess game of anybody or any political party.\n\n\u201cEnsure that you discharge your functions with utmost professionalism to bring about peace, security and development of Bayelsa and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cSecurity does not know ethnicity. It has no face of political parties and so, let nobody influence you and your Command on politics.
