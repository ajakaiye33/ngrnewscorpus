          "text": "By Henry Umoru \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Senate has raised the alarm over the mismanagement of N603 million from the N2.4billion internally generated revenue, IGR, by management of the University of Abuja.\n\nThe Senator Matthew Urhoghide, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Edo South led Senate Committee on Public Accounts Committee, SPAC, sustained the query of Auditor General of the Federation against the university on the said money.\n\nThe Auditor General of the Federation had raised concern in the 2017 report over the mismanagement of N603 million out of the N2 4 billion generated Internally by institution. University of Abuja was expected to remit the N603 million into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, CRF, which forms 25 per cent of the revenue generated in the institution.\n\nREAD ALSO: Uniabuja promotes 118 staff\n\nWhile responding to the query before the Senate Committee, the Vice Chancellor of University of Abuja , AbdulRasheed Na\u2019Allah, claimed that the money generatediInternally was not enough to run the affairs of the institution, adding that they were, therefore, forced to spend N603 million meant for remittance to the Federation Account.\n\nNa\u2019Allah said: \u201cPeculiarity of the universities in Nigeria is clear and does not have enough IGR to remit to the Consolidated Revenue Fund as adduced by the Auditor General.\n\n\u201cThe universities collect only third party revenues from students. Revenue collected are for specific purpose such as union dues , ID card, medical fees, laboratory fees usually refees to other charges.\n\n\u201cCost recovery concept is adopted by the university, that is charges collected were used to pay for services rendered.\n\n\u201cFor instance , ID card charges were used to process ID cards for students. These revenues are not enough for the purpose collected and, therefore, the capacity for the university to remit surplus is lacking\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, Senator Urhoghide, who was represented by the vice chairman of the committee, Senator Ibrahim Hadejia, demanded a refund of the N603 million to the CRF.\n\nThe query read. \u201cThe Federal Circular Reference No. BO/REV/12235/259/VII/201 dated 11th November, 2011 issued by the Honorable Minister of Finance restricting expenditure on IGR to 75% while 25% is to be remitted to the CRF.\n\n\u201cDuring the review of financial records and documents, it was observed that the University generated the sum of \u00a6 2,413,787,645.48 internally in 2016 and 2017.\n\n\u201cThe yearly revenue generated internally was \u00a6 1,463,097,604.13 in 2016 and \u00a6 950,690,041.35 in 2017.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the University failed to remit 25% of its IGR amounting to \u00a6 603,446,911.37 to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, CRF.\n\n\u201cNon remittance of the IGR shows lack of control in the expenditure of public fund. Furthermore, funds for developmental purposes is tied down.\n\n\u201cThe Vice Chancellor is required to remit the sum of \u00a6 603,446,911.37 being 25% of IGR to the CRF immediately and forward evidence of remittance to my Office for confirmation.\u201d\n\nValentine: Dufil donates to orphanages\n\nDUFIL Prima, makers of Nigeria\u2019s leading noodles, Indomie Instant Noodles, has donated cartons of the product to three orphanages in Lagos as part of activities to mark this year\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day celebrations, which took place last week.\n\nDonating to orphanage homes has become a tradition to Dufil Prima as it continues to enable orphaned children relish the superior taste of Indomie Instant Noodles. The team paid a visit to the Nigerian Red Cross Motherless & Abandoned Babies Home, Heritage Homes Orphanage, and Love Home Orphanage.\n\nExpressing delight and appreciation, the Branch Secretary, Nigerian Red Cross, Lagos, Mr. Olakunle Lasisi, said: \u201cWe appreciate what Dufil Prima has done in the lives of these children today by extending love to the less privileged. As parents, we know that if Indomie is missing in the home, it never really feels the same because Indomie is the preferred meal for children.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Dufil Prima, Group Corporate Communications & Events Manager, Tope Ashiwaju, said: \u201cValentine is a period of sharing love and giving to those who may be unable to reciprocate the gesture. To children, Indomie is not just a meal, it represents a symbol of the love their parents have for them and an nutrition that spurs them to do well in many areas of their lives.\n\n\u201cWe are here to extend love to these beautiful children because we love them and we believe in them.\u201d\n\nThe future parents, teachers,accountants, lawyers, governors, pastors, imams, and senators are here. Seeing the genuine smiles and joy on the faces of these kids on account of their love for the Indomie brand is quite humbling and is all the gratification we need to do more.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Dufil Prima has marked the Valentine season through generous donations of noodles to select orphanages across the country.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli and Jide Orintinsin, Abuja\n\nParley to set agenda for tomorrow\u2019s talks with Buhari\n\nCongresses to hold in zones\n\nWith the caretaker committee foot-dragging on plans for the party\u2019s convention slated for Saturday, All Progressives Congress (APC) governors will meet today on the fate of the exercise.\n\nThe caretaker committee has not taken the needed steps to make the convention possible aside from notifying the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cNo other steps necessary to show preparation for the convention has been taken by the caretaker committee, hence, the necessity for today\u2019s meeting by the governors,\u201d a source close to the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), said at the weekend.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt was learnt that today\u2019s meeting will prepare grounds for tomorrow\u2019s meeting of the governors and members of the Mai Mala-Buni led Caretaker Committee with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa.\n\nThe meeting was shifted last week to enable the President to travel to Belgium for the European Union-Africa Union (EU-AU) Summit in Brussels.\n\nThe President returned on Saturday.\n\nA source said the caretaker committee is planning to ask for a long shift of the convention, but some governors are believed to be angry about this.\n\nThey are said to be interested in a two-week shift from February 26 to March 12.\n\nPart of the argument for the shift of date being proposed by the caretaker committee, it was learnt, is the need to hold the zonal congresses to elect the zonal vice chairmen before the election of the members of the National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nAnother argument is that the February 26 date coincides with by-elections in eight APC states.\n\nThe Saturday date is shaky because the caretaker committee has failed to unveil pre-convention activities, including zoning, sale of nomination forms, the inauguration of sub-committees and submission of forms.\n\nAlready, APC has ward, council and state executive committees in place.\n\nThe party\u2019s Directorate of Organisation had been directed to prepare a schedule of activities and budget for zonal congresses.\n\nThe date for the zonal congress, however, will be released after the party leadership has secured the nod of President Buhari on zoning and micro-zoning.\n\nIt was gathered that apart from employing the zonal congress to buy more time, the arrangement was put in place by the caretaker committee to perfect the consensus mode of electing new party leaders and flag-bearers for the 2023 general elections.\n\nA source, who pleaded anonymity, said the Caretaker Committee and some governors perfected the zonal congress arrangement while President Buhari was in Belgium and intend to sell the idea to him, with the support of some influential members of the Federal Executive Council.\n\nThe source said: \u201cHaving conducted congresses from the ward to the state level, the line of argument of the caretaker committee was that it will be proper to have zonal leaders of the party determined at their various geo-political zones for proper inclusiveness of party members.\n\n\u201cHence, they (CECPC) will be proposing to Mr President the need for zonal congress before the national convention.\u201d\n\nAPC governors\u2019 meeting became imperative, following alleged foot-dragging by the caretaker committee.\n\nThe meeting may decide whether or not to go ahead with the convention scheduled for February 26.\n\nBut most APC governors were angry that the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has kept them in the dark over the convention.\n\nIt was learnt that some governors have sent an emissary to President Buhari to feel his pulse on whether or not to postpone the convention.\n\nSpeculations about a likely revolt against Buni have made some governors to threaten a boycott of today\u2019s session in Abuja.\n\nThe consensus among governors was still on the ceding of the office of the national chairman to the Northcentral.\n\nThe fresh proposal to anoint a former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara as chairman received \u201clittle backing\u201d last night.\n\nAccording to a source, who spoke in confidence, most APC governors were unhappy with the Caretaker Committee for its ding-dong attitude to the convention.\n\nThe source said the governors could not fathom why the caretaker committee was yet to raise sub-committees for the exercise.\n\nThe source claimed that the split of the PGF into pro and anti-convention groups has deepened the cracks in the association.\n\nThe source said: \u201cAll is not well among APC governors over the convention because the Caretaker Committee is unwilling to stick to the agreed February 26 timeline. The committee wants to have its cake and eat it.\n\n\u201cApart from funding, the Caretaker Committee has come up with an excuse that some off-season elections will hold on the convention date. It is contemplating a shift to March 12.\n\n\u201cMost governors are, however, insisting on February 26 having got wind of a plot to drag the convention till July or August when presidential and other primaries will be conducted. The CECPC members wanted a two-in-one convention.\n\n\u201cThere are fears that the shift in convention date was being designed to either favour some members of the CECPC or their cronies for elective offices, including presidential and governorship seats in 2023.\n\n\u201cAll these factors have made today\u2019s meeting compelling.\u201d\n\nA governor, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cIt is going to be a make or mar meeting to break the jinx on this convention. We will decide either on going ahead with the convention or a slight postponement which may be the last of such.\n\n\u201cWe heard rumours of a new convention date of March 12 but the CECPC has not made recommendations to the PGF. Governors are being turned into ball boys.\n\n\u201cWe now have pro and anti-convention governors simply because we can\u2019t keep to an agreement on the date we chose because of 2023 ambitions.\n\n\u201cLeft to some of us, we have had enough of CECPC unless the President decides otherwise. This is why there is tension among us.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that some governors were threatening to boycott today\u2019s meeting which they suspected might \u201cput Buni on the spot.\u201d\n\nAnother source, who spoke on the intrigues, said: \u201cThose planning to boycott the meeting have become desperate and trying to ensure that the PGF does not have the quorum at today\u2019s meeting.\n\n\u201cThey are afraid that governors may join issues with Buni and CECPC at the meeting.\n\n\u201cSome governors sent an emissary to the President last night on the need to intervene and give a definite direction.\n\n\u201cThe way we are going, APC is closer to the crisis which made it to lose elections in Zamfara State in 2019.\n\n\u201cThere are some forces pulling the strings to create a permanent crisis in APC.\u201d\n\nMany governors have insisted on an APC chairmanship slot for the Northcentral instead of the retention of the office by the Northeast.\n\nIt was learnt that the same anti-convention forces came up with the choice of ex-Speaker Yakubu Dogara to \u201cprop up a new issue which could cause fresh confusion in the party.\u201d\n\nAnother governor said: \u201cDogara is a good leader but his candidature is not flying because those behind it are mischievous.\n\n\u201cWe had got to a point where some governors who didn\u2019t know how APC was formed are trying to foist crisis on the party. They can\u2019t eat their cake and have it.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, & Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nBarring any counter directive from the Presidency, the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may be postponed till the middle of March due to myriads of factors.\n\nTo this end, the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), an umbrella body for governors elected on the APC platform will meet today in Abuja to deliberate on a new date that would be acceptable to all party stakeholders.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nA chieftain of the ruling party told Daily Sun that clear signal that postponement of the convention is inevitable necessitated the governors\u2019 meeting to \u201ctry and resolve grey areas threatening the convention.\u201d\n\nThe source further revealed that the progressive governors would, after the meeting, visit President Muhammadu Buhari tomorrow to brief him of their resolutions.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I strongly doubt the possibility of the convention holding this weekend as planned. It is almost practically impossible because of reasons already in the public domain. There has not been any attempt to constitute sub-committees, there has been no resolution on the zoning arrangements, no sale of nomination forms and more disturbingly, there has not been serious information on the side of the party\u2019s national leadership. I can confirm to you that the APC governors will be meeting on Monday night. The agenda of the meeting will be to resolve all those grey areas hampering the convention. They will more importantly agree on a new date for the convention. The governors will also meet with President Buhari on Tuesday not only to brief him on the new developments but also to table before him their resolutions on the way forward.\u201d\n\nAn administrative staff at the party\u2019s headquarters confirmed that they were in the dark just like most members of the party.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing on ground to show that the convention can take place this weekend. We waited with high hopes for the sale of nomination forms last week, but nothing happened. I don\u2019t believe there will be convention this weekend since there is nothing to indicate that. At least, they have not resolved very important issue of zoning arrangements nor have they set up sub-committees. Therefore, there is every reason to doubt the possibility of the convention holding,\u201d the management staff noted.\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari is expected to meet with Governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe meeting which was to hold last Tuesday before it was called off shortly before the President left for Brussels, Belgium to attend the just concluded EU-AU Summit.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nTop government sources said the rescheduled meeting which is at the instance of\n\nPresident Buhari is to look at the national convention of the party fixed for Saturday, February 26, 2022.\n\nAccording to sources, the date may no longer be feasible as it is less than a week away with no known programme put in place by the party.\n\nThe Chairman of the Interim Committee of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni is expected at the meeting which will also have 20 other APC Governors in attendance, to table another possible date and other logistics for approval by President Buhari.\n\nAPC youths under the umbrella of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) has petitioned President Buhari, threatening not only a showdown but also to elect a parallel national leadership should the party fail to organise the convention on February 26.\n\nThe petition, copied to the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), and signed by Prince Mustapha Audu, read in part: \u201cMr. President, we want to inform you that prior to your departure for Belgium, the youth wing of the APC which according to the records are 35 million strong, have come together as one indivisible entity. One of the conditions stated for the reconciliation was the date of the APC National convention which has been slated for February 26, 2022.\n\n\u201cAs we write this letter, the schedule released by the CECPC for planning towards the conduct of the convention has all been violated. This includes the February 14-19 sale of form date and return of forms deadline, release of zoning arrangements. There are no known members of any committee setup towards the seamless conduct of the supposed upcoming February 26 APC National Convention.\n\n\u201cThere has been no formal communication to stakeholders who have been anxiously waiting to participate in the upcoming convention. Many have travelled from far and wide from all over the country to purchase forms and run for different positions at the upcoming convention and yet there has been nothing but utter silence from the CECPC.",

          "title": "Buhari May Sign Electoral Bill Today, Seeks Lawmakers\u2019 Assurances to Amend Clause 84",
          "text": "\u2022Ruling party\u2019s governors meet tonight in Abuja ahead of meeting with president tomorrow\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAll things being equal, President Muhammadu Buhari, has agreed to sign the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill and may in fact sign the bill today but on the condition that the National Assembly would amend the contentious Clause 84, which infringes on the constitutional rights of certain category of people. The contentious aspect bars political appointees from contesting elections and voting as delegates, either at conventions or congresses, after assenting to it.\n\nThe president, who already met with the leadership of the two chambers of the National Assembly was awaiting assurances from the leadership of the National Assembly to amend the bill after signing it into law. \u201cThe President wants to put this behind us but simply wants assurances so as not not to allow this to continue to be a distraction on the country. He doesn\u2019t want other good aspects of the bill to continue to suffer.\u201d\n\nAlso, the president is expected to meet with governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) tomorrow at the State House, Abuja, to address concerns relating to the proposed February 26 national convention of the party.\n\nBut this is not going to be before a meeting of the APC governors tonight in Abuja, where they want to take a final look at the situation and issues relating to the convention before engaging the president tomorrow, and ultimately a decision.\n\nBuhari, last night, decided to lay the issues stalling the Electoral Act Amendment Bill to rest, when he seized the initiative and met with the leadership of the National Assembly with a view to finding a middle ground and closing the deal once and for all.\n\nThe president was said to have earlier met with the Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase, and the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, who is the Chairman of the amendment committee, deputised by Wase, on how to resolve the controversial Clause 84 of the new amendment.\n\nAccording to sources, the president had only asked if they would be willing to expunge the contentious aspect after he signs the bill so that the political turf could be cleared of the electoral bill crisis. According to a source with knowledge of the ongoing conversation, the president is seeking comfort and assurances that the aspect that infringes on the constitutional rights of Nigerians would be brought in conformity to the constitution through an amendment after he has signed to avoid further delay to the take off of the bill.\u201d\n\nBut as at last night, THISDAY could not glean from the leadership of the National Assembly if they had agreed to the president\u2019s proposal, but feelers from the Villa, indicated that once the Buhari gets the assurance of the the legislative leadership to address the grey area, he would move swiftly to sign the bill, possibly today.\n\nThere had been misgivings about the new amendment, which had also fuelled speculations on whether or not the president would sign it into law.\n\nThe latest speculation was stoked by rumours that some governors, especially, those of the ruling APC, were not comfortable with the new amendment and had planned to prevail on the president to also veto it, as he did in the last one.\n\nThis is because the harmonised version of the Electoral Bill recently passed by the legislature and considered the final agreed version by both Senate and House of Representatives, had inserted a controversial Clause 84 into the amendment bill.\n\nThe implication of the Clause 84 was that all political appointees in President Buhari\u2019s government would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of their political parties.\n\nAlso, by the provision at issue, political appointees were further barred from voting as delegates in a convention or seeking nomination in the primaries of their political parties.\n\nUnlike what was obtainable in the past, when most APC ministers and commissioners took leave of absence to contest their party\u2019s primaries and later went back to their jobs after they lost, that grace was no longer available with the new proposal.\n\nAccording to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, there was a lacuna in the new law, which encouraged infringements on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.\n\nThe Supreme Court had pronounced at different times that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution is ultra vires and, to that extent, null and void.\n\nSources, however, believed that the clause was meant to clip the wings of the governors, who, through appointments, often controlled those who became automatic delegates and determined the outcome of congresses.\n\nSources further claimed that the idea was originally from the House of Representatives, pushed by a principal officer from Lagos as an agenda to serve some interests. The senate was said to have concurred, just to keep the \u201cone house\u201d impression by the National Assembly.\n\nBut the fear being expressed by many was that, with a clause that clearly breached the provision of the constitution, the president might be forced to veto the electoral act amendment bill again, and that if that happened, a new electoral law might not be ready for the 2023 elections, hence the new rapprochement by the president.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the first amendment bill over the provision of direct primary as the only mode of choosing candidates by political parties.\n\nThe bill earlier passed by the National Assembly on November 18, 2021, provided: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission.\u201d\n\nBut Buhari, in declining assent, disclosed that he would only give assent to the bill if the lawmakers provided options for the conduct of primaries by political parties.\n\nThe president also cited several disadvantages of the provision to the system, including security and possible manipulation by incumbent officeholders, who might be seeking re-election, as well as political parties\u2019 inability to muster funds for it.\n\nBuhari Meets Governors Tomorrow\n\nHowever, the president\u2019s meeting with governors over the national convention tomorrow, was initially scheduled to hold last Tuesday but was called off shortly before the president proceeded on a four-day official visit to Brussels, Belgium, to attend the EU-AU Summit.\n\nSources told THISDAY at the weekend that the rescheduled meeting, which is at the instance of President Buhari, is to look at the national convention of the party fixed for Saturday, February 26, 2022.\n\nSome stakeholders have been pushing for a postponement of the convention citing logistical challenge and planning issues. They pointed out that the February 26 date was no longer feasible. Ultimately however it is the President\u2019s decision to make whether to go ahead or not. And as at this early morning he had not made that call.\n\nThe meeting with the President, which will be led by the Chairman of the Interim Committee of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, with 20 other APC Governors in attendance, would now table another possible date and other logistics for approval by President Buhari.\n\nThe interim leadership of the party was said to be pushing for the convention to be moved by two weeks to mid March but it will have to seek the approval of President Buhari in his capacity as the National leader of the APC.\n\nThis was the same step Buni-led interim committee took last December, when it approached the President to approve the February 26 date, which President Buhari gladly did.\n\nThe same scenario may play out as the President might accede to the extension of the date for the convention being proposed by some of the party leaders.\n\nAPC Governors Meet Tonight\n\nWorried by the turn of events over the national convention of APC, governors elected on the platform of the party are billed to meet tonight in Abuja, to take a final stand on the matter as well as decide whether to go ahead or shift the date of the convention.\n\nSome of the governors, whom THISDAY gathered were unhappy with both the president and party leadership, hinted that the meeting tonight would be the final one on the convention and that the outcome may be unpleasant as a majority of them were ready to go all out.\n\nParty sources, who also hinted at some of the happenings in the APC, however, pointed at the Imo State Governor, Uzodinma and his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello, as the arrowheads of those pushing for a postponement of the convention.\n\nAccording to party sources, the duo of Uzodinma and Bello, were the ones orchestrating the postponement, because they were said to be comfortable with the current caretaker committee through whom they\u2019ve been able to push many agenda and were therefore striving hard to ensure they stall the convention.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfortunate that people, who had no idea how this party came about are the ones causing the current commotion in our party? Can you imagine Hope and Bello holding the party to ransom over completely self-serving reasons, which do not even align with collective interest.\n\n\u201cI hope the meeting of the governors tonight is not going to be where they would throw it all out through the window, because this is absolutely ridiculous. What is the sense in the postponement of the convention, when we can actually tidy up everything in two or three days?\n\n\u201cReally, what do we need to get this done? With a unity list, the convention would be over in no time, because we\u2019d be going only to ratify the list. So, why stalling the entire party and by extension the country?\n\n\u201cWhy is the chairman acting as if he is not in charge? The whole thing is just disappointing and honestly, I\u2019m ashamed how the governors allowed two people without a stake in the party to drive them to this shameful station,\u201d said the party source.\n\nStakeholders Insist Convention Must Go on as Planned\n\nAlready, many stakeholders of the APC had claimed that except the president said otherwise, the proposed national convention of the party was unlikely.\n\nTHISDAY further gathered at the weekend that although some members of the party, who were opposed to the convention holding as scheduled, had begun to shop for an injunction to stop the exercise, the caretaker committee leadership of the party was also ready to go ahead with convention plans nonetheless.\n\nThis is as the youths of the party, under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM),had declared their readiness for the APC national convention on February 26, if the caretaker committee could not carry out the task.\n\nAt the same time, some stakeholders in party had listed a few of the factors believed should guide the choice of the new chairman of the party, citing particularly, a corruption-free individual without cases with any of the anti-corruption agencies.\n\nHowever, with the convention not likely to hold again, THISDAY gathered that the only person, who could have approved that the exercise goes on or be postponed at this stage was President Buhari, who unfortunately, has remained quiet about it until the Tuesday meeting was slated.\n\nWhile some members of the party had expressed concerns over the level of preparedness for an exercise that is scheduled to hold this weekend, including the zoning of offices and the sales of nomination form that have yet to take off, THISDAY gathered that all of those would be resolved in no time the moment Buhari gives a direction on the convention.\n\nBut whether or not the president agrees to go ahead with the convention as scheduled for this weekend after tomorrow\u2019s meeting, some members of the party were alleged to have started shopping for an injunction to stop the exercise from holding.\n\nAPC Youths Offer to Assist with Convention\n\nMeanwhile, leader of the Progressive Youth Movement, Mustapha Audu, in an open letter to Buhari, the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), lamented that overriding personal interest had made it impossible to conduct the national convention of the ruling APC.\n\nHe, however, maintained that, \u201cThe country is watching, and Mr. President has been promised a date of February 26th, 2022, for the APC National Convention. Any attempt to move this date shows that there is no regard for honesty or integrity, and this dents our image in the eyes of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the convention date was decided over two months ago and the caretaker committee has had more than enough time to put its house in order.\n\n\u201cWe want to reassure Mr. President that we, as young stakeholders, stand ready to conduct the National Convention come February 26th 2022 if the current CECPC cannot carry out the task,\u201d the APC youth said, decrying that the schedule of activities released by the caretaker committee for planning towards the conduct of the convention had all been violated.\n\nHe said these included the February 14 sale of forms date, release of zoning arrangements, the return of completed forms, which was supposed to be the deadline date.\n\nHis words: \u201cHolding a convention is not a difficulty as we carried out the previous ward, local government, state congresses and national convention within 12 days in 2018 between May 2nd and May 14th, 2018.\n\n\u201cHowever, the overriding personal interest this time around has unfortunately made it nearly impossible to conduct the national convention in over 20 months since the establishment of the CECPC in June 2020.\u201d\n\nAlso, a document titled: \u201cOur Position On Consensus National Chairman\u201d by some concerned members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and South-South Emerging Leaders\u2019 Forum (SELF), had stated that the party would converge for the national convention and that the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led committee would hand over the baton of leadership to a set of newly-elected executives.\n\nAccording to the document, members said that their views were no longer needed as executive committee members, notwithstanding the fact that top of the convention\u2019s checklist was the election of a new national chairman, after the controversial suspension of Adams Oshiomhole left a huge vacuum in 2021.\n\n\u201cIn fact, reports from some quarters have attributed to the plethora of internal conflicts and unending chaos at some state branches to the lack of an arrowhead, who will steer the activities of the party.\n\n\u201cTo them, the APC needs a leader, who will bridge the gaps across different ranks of the political group and maintain a cohesive force to retain power in the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cSo, for the sustenance of a zoning arrangement that is workable, the party stalwarts have decided to allow the North-Central zone to produce the next Chairman, thus eliminating Northeasterners and people from other geopolitical zones from the race.\n\n\u201cThis entails that contestants with an edge include Senator Mohammed Sani Musa (Niger State), Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura (Nasarawa State), Mallam Saliu Mustapha (Kwara State), ex-Governor George Akume (Benue State), Mohammed Etsu (Niger State), Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa State) and former Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Abu Bawa Bwari (Niger State).\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria\u2019s biggest political party shops for a new Chairman, we hereby examine some factors that may determine, who wears the crown from the North Central zone,\u201d the stakeholders said.\n\nAccording to the document under \u201cIntegrity test\u201d, the stakeholders said, \u201cSince the 2023 election is fast approaching, some have said the party may shoot itself in the leg by producing anyone, who has corruption cases hanging around his neck.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the proponents, was to avoid providing the opposition with an opportunity to rubbish the party\u2019s integrity.\n\nThey urged leaders of the party not to elect as chairman, some former governors and individuals, who have been indicted for financial crimes by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other anti-graft agencies.\n\nThey said it would be out of place for the APC to elect as national chairman and head of the National Working Committee (NWC), a person, who is indicted by the EFCC and other like agencies.\n\nAnother criterion listed is the alleged intra-state rivalry, stating that political observers had contended that the failure of some states to produce a consensus candidate might thwart the chances of some candidates.\n\nThey equally cited the age factor, saying, \u201cIf the words of President Muhammadu Buhari are to be banked on, age might be a factor in the chairmanship race.\u201d\n\nThey argued that the president, while hosting members of the APC National Lobby Group, at the State House, said it was time to give younger elements in the party the benefit to aspire to leadership in the party.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Presidency\u2019s Intervention Speeded up Kyari\u2019s Arrest",
          "text": "Micheal Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFresh facts have emerged on the process leading to the arrest of \u201csuper cop\u201d Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abba Kyari and his subsequent hand over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) last week.\n\nIn a dramatic move on February 14, NDLEA at a world press conference declared wanted Kyari, who had been suspended from his duties months ago following his indictment by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for alleged involvement with Internet fraudster, Hushpuppi, in cyber-criminal activities.\n\nThe move became necessary following the reluctance by the police high command to accede to the request by the anti-drug agency to release Kyari for interrogation.\n\n\u201cBut for the direct intervention by the presidency after the press conference questioning the delay in arresting and handing over Kyari to the NDLEA, the police high command would probably have continued to dither on the request to hand him over for interrogation,\u201d a presidency source said.\n\nHaving assembled a watertight case, with graphic video evidence, photographs, audio recordings, WhatsApp chats, etc., against Kyari and his men, NDLEA, it was gathered, briefed the president and other persons that needed to know in the presidency of the depth of Kyari\u2019s involvement in the drug ring. After securing the nod of the presidency to move against Kyari, the drug agency approached the Inspector General of Police.\n\nThe source revealed, \u201cThe NDLEA chairman, Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), went ahead to brief the IGP, who by this time was unaware that the president had been briefed. The IG was presented some of the damning evidence gathered against Kyari and his co-conspirators, urging him to release Kyari to the agency for interrogation.\n\n\u201cThe IGP promised the NDLEA that Kyari was going to be handed over to them on Thursday, February 10, but that did not happen. Friday also came and went, and nothing was done. The drug agency waited all through that weekend, but nothing happened. And Kyari who, apparently, had become aware of the request suddenly became unreachable to the agency.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kyari had started calling everyone in the presidency he thought could do something to put pressure on NDLEA to back off from arresting him.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that the press conference by NDLEA was a pre-emptive move following a tip-off to checkmate an alleged plot by the police high-ups to shield the wanted cop from arrest by the anti-drug agency, according sources briefed on the matter.\n\nPresidency sources told THISDAY, \u201cThe NDLEA got intelligence that the police were planning to change the narrative by parading some persons as suspects over the matter. It was when they (NDLEA) got wind of the move that they knew the police wanted to turn the case around. That was why they hurriedly addressed that world press conference last Monday.\n\n\u201cAnd immediately after the media briefing and reactions were pouring from across the world, the presidency called the IGP and directed him to ensure that Kyari was released to the NDLEA immediately. At this stage, the police high-ups who had been shielding Kyari all along knew the game was up and had to arrest him immediately.\u201d\n\nThe erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigeria Police was subsequently arrested and handed over to the drug law enforcement agency that Monday evening about 5 pm.\n\nKyari has been accused by the drug-fighting agency of being a member of a drug-dealing cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline.\n\nAlongside Kyari, four other suspects in the matter, namely, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba; and Inspector John Nuhu are presently being interrogated and further investigation being carried out on their alleged involvement in cocaine dealings, at the headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja.\n\nJohn Umoru, also a key member of the Abba Kyari gang, who goes by the nickname \u201cToo much money\u201d, is presently at large. The Police Service Commission had directed the IGP, Usman Baba, to ensure Umoru\u2019s arrest.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the drug-fighting agency has watertight case backed with solid evidence against Kyari and the others.\n\nKyari, despite being on suspension, was said to have still carried on with his despicable acts. The source disclosed that there were more than 10 audio evidences, five video evidences, and pictures, stressing that what the NDLEA did was a \u201cclean job.\u201d\n\nThe source stated, \u201cThe fact is that Kyari was being shielded from being extradited to the US by the police leadership, which was terrible enough case and worse for a senior police officer to be dealing in cocaine.\n\n\u201cThe modus operandi of Kyari and his men was that once they get information about banned drugs that were imported, such as tramadol, they would impound the items from the importer that brought them into the country and sell them to another cartel. That is, they take from one cartel and go and sell to another.\n\n\u201cHe is a billionaire and we learnt that in his confessional statement he revealed that he owns properties in choice locations in Lagos and Abuja. He owns an estate in Lekki, in Lagos, he has a house in Victoria Island, he has an estate in Asokoro in Abuja, and another estate at Guzape, Abuja, that is to let you know how corrupt this young man, who was on his way to becoming the IGP of the NPF, was.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY checks also revealed that the anti-drug agency last week filed an ex parte action in court to detain Kyari and his men for two weeks to allow it more time to conclude its investigation. He and his conspirators may be charged to court in the next two to three weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, more trouble appears imminent for Kyari, as NDLEA launches a probe into the seizure of a large consignment of Tramadol, an illegal drug, in Lagos.\n\nSources close to NDLEA said Kyari and other had been linked to the alleged seizure of a large consignment of Tramadol in a warehouse at the Amuwo-Odofin area of Lagos. It was gathered that someone who claimed to be a pharmacist imported the consignment worth N3 billion into Nigeria.\n\nIt was learnt that the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), allegedly, got information on the consignment and stormed the warehouse where the illegal drug was stocked, leading to the seizure.\n\nSources at NDLEA said the agency ought to have been told of the seizure, which allegedly took place last year, but the Kyari team kept the information from the agency.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that the IRT may have sold the consignment of Tramadol to a cartel after storming the Amuwo Odofin warehouse and seizing the Tramadol,\u201d a source said. \u201cWe have launched a probe into the case with a view to getting to the root of the matter,\u201d the source added.\n\nSpokesman of NDLEA, Mr. Femi Babafemi, said no stone would be left unturned in ensuring that all suspects already in custody and those that might still be indicted in the course of investigation faced the full weight of the law. Babafemi said the war by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari against drug was uncompromising, adding that the on-going case \u201cshowed a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman said the NDLEA had a trove of intelligence, hard facts, from chats to photos and video, and a detailed transcript of the communication between Kyari and officers of the agency.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is disheartening to hear straight from the horse\u2019s mouth the kind of sleaze engaged in by this team of rogue law enforcement agents led by Kyari, the members of whom he described this way: \u2018the boys are very, very sharp, they are very loyal.\u2019\u201d\n\nKyari had solved many criminal cases and was until recently among the most celebrated police officers in the country. But he found himself in troubled waters when he was associated with Hushpuppi\u2019s cybercrime case. An American court ordered his deportation to the United States to be prosecuted along with Abbas Ramon, alias Hushpuppi, a request the Nigerian government was yet to respond to.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u202250,000 jobs created since creation of NOGICD Act, says Wabote\n\n\u2022Local oil firms now produce 60% of Nigeria\u2019s domestic gas\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFrom a whopping $380 billion loss in capital flight due to the absence of an enabling law for retention of capital in the oil and gas industry, Nigeria currently has an annual in-country retention of $8 billion under the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act. Executive Secretary of Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, stated this in Lagos during a meeting with editors.\n\nWabote revealed that about two million jobs were also lost during the 50 years that the country\u2019s oil and industry operated without a capital retention law. But he said at least 50,000 jobs had so far been created with the implementation of the NOGICD Act.\n\nOver the past 11 years, Wabote stated that the level of Nigerian content in the oil industry, which was about five per cent before the enactment of the act in 2010, had increased to 26 per cent in 2016 and 42 per cent as at December 2021.\n\nHe explained, \u201cBefore now, there was revenue focus with little emphasis on in-country value addition, with massive capital flight of over $380 billion and an estimated two million job loss over a 50-year period, while the local content in the oil and gas industry was less than five per cent.\u201d\n\nWabote explained that NCDMB launched a Nigerian content 10-year strategic roadmap in 2017, with the target to achieve 70 per cent Nigerian content by 2027. As part of this goal, the board, he noted, would catalyse the creation of 300, 000 direct jobs in the oil and gas industry and linkage sectors and enable the retention of $13 billion out of the estimated annual $20 billion spend in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe NCDMB helmsman hinted that a pointer to the marked improvement in Nigerian content implementation was that the local economy used to retain little or nothing from the annual oil industry spend of $20 billion before the Act. The $8 billion in-country retention per year was possible, according to him, due to the development of critical capacities and assets by local oil and gas service companies and increased domiciliation and domestication of industry operations.\n\nWabote said Nigeria had also moved from near zero participation in the operations side of the oil and gas sector to the point where indigenous operators, such as Seplat, Aiteo, Eroton, and others, were now responsible for 15 per cent of the country\u2019s oil production and 60 per cent of domestic gas supply.\n\nOther major accomplishments of Nigerian content implementation included the establishment of two world-class pipe mills and five pipe coating yards, enabling Nigerian firms to fabricate more than 250,000 tonnes of steel per year, and ownership of more than 40 per cent of marine vessels used in the industry, he stated.\n\nWabote added that over 10 million training man-hours had been delivered via the board\u2019s human capacity development programme, thereby enabling the indigenous workforce to sustain oil production at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.\n\nProviding details of the board\u2019s credit facilities to the oil and gas industry, Wabote said NCDMB had inaugurated a $50 million Nigerian Content Research and Development Fund to drive basic research, commercialisation of research breakthroughs, establishment of research centres of excellence, and sponsorship of university endowments. He added that the board floated a $50 million special loan product for women in the oil and gas business to enable empowerment of the womenfolk in the industry, managed by Nexim (Nigerian Export-Import) Bank, and established another $30 million working capital fund to support oil and gas service companies.\n\nThe NCDMB executive secretary announced that the agency recently secured the approval of its Governing Council to set up a $50 million fund for a manufacturing product line, to be dedicated to companies that would operate in the Nigerian oil and gas parks. He said this was being constructed by the board in Bayelsa and Cross River states, explaining that the beneficiaries of the fund would have to be engaged in the manufacturing of equipment components used in the oil and gas industry and linkage sectors.\n\nWabote stated that NCDMB convened the breakfast meeting with the managements of the media organisations to enable senior members of the media understand the importance of Nigerian content to the economy.\n\nHe added that the COVID-19 pandemic made humanity realise that every economy needed to develop local capacities and capabilities in the core sectors, hence, all hands must now be on deck to push the local content narrative.\n\nHe charged media practitioners to uphold the ethics of the profession, noting that Nigerians depend on the media for many decisions.\n\nHowever, Wabote regretted that some online media platforms were undermining the federal government\u2019s intentions of bringing in technocrats and professionals to serve as appointees through targeted and unwarranted attacks.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Manager, Corporate Communications, NCDMB, Mr. Esueme Kikile, noted that media practitioners were key partners in the implementation of the NOGICD Act. Kikile solicited the support of the media to curb the incidence of fake news and libellous publications.\n\nHe assured the media of the board\u2019s continuous partnership and support.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Minister cries foul, Adeoti heads to court\n\n\u2022Buhari, APC govs to decide new date for national convention\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State yesterday won the governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held in the state.\n\nOyetola was backed by the National Leader of the APC, Senator Bola Tinubu.\n\nThis is coming as President Muhammadu Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party\u2019s National Convention following the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nOyetola also defeated his main challenger for the APC governorship ticket, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, at Ifofin Ward 8 of the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, in Ilesa East Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Osun State governor won in Aregbesola\u2019s ward with 309 votes against 146 recorded for Adeoti, the aspirant anointed by Aregbesola.\n\nThe two aspirants, who contested with Oyetola were former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Lasun Yusuff and a former Secretary to the State Government, Adeoti.\n\nAnnouncing the result in the early hours of today, at the state\u2019s APC secretariat in Osogbo, the Chairman of Osun APC Primary Election Committee and Kwara State Governor, Mr. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, said accredited voters were 247,207 while the total number of votes cast was 235,550.\n\nOyetola polled 222,169 votes to beat Aregbesola\u2019s candidate, Adeoti, who scored 12,921, while Lasun came a distant third with 460 votes.\n\nBefore the primary election, Aregbesola had attacked Oyetola\u2019s main backer and his estranged godfather, Tinubu, telling him that the same treatment meted out to a former Lagos State governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, which foreclosed his re-election bid in 2019, would be administered on his brother, Oyetola.\n\nHowever, Aregbesola was absent from the primary election and was said to have left Ilesa for Abuja yesterday morning for unspecified official duty.\n\nWhile the minister has threatened to explore legal means to obtain justice, alleging that the results of the primary election were \u201cfarcically counted in favour of the governor,\u201d Adeoti has vowed to seek Oyetola\u2019s disqualification in court.\n\nReacting to the election in a statement issued in Osogbo, the state capital yesterday, Adeoti vowed to head to court to challenge what he referred to as \u201cpyrrhic victory\u201d won by Oyetola.\n\nHe accused the governor of rigging the election with the apparent backing of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party.\n\nAdeoti said the ugly development in Osun APC has sent a wrong signal as to whether the APC has a future in the state.\n\nHe also accused Oyetola of using intimidation and violence to ensure that the primary election was not free and fair.\n\n\u201dThere was violence in Olorunda Local Government where the Ward 3 Chairman of the Rasaq Salinsile-led APC in Olorunda Local government, Mr. Sala Ademola and his secretary, Mr. Ajisefini were kidnapped. Our supporters were also disenfranchised in all the wards in Ife East by not being accredited and being intimidated with thugs wielding dangerous weapons.\u201d\n\nHe also accused a top chieftain of APC of taking over the electioneering process in Ife and halting the accreditation process, sending out his supporter using thugs, while allowing and counting party members from the governor\u2019s group.\n\nThe APC governorship aspirant also alleged that the Osun State government procured the services of armed policemen who aided the well-choreographed rigging of the election.\n\n\u201dThere was also a massive influx of unregistered members of the party who voted with the connivance of the heavily-compromised National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, of which Oyetola is a member. Overall, there was a massive disenfranchisement of registered APC members in all my strongholds during the so-called primary election.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that there was no way any primary election conducted in the state would be fair if Oyetola remains a member of the CECPC.\n\n\u201cGovernor Oyetola\u2019s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if allowed to pass us by.\n\n\u201cWe are reliably informed that Governor Oyetola is the one who hand-picked the Chairman and members of the primary election committee. It is within human reasonability not to trust such handpicked committee by an interested party member. Such committee would never be fair to other contenders.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, express absolute opposition to the outcome of the election because they were chosen by Governor Oyetola. There can only be point of convergence for us if Governor Oyetola could resign his membership and the process of conducting the primary begins afresh,\u201d Adeoti explained.\n\nAdeoti argued that Oyetola\u2019s participation in the election was a violation of the provision of Article 31(iii) of the APC Constitution (2014) as amended which says: \u201cAny party office holder interested in contesting for an elective office (whether party office or office in a general election) shall resign and leave office 30 days prior to the date of nomination or party primary for office he or she is seeking to contest\u201d.\n\nHe said the process had been orchestrated from the beginning to manipulate the outcome in favour of Oyetola, which was why the date of the primary was changed from March 5 to February 19.\n\n\u201cWe have it on good authority that the NCECPC was influenced by Oyetola to reverse the date to have the primary before the National Convention scheduled to hold on February 26, 2022. It is believed that Oyetola is afraid of contesting a free and fair primary election to be conducted by an objective committee after a neutral leadership of the party would have emerged,\u201d Adeoti alleged.\n\nHe however appealed to his supporters to be calm, vowing to seek a legal redress.\n\nAlso reacting in a statement by his media\u2019s aide, Mr. Sola Fasure, the interior minister and Adeoti\u2019s main backer alleged that the results of the governorship primary were \u201cfarcically counted in favour of the governor.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have received and continue to receive the reports of the shenanigans of the officials who conducted the sham of an election.\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with reports state-wide of how your names were expunged from the party\u2019s voters\u2019 register, which was not made available until this morning, contrary to the convention of making the list available to the candidates before the election.\n\n\u201cWe have heard of how party registration cards were being hawked this morning to the supporters of the state governor.\n\n\u201cYou are urged not to take laws into your hands. Please leave the rest to the Almighty God and let us explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice,\u201d Aregbesola explained.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Aregbesola-backed faction of the party in the state, Mr. Abiodun Agboola, in a statement issued, said: \u201cWe strongly condemned the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u201d.\n\nHe alleged that there were no records and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.\n\nThe Chairman of the anti-Oyetola faction of the party in the state, Mr. Rasaq Salinsile, who is from Ward 04, Isale-Oba in Iwo Local Government Area also told THISDAY that the election was fraudulent.\n\nOyetola had expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the primary election.\n\nThe governor, who applauded the members of the party for turning out in large number said, \u201closing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.\u201d\n\nOyetola spoke shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 1, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji.\n\nHe lauded Osun people for conducting themselves peacefully, saying the peaceful conduct of the election has testified to the fact that Osun remains the most peaceful state in the country.\n\nThe governor noted that news of violence making the rounds were mere speculations.\n\n\u201cI just want to appeal to all our people across the state to maintain peace. Election process should not be a battlefield or a do-or-die affair. Let everyone exercise his/her right to choose in determining who represents them at the party level and ultimately at the general election,\u201d Oyetola added.\n\nAlso commenting on the election, the Chairman of Osun APC Governorship Primary and Kwara State Governor, AbdulRazak, also hailed the peaceful conduct of the exercise.\n\nHe applauded APC members for the huge turnout and their peaceful conduct.\n\nHe spoke with journalists after monitoring the election in Iragbiji, the hometown of Governor Oyetola.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you open the pages of newspapers today, what was painted was a picture of the war in Osun. But the primaries election has been peaceful. I congratulate the people of Osun and all the aspirants. They have all done well.\u201d\n\nBuhari, APC Govs to Decide New Date for National Convention\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that this development followed the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the INEC.\n\nA source close to the APC National Caretaker Committee told THISDAY at the weekend that the clash of the proposed convention with the national elections was brought to the attention of the party after it had written to notify INEC of its intention to hold the national convention.\n\n\u201cElections are national issues that cut across political parties and therefore, it is not expected that party affairs should overshadow national elections. The stakeholders will meet and come up with a new date not beyond two to three weeks,\u201d the source explained\n\nOn whether INEC has been notified, the source said that the electoral body would be notified after the proposed meeting between Buhari, the APC governors and the members of the caretaker committee.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "* Electoral Bill 2022 still inchoate, commission clarifies\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated that the 2023 general election is not encumbered and will hold as planned, beginning with the presidential poll scheduled for February 18, 2023.\n\nResponding to speculations that it might postpone the scheduled conduct of the 2023 general election if President Muhammadu Buhari signs the Electoral Bill after February 22, 2022, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman of Voter Education, Mr Festus Okoye told THISDAY that the commission was not in any form of dilemma relating to the exercise of its constitutional and legal powers.\n\nOkoye stated that the commission was focused and working proactively to deliver on its mandate.\n\nAccording to Section 28 (1) of the Electoral Bill 2022, INEC is required to issue a notice of election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election.\n\nThe Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Mr Samson Itodo, had reportedly stated that in line with the Electoral Bill 2022, the deadline for the commission to issue the notice of election for the 2023 general election will be February 22, 2022, \u201cthe reasons being that the total number of days from February 22, 2022, to February 17, 2023, is 360 days.\u201d\n\nBut Okoye told THISDAY that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which, according to him, is still inchoate.\n\nAccording to him, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act.\n\nHe insisted that the electoral body was in synch with the constitutional provisions relating to the period for the holding of elections, adding that the provisions are sacrosanct and cast in stone.\n\n\u201cThe commission is only permitted to orbit around the constitutional timelines in fixing the date for the holding of elections.\n\n\u201cThe commission is a regulatory body guided by the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as altered), the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and its Rules, Regulations and Guidelines.\n\n\u201cAs of today, the existing and extant electoral legal framework for the conduct of elections remains the Constitution and the Electoral Act and the commission will continue to rely on its provisions for electoral continuity, pending any amendment to the said law.\n\n\u201cBy the commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines made pursuant to the powers conferred on it by the Constitution and the Electoral Act, the 2023 general election will hold on the 18th of February 2023,\u201d Okoye explained.\n\nHe argued that the scheduled date is in consonance and in conformity with sections 132(1) and 178(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria that gives the commission the exclusive right and power to appoint the date for the holding of Executive and Legislative Elections subject to the timelines and schedule circumscribed in Sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBy the said sections, election to executive positions shall hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than 10th January 2023 and not later than May 10, 2023.\n\n\u201cBy Section 30 of the existing and current Electoral Act, the commission shall give notice of the holding of the elections not later than 90 days to the said election and this remains the law and the commission is in good standing relating to its timelines and schedules,\u201d Okoye added.\n\nThe INEC commissioner said that the speculations and anxiety relating to the shifting of the date of the 2023 elections were based on the Electoral Bill 2022 which is still inchoate.\n\nAccording to him, Section 28 of the said Bill requires the commission to give notice of election not later than 360 days to the said election, stressing that the said 360 days will elapse in the next few days.\n\nHe said that the commission was also aware that Section 58 of the Constitution gives the President 30 days to assent to the Bill or withhold his assent.\n\n\u201cThe commission is aware that the Bill was transmitted to the President on January 31, 2022. The members of the National Assembly and the Executive are aware of these timelines in the Bill and the implications of the timelines if the Bill is assented to and these are issues that can be adjusted and streamlined.\n\n\u201cThe commission desires an expeditious resolution of the issues surrounding the new electoral legal framework as there are creative and innovative issues and provisions in the Bill that will enhance and advance the electoral process and our democracy.\n\n\u201cThe commission is focused and will continue with its preparations for the conduct of the 2023 general election. If there are challenges with timelines, the commission will meet, assess those challenges and remain within the constitutional and legal confines in sections 132(2) and 178(2) of the Constitution that requires that elections to executive positions to hold not earlier than December 30, 2022, and not later than April 29, 2023, while legislative elections shall hold not earlier than January 10, 2023, and not later than May 10, 2023,\u201d he explained.\n\nSome civil society groups had declared February 22, 2022, National Day of Protest on the Electoral Bill\n\nThe groups said they were aware that the National Assembly transmitted the Bill to the President on January 2022.\n\nThey said that they were also aware the Bill allows for electronic transmission of results, strengthens INEC\u2019s financial independence and empowers the commission to reject falsified election results.\n\n\u201cThe bill, when signed, requires INEC to issue Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the day appointed for an election. Therefore, the President has to give assent to the bill on or before 22nd February 2022 if the dates announced for the 2023 elections are to be maintained.\n\nAccordingly, they said that they have resolved to declare Tuesday, February 22, 2022, as the National Day of Protest to demand immediate assent to the bill.\n\n\u201cWe urge citizens across the nation to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to act on this matter of urgent national importance\u201d.\n\nThe CSOs that signed the statement include Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, Yiaga Africa, Partners for Electoral Reform (PER), International Press Centre Institute for Media and Society, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, The Albino Foundation, Centre for Citizens with Disability, Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), Labour Civil Society Coalition (LASCO), Transition Monitoring Group, CLEEN Foundation, and Civil Society, Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC).\n\nOthers include: Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre (WARDC), Nigeria Network of Non-Governmental Organisations (NNNGO), Inclusive Friends Association (IFA), Enough is Enough (EIE), The Electoral Hub, Centre for Liberty, Take Back Nigeria Movement, International Peace and Civil Responsibility Centre (IPCRC),100 Women Lobby Group, Women in Politics Forum, Raising New Voices, Millennials Active Citizenship Advocacy Africa and Ready to Lead Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Conducting Census For The Living And The Living Dead, By Owei Lakemfa",
          "text": "Life in Nigeria is very cheap and living is very costly. But please don\u2019t ask me for the statistics because they are hard to come by Registration of birth, especially in the rural areas is not common, but more uncommon is that of death; the general attitude is \u2018God gives and God takes\u2019. So why worry about a death certificate?\n\nWeekly, there are reports of killings across the country, especially by terrorists, kidnappers and bandits. Some of these hold territory, run court and impose taxes, and all institutions, including the security services and governments, seem unable or incapable of defending the citizenry. The result is the mass exodus to various parts of the country like Abuja and neigbouring countries like Cameroun that are thought to be safer.\n\nThe Buhari administration thinks that given this scenario, there is the need to know how many Nigerians are still surviving, how many foreigners have flowed in, how many bandits, especially from Central and West Africa have crossed into the country. These groups have complicated our problems by leaving villages and towns deserted and ruining lives.\n\nAlso, given arrested social progress, ever rising inflation, hunger and the imperative of borrowing from abroad, there is the need for the country to have some reliable population count so we will ever be conversant with the ratio of population to external borrowings. As some have argued, borrowing shows the good health of our economy as the rich would not want to extend loan facilities to the insolvent.\n\nOrdinarily, census is supposed to give reliable data with which to plan and determine the basic needs for schools, hospitals, roads and other infrastructure. That cannot be the reason for the Buhari government conducting census because it is doing wonderfully well without statistics. In any case, you do not need census to tell you that out of school children should be in school. In the case of this government, even schools for such children built by the previous administration, were abandoned.\n\nIn 2012, the Jonathan administration set out to build 400 schools in the North to vastly improve education in that part of the country. At least, 165 of these integrated Amajiri schools were opened, some with integrated language laboratories and health clinics. But when the Buhari administration came to power, many of these schools were shut down, some seized by state governments and many underutilized with the students roaming the streets.\n\nSo why would it worry itself with planning for basic needs when it has only 15 months to go in an eight-year renewed tenure? It might have to do more with the allocation of funds and justification of why in a country where 90 per cent contribute little or nothing to the national purse, the producers get little, and the non-producers get the lion share.\n\nThe digital census which is coming with a princely tag of N178.09 billion is needed at this time of want, and when free money needs to be sourced for the 2023 elections.\n\nAll these should not be misconstrued as my being allergic to census. No, I love it because it will show that while Nigeria may well be big for nothing, at least, it has the largest population of Black people in the world. That feeling can be soothing.\n\nThe last census in 2006 gave us a population of 140 million which some states challenged. Our current estimated population, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, is 206 million. I bet we are way more than that as the new census might also include estimated figures which would be handy in politicians negotiating among themselves.\n\nCensus is not really value free as it has its own politics. For example, the South rejected the provisional results of the 2006 census which had Kano with 9.4 million as the most populous state followed by Lagos State with nine million people. That census had the North with 75 million people and the South, 65 million. The then Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, demanded a recount, insisting that the state which led the 1991 Census and had since then developed into a mega city as attested to by the international community, cannot have less population than Kano State.\n\nHe argued that a parallel census the state had conducted in collaboration with the National Population Commission had over 17.5 million people; so the 9.0 million given it was fraudulent. The Pan Igbo umbrella group, Ohanaeze said the 2006 census was used as a political weapon to present Igbo as a minority populace. Then president, Olusegun Obasanjo, said Nigerians were free to do whatever they liked with that census. It is not known if the final population figures were released, but what is certain is that no store was put on this population exercise. It was a waste of resources. The first national census in 1953 conducted by the British colonialists was controversial and rejected, as were those of 1962, 1963 and 1973.\n\nLet me commend President Muhammadu Buhari for forging ahead with his census programme because only a courageous leader would conduct a census when many parts of the country are under the control of local and foreign invaders, terrorists and bandits. Unless a decision has been taken to estimate the population, how do you conduct census in parts of the country under occupation?\n\nI do not take the joke of the Chairman of the NPC, Nasir Isa Kwarra, serious. He boasts that the commission has the capacity to tackle insecurity in all the states of the federation during the census. If for 13 years the entire Nigerian Armed Forces and other security agencies have been unable to defeat the Boko Haram, and cannot put down rampaging banditry and kidnapping, how does a civil commission like his hope to marshal the necessary firepower and security to overrun these groups during the census? Does he hope to bring in American and Russians troops to do the job?\n\nIf population were linked with production and taxation rather than free consumption, the figures would be more reliable and less contentious. By the way, what is the whole essence of the National Identification Number, NIN, which is assigned to every Nigerian at the completion of enrolment into the National Identity Data Base?\n\nIn a country where elections are rigged with impunity, doubts will always be created by a new population census even if they are conducted by angels. So the May, 2022 census may just be another round of controversy and acrimony. Who knows, that might well be the motive; at least it would divide Nigerians on ethno-regional basis and divert attention from the pressing challenges of insecurity, hunger and living in conditions unsuitable for human beings.",

          "text": "Pan-African fintech firm Flutterwave on Friday announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard as well as the addition of small business lending, fintech-as-a-service (FaaS), and more to its suite of offerings.\n\nThe announcement comes 2 days after Flutterwave confirmed it had raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion. Led by founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, the company facilitates cross-border payments transactions of small-to-large businesses in Africa via one API.\n\nIn a virtual event themed \u201cFlutterwave 3.0\u201d, Africa\u2019s most valuable startup and payments giant rolled out a series of products and services including FaaS services for embedded finance, SME loans for its users, card issuance for a wide array of clients while announcing the addition of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlutterwave Capital, the new SME loans product, is offered in partnership with the company\u2019s lending partners\u2014CashConnect Microfinance Bank, MoneyWise Microfinance Bank, Wema Bank, Zenith Bank, Stanbic IBTC Bank, and Sterling Bank.\n\nThe new product will enable businesses \u201ceasily access loans without collateral, cumbersome documentation, and other stringent terms and conditions,\u201d a blog post on Flutterwave\u2019s website reads, adding that eligible applicants can access the funds they need in less than 2 business days.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave Capital, we\u2019re making it easier for business owners to access the funds they require to grow their businesses. Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases",
          "text": "In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.\n\nThe growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021\u2014its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.\n\nScams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called \u201crug pull\u201d. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.\n\nCryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.\n\nDeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.\n\nDeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth\u20141,964%\u2014for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens\u2014all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.\n\nWhile Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent \u201ctokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges\u201d.\n\nApart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.\n\nIn a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won\u2019t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales\u2014private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized \u00a3180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple\u2019s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Ckrowd\u2019s plan to help African creators monetise their content",
          "text": "The term \u201ccreator economy\u201d became popular throughout 2021 when venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and independent creators not only threw the phrase around but also invested heavily in the content industry\u2014an industry that would leapfrog into becoming a $100 billion industry.\n\nContent creators\u2014writers, artists, social media influencers, videographers, gamers, podcasters\u2014are raking in millions of dollars annually by monetising their craft. But only a tiny fraction of these creators are Africans. This means African creators are still struggling to earn much from their craft, compared to their global counterparts.\n\nTwo things may have caused this: one is, global payment networks like Paypal that should connect African creators with the rest of the world have shut Africans out of their network; secondly, lack or shortage of efficient local creator platforms that connect the rest of the world directly to African creators.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile there are some companies already building to solve the first problem, Ckrowd, a content streaming platform and marketplace, is solving the second problem at scale.\n\nCkrowd is positioning itself as the platform that bridges the gap between African content creators or suppliers and their global content consumers by providing creators with the opportunity to earn income while giving \u201cunique, exclusive, and engaging content experiences to their consumers\u201d.\n\nCkrowd was founded out of a will to do more\n\nCkrowd was founded by Olukayode Adebayo in November 2020. But before then, Adebayo, who was freshly back to Nigeria after a stint with the Nigerian embassy in China, had founded a real estate company that morphed into a hospitality business. He then started a media outfit in September 2016, called KAM Africa.\n\nAt KAM Africa, Adebayo started an initiative that would help creative professionals like musicians and actors understand the business part of their craft. But as he continued with the initiative, he realised that there was a need to bring all these promising enterprises together. Nobody builds in isolation, especially in the entertainment scene. So KAM Africa started Amfest, a festival-like event that brings together African creative businesses.\n\nAdebayo\u2019s cross-continental experience helped Amfest to quickly scale out of its founding country Nigeria into Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and even Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe started building business partnerships with other platforms and scaled very fast. It was in the process of supporting the sector that we found out that many of these talents that are now enterprises had a problem with anything that doesn\u2019t involve physical human interaction,\u201d Adebayo told TechCabal. \u201cAt the point of this discovery, COVID-19 happened and it became even clearer as most of them were left without income. So, there was a need to bring them online.\u201d\n\nThe next thing to build became apparent; Ckrowd\u2014the solution to these persistent problems. After doing a lot of research and consultations throughout 2020, Adebayo launched the beta version of Ckrowd early last year and then launched publicly in August.\n\nHow Ckrowd works\n\nThe platform is a direct-to-consumer platform where original and exclusive African content in education, information, and entertainment is distributed directly to local and global consumers in short videos and live stream format. Think of a marriage between OnlyFans, Patreon, and YouTube\u2014in fact, a combination of all the streaming platforms out there\u2014but now for African content.\n\nLast year in December, uduX, a Nigerian streaming platform, partnered with telecoms giant MTN to live stream Wizkid\u2019s \u201cMade in Lagos\u201d concert from London\u2019s 02 Arena to over 238,000 Africans. But the event was quickly moved to YouTube after the day one of the three-days concert. Regardless of what might have caused the relocation, it\u2019s, however, an indication that Africa needs more efficient indigenous platforms that can aggregate content and put more money in the pocket of local creators while providing a seamless experience for local and global consumers.\n\nFor Adebayo, Ckrowd is taking an all-encompassing approach to building for the African creator economy, one that\u2019s a win-win for all the stakeholders.\n\nTo better understand CKrowd\u2019s advantage, let\u2019s look at how existing streaming platforms work: On YouTube, for instance, creators make money according to their view numbers and sometimes from ads. This means, if YouTube pays $0.0001 per view, you\u2019ll need 10,000 views to make $10. In the case of Netflix, let\u2019s say you subscribe at $10 per month, what happens if you are too busy for Netflix that month? Will you be refunded? No!\n\nFrom the creator\u2019s end, 10,000 views for $10 is not sustainable. How many African creators hit hundreds of thousands of views or millions? A small number. For consumers, the subscription model is not good if you can\u2019t flip unused subscriptions.\n\nOn Ckrowd, creators can livestream their content like uduX live and upload on-demand contents like on Netflix. Creators also control their spaces and how they want to be paid\u2014per view or by subscription. Unlike on social media platforms where creators, after creating content and amassing views and followers, would have to go outside the platform to market their views and followers to brands, Ckrowd lets creators set their prices and make their money as they go. It also allows viewers to select how they wish to pay for content\u2014all inside the platform.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to deliver economic value to African creators. The platform pays 70% of total income on content to creators, which we believe is the highest pay-out on digital content to African creators,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nCkrowd is not only for music and film content; educational, culinary, sports, and other forms of content are allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe Ckrowd platform is similar to a large arena in the cloud where you can broadcast live & short on-demand video content and charge access fees on behalf of the creators of that content. This allows the platform to uniquely function as an edtech, mediatech and adtech hybrid,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nCkrowd, from 4 users at its beta launch, has grown to have over 2,000 users on its platform. Last year in October, it raised $160,000 in pre-seed funding; $60,000 of equity funding, and $100,000 export grant investment from an international angel investor group, as well as backing from the Export Expansion Facility Programme from Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nCkrowd plans to use the new capital to expand with new innovative technologies and strategies to get more customers, accelerate growth and promote intra-African creative industries. In addition to that, the company plans to hire more talent, especially in product, Research and Development (R&D) and engineering.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, the startup has already made headway in some of these plans. It acquired a marketing agency last year to power the ads sector of its business. The company said the agency\u2019s channels had access to about 50 million people across Africa, which means Ckrowd can now reach these people through email, SMS, and other channels available. This sounds like a transfer of data without the consent of the owners; however, if these people opted in with the marketing agency, which has now been acquired, then, by extension, they have opted in with Ckrowd.\n\nThe startup also recently announced the appointment of the founder and director of Music Works International Katherine McVicker and co-founder of Cultural Connections of Africa (CCA) Adeleye Fabusoro as executive members to its advisory board. Adebayo also said the company has built its own production studio and is currently partnering with other media houses across the continent, He hinted that they [Ckrowd] will soon start rolling out the results of the partnerships.\n\nCkrowd is taking on big players like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, ShowMax, uduX and even cable television channel who\u2019ve got their claws deep in the streaming market. Will it curve, niche down, or dominate? This is not an easy one to predict but from Adebayo\u2019s confidence in the product and their pan-African play, there\u2019s something to root for in Ckrowd.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nIn the last few weeks, on every social media platform I use \u2014 mainly Twitter and WhatsApp \u2014 one of the first things I see is \u201cWordle 2/6\u201d or \u201cWordle 1/6\u201d, followed by some green, yellow, and white squares.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m not hating or anything, but I\u2019m not a huge fan of Wordle or the other variants springing up like quordle, octordle, and semantle.\n\nAnd with new ownership comes some changes. In January 2022, The New York Times acquired Wordle from the creator, Josh Wardle, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, there\u2019s been screening of \u201coffensive words\u201d and what appears to be significantly more ad-tracking. At least the game is still free, though.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, February 18, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first six countries to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines in Africa. Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia are the chosen ones.\n\nOn to today\u2019s Digest; we\u2019ll be discussing the WHO\u2019s announcement and:\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s wave of announcements\n\nGoogle\u2019s Privacy Sandbox getting extended to Android\n\nAn ambitious wave of products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing its $250 million Series D announcement on Wednesday, February 16, 2022, African fintech startup Flutterwave has revealed several new products and features.\n\nOn Friday, February 18, 2022, it revealed this at its virtual event, Flutterwave 3.0. It also announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard.\n\nOne of the products is its Fintech as a Service (FaaS) \u2014 enabling businesses to automatically embed financial services into their product. It also introduced Flutterwave Capital which would provide loans for its merchants.\n\nOther products and services include card issuance \u2014 physical for Nigerian residents and virtual for others \u2014 and Flutterwave Grow to help businesses incorporate across Africa.\n\nFlutterwave-acquired Disha was not left out, with creatives now able to receive payments via their links.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis seems quite ambitious, but it does spell some exciting times in the African fintech ecosystem.\n\nBalancing privacy and profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Visual Content Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nLast year, in April, Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy which meant app developers had to explicitly seek the consent of users to use the company\u2019s Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA). In other words, users permission must be sought before their data can be tracked.\n\nThere were mixed reactions to this. According to the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s Mobile ecosystems market study interim report published in December 2021, Apple said organisations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and makers of Firefox, a free and open-source browser, Mozilla supported this decision.\n\nOther parties projected that it would cause a fall in revenue for companies reliant on IDFA to measure and attribute for iOS mobile advertising campaigns. Basically, companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), Google, Snapchat, and Twitter that need advertising revenue were more likely to be affected.\n\nThere was also a likelihood that small businesses that rely on these platforms for advertising would be affected as well.\n\nIn February 2021, Meta took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, claiming it was protesting for \u201csmall businesses everywhere.\u201d Financial Times revealed that Meta, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube lost $10 billion in revenue once Twitter implemented the ATT more than seven months later.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 16, 2022, Google announced that it would be toeing Apple\u2019s line and introducing privacy limitations to cover apps on its Android smartphones, extending its previous decision to do the same on its Chrome browser.\n\nIn its blog post, Google said, \u201cToday, we\u2019re announcing a multi-year initiative to build the Privacy Sandbox on Android, with the goal of introducing new, more private advertising solutions. Specifically, these solutions will limit sharing of user data with third parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut explanation of how this would work yet, the company said it would be working closely with the industry and regulators to \u201cimprove user privacy without putting access to free content and services at risk.\u201d\n\nIt would be interesting to see how this works considering the competing interests of privacy and profit-making. You can also watch out for a Privacy Roundtable explainer this Thursday.\n\nAfrica-produced mRNA vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve all probably heard a lot more about vaccines in the last couple of years than we thought we would in our lifetime. But the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has broadened our knowledge. Currently, two of the world\u2019s most effective COVID-19 vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but an mRNA is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to one of the DNA strands of a gene. mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein \u2014 or even just a piece of a protein \u2014 that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.\n\nOn Friday, February 18, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first six countries to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines in Africa. They are Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia.\n\nThis comes after the work being done by the WHO to establish a global technology transfer hub in South Africa to serve low and middle-income countries. Africa suffers from a shortage of biotech facilities, and while health tech is slowly gaining momentum, much of the focus still remains on access to primary healthcare and insurance.\n\nWhat you might have missed last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nThis weekend, listening to early Linkin Park reminded me why heavy metal is not particularly my scene.

Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nSolving critical bankend freight industry challenges\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\nSolving critical backend freight industry challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.\n\nFor most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.\n\nOne of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.\n\nPartech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.\n\nHe also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company\u2019s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.\n\nThe round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.\n\nNonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.\n\nEarnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMost people with EUPD/BPD aren\u2019t manipulative \u2013 but often those around us can be.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network. It plans to grow its 7,000 agent network by three times a year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nScientists Created a Cyborg Fish Powered by Beating Human Heart Cells.

          "text": "In November 2018, Nigeria awarded a $500 million contract to the Sierra Nevada Corporation to manufacture 12 A-29 Super Tucano attack aircraft planes for the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nExactly a year earlier, in 2017, Brazilian aviation giant Embraer announced that it had received a firm order from the Philippine Air Force for six A-29 Super Tucano close air support (CAS) aircraft. IHS Jane, the world\u2019s leading source of defence intelligence, reported that the Philippines\u2019 A-29 contract was valued at $99 million.\n\nThe Philippines contract equates to $16.5 million per Tucano aircraft whereas in Nigeria\u2019s case, when other costs included into the contract is taken out, it was $30 million for each one of the 12 that would finally arrive last year.\n\nWhy Nigeria paid about double the amount the Philippines paid for the same specification of Tucano jets will leave many scratching their heads, but for Nigerians inflated government expenditure is nothing new.\n\nFor years now, at the Nigerian Air Force bases in Makurdi, Kainji and Lagos, unrepaired combat and transport planes bought in the 1970s and 1980s including the French built Alpha Jets, the Anglo-British Jaguar strike aircrafts and the medium-lift C-130 transport planes lie idle and wasting, unmaintained and unused by the Air Force. Nigeria\u2019s biggest ship and only Frigate NNS ARADU has for over a decade been inactive, idle and wasted, unrepaired by the Navy.\n\n\u2018Beegeagle\u2019, Nigeria\u2019s leading defence analyst noted in 2012 about the Nigerian Air Force Jaguar aircrafts, \u201cThe Jaguar jet has had the shortest service life in the Nigerian Air Force, thanks in no small part to the nature of the purchase contract and the international politics of arms transfer at that time. An initial batch of 12 single seat variants were supplied and later six twin-seat versions which were used for pilot training in the United States were inducted into the NAF.\n\n\u201cSometime in 2007 when these jets were put on display by the NAF for prospective buyers to inspect, it emerged that a Jaguar B TRAINER variant (NAF 703) had flown for only 150 hours 54 minutes since it was manufactured in December 1984. It had its 100 hours\u2019 inspection on the 10th day of February, 1986. It suggests that the created fleet of Jaguar jets is almost brand-new still\u201d.\n\nSimply put, for more than three decades, military aircrafts as well as other assets and platforms bought with tax payers\u2019 money have been wasting away in the open, buffeted by the vagaries of the environment, simply because the military and the government have no interest in repairing them. They are more interested in buying new systems.\n\nWaste, driven by corruption, pervades Nigeria\u2019s defence sector. Transparency International (TI) in a report warned, \u201cCorruption had an undeniable impact on Nigeria\u2019s security situation. Corruption in the defence sector, in particular, has resulted in the waste of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of public funds\u201d.\n\nRead also: Canada to support Black-owned businesses with $2.8 million investment\n\nCorruption and corrupt practices, Kwopnan Bulus, a lecturer in the Department of Political Science at the University of Jos, posits, are the essential problems with poor infrastructure execution, maintenance and procurement in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bulus, \u201cin most cases and as we have seen, kickbacks to politicians and bureaucrats have become so entrenched that it results in poor quality of infrastructure. In addition, a lot of these loans were diverted and used for purposes other than what they were initially procured for. Once this is done, the result is that such infrastructure would unlikely yield the objective result.\n\n\u201cSo what the Chinese are doing now,\u201d he added, \u201cis that instead of giving the money to Nigerians, they give the contracts to Chinese companies and pay them, thus eliminating the corruption that is so inherent in the Nigerian system. I think that\u2019s what they are doing with respect to the Akwanga-Makurdi road. We need to be more deliberate about the monitoring and evaluation of the execution and outcomes of the infrastructure projects we are undertaking.\u201d\n\nIt is not just about corruption though. It is also the bigger issue of the culture of maintenance that has resulted in poor value for Nigerians for money spent by the government, says Rajneesh Narula, the John H. Dunning chair of International Business Regulation at the Henley Business School, University of Reading. \u201cMany Nigerian politicians,\u201d he notes, \u201chistorically tend to want the latest model, rather than spending money on training and undertaking regular maintenance and repairs.\u201d\n\nAnd it is not just the putrid defence sector alone. Nigeria\u2019s power generation has an installed capacity of about 12,522mw, mostly built from loans garnered in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet, actual generated power hovers between a scandalous 3000mw and an immoral 4500mw. The historic gap between the demand for power in Nigeria and the electricity available from the grid has led to widespread self-generation of power in the commercial, industrial and residential sectors; many individuals and businesses own their generators to compensate for lack of access to and supply of energy.\n\nBusinesses\u2019 reliance on self-generation via diesel-powered generators has resulted in continuous increase in the price of goods and services. This is because, typically, self-generation accounts for a significant portion of most businesses\u2019 recurrent expenditure; such significant overhead costs are clearly being passed onto consumers.\n\nThe World Bank in 2021 noted that 85 million Nigerians do not have access to grid electricity. This represents 43 percent of the country\u2019s population and makes Nigeria the country with the largest energy access deficit in the world. \u201cThe lack of reliable power,\u201d said the bank, \u201cis a significant constraint for citizens and businesses, resulting in annual economic losses estimated at $26.2 billion (\u20a610.1trn) which is equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP.\n\n\u201cAccording to the 2020 World Bank Doing Business report, Nigeria ranks 171 out of 190 countries in getting electricity and electricity access is seen as one of the major constraints for the private sector.\u201d\n\nYet, tens of billions of dollars have been spent between 1999 and 2021 to generate microscopic amounts of power. The Federal Government has reportedly spent around $31.45 billion on the sector between 1999 and 2013.\n\nAccording to dataphyte, in 2021, \u201calmost six years into the Buhari-led government, over \u20a61.3 trillion has entered into the electricity sector,\u201d in the form of budgetary provisions and support.\n\nIn 2019, the World Bank approved a $550 million loan for Nigeria to develop mini grids and solar home systems. In June 2020, the government approved $120 million for the continued construction and completion of the Kashimbila multipurpose dam in Taraba State, expected to generate 40mw and water for the community. The government recently signed a six-year, N1.15 trillion contract with Germany\u2019s Siemen AG for a three-phased electrification project aimed at increasing Nigeria\u2019s power to 25,000mw.\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s government announced that it intended to spend $3 billion on the energy sector in the next 24 months to increase the power being wheeled by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) from the current 4,900mw to at least 7,000mw.\n\nIn the transport sector, $5 billion worth of rail projects were flagged off in 2021 with a promise by the government to spend tens of billions of dollars on its rail networks in the coming years. After borrowing over $5 billion from the Chinese to build new rail tracks and buy new locomotives, the country is seeking a further $14.4 billion from outside China to fund an upgrade of a narrow-gauge track in the South-East and the building of a standard-gauge on the coast.\n\nIn 2017, Nigeria\u2019s government secured a $6.1 billion loan from China Exim Bank for the construction of Calabar-Port Harcourt, Lagos-Ibadan, Lagos-Kano rail, and Lagos to Kaduna railway and another $1.5 billion counterpart funding for the Lagos-Ibadan project. The administration has accumulated various other loans to fund the projects, which form part of the N40.08 trillion-sovereign-debt burden that is currently weighing heavily on the country\u2019s fiscal position.\n\nIn spite of the huge investments made in the rail sector since 2006, the impact of rail on the economy is still meagre. It has done little to reinvigorate the economy, \u201cbecause the focus is on passengers, the majority of whom who see the ticket prices as too expensive rather than on the movement of goods where much of the income for rail transport globally comes from,\u201d said a Chinese civil engineer involved in the construction of the country\u2019s rail projects.\n\nFor Professor Narula, the focus should be on maintenance. \u201cSomewhere in the 1970s,\u201d he notes, \u201cthe Dutch ran the railways. In the 1980s, the Indian Railways sent thousands of workers to Nigeria and Nigerians to India to train them in running the railways efficiently and maintaining existing rolling stock, but then after the Indians left, it returned back to the original state of disrepair and inefficiency. Now we have spent a fortune buying trains again, but will they be maintained once the Chinese stop managing it?\u201d\n\nValue for money is not a completely Nigerian problem, argues Andrew Nevin, partner, Financial Services Lead and chief economist at PwC Nigeria. For Nevin, who has lived in Nigeria since 2008, \u201cpeople all over the world complain of waste. The concept of value for money is new\u201d. In the past, he further notes, \u201cgovernments did whatever they liked and citizens couldn\u2019t do much. Now this is changing, governments are asking for taxes and levies from citizens and citizens are asking for improvement in the provision of public goods such as education, health, water and electricity. Therefore, there needs to be clear signs that the government can deliver on projects.\u201d\n\nA major challenge he posits, \u201cis the multiplicity of MDAs in Nigeria.\u201d Most of these agencies, he argues, \u201cwere never created to deliver value. They were created for patronage during the oil boom days. Due to the many actors involved, and elongated decision-making process, they drive up the cost of value creation and drive down efficiency.\u201d\n\nNigerians, he urges, should keep putting pressure on governments in a constructive way. \u201cCitizens\u2019 action is no doubt having an effect on the government. We can see that with the programme and project deliveries of the governors of Lagos, Edo, Kaduna and now the election of a brilliant economist and highly competent manager in Anambra, Professor Charles Soludo. People should make their voices heard and choose the right leaders.\u201d",

This is because, typically, self-generation accounts for a significant portion of most businesses\u2019 recurrent expenditure; such significant overhead costs are clearly being passed onto consumers.\n\nThe World Bank in 2021 noted that 85 million Nigerians do not have access to grid electricity. This represents 43 percent of the country\u2019s population and makes Nigeria the country with the largest energy access deficit in the world. \u201cThe lack of reliable power,\u201d said the bank, \u201cis a significant constraint for citizens and businesses, resulting in annual economic losses estimated at $26.2 billion (\u20a610.1trn) which is equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP.\n\n\u201cAccording to the 2020 World Bank Doing Business report, Nigeria ranks 171 out of 190 countries in getting electricity and electricity access is seen as one of the major constraints for the private sector.\u201d\n\nYet, tens of billions of dollars have been spent between 1999 and 2021 to generate microscopic amounts of power. The Federal Government has reportedly spent around $31.45 billion on the sector between 1999 and 2013.\n\nAccording to dataphyte, in 2021, \u201calmost six years into the Buhari-led government, over \u20a61.3 trillion has entered into the electricity sector,\u201d in the form of budgetary provisions and support.\n\nIn 2019, the World Bank approved a $550 million loan for Nigeria to develop mini grids and solar home systems. In June 2020, the government approved $120 million for the continued construction and completion of the Kashimbila multipurpose dam in Taraba State, expected to generate 40mw and water for the community. The government recently signed a six-year, N1.15 trillion contract with Germany\u2019s Siemen AG for a three-phased electrification project aimed at increasing Nigeria\u2019s power to 25,000mw.\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s government announced that it intended to spend $3 billion on the energy sector in the next 24 months to increase the power being wheeled by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) from the current 4,900mw to at least 7,000mw.\n\nIn the transport sector, $5 billion worth of rail projects were flagged off in 2021 with a promise by the government to spend tens of billions of dollars on its rail networks in the coming years. After borrowing over $5 billion from the Chinese to build new rail tracks and buy new locomotives, the country is seeking a further $14.4 billion from outside China to fund an upgrade of a narrow-gauge track in the South-East and the building of a standard-gauge on the coast.\n\nIn 2017, Nigeria\u2019s government secured a $6.1 billion loan from China Exim Bank for the construction of Calabar-Port Harcourt, Lagos-Ibadan, Lagos-Kano rail, and Lagos to Kaduna railway and another $1.5 billion counterpart funding for the Lagos-Ibadan project. The administration has accumulated various other loans to fund the projects, which form part of the N40.08 trillion-sovereign-debt burden that is currently weighing heavily on the country\u2019s fiscal position.\n\nIn spite of the huge investments made in the rail sector since 2006, the impact of rail on the economy is still meagre. It has done little to reinvigorate the economy, \u201cbecause the focus is on passengers, the majority of whom who see the ticket prices as too expensive rather than on the movement of goods where much of the income for rail transport globally comes from,\u201d said a Chinese civil engineer involved in the construction of the country\u2019s rail projects.\n\nFor Professor Narula, the focus should be on maintenance. \u201cSomewhere in the 1970s,\u201d he notes, \u201cthe Dutch ran the railways. In the 1980s, the Indian Railways sent thousands of workers to Nigeria and Nigerians to India to train them in running the railways efficiently and maintaining existing rolling stock, but then after the Indians left, it returned back to the original state of disrepair and inefficiency. Now we have spent a fortune buying trains again, but will they be maintained once the Chinese stop managing it?\u201d\n\nValue for money is not a completely Nigerian problem, argues Andrew Nevin, partner, Financial Services Lead and chief economist at PwC Nigeria. For Nevin, who has lived in Nigeria since 2008, \u201cpeople all over the world complain of waste. The concept of value for money is new\u201d. In the past, he further notes, \u201cgovernments did whatever they liked and citizens couldn\u2019t do much. Now this is changing, governments are asking for taxes and levies from citizens and citizens are asking for improvement in the provision of public goods such as education, health, water and electricity. Therefore, there needs to be clear signs that the government can deliver on projects.\u201d\n\nA major challenge he posits, \u201cis the multiplicity of MDAs in Nigeria.\u201d Most of these agencies, he argues, \u201cwere never created to deliver value. They were created for patronage during the oil boom days. Due to the many actors involved, and elongated decision-making process, they drive up the cost of value creation and drive down efficiency.\u201d\n\nNigerians, he urges, should keep putting pressure on governments in a constructive way. \u201cCitizens\u2019 action is no doubt having an effect on the government. We can see that with the programme and project deliveries of the governors of Lagos, Edo, Kaduna and now the election of a brilliant economist and highly competent manager in Anambra, Professor Charles Soludo. People should make their voices heard and choose the right leaders.\u201d",

          "text": "In the face of poor performance and huge overheads, fixing Nigeria\u2019s unprofitable refineries to functional capacity has remained the promise of every administration since 1999.\n\nAbuja has however piled up debt rather than embrace global examples on how to run a successful refinery, failing to curb an appetite for waste that has eaten the country\u2019s national budget for decades.\n\nNigeria\u2019s long history of wasteful spending on turnaround maintenance has continued with the present government, as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) spent close to N2 trillion on maintaining its struggling refineries from 2015 till 2021, a development that had not brought Nigeria any closer to ending imports of refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cInefficiency is the gift of the present administration, except that sometimes, this gift is in oversupply. Or how else can anyone explain all the expenses on the refineries without any due diligence or risk evaluation,\u201d a source familiar with the matter told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cIt would take more than another repair to cover the developing scandal that Nigeria\u2019s refineries have become,\u201d he said.\n\nA detailed breakdown shows Nigeria\u2019s four public refineries have been a drain on the finances of Africa\u2019s biggest economy, as NNPC data showed Nigeria spent N82.82 billion on maintenance in 2015.\n\nRead also: NNPC to take delivery of 2.3bn litres of PMS\n\nEven though the spending has been futile, the wasteful pattern continued in the remaining three years of President Buhari\u2019s first reign as the state-run energy company, NNPC, spent N78.95 billion, N604.127 billion and N426.66 billion in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, on the refineries.\n\nIn 2019, NNPC records showed the amount expended on the refineries dropped to N218.18 billion. The NNPC also declared that N64.534 billion was spent on the three refining companies from January to June 2020.\n\nThe NNPC spent N100 billion on the rehabilitation of the nation\u2019s refineries in 2021.\n\nIn its latest presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting seen by BusinessDay, NNPC said it spent N100 billion on the rehabilitation of the nation\u2019s refineries in 2021.\n\nAccording to the state oil firm, the fund was used to revamp the facilities throughout the year.\n\nAlthough the specific refineries were not stated, according to the funding report, NNPC said it spent N8.3 billion every month in 2021 to revamp the refineries.\n\nThe situation in Nigeria has become even more worrisome after the first-ever audited report of NNPC showed that Nigeria\u2019s four refineries gulped a combined loss of N154.54 billion in 2018 compared to N252 billion in 2017.\n\nAccording to advocates of fixing the refineries, the government\u2019s main argument is that if the refineries are sold in their current state, they\u2019ll be flogged for less than their scrap value.\n\n\u201cRefineries are one of the most complex facilities to run, they are capital, technology and management intensive operations, yet low margin,\u201d Olagoke Balogun, former processor operator at Chevron with 13 years experience in the refining business, said.\n\nBalogun noted, \u201cAside from corruption, the Nigerian state is grossly incompetent to run such complex operations even if they wanted to.\u201d\n\nIn a world where global private refiners with stronger and more efficient systems are struggling to break even, most experts are in awe of President Buhari\u2019s decision to shell out $1.5-billion to flog the dying Port Harcourt refinery horse, before, according to the new plan, handing them over to private companies to manage\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s economic managers seemed obsessed with maintaining its refineries; Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s equivalent of the NNPC, decided that the smart thing to do was to sell off the refinery\u2019s assets and cut its loss.\n\nIn a competitive global bid, Mubadala, Abu Dhabi\u2019s state-owned investment fund offered to buy Petrobras\u2019s 333,000bpd Landulpho Alves refinery for $1.8billion, a value higher than what the Nigerian government intends to invest in a rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt refinery guaranteed to produce a worse outcome.\n\nAccording to some reports, the company could realise about $25billion-$35billion from the sale of its non-core assets in the next four years.\n\n\u201cWhich means, by re-evaluating its assets, Brazil could get in four years what Nigeria used in 30 to fix its own rickety assets,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, a former chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), said.\n\nWhile the development in Brazil serves as a lesson for how Nigeria efficiently manages its refineries, the echoes from Zambia serves as warning.\n\nAt their peak, Zambia\u2019s copper mines produced 12 percent of the world\u2019s copper. They were the pride of Zambia and the glory of southern Africa.\n\nHowever, a combination of steep crashes in commodity prices, global politics, internal incompetence and mismanagement, some of which are present in today\u2019s Nigerian refineries put the future of the mines in grave danger.\n\nIn response to the economic crisis facing Zambia in the 90\u2019s, President Frederick Chiluba was offered $165million by foregin investors to buy Konkola Copper Mines (KCM), the country\u2019s largest mining facility.\n\nPresident Chiluba haggled for nine years. When the price of copper finally collapsed in 2000, the best he could get for KCM was $90 million.",

At the time that we started this fight in June 2020, we had just about 14 States that had domesticated the VAPP Law. A year and half later, as we speak today we have about 32 States that have come to the point of domestication, some waiting for assent.\n\n\u201cThis was all as a result of one attempt at cooperating to fight a common enemy.

          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nWhen the online lenders such as Fairmoney, Quick Check and other online lending application sites came on board a couple of years ago, many Nigerians were happy that finally they could access loans within less than 30 minutes to meet their needs.\n\nActually the new online lenders came in handy as many Nigerians in need of quick loans are now able to access the loans without much ado, unlike the hassle and possible rejection of their applications and tough requirements demanded of them by conventional commercial banks.\n\nIn recent years, the Nigerian fintech space is making wave, blossoming exponentially, and at the same time drawing the attention of both foreign and local investors and drawing new entrants into the diverse sub-sectors within the ecosystem.\n\nA good number of them such as Fairmoney, Renmoney and others have made good offering uncollateralized loan facilities to Nigerians albeit at eye-popping interest rates.\n\nOn this point of interest rates, it would look as if some have met and agreed to come down hard on defaulters, resorting to unbelievably desperate measures to recover loan facilities obtained from their apps.\n\nFindings made by Business Hallmark have revealed that a great number of the loan app operators now send embarrassing short messages service (SMS) and WhatsApp messages to the close contacts of their loan defaulters with the intention of shaming the defaulters, tagging them with terms like \u2018criminal,\u2019 \u2018fraudster,\u2019 and \u2018terrible debtor\u2019 among others.\n\nIn some cases, the full names, phone numbers and pictures of the alleged loan defaulters are shared with their contacts like religious leaders, members of churches and mosques, close friends, bosses, colleagues and family members.\n\nBut the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has described the debt recovery strategy adopted by some of these fintechs as a data-sharing breach.\n\nBusinessHallmark investigations showed that the agency does not support such \u201cambushed tactic of debt recovery\u201d and emphasized that no fintech firm is allowed to share its customers\u2019 data without due process.\n\nThis was made known in a press release last year by NITDA\u2019s spokesperson, Hadiza Umah.\n\nTo curb the trend, NITDA imposed a sanction of N10 million on an online lending platform, Soko Lending Company Limited (Sokoloan), for data privacy invasion.\n\nAccording to NITDA, it received a series of complaints against the company, including \u2018unauthorized disclosures, failure to protect customers\u2019 personal data, and defamation of character.\n\nIn view of the fact that majority of these online lenders charge high interest rates and expect their loan beneficiaries to pay back within shortest time, some seven days, or 14 days the maximum tenure is one month, many desirous of accessing loans for one reason or the other are now wary of approaching online lenders.\n\nAdegoke Sanmi, a mechanic said \u201cI will not go to them for loan again. I approached one of them last year for a loan of N10,000 to be paid back in seven days. On that date, when I was making frantic efforts to repay the loans, I started receiving calls from people in my contacts that an online lender sent them text messages that I\u2019m a chronic debtor and criminal.\u201d\n\nMany people who have been victims of such crude tactic of debt recovery told this medium that they prefer to join contribution groups instead of these online lenders.\n\nIn view of the unwholesome experiences of Nigerians in the hands of online lenders, the arrival of a Nigerian startup, Earnipay, which has raised $4 million to provide on-demand salary to workers would be a refreshing new dawn. But only salaries earners can benefit from the scheme.\n\nEarnipay is a financial technology solution that gives on-demand salary access to income-earners, it announced last Friday it landed a seed deal of l $4 million to scale its operation in Africa.\n\nMaking the disclosure was Maria Adediran, Earnipay\u2019s accounts director, in a statement to the media, seen by BusinessHallmark.\n\nFounded in 2021 by Nonso Onwuzulike, Earnipay officially launched operations in January with less fanfare.\n\nAt the launch, the Fintech company said its aim is to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being by partnering with employers and seamlessly integrating with their payroll systems to offer its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app on any day of the month.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the month, the employer deducts from the employee\u2019s salary the amount withdrawn, refunds Earnipay with it, then pays the employee the balance as their salary for that month,\u201d the firm said.\n\n\u201cEarnipay charges employees a small processing fee of N250 or N500 for this access. There is no payback and no interest charge because employees are accessing what they have worked for, it\u2019s their money,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAccording to Earnipay, the funding round was led by Canaan, with participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital and Paystack.\n\nAccording to the company, with the seed funding, Earnipay will accelerate the development of its technology platform to serve large enterprise employers. By doing so, Earnipay will provide employees with the tools they need to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nThe company says it would offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees by the end of 2022.\n\nSpeaking on the funding round, the CEO Nonso Onwuzulike, said \u201cFinancial worries are the leading cause of distractions in the workplace. The monthly pay cycle means employees are often unable to afford daily expenses, cover emergencies or take advantage of immediate financial opportunities.\n\n\u201cAs a result, they become exposed to predatory payday loans and get stuck in unending debt cycles with unrealistic payback periods and expensive interest rates.\n\n\u201cEarnipay exists to address this problem and offer an ethical alternative to instant salary access while helping employers improve employee engagement and retention at zero cost to their business.\n\n\u201cThe future of salary is on-demand, and we\u2019re excited to be pioneering this amazing solution in Africa. I\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected investors who understand the need for a platform such as Earnipay to drive better access to salaries, and, importantly, to improve the financial well-being of income-earners in Africa,\u201d Mr. Onwuzulike said.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "Controversy trails Nigeria\u2019s 3.4% GDP growth \u2013 The growth is questionable \u2014Experts",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThe report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which put Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2021 at 3.4 percent, has sparked controversy, with economists arguing that the said growth could be linked to the base effects of the recession witnessed in 2020.\n\nThe GDP report released on Thursday also showed that the economy weakened further in the fourth quarter of 2021, after recording a decline in the third quarter of last year.\n\nSpecifically, the report revealed that the quarterly GDP growth fell to 3.98 per cent in Q4 2021, from the 4.03 per cent and 5.01 per cent recorded in Q3 and Q2, respectively.\n\nThe annual growth rate of 3.4 per cent is the highest the country has recorded in seven years. The last time the country\u2019s annual GDP growth rate exceeded three per cent was in 2014, when a 6.22 per cent growth was recorded.\n\nIn 2015, annual GDP stood at 2.7 per cent; it contracted to -1.58 per cent in 2016; rebounded slightly to 0.8 per cent in 2017; grew to 1.91 per cent in 2018 and 2.27 per cent in 2019. Due to the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic, the country\u2019s annual with GDP again contracted to -1.92 per cent 2020.\n\nThe World Bank had in the latest edition of its Nigeria Development Update in November raised its 2021 and 2022 economic growth forecasts for Nigeria to 2.7 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively, saying the economy had experienced a rebound that was faster than expected. In the June 2021 edition of the NDU, the Bretton Wood institution projected a growth rate of 1.8 per cent in 2021 and 2.1 per cent in 2022.\n\nEarlier in April, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had in the reviewed 2021 World Economic Outlook raised Nigeria\u2019s 2021 growth projection to 2.5 per cent, a figure 1.5 percent point higher than January\u2019s estimate and much higher than the 0.8 per cent forecast in October 2020.\n\nThe latest NBS report read in part, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 3.98 per cent (year-on-year) in real terms in the fourth quarter of 2021, showing a sustained positive growth for the fifth quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020 when output contracted by -6.10 per cent and -3.62 per cent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter growth indicates a steady economic recovery accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 per cent in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Q4 2021 growth rate was higher than the 0.11 per cent growth rate recorded in Q4 2020 by 3.87 per cent points and lower than 4.03 per cent recorded in Q3 2021 by 0.05 per cent points.\n\n\u2018Questionable growth\u2019\n\nSpeaking with Business Hallmark, Prof Leo Ukpong of the Department of Economics, University of Uyo, described the growth figure released by the NBS as questionable.\n\n\u201cWell, if the figures are true, it is a good thing, considering that the economy is still recovering from the shocks of Covid-19 and oil price crash.\n\n\u201cHowever, when you look at the level of unemployment, rate of inflation among other issues, you begin to wonder where the growth is coming from.\u201d\n\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer of Centre for The Promotion of Private Enterprises (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, in an interview with Business Hallmark, noted that the recent GDP numbers are indicative of a gradual recovery of the economy.\n\nHe observed that that the full year GDP growth of 3.4% and the fourth quarter GDP growth of 3.98%, surpassed both IMF and World Bank projections of 2.6% and 2.7% respectively.\n\nAccording to him, the positive growth outcomes were driven by a strong base effect and the easing of shocks of the pandemic on the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe base year (2020) was characterized by devastating shocks of the Covid 19 pandemic. There was a collapse of commodity prices, supply chains were disrupted, travels were restricted and many sectors were on complete lockdown.\n\n\u201cBut in 2021, we saw a rebound of oil prices, relaxation of travel restrictions, improvements in vaccination rates, lifting of lockdowns and economic stimulus programmes by government.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter typically witnessed increased spending and heightened tempo of economic activities because of the end of year festivities. These were the critical drivers of the growth.\n\n\u201cHowever, GDP growth is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. For growth to be meaningful, it must impact on citizens welfare, create jobs, alleviate poverty, reduce inequality, ensure prosperity of small businesses and promote inclusion.\n\n\u201cEconomic performance on the score of these metrics has been suboptimal. Galloping inflation and the sharp depreciation of the currency had inflicted immeasurable shocks on business performance and the welfare of citizens. Citizens\u2019 purchasing power was considerably eroded thus aggravating poverty.\n\n\u201cWhile we welcome the positive growth numbers, we reckon that there is still a great deal of work to be done to translate the growth to improved welfare and prosperity of small businesses. This would require a mix of fiscal, monetary and social policy interventions.\u201d\n\nIn a similar view, the Executive Vice Chairman, HighCap Securities, Mr. David Adonri, observed that the figures surpassed projections by both analysts and international organisations like the World Bank and IMF.\n\nHe, however, argued that the growth figures as released by the NBS may simply be as a result of base effect, since it is coming just after a year of terrible economic inactivity.\n\n\u201cHowever, you know that 2020 was so bad with the pandemic, high unemployment, high inflation and crashed oil prices\u201d, Adonri said.\n\n\u201cSo, the growth they\u2019re talking about is mainly as a result of what we call base effect. What that means is that since 2020 was so bad and down, anything recorded subsequently will be so magnified. So, that growth doesn\u2019t mean much to me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have exchanged verbal blows over the report. In an interview with a national daily on Thursday, National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr. Debo Ologunagba, said Nigeria\u2019s economy could not have witnessed growth because of the voodoo economics being implemented by President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government.\n\nThe PDP spokesman, who wondered how Nigeria could have witnessed economic growth with the high level of insecurity and unemployment, said the All Progressives Congress (APC) was running a government of liars, by liars and for liars.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is the voodoo economics of Buhari. When you talk of economic growth it must have a direct impact on the lives of the people. If it is growth, it cannot grow downwards, growth goes upwards. We all know the economy of Nigeria has been going dow.\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey say there was economic growth in the last quarter of last year when there were massive killings in the North-West? Growth has to do with production and human development index. So, what is the basis of this growth? We don\u2019t have the right statistics.\u201d\n\nOlogungba said the NBS could have been deceived at the point of the collation of data which is usually provided by the federal government.\n\nResponding to the PDO, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said it was unfortunate that the opposition party was sad over Nigeria\u2019s progress.\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cA vibrant opposition is important in any democracy. However, we have an opposition that doesn\u2019t want to hear anything good about the country and this administration. It is the same NBS that reported that the country was in recession. At that time, it was not fake or cooked.\n\n\u201cSo, I think we should learn to believe in the country, we should understand that while opposition is very good for a vibrant democracy, a nihilistic opposition that sees nothing good in the administration should be condemned.\u201d\n\nOn why many Nigerians were not yet feeling the impact of economic growth, Mohammed said economic recovery is a slow process like a human being getting cured of an ailment, adding that more Nigerians will feel the impact of the government\u2019s policy in due course.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Monday, struck out a suit seeking the disqualification of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, from contesting the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe suit, marked FHC/ABJ/CS/177, challenged Atiku\u2019s eligibility on the premise that he is not a Nigerian by birth.\n\nRecall that the subject of Atiku\u2019s citizenship came shortly after the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, claimed that the former VP was \u2018Cameroonian\u2019 in the build-up to the 2019 elections.\n\nSubsequently, a group under the aegis of the Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa (EMN) in the suit, urged the court to determine; \u201cWhether section 25 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), is the sole authority that spells out ways by which a person can become a Nigerian citizen by birth?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhether by the provisions of section 131(a) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), only a Nigeria citizen by birth can contest for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria?\u201d\n\nThe group also joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Attorney-general of the Federation as respondents in the case.\n\nThe Adamawa State government, through its Attorney-General (AG), had on July 27, 2021, sought an order of the court to be joined in the suit. The state government told the court that Atiku was eligible to vie for the office of the president.\n\nDelivering judgement on the case, Justice Inyang Ekwo struck out the suit for want of merit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJustice Ekwo held that since the plaintiff lacked the locus standi, the court, therefore, did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the case.",

They will tell us why they called. I don\u2019t know what they plan to tell us, we will meet them within the week,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told Nigerians to \u201cAppeal to the government to implement the agreement we signed with them. The strike can be called off any day, it is in the government\u2019s hand if they want it to last for a week, two weeks, one month, a year, or more. It is the government that will decide when they want the strike to end. Our position is that they should agree and implement what they signed with us. If they are responsive, it doesn\u2019t need to last for weeks. We have given them one month to react.\u201d\n\nAlso, the ASUU Chairman, Federal University, Dutsin-ma, Dr Jibrin Shagari, in an interview with The PUNCH, confirmed that the union\u2019s NEC members will converge on Abuja on Monday night.\n\nShagari said, \u201cYes, I can confirm that our national officers will be in Abuja on Monday night where they will meet and later meet the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nASUU rules out confidence in FG as meeting holds\n\nMeanwhile, union members still do not believe that the government is ready to meet their demands.\n\nThe Chairman, ASUU, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Dr Gbenga Adeleye, insisted that the union would not call off the strike if their demands were not met.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are on strike. If they don\u2019t do what they are supposed to do, we are not going to call off the strike.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing about whether we are confident or not confident.\n\n\u201cIt is for them to meet our demands, if they are not meeting our demands, we are not calling off the strike.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of ASUU at the University of Ibadan, Prof. Ayo Akinwole, in a statement on Sunday, said, so far, those in charge of the Ministry of Education had displayed gross incompetence and lack the interests of the masses.\n\nAkinwole described the FG as a slave merchant, who only listened and implemented he destructive policy recommendations of the International Monetary fund and World Bank against the larger interest of Nigerians.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Federal Government lacks integrity. It is sad. The government cannot be trusted any longer. We have been on the same salary for 13 years and it is even shameful to show anyone your payslip.\n\n\u201cWhen compared to the work we do, we have sacrificed for Nigeria to the detriment of our wellbeing and this is already dampening the morale of our people.\n\n\u201cFederal Government should sign the renegotiated agreement, implement it, roll out UTAS, pay unpaid earned academic allowances, commit more funds into the revitalisation of universities.\n\n\u201cParents should impress it on the government to sign the new welfare package for our members. If we fail to fight for our rights, the slave merchants in government will continue to trade with our future and future of the children of the masses.\u201d",

          "text": "There is palpable fear and tension in the oil and gas sector as security agencies commenced investigation into the importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol into the country.\n\nThis is not unconnected with the findings of the investigation by security agencies, a source conversant with the probe told Blueprint in Abuja weekend.\n\nThe Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited had admitted that four PMS cargoes imported by four consortia under the Direct Sale of Crude Oil and Direct Purchase of Petroleum (DSDP) programme were adulterated.\n\nThe importers are; MRS which imported through vessel MT Bow Pioneer and loaded at Litasco Terminal; Antwerp-Belgium, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, which used vessel MT Tom Hilde and loaded from the same terminal; Oando loaded through MT Elka Apollon from the same terminal; as well as NNPC\u2019s subsidiary, Duke Oil, which used MT Nord Gainer and also loaded the vessel from the same terminal.\n\nBlueprint learnt that a loophole in the system was exploited to get the cargoes identified to contain dangerous levels of methanol, used to blend PMS into the country.\n\nThe discovery of the contaminated petroleum product, which has cost the country several billions in losses, has seen acute fuel shortages and long queues in Abuja, Lagos and most parts of the country.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the NNPC and its subsidiaries have been running helter-skelter to mop up the dirty petrol as well as restock filling stations.\n\nAcross the country, some motorists have complained of damages to their cars with civil society organisations threatening protests against the NNPC leadership as well as the affected companies.\n\nBuhari\u2019s order\n\nIn response to public outcry over what some in security circles have described as economic sabotage, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered that producers and providers of the bad product be held accountable and nobody should be spared.\n\nA press statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, reads in part: \u201cIn a reaction to the issue of petroleum product shortages linked to the inadvertent supply of products of foreign origin into the Nigerian market, President Buhari said the protection of consumer interests is a priority of the present administration and is ready to take all necessary measures to protect consumers from hazardous products, loss or injuries from the consumption of substandard goods.\n\n\u201cThe President directed that in line with the law, service providers must make full disclosure of relevant information with respect to consumption of their products and that dissatisfied consumers are entitled to a proper redress of their complaints.\u201d\n\nSecurity checks\n\nBlueprint reports that in line with the presidential directive, security agencies had since commenced investigation into the circumstances and are expected to make their findings known within a two-week timeframe.\n\nAccording to a source in one of the security agencies who asked not to be named as he was not permitted to speak, \u201cfindings of the probe indicate that heads would roll. The order by the president is clear. He said it should be investigated and that has put all security agencies on their toes.\n\n\u201cThe agencies are on top of the matter and investigation has been up and all involved parties, individuals and corporate companies were invited and they made useful revelations. They have answered questions and provided information on what may have gone wrong.\n\n\u201cThe major players have been told they can be invited over and over as fresh facts emerge in the course of the investigation. Not too long from now, Nigerians will see decisive action on this embarrassing situation.\u201d\n\nOn which agencies are involved in the investigation and which was leading the investigation, the source said: \u201cThe investigation falls directly within the mandate, role and functions of the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\n\u201cThey are saddled with the responsibility of, among others, prevention, detection of economic crimes of national security dimension; as well as provision of timely advice on all matters of national security interest.\u201d\n\nHowever, a source in the NNPC disclosed to Blueprint that the management of the corporation, which actually raised the alarm of the contaminated PMS, was in support of the investigation as their own findings uncovered the involvement of third parties.\n\nAccording to the official, who asked not to be named, the probe was getting complicated and technical, especially with the establishment of third party involvement in the supply of the bad products.\n\nAccording to the source, a particular company (name withheld) that has been trying to absolve itself of blame was found to have got its supply from BP, which was discovered to have got its supply from other sources as well.\n\nThis, the source said, had created room for blame trading.\n\nIn a bid to forestall any legal complications from the outcome of the probe, the source said technical assistance had been provided for the investigating agencies.\n\nThe source further disclosed that invitation and interrogation of some companies with DCDP was being delayed to avoid disruption of supply of products as the NNPC was committed to ensuring complete disappearance of fuel queues.\n\nCSOs express angst\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern Coalition Forum (NCF) has called for the resignation of NNPC Group Managing Director Mele Kyari and CEO Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Engr. Farouk Ahmed over importation of methanol adulterated fuel into Nigeria.\n\nThe forum, a coalition of 26 civil society organisations in Northern Nigeria under the aegis of Coalition of Concerned Northern Forum(CCNF), also urged the immediate sack of all NNPC management staff, punitive measure against the importers of the adulterated fuel, and adequate compensations for owners of vehicles, generators and machines damaged by the fuel, which has caused extended fuel scarcity across the country.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by leaders of the groups, Malam Ibrahim Bature and Comrade Abdulsalam Moh\u2019d Kazeem, they said: \u201cWe condemn in totality the current persistent scarcity of petroleum products across the nation, the scarcity is aimed at embarrassing the current administration by its enemies and unpatriotic elements from within.\n\n\u201cSince 2015 till date, we have over two GMD\u2019s, to our greatest surprise as progressives all the past GMDs of NNPC including Mr Ibe Kachikwu have helped the current administration greatly, in ensuring that all petroleum products meet our nation\u2019s required standard and also ensured no scarcity and fuel queues in our filling stations even during festive periods.\n\n\u201cThe current administration has spent over six years without fuel scarcity and queues in our filling stations, the same administration has less than two years to go, but strangely, fuel scarcity has surfaced due to importation of an adulterated PMS, which has never happened in the history of our country, pointing towards discrediting the record of Mr President and minister of petroleum.\n\n\u201cNNPC\u2019s quality inspection unit which comprises of GMO, SGS, Geochem and G&G did not conduct any test before the said products were discharged, the above units are saddled with the responsibilities of ensuring that the products are not above our required standard, yet the same unit has up till date equipment at her disposal with adequate funding for such tasks.\n\n\u201cNNPC management should make public genuine and comprehensive names of those involved in this national scandal and embarrassment. If our demands are not met in the next three working days, we shall occupy all NNPC zonal offices and its subsidiaries across our region and the FCT. We will follow up with full action after the expiration of our ultimatum and this will serve as litmus test for government\u2019s fight against corruption and indiscipline,\u201d the statement further said.",
          "summary": "There is palpable fear and tension in the oil and gas sector as security agencies commenced investigation into the importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol into the country.\nThis is not unconnected with the findings of the investigation by security agencies, a source conversant with the probe told Blueprint in Abuja weekend.\nAccording to a source in one of the security agencies who asked not to be named as he was not permitted to speak, \u201cfindings of the probe indicate that heads would roll.\nHe said it should be investigated and that has put all security agencies on their toes.\nAccording to the official, who asked not to be named, the probe was getting complicated and technical, especially with the establishment of third party involvement in the supply of the bad products.",

          "text": "Ahead of the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) scheduled for Saturday, the serving governors and other major critical stakeholders have narrowed the contest to four leading aspirants from the North-central.\n\nBlueprint also gathered that the names of the four shortlisted aspirants have been forwarded to President Muhammadu Buhari to make his choice.\n\nThis is coming amid uncertainty surrounding the February 26, 2022 date announced by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nInvestigations revealed in Abuja Sunday that some party stakeholders had perfected plan to sell to Mr President, an idea of holding congresses in the zones where zonal leaders would emerge before the national convention.\n\nAn APC chieftain who confided in one of our correspondents said the proponents of such idea believed a strong reason must be advanced to convince the president on why February 26 date for the national convention is not feasible.\n\nThe source said: \u201cRemember the party conducted congresses at Ward, Local Government and up to state level. Therefore, the zonal leaders should also emerge before the national convention. It is a logical thing. Again this will reduce the level of acrimony among our members.\u201d\n\nBlueprint had reported that the party was yet to sell the nomination forms to the aspirants, yet to inaugurate all the committees for the national convention and also speak on the zoning formula.\n\nFurther to this, the aspirants are yet to be screened by the appropriate committee to be saddled with such responsibility.\n\nPut together, another party source said, \u201cIn a matter of days, the Buni committee may have to announce a change in the convention date. This is most probable when one looks at all of these things that are not yet in place.\u201d\n\nAspirants\n\nThe lucky aspirants, though not in particular order include; Senator Mohammed Sani Musa from Niger state, Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura from Nasarawa state, Mallam Saliu Mustapha from Kwara state and ex-Governor George Akume from Benue state.\n\nBut apart from the quartet, there are about ten others from the North-east and North-west jostling to lead the APC in same capacity.\n\nAl-makura\n\nSimilarly, Al-makura is a lawmaker and two-term governor of Nasarawa state. Born in 1952, he was the only Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) governor President Buhari had in his kitty during the merger negotiation that produced the ruling APC in 2014.\n\nIn 1980, Al-makura emerged the youth leader of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in the old Plateau state. He was elected into the Constituent Assembly of 1988\u201389 representing the Lafia\u2013Obi Federal Constituency of what is now Nasarawa state.\n\nThe politician was also the state secretary of the National Republican Convention (NRC) in the old Plateau state from 1990 to 1992.\n\nAs a close political ally to the president, stakeholders are of the view that he may be considered for the party\u2019s top job.\n\nMusa\n\nThe lawmaker currently represents Niger East in the National Assembly. Born in 1965, Musa has been in politics for the better part of his adult years having also come from a family of politicians\n\nAs chairman of Activate Technologies Limited between 2011 and 2017, he coordinated the design, planning, production and delivery of Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and Smart Card Readers (SCR) which the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) deployed for the 2015 and 2019 general elections.\n\nMusa is also the chairman of the all-important Senate Services Committee and also a member of eight other committees in the upper chamber.\n\nThe lawmaker has sponsored about 12 bills including the National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill, 2021; FCT Borderline Community Development Commission Bill, 2021 and the Critical Infrastructure Protection Bill, 2021 among others.\n\nThough rumoured to have some governors\u2019 support, it is not however sure if the presidency would be favourably disposed to his candidature.\n\nMustapha\n\nMustapha, considered by many as a bridge between the old and the young, is a native of Ilorin, Kwara state. Born in 1972, the Turaki of Ilorin started his political career in the early 21st century when he became the first national publicity secretary of the Progressive Action Congress (PAC), a defunct political party that contested in the 2003 presidential election.\n\nMustapha became a member of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) during which he was committed to Buhari\u2019s presidential ambition.\n\nIn 2009, when a breakaway faction of the ANPP, led by Buhari, formed the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Mustapha became the deputy national chairman of the party. He held this position until the party merged with other amalgams to form the APC.\n\nConsidering his wealth of experience in party administration coupled with his loyalty to Buhari since their days in the ANPP till date, the Kwara born politician, it is believed, may ultimately emerge the party leader.\n\nAbove all, observers believe, President Buhari\u2019s recent statement that youth be given prominent roles within the party and administration may also work in Mustapha\u2019s favour.\n\nAkume\n\nAkume is a former Benue state governor and current Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs.\n\nBorn in 1953, Akume became governor in 1999 and served out two terms of four years each.\n\nThe former governor later won another election to represent his people in Nigeria\u2019s Senate. He was the Minority Leader of the Senate from June 2011 to June 2015.\n\nHe was re-elected Senator for Benue North-west in the April 2011 elections, running on the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) platform, during which he was chairman Senate committee on Army.\n\nIn this contest for the position of the national chairmanship, Akume is seen in some quarters as the most experienced with home-based support, reach across the country and the only Christian on the list.\n\nForum cautions on Al-makura\n\nMeanwhile, the Progressive Disability Forum(PDF), the disability wing of the APC, has warned against using the \u2018disability\u2019 condition of Al-makura as a basis to disqualify him from the party\u2019s chairmanship race.\n\nThe forum, in a letter signed by its national coordinator, Abdulaziz Onibare and addressed to President Buhari, stated that the party would be in contravention of the National Disability Act and its constitution if such move succeeded.\n\n\u201cIt has come to our notice that some groups of people are moving around castigating the person of His Excellency, Senator Umaru Tanko Al makura, questioning his capacity on the basis of his disability. They didn\u2019t question his capacity when he was contributing his millions, time and energy for the progress of the party,\u201d it said.\n\nThe group said the lawmaker\u2019s disability should not be a yardstick to measure his competence to lead the party, stating that he had paid his dues as a true party man.\n\nTo this end, the forum said, the former governor should be given the opportunity to lead APC to a resounding victory during the 2023 elections, and pleaded that its members\u2019 contribution to the party should not to be allowed to go in vain.\n\nIt lamented that the leadership of the party had continued to marginalise the group as it has never held any tangible positions, adding that: \u201cWe should be given the opportunity to lead this party, and our disability cannot be counted as a barrier. Hence, we felt it a point of duty to emphasize it.\u201d\n\nClamour for youth\n\nIn a related development, the Coalition For Democracy and Credible Election (CODECE) has urged the party to elect a youth as its next national chairman to reflect Buhari\u2019s words on youths.\n\nThis appeal was contained in a letter titled;\u201d Our Utmost Advise(sic) on the Most Suitable Candidate\u201d and signed by the group\u2019s national coordinator, Amb. Mohammed Atta.\n\n\u201cWith due honor and respect, we write to convey the mood of the nation to you as the election year draws nearer, and the All Progressives Congress (APC)\u2019s National Convention slated for February 26, 2022 is few days away.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is on good record that your Excellency had in the last six (6) years given more recognition, opportunities and support to the youths of Nigeria more than any leader before you. This much, you recently demonstrated when you directed the office of the Secretary to the Government of the federation (SGF), Ministers and Heads of Agencies to give consideration for the appointment of youths into public service,\u201d they said.\n\nThe letter further reads: \u201cTo re-echo your commitment to integrity, rule of law and fairness which you stand for, we strongly believe electing youths into political positions is the ultimate goal your administration will aim at\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest legacies you have lived for is integrity. Therefore, the choice of the next APC chairman should reflect your words, with the election of a young, energetic and vibrant Nigerian, with public trust and unquestionable character.\u201d\n\n",

It is therefore not a time to query anyone but a time to come together to salvage the plight of the average Nigerian.\n\n\u201cAfter the storm settles there will be time enough to investigate and get to the bottom so that this does not repeat itself.\n\n\u201cMr. President\u2019s charge to all parties and agencies concerned is to work together to ensure that normalcy returns quickly\u2019, the statement added.\n\nHe said that Nigerians deserve the best and President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government is determined to set the country on the right path of petroleum products availability and sustainability as demonstrated in the award of the contracts for the rehabilitation of all our refineries and the acquisition of a stake in the Dangote Refinery.\n\n\u201cLet us as Nigerians stand shoulder to shoulder in our shared quest for a greater country,\u201d he noted.",
          "summary": "The Federal Government has admitted that the fuel scarcity was not because of the absence of supply of products but due to inspection failure, which allowed adulterated products into the country.\n\u201cThe Federal Government sympathizes with the citizenry over the unforeseen hardship, occasioned by the inevitable scarcity.\nLet me once again appeal to Nigerians to be patient with the government in finding lasting solutions to the crisis.\n\u201cWe appreciate the NNPC for showing so much concern to the plight of Nigerians by coming forward with an apology.\n\u201cLet us as Nigerians stand shoulder to shoulder in our shared quest for a greater country,\u201d he noted.",

          "text": "The Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has described the recent killing at the newly relocated Omuma-Uzo Cattle Market/ Abattoir in Ukwa West as unfortunate but vowed that the perpetrators will be punished.\n\nHe stated this at the Governor\u2019s Lodge, Aba while receiving leaders of the Hausa Community from Gombe and Adamawa states.\n\n\u201cThis administration takes issues of peace and harmony very seriously because there cannot be any form of sustainable development in an insecure environment,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cI want to let you know that I recognise the need for peaceful co-existence between Abians and those who have come to transact legitimate business in the state, and am assuring you that the security chiefs in the state are working tirelessly to fish out the perpetrators of that ugly incident, who will not go unpunished\u201d.\n\nThe governor, who commiserated with them especially the families of those who died in the sad incident, hinted that setting up a conflict resolution committee was to help in resolving the conflicts between herdsmen and farmers. He said the state government pays some compensation to either the farmer or herdsmen who lose their crops or cattle after a proper assessment of the situation.\n\nAccording to him, the government will support the families of those who lost their lives during the attack and pay the medical bills of the injured. Ikpeazu also assured that those whose cows and goats were killed will be assisted to help them carry on with their businesses. He noted that the attack affected not just Hausas but Igbos, faulting the impression that only Hausas were in the business of selling.\n\nThe governor equally regretted the increasing level of insecurity in the country, lamenting that lives no longer mean anything to some people. He, however, assured the Hausa Community to live in the state without fear as his administration will protect their lives and property.\n\nThe Chairman, Hausa Cattle Market, Ibrahim Njidda, who also spoke at the event, recalled the cordial relationship Governor Ikpeazu shares with them in the state but regretted the recent incident. He appealed to the governor to assist them, consider getting them an alternative location for their trade and provide adequate security for them.",

          "text": "Two separate groups, The Mass Interest Project (TMIP)and The Youth For Transparency Initiative (TYTI) have called on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to contest for the 2023 Presidency.\n\nThe Mass Interest Project, has urged Emefiele, to throw his hat in the ring and contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn a statement, titled, \u201dThe Charge 2023\u201d, issued weekend, TMIP, said the country\u2019s next president should be an experienced entrepreneur and or a business leader, adding that the person the cap best fits to take over the mantle of leadership in the country was no other than the CBN governor.\n\nOn his part, President, TYTI, Koko Umar, in a statement yesterday, in Kaduna,said the CBN governor was one of the great Nigerians who had demonstrated competence and capacity in public service and should be trusted with the leadership of the country.\n\nThe group said, as the governor of the CBN, Emefiele has made tremendous achievements that qualifies him to run for the presidency in 2023.\n\n\u201cOne of the great Nigerians who has contributed to the development of country is the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Godwin Emefiele,\u201d the group said.\n\nAccording to TMIP, \u201dAs expected, there is already tension across the country. From East to West, North to South, Nigerians are beginning to feel the heat as the political gladiators go on the hustings, perfecting their art to play the game to know how tom play with ruthless efficiency.\n\n\u201dThese are men and some women who are well versed in political deception, intimidation, blackmail and are also experts in the arts of violence which they readily deploy to exact vengeance or force compliance to their will and desire.\n\n\u201dThey are also adept at making promises they cannot keep or are not capable of supporting. They have been there from the beginning, from the First Republic, Second Republic, Third Republic, Fourth Republic and continued to rule the coast, even up to the present political dispensation.\n\n\u201dWe, the people, work to manifest the Nigeria of our hope on our way to greatness! We march, fiercely guarding the vision and liberty to build a Nigeria we believe in, not a career politicians but as citizens with an equal stake in this Republic.\n\n\u201dYes, we are on the march, in search of the next leader of our country. Behold we have found a man with a proven track record of loyalty, patriotism and understanding for sustainable development. A man, whose name connotes a date with destiny.\n\n\u201dGodwin Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele, would you lead our people on this march for a better Nigeria? Would you lead The Charge 2023?\n\nSimilarly, the TYTI maintained that since his appointment as CBN governor in 2014, Emefiele has been relentless in building a strong financial system to strengthen the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cHis unrelenting efforts at the apex bank has helped to navigate the Nigerian economy through turbulent economic challenges to growth and inclusiveness in policy development and implementation.\n\n\u201cUnder Emefiele the (CBN) is more people focused, as its policies and programmes are tailored towards supporting small businesses and job creation.\n\n\u201cUnder his leadership, the CBN introduced various interventions, which aimed at growing the economy, job creation and lifting people out of poverty.\n\n\u201cUnder him, the CBN introduced 37 intervention funds targeted at stimulating the economy and addressing the issue of unemployment.\n\n\u201cThrough the development finance initiatives, the bank granted N756.51 billion to 3,734,938 small holder farmers of which N120.24 billion was extended for the 2021 Wet Season to 627,051 farmers under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP)\u201d, the group enumerated.\n\nAccording to the group, this has revolutionised rice production in Nigeria, saving the country from spend over N356 billion annually on rice importation which had hitherto affected local production negatively.\n\n\u201cThe rice pyramid recently showcased in Abuja is a proof that we have broken the chains of rice importation,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement further noted Emefiele\u2019s achievements in implementation of the National Youth Investment Fund (NYIF), in which the CBN released N3.0 billion to 7,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,411 were individuals and 2,646 SMEs.\n\n\u201cIn the creative industry, N3.22 billion was disbursed to 356 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, software development, fashion, and IT verticals, under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI)\n\n\u201cAlso the CBN under the N1.0 trillion Real Sector Facility, released N923.41 billion to 251 real sector projects, of which 87 were in light manufacturing, 40 in agro based industry, 32 in services and 11 in mining.\n\nIn the health sector the CBN disbursed N98.41 billion for 103 health projects under the bank\u2019s Healthcare Sector Intervention Facility (HSIF).\n\n\u201cThese are just a few of the many achievements recorded by Emefiele the past seven years at the apex bank.\n\n\u201cHis significant support for the Nigerian economy through the use of intervention funds to boost growth is laudable.\n\n\u201cHe has proven himself to be a diligent and determined public servant whose track records will remain indelible in history.\n\n\u201cIt is for this that the TYTI wishes to passionately appeal to Emefiele to contest for the 2023 presidency.\u201d\n\nThe group appealed to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) present the best candidate for the 2023 Presidency, stressing that \u201cEmefiele is the best because he has demonstrated competence and capacity that qualifies him to be the President of Nigeria.\n\nAlthough the CBN governor has not openly declared interest to contest the 2023 presidential election, several groups have in the past few weeks, been clamouring for his declaration of interest in the race, saying the country was at a point technocrats needed to take over the reins of power and steer it out of its present predicament.\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna",

          "title": "Nigerian Airlines Hike Fares as Aviation Fuel Rises to N420 Per Litre",
          "text": "Less than 10 days after domestic airlines lamented that oil marketers have increased price of Jet A1 (aviation fuel) to N400 per litre, the price of the product has increased to N420 per litre in Lagos and N450 per litre at other airports outside Lagos and Abuja.\n\nThis has prompted domestic airlines to increase base fare to over N50, 000 per flight.\n\nTHISDAY learnt the price of aviation fuel increased to N420 per litre on Sunday, as against the N400 per litre it was on Thursday, without prior notice to the airlines.\n\nBut depending on the city where the airport is located, the price hovers around N420 and N450 per litre, especially in northern part of the country, where it is predicted that the price could rise to N500 per litre in few days.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that as the price is now subject to the exchange rate of the naira against the dollars, until when the country begins to refine the product locally.\n\n\u201cAs at today (Sunday), a litre of fuel goes for N420 in Lagos and it is between N430 and N450 in some northern states. The fact is that the price of the product may go higher as aviation fuel is scarce in the country.\n\n\u201cAbout three weeks ago, the product was scarce in all the airports in the country and this contributed to some of the delayed flights we experienced at that period. The government needs to arrest the situation before it goes out of hand,\u201d a source told THISDAY.\n\nDefending the increase in airfares, a spokesman of one of the major domestic airlines told THISDAY that the new fares were a response to the increase in the price of aviation fuel, the increase in the cost of handling rates by aviation handling companies and also the exchange rate.\n\nThe official said airlines had to increase fares in order to survive, insisting that without that, most of the airlines would not continue to operate in the next three months, adding that until now, airlines have been subsidizing the base fare.\n\n\u201cWe increase fare in reaction to the cost of aviation fuel, which is increasing daily without prior warning to airlines. We sell tickets at lower price but we airlift passengers at the new aviation fuel prices, which means we are incurring heavy losses. If we do not increase fares, many of us will not last three months.\n\n\u201cWe are batting with poor infrastructure, exchange rate depreciation, high price of aviation fuel and increase in the price of handing by aviation handling companies. If you go to market to buy to resell and find out that prices have suddenly gone up will you sell at the same old price? No! We are feeling the economic pinch together.\n\n\u201cWe should put the blame where it should be and these are forex, aviation fuel, which is biggest reason for the hike,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nBut reacting to the increased fares by airlines, the former CEO of Aero Contractors and former Managing Director of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Capt Ado Sanusi, condemned the decision of Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) to increase fares, saying that such decision was against free economy and against anti-trust laws.\n\n\u201cI am not against the increase in airfares in response to high cost of operation, increase in the price of aviation fuel, but AON cannot come out and fix prices of tickets. That is against the law and against free economy.\n\n\u201cEvery airline should look at its own costs and decide the fares. When you fix fares, some airlines will be affected negatively and it could lead to them going under because airlines have different financial models and so should fix their own fares,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother spokesman of one of the airlines, however, told THISDAY that AON did not fix fares for the airlines; rather, each airline recognising its operational challenges in terms of finance, decided to increase fares, disclosing that it was not every airline that pegged its base fare to N50, 000.\n\nAlso, a top official of AON told THISDAY that he was not aware that the association fixed fares for airlines, stressing that airlines fixed the fares by themselves.\n\nAccording to the operators, aviation fuel takes between 35 to 40 per cent of total cost of airlines and some of the stakeholders are concerned that some of the operators may be compelled to shut operations if the challenges in the sub-sector were no urgent intervention by government.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, the Chairman, United Nigeria Airlines (UNA), Dr. Obiora Okonkwo had raised the alarm that the price of aviation fuel rose by over 100 per cent in the last one year.\n\nHe had emphasised that the exchange rate had also depreciated from N340 to N570 to a dollar within the same period, stressing that it was pertinent for the government to look critically into the development of the industry in order to arrest collapse.\n\nChinedu Eze",
          "summary": "THISDAY learnt the price of aviation fuel increased to N420 per litre on Sunday, as against the N400 per litre it was on Thursday, without prior notice to the airlines.\nThe fact is that the price of the product may go higher as aviation fuel is scarce in the country.\n\u201cWe increase fare in reaction to the cost of aviation fuel, which is increasing daily without prior warning to airlines.\n\u201cWe are batting with poor infrastructure, exchange rate depreciation, high price of aviation fuel and increase in the price of handing by aviation handling companies.\n\u201cWe should put the blame where it should be and these are forex, aviation fuel, which is biggest reason for the hike,\u201d the spokesman said.",
