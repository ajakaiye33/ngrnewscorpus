When I contested as Governor in Anambra I did so in a small party. People told me that I had no structure. People are the structure. When I was a Governor in Anambra, my party had no state or federal lawmaker.\n\n\u201cWhen I left as Governor no state was financially stable as Anambra. We were not owing anybody. The people will decide who will rule them. Luckily we have eights months, let people come and tell you how they have started. Come and tell us, don\u2019t use people or glossy paper, tell us from your mouth so that we can hold you to account.\u201d\n\nThe national secretary of the Young Peoples Party( YPP) Hon. Vidiyano Bamaiyi, also said 75 percent of politicians in Nigeria are political bandits.\n\n\u201cPolitical bandits that have taken over Nigeria, most of them have no business being there. Political bandits and brigands have taken over the political space,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, Senator Albert Bassey said only through direct primaries will the country eliminate money politics saying \u201cgoing forward, Nigerians should vote for candidates and not party.\u201d",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nPresident Buhari, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said the victory was well-deserved considering his contributions to the development of the state and the party before his nomination as flag bearer.\n\nHe, however, implored him to be magnanimous in victory in the interest of the people of the state.\n\nBuhari also rejoiced with APC chairman, Abdulahi Adamu, and the National Working Committee of the party for the victory, the first under the tenure of the newly elected executives of the party.\n\n\u201cThis is a good beginning for you and your team. The APC is getting stronger and more united. The victory of our party in Ekiti is an indication of the confidence of Nigerians in the ability of our great party to deliver quality governance to all,\u201d he said.\n\nHe lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission and law enforcement agencies for the preparations put in place for the smooth conduct of the poll, urging them to keep the momentum in other upcoming elections.\n\n\u2022Orji Kalu: Victory timely, well-deserved\n\nChief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Kalu, in a message issued in Abuja, wished Oyebanji a successful tenure in office, while urging him to adopt a participatory leadership style.\n\nWhile commending the people of Ekiti for voting the candidate of the APC, Kalu urged Oyebanji to consolidate on the achievements of Governor Fayemi. According to him, the APC would continue to wax strong.\n\n\u201cThe victory of the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Biodun Oyebanji is timely and well deserved. The Fayemi-led state government has transformed Ekiti in all ramifications and as such, the people of Ekiti compensated the APC for the good works of the current administration in the state.\n\n\u201cThe governor-elect having served in various capacities at the state level has the administrative acumen and political dexterity to build on the accomplishments of the current administration. The people of Ekiti have reaffirmed their support for the APC with their votes.\n\n\u201cI commend the governorship candidates of other political parties for the political maturity displayed before and after the poll.\u201d\n\nKalu applauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security agencies, the media, civil society organisations and other stakeholders in ensuring a free and fair poll.\n\n\u2022Fayemi, Bagudu\n\nIn his reaction, Governor Fayemi said APC won because the party has a sellable product in Oyebanji.\n\nHe made the assertions when he led other APC governors, under the Ekiti Governorship Campaign Council to present a copy of the election results to Oyebanji in his home town, Ikogosi.\n\nFayemi who was accompanied by Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State and Mohammed Abubakar of Jigawa, said there were all manners of pundits and analyses, which put the stakeholders on their toes and pushed them to work harder for the success of the election.\n\nHe said there were those who predicted victory for other parties, while there were those who said APC would \u201ccarry the day\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were able to achieve victory, not just because of the hardwork of our party.\n\n\u201cThis is a candidate that is very well known to Ekiti people, someone who started demonstrating commitment to the Ekiti project in his twenties.\n\n\u201cSomeone, who acted as the Secretary of the Committee for the creation of Ekiti way back in the nineties.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised, if you have someone who was there at the birth of the state at a relatively young age as our candidate.\n\n\u201cHe has served in many government capacities as Commissioner, Chief of Staff and other positions in both my administration and that of the first elected governor of the state, Otunba Niyi Adebayo.\n\n\u201cYou can see that the trajectory has been very clear, has been on the upswing, has been very focussed on making Ekiti better.\n\n\u201cThe results of the governorship election is significant.\n\n\u201cIt is a statement about the quality of our candidate and a statement about the confidence reposed in us for having serve them meritoriously in the last four years,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nBagudu, who doubled as the Chairman of Ekiti APC Governorship Campaign Council, revealed that for APC to have won the election with over 100,000 vote margin compared to less than 20,000 recorded in 2018 confirmed how well Fayemi had done in improving the lives of the people.\n\n\u2022Abiodun, Oyetola\n\nIn the same vein, Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, said the victory indicated that the outgoing governor had performed in office to the admiration of Ekiti people.\n\nAbiodun, while saying that the people have spoken through the ballot, commended INEC for conducting a free and fair governorship election.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, said outcome of the exercise was a true reflection of their wishes and aspirations.\n\nHe said he was confident that the governor-elect would reciprocate the mandate given him by delivering quality governance and dividends of democracy to the people of the state.\n\nOyetola also lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for enhancing the credibility of the electoral process with the peaceful conduct of the poll.\n\nHe also commended security agencies, political parties and their candidates, and the people of Ekiti for the peaceful and successful conduct of the election.\n\n\u2022APC mocks PDP\n\nThe APC has mocked the opposition PDP for finishing third in the race.\n\nA statement by the National Publicity Secretary (NPS), Felix Morka said the victory was an eloquent testimony of the acceptance of the APC under the leadership of President Buhari, National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, commitment of members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and accomplishments of Governor Fayemi.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) finished a distant third position in the just-concluded election. Despite its claim to a self-serving and self-assigned rescue mission of Nigeria, the people of Ekiti State, and by extension, Nigerians are not, in any way, deceived by the ceaseless propaganda of a desperate party that only seeks a return to power to continue its ruinous escapades.\u201d\n\n\u2022Inspiration for more victories \u2013Tinubu\n\nAPC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, said the victory would motivate and inspire the party for more victories in the coming elections.\n\nHe also congratulated the Governor-elect, APC governors, and his party for victory in the governorship election.\n\nAsiwaju Tinubu commended Oyebanji for the steadfastness and passion he brought into the campaign, which he said paid off with the emphatic and outstanding victory.\n\nTinubu was also full of praise for the party\u2019s governors and members of National Working Committee under the leadership of Senator Abdullahi Adamu for recording their first major electoral victory. He charged them not to relent in their efforts to lead the party to greater victory in 2023 general elections.\n\n\u2022Precursor to Osun, 2023 election success \u2013Adamu\n\nThe party National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, declared that the victory is precursor to the victories at next month\u2019s Osun State gubernatorial election and 2023 general elections.\n\nIn a letter congratulating the governor-elect, he described the victory as the result of his popularity and strong campaign strategies put in place by the party.\n\nAdamu said Oyebanji has the pedigree, experience and vision to take Ekiti State to the next level of development.\n\nHe also thanked the people of Ekiti State for reposing their confidence in the APC and Oyebanji, promising that the new governor would continue to implement the people oriented programmes of the party already started by the outgoing governor, Kayode Fayemi.\n\nThe chairman also paid glowing tribute to President Buhari saying: \u201cAs leader of the APC, he provided guidance for the party going into the Ekiti State election.\u201d\n\n\u2022Replicate gains of Ekiti in 2023 polls, NILVEJ tasks INEC\n\nThe Nigeria League of Veteran Journalists (NILVEJ) wants the successes and gains achieved by the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC in the Ekiti State governorship election to be sustained and replicated in the 2023 general election.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja, the National President of the League, Chief Oliver Okpala hailed INEC for what he described as a \u2018wonderful performance\u2019 in the Ekiti Governorship poll.\n\nOkpala said the early arrival and delivery of electoral material at polling units as well as prompt commencement of accreditation and voting made the exercise hitch free and transparent for all to see.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month! Skills open the doors to financial opportunities Click here to learn it .\n\n\u201cThe commencement of accreditation and voting which was done simultaneously also helped in improving the exercise. This cut off the loss of interest and which was associated with the earlier method of accreditation, going away to wait before coming back to vote at a later time. So, we are systematically and significantly reducing voter apathy. Additionally, the use of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System,",

CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nDaily Sun gathered that most aggrieved leaders,including some of the governors who backed Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike as vice presidential candidate to Atiku Abubakar, are considering not participating actively in his presidential campaign.\n\nSigns of dissent became evident when some of the governors, who rooted for Wike boycotted the unveiling of Okowa in Abuja.\n\nThe governors include Seyi Makinde, Oyo State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Enugu; Okezie Ikpeazu, Abia and Samuel Ortom, Benue. Wike also stayed away from the event.\n\nA top party source told Daily Sun that those aggrieved by Okowa\u2019s emergence, realising that there is nothing they can do about it have decided to be indifferent to the affairs of the party.\n\nAnother source claimed that the lack of unity in the party and indifference of the governors stalled the grand finale of the PDP governorship campaign in Ekiti State, last Thursday as it became difficult mobilising party leaders for the programme.\n\nThe source, who expressed disappointment over the poor performance of the PDP in the Ekiti gubernatorial poll said: \u201cThe recent issues in the party contributed greatly to our lose.\u201d\n\nAnother official confirmed that feelings of resentments and disappointments were normal in an election contest where there were winners and losers, but the party has a dispute resolution mechanism to handle the issues.\n\n\u201cThe governors have not stated any position publicly or privately. Don\u2019t forget that the constitution gives the presidential candidate the prerogative to choose his running mate. We have an effective dispute resolution mechanism and we are talking. I can tell you that the process is ongoing. What is paramount to every member of the PDP is not personal interest, but national issues.

Notwithstanding, the party reportedly has uploaded the Senate President and the Minister of Niger Delta as senatorial candidates, although they did not participate in a valid primary.\n\n\u201cSubmitting names of persons who did not win duly conducted primaries on INEC portals is contrary to the electoral law. The electoral law requires that only persons who won duly conducted primaries should be submitted as candidates.\n\n\u201cIt is INEC that determines what is a duly conducted primary, based on its guidelines and the electoral law. The practice in the past where INEC allowed parties to make wrong and fraudulent entries and hoped that the courts will reverse them has gone with the new Electoral Act which now empowers INEC to reverse such fraudulent and wrong actions by the parties.\n\n\u201cSection 84 (1) of the Electoral Act, 2022 provides that \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Act shall hold primaries for the aspirants to all elective positions which shall be monitored by the Commission.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has described 70 per cent of Nigerian politicians as lunatics.\n\nHe made this declaration, yesterday, at the Men of Valour conference with the theme: \u201cNavigating the corridors of power, the church, and the politics\u201d organised by the Revival House of International Church (RHOGIC), Abuja.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe said only a lunatic would steal N80 billion of citizens money for personal use because he is privileged to be in government. He said most politicians in corridors of power have no reason to be there, warning that unless lunatics are flushed out and competent people voted in, the country would continue to suffer.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t allow this gangsterism to continue. Nigerians should take back their country. 70 per cent of those who are in politics today should not have any reason to be there. I have said it, politics in Nigeria is a case where lunatics have taken over the asylum. This is the only country where the worst is leading. I was a trader and gradually entered into politics. When you take far more than you need you are sick.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain that one person took N80 billion; it is not greed, it is sickness. When you take N1 billion that is greed, but when you take N80 billion that is sickness. Mad people have taken over our politics. If we get young people with the competence and capacity to be there, things will change.\u201d\n\nOn whether a third force can wrest power from the powerful duo of All Progressive Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the former Anambra State governor said only the people that would vote have the final say on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt is about the people. When I contested as governor in Anambra, I did so in a small party. People told me that I had no structure. People are the structure. When I was a governor in Anambra, my party had no state or federal lawmaker.\n\n\u201cWhen I left as governor, no state was financially stable as Anambra. We were not owing anybody. The people will decide who will rule them. Luckily we have eights months, let people come and tell you how they have started. Come and tell us, don\u2019t use people or glossy paper, tell us from your mouth so that we can hold you to account.\u201d\n\nOn the 2023 general elections, Obi, said prayers alone cannot salvage the country.\n\n\u201cWe have prayed enough, it is time to act. With these people in power? You can pray from now until anytime, they won\u2019t go until you chase them out. So it is time to act, not just pray. It is time for us to close the church and deal with these people.\u201d\n\nObi also urged the youths not to make a profession out of politics.\n\nNational secretary of Young Peoples Party (YPP), Vidiyano Bamaiyi, also claimed 75 per cent of politicians in Nigeria are political bandits.\n\n\u201cPolitical bandits that have taken over Nigeria, most of them have no business being there. Political bandits and brigands have taken over the political space.\u201d\n\nSenator Albert Bassey said only through direct primaries would the country eliminate money politics saying, \u201cgoing forward, Nigerians should vote for candidates and not party.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\u2022EFCC arrests vote buyers\n\nKunle Aderinokun in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Victor Ogunje in Ado-Ekiti\n\n\n\nThe governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, was this early morning declared the winner of yesterday\u2019s governorship poll after sweeping 15 out of the 16 local government areas (LGAs) in the state.\n\nThe governorship election, which was held under a calm and peaceful atmosphere, also recorded a large turnout of voters.\n\nThe poll was however characterised by vote-buying in all the 16 LGAs in the state, leading to the intervention of the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), who arrested some vote-buyers.\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Oyebanji scored 187,057 votes to defeat his main challenger and governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr. Segun Oni, who came a distant second with 82,211 votes, while the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Bisi Kolawole garnered 67,457 votes to clinch the third position.\n\nHowever, while the APC and PDP won in 15 and one local government area, respectively, the SDP did not win any LGA.\n\nSixteen political parties participated in the election.\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Returning Officer, Prof. Oyebode Adebowale, APC won in Ado-Ekiti, Ikere, Emure, Ijero, Ilejemeje, Ekiti South West, Ekiti West, Ekiti East, Moba, Oye, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Ise/Orun, Aiyekire/Gbonyin, Ido-Osi, and Ikole LGAs.\n\nWhile Irepodun/Ifelodun is the LGA of former governor Ayo Fayose, who was the main backer of the PDP candidate, Ido-Osi is the LGA of the governorship candidate of SDP, Oni.\n\nIkole is the LGA of Kemi Elebute-Halle, the candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP).\n\nThe candidate of the PDP, Kolawole, was announced the winner in Efon Alaye LGA, while Oni of the SDP did not win a single LGA.\n\nThe winner of the governorship election, Oyebanji, is a former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), to Governor Kayode Fayemi.\n\nEFCC Arrests Vote Buyers, Election Calm, Peaceful\n\nFollowing the widespread vote-buying, which characterised the governorship election, the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested persons suspected to be engaged in vote-buying in the poll.\n\nSome of the suspects were paraded at the Oke Ori Omi Area Division of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nThe suspects were reported to have been caught with bundles of cash allegedly used for vote-buying.\n\nSome other persons were also arrested at a private residence with a book containing details of voters of a certain voting area.\n\nThough the election was said to be calm and peaceful, sponsored thugs had a field day destroying ballot boxes in the stronghold of opposition parties in Ise Ekiti and Ilawe Ekiti Polling Units.\n\nBallot boxes in Ilasa, Polling Unit 001 in Ekiti East, another stronghold of the opposition party, were destroyed by sponsored thugs.\n\nThe Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room (Situation Room), which observed the election, said in a statement that it received reports of widespread vote-buying by political party agents across the 16 LGAs in the state.\n\n\u201cIn many instances, voters were induced with money ranging from N4,500 to N10,000 by asking them to flag completed ballot papers as proof of voting in a specified manner in what they term \u2018See and Buy\u2019. Situation Room strongly condemns this blatant violation of the electoral law,\u201d said the statement.\n\nSituation Room noted that the election was generally peaceful, with voters civilly conducting themselves in most of the polling units.\n\nIt, however, observed that the redistribution of voters done by INEC still did not take care of the issue of a huge population of voters in some polling units as many new polling units had abysmally low numbers while older polling units remain overcrowded.\n\n\u201cThere were also polling units sited in private residences such as PU006 Omiragunsin\u2019s House, Okemesi Ward 1, Ekiti West LGA and PU003 in front of Ezekiel\u2019s House Iroro/Ita Alafia Iroro Imegun, Ward 3 Araromi Omuo, Ekiti East LGA,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSituation Room, which commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), noted the early arrival of poll officials and election materials in 93 per cent of the polling units observed.\n\nAccording to the group, polls commenced before 9 a.m. in at least 88 per cent of the locations, which it described as an improvement of both the Anambra State Governorship Election 2021 and FCT Area Councils Elections 2022.\n\nSituation Room observed that the Bi-Modal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS) was functional in at least 76 per cent of the voting locations.\n\n\u201cHowever, there have been many reports of delays and malfunctioning BVAS machines in some voting units especially those with many registered voters. Examples of the locations where the machines malfunctioned are PU 002 Igbaletere by Mechanic Workshop, Ward 6 Ado Okeyinmi, Ado-Ekiti LGA where the Machine was going on and off intermittently, PU 007 LA Primary School Oke Afin, Otun Ward III and PU018 Igogo Ward II both in Moba LGA where the BVAS failed, and PU 014, Ward I Okemesi, Ekiti West LGA, amongst others. Furthermore, INEC\u2019s distribution of the BVAS devices was not proportionate to the population of registered voters by polling unit,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked INEC to prosecute all those involved in vote-buying in the governorship election.\n\nSERAP in a short tweet last night said the prosecution must not end with those caught in the act but must be extended to the politicians who funded their election malpractice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Peter Obi and the Last \u2018Big Men\u2019",
          "text": "ENGAGEMENTS by Chidi Amuta\n\nThe outcome of our presidential nominations season has produced a new landscape of mixed blessings. The two major parties have produced rival contestants straight from the dark recesses of Africa\u2019s political past. Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu are in many ways a throwback to the African \u2018Big Man\u2019 politician of the 1970s to 1990s. On the contrary, a minor party, the Labour Party, has positioned a presidential candidate who symbolises the urgent present and the imminent future of African political contest. Mr. Peter Obi has emerged as both a generational shift and a redefinition of both political message and medium. The politics of business as usual is about to come face to face with the politics of norm shattering conveyed through the multiple devices and platforms of the internet age.\n\nIt is hard to forget where and who we are. In Nigeria\u2019s politics of ethnic identity, Tinubu is a Yoruba candidate while Atiku is the Hausa/Fulani opposite. Peter Obi is the candidate of ethnic anonymity, a sort of political everyman with perspectives that cut across all the silly barriers that have held us hostage.\n\nThere are other benefits of the presidential nominations season. A partisan frenzy has been unleashed. The public is falling over itself either in triumphant adulation or mournful regret over the emergence of Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu as mascots of the dominant parties. The emergence of both men replaces the anonymity of their respective party platforms with recognisable names. Overnight, those who prefer the PDP have become Atiku devotees whether they like Mr. Atiku\u2019s nose or not. The same goes for the other side. People who a few weeks back were ready to cast stones at anything that bore a Tinubu sign are now finding justifications on why the man should relocate from his Lagos Bourdillon home to Aso Rock Villa.\n\nThe epidemic of partisanship is of course a healthy sign for our quirky democracy. Schism and alignment are perfect entitlements of an activated public in a place of democracy. Moreover, in the absence of any ideological markers to distinguish between the parties, people are better off queuing up and falling over each other behind emblems.\n\nA tragic feature of today\u2019s African democracy is the ease with which the parties\u2019 become extensions of the private political estates of their overbearing founders or leaders. At this moment, the APC is now synonymous with Tinubu while the PDP has become Atiku Abubakar by other means.\n\nTogether, both men are political Siamese twins. They represent an easily recognizable feature of Africa\u2019s political landscape. Somehow, they are in many ways our own version of the reign and rule of the African \u201cBig Man\u201d as sovereign. They will carry the imprints of the modern African nation state mostly as pseudo traditional chiefs disguised as elected presidents. Both are immensely wealthy men. Their political prominence is mostly a product of their awesome economic power. They have used economic power to buy into and invoke the major classic indices of power. They have bought into primordial traditional authority by overwhelming the traditional institutions. They even influence the appointment of some traditional rulers. They control and endorse religious authority by donating churches and mosques. They own media houses and powerful information platforms and channels. They have amorphous families sometimes with multiple spouses and offspring. Both men have an identical political trajectory with many previous attempts at the top job. Their humongous wealth spans all major sectors. Those interested in following their big money usually get lost in the confusing hazy borderline between private fortune and the public treasury. Some inquisitive people end up in the confusing intersection between private fortune and privileged access to the public treasury in one way or the other.\n\nThe political gravity of both Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar is ultimately more a function of their economic and financial leverage than the ideas and policy propositions they are associated with. In each case, the emergence of a personality cult is well within reach despite the constraints of constitutional conformity. African history is littered with the nasty footsteps of a succession of African \u2018Big Men\u2019. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea. Paul Biya of Cameroun. Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo Brazaville, Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, Mobutu Sese Seko of former Zaire. These are the more memorable variants of the Africa Big Man president.\n\nThe African Big Man as modern-day ruler of the nation state is a quaint anomaly, the cultural continuation of the fabled African Chief in most traditional African cultures and societies. The Chief is the inheritor of privileges beyond reproach or questioning. He has a natural entitlement to communal assets and benefits. The chief expects to be gifted the best maidens, the fattest cows, the most fertile communal lands, and the best harvests from those who toil. These entitlements are hardly subject to questioning. The modern African Big Man president feels a similar sense of entitlement.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a national constitution hardly regulates or limits the powers and entitlement of the African Big Man President. In most cases, the rule of law, the power of due process and the requirements of standard public accountability and the observance of a code of public conduct are mostly observed in breach. Civil society activists and rights lawyers who insist on these matters are quickly lumped with the political opposition \u2018enemies of the people\u2019 and could end up with endless prison terms.\n\nThe classic African Big Man ruler did not quite materialise centre stage in Nigerian politics in the 1980s and 1990s. This coincides with a period in which Nigerian politics and governance, like in Argentina and much of Latin America, was dominated by a rival but equally fearsome power contender: Big Generals. From the 1970s up to 1999 and even till President Buhari, Nigerian politics and power was straddled by Big Generals either in uniform or as elected democracy converts. As a rule, civilian political Big Men and Big Generals do not sleep on the same bed. This is one reason why the military neutralized the threatened emergence of Chief M.K.O Abiola in the early 1990s. In the current nominations of Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar, the Big Man has re-emerged centre stage in Nigeria\u2019s political arena through the democratic process.\n\nHowever, the reign and rule of the few remaining African Big Men is doomed to imminent end. A combination of biological extinction and technological substitution will see to that. The few of this specie left are mostly in their mid-70s to 80s. They are being challenged and replaced by younger politicians with support bases rooted in a new demographics and new messaging. African democracy is now appealing directly to a broad popular demographic base with an egalitarian consciousness. A younger generation of leaders and aspiring leaders empowered and connected by the internet and an array of new technologies is on the ascent. International best practices are increasingly beaming the searchlight on African governance and politics. African democracies are being compelled, through peer pressure, to shape up to global standards of citizens\u2019 rights and public accountability.\n\nThe younger generation of African political activists and leaders is no longer frightened by decadent myths, ancient customs or the deployment of medieval intimidation and repression strategies. Nor are they impressed by long motorcades, authorized state gangsters in the name of security or the sickening opulence of Big Men.\n\nOut of the loud and wide expectation of a Third Force to counter Nigeria\u2019s dominant two-party politics, something unexpected has reared its head. The real unexpected tale from our season of presidential nomination primaries is the emergence of Mr. Peter Obi. Beyond being the flag bearer of a little-known fringe Labour Party, Mr. Obi has materialized as a one-man political squad. Somehow, the lone scraggy voice of an ex -state governor has risen above the national political noise to reach the usually fractious Nigerian public. A new message that is both refreshingly new and unifying is afloat.\n\nWith no retinue of groveling followers, no intimidating motorcade of glimmering SUVs, no political fellow travellers in over embroidered flowing gowns, Mr. Peter Obi broke loose from the suffocating embrace of his former PDP. At a disarming final moment before the presidential nomination primaries, he had the uncommon decency to say a polite goodbye to Atiku Abubakar whose running mate he had been in the 2019 race. At another political event where Atiku declared his presidential intention, Mr. Obi described his former principal as \u2018my brother\u2019 and \u2018leader\u2019 only to take his leave of both the PDP and Mr. Atiku shortly afterwards.\n\nPrior to leaving the PDP, Peter Obi had gradually emerged as the darling of the Nigerian Online Republic. He is easily the most followed and admired political figure among Nigerians on Twitter where he has a following of over 1,000,000 and still counting. His Facebook, Instagram and Tik Tok followership is growing by the moment. So far, his few open forum events are packed with active audiences who only seem to want more of his inspirational political messages. He is already a cross between a power preacher and a rock star.\n\nThe Peter Obi phenomenon is a timely reversal of the old African Big Man narrative. Enter the youthful politician clad in simple outfit. He is determined to shorten the length of the presidential motorcade, curb wasteful governance, live modestly in simple circumstances, resist corruption, shun the filthy lucre, empty opulence and gradiosity of public office and avoid or curb the pomposity of state ceremony. Here is a leader who has undertaken to connect with the people as one of them. This is the regular Bayo, Emeka, Abu or Joe next door who wakes up early to pray for his nation, undertake his morning exercise, make his own coffee. Mr. Obi carries his own bag at the airport and holds up his own umbrella in the rain. Peter Obi\u2019s increasing magnetism lies mostly in the fact that of all the political salesmen at our doorstep these days, he alone embodies the highpoints of this new anti-Big Man narrative.\n\nPeter Obi is communicating and connecting directly with ordinary Nigerians on the streets and in the markets. His catchment is a new strategic demographics of youth and the internet generation, the urban unemployed who see their hopeless situation because of the years of wasteful governance by Big Men politicians. But the traditional party membership and configuration still gives an advantage to the rural grassroot poor who remain in the vice grip of the politics and parties of Big Men.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s emerging democratic culture, Mr. Pater Obi is the galvanisation of the convergence of new realities and new technologies. Mr. Obi is merely the embodiment a new spirit and the carrier of a generational burden. An entirely new generation and vast population of Nigerians feel challenged to reject decades of bad politics and worsening social and economic conditions. Peter Obi is merely the current embodiment of a spirit that was hinted at by the spontaneous outburst of the ENDSARS protests. He may be the first political expression of the new spirit of protest bad government and ugly social and economic conditions.\n\nPeter Obi is still a fad, not quite a movement yet. There are pitfalls and obstacles. His solo dance is not yet a movement. His party platform still lacks a nationwide structure at the base. He fits rather untidily into the labour camp. No one knows his links to the Nigerian labour movement nor his ideological affinity to the movement\u2019s leftist and left of centre inclination. His proposition remains at best a solo flight. His perspective are personal convictions. His lifestyle and frugality are more of a personal choice. In his political train, there are no fellow travellers or disciples to convert his personal message into a creed. Beyond his instinctual appeal as a more frugal, unassuming, and more accountable leadership proposition, we are waiting for a systematic worldview and alternative perspective in a world full of models and options.\n\nMeanwhile, questions abound: Is Peter Obi a socialist? Not at all. Is he a social democrat? No one is certain. Is he a laissez faire capitalist or random trader who made good and stumbled into the government house in Awka? Not quite sure. Given his business antecedents as a bank owner, wine merchant, general importer, retailer of sundry wares and serial global investor, Mr. Obi would at best be a left of center politician with a personal lifestyle of frugality, modesty, and simplicity. All these qualities appeal naturally to a Nigerian public that has spent decades longing for a minimum level of modesty and accountability on the part of our leaders.\n\nThe immediate political risk confronting Mr. Obi is that of insulating his movement from ethnic pigeonholing. An Igbo mass who cannot find their own among the major political figurines of this season may want to own Peter Obi. His communicators must duck that trap by sustaining his nationalist and popular message.\n\nOn closer examination, there may be issues arising from the alternative leadership style and culture that Mr. Obi is increasingly symbolizing. The politician with a disciplined Spartan lifestyle and compulsive frugality in government may be new in these parts but it is not entirely a novelty in other places. It is in fact a common feature of post-industrial European countries. When industrialisation and economic development has created reasonable egalitarianism and prosperity, material glamour and glitz stop impressing most citizens. Leaders become more of everyman. Utilitarian functionality replaces grotesque opulence and senseless gadgetry. Substance replaces appearance and the lofty insensitivity of kings and princes gives way to the modesty of republican equality. Nigeria is not an industrial let alone a post -industrial society. Government remains the cash machine that sustains the economic life and livelihood of most citizens.\n\nPeter Obi\u2019s message is mostly about shrinking government and freeing resources for development. But government and its wasteful ways employs a multitude. Our huge public service is more of a social insurance mechanism than an engine of growth or bureaucratic functionality and efficiency. Sometimes the foolish ceremonies of government create employment. When a Nigerian government stages an elaborate ceremony to dish out awards to \u2018deserving\u2019 Nigerians in an annual festival, all the multiplier effect of moving a crowd of people from various parts to Abuja are activated. Hotels. Airlines, transporter, food vendors, dressmakers etc reap a harvest.\n\nMr. Peter Obi has come to serve notice on our behalf: Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar (whoever wins in 2023) are perhaps the last Big Men that will rule Nigeria. Similarly, we have seen the last Big Generals in power. After this season, political contest and power will revert to a majority in a true republic. Mr. Obi\u2019s emergence has value as a timely signal of the direction in which a new consciousness and new technologies will lead Nigeria long after the last Big Man has exited the central place of power.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Mr. Peter Obi has emerged as both a generational shift and a redefinition of both political message and medium.\nAs a rule, civilian political Big Men and Big Generals do not sleep on the same bed.\nThe real unexpected tale from our season of presidential nomination primaries is the emergence of Mr. Peter Obi.\nThe Peter Obi phenomenon is a timely reversal of the old African Big Man narrative.\nMr. Peter Obi has come to serve notice on our behalf: Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar (whoever wins in 2023) are perhaps the last Big Men that will rule Nigeria.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abena, a voice assistant wants to preserve African languages",
          "text": "Like many kids who grew up with an elderly relative, Nana Ghartey was used to helping his grandmother out around the house. He was 9 years old, and they lived together in Winneba, a small town in Ghana about 65 kilometres east of the capital city of Accra. Ghartey told TechCabal that because his grandmother didn\u2019t have the best eyesight and had trouble walking around, he regularly had to support her in completing basic tasks and functions: turning the lights in her home on and off, operating the radio and TV, and dialling numbers on her mobile phone on her behalf, and helping her check her phone credit balance. Another reason Ghartey needed to assist his grandmother was that she primarily speaks Fante, a tonal language native to the Akan tribe in Ghana and had trouble understanding the Western languages predominantly used by tech devices.\n\nBut in addition to being a dutiful young boy, Ghartey was also a budding computer geek. His late mother was a programmer at Wang Computers, so even as a toddler, Ghartey was used to being surrounded by them. With time, he slowly began to teach himself how to operate them; once he learned how to type, he was able to help his mum out with small tasks on Microsoft Word.\n\nGhartey, who is now 32, told TechCabal that he credits the needs of his grandmother during his adolescence and his early exposure to computers through his mother\u2019s profession as the inspiration and catalyst, respectively, of the artificial intelligence products he created, initially to help his grandmother out, Kofi, and the one he made for the wider public, Abena. They are the first voice assistants offered in Fante and Twi, respectively.\n\nFor all the opportunities technology affords to customise experiences by catering to users\u2019 needs with hyper-specificity, millions of Africans like Ghartey\u2019s grandmother, who either don\u2019t speak English or other Westernised languages or simply prefer not to, are often excluded from these benefits. The linguistic dominance of Western languages also threatens indigenous African languages; as big, Western-based tech companies spread their influence across Africa, both as service and product providers, and as job creators, indigenous languages are often deprioritised and nudged into the background.\n\nThe invention of the first voice assistant in 1992, Radio Rex, marked an era where computers developed the ability to translate on-screen actions or words into text. By 2010, the wealthiest American tech companies had launched language technologies: Siri was released that year, Google Now in 2012, and Alexa in 2014. But these voice technologies support only Western languages and are unavailable in African languages because of the low-revenue opportunities in African markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though these behemoth tech companies lack the means to build products that support indigenous African languages. And, to be fair, some have made efforts to catch up, slowly but surely, like Google Translate\u2019s addition of 10 African languages to the platform last month. Some language experts argue that these companies are the only entities, along with robust AI labs (though often the two are linked), that can solve what they characterise as a \u201clow resources\u201d problem.\n\nGhartey has his own theories about that.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they can\u2019t build such systems for African languages. Surely they can,\u201d he told TechCabal from Accra, where he now lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve prioritised the languages that they want to focus on first.\u201d\n\nSo rather than wait for big tech to do all of the problem solving, he\u2019s been working towards a solution for nearly a decade\u2014with a much smaller team and significantly fewer resources\u2014and has already made headway.\n\n\u201cWorking on voice tech for African languages has been a completely different ball game. Data set out there are based on religious text, so you end up building a system that has a bias for biblical words.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ghartey reached his teenage years, he was consumed by a desire to learn as much about computers as he could. In high school, he was the designated tech guy, often helping his classmates do things like connect to the internet on their phones. (This was 2005 when such functions weren\u2019t yet second nature.) Sometimes, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to use the campus computer lab, he skipped class and sneaked off to internet caf\u00e9s just to spend more time tinkering with them, he recalled to TechCabal. After years spent assisting his grandmother, he had become accustomed to using his skills to help anyone who needed it.\n\nHe still graduated, though, and went on to study Information Technology at the Ghana Telecom University in Accra. But Ghartey taught himself mobile app development and built desktop applications, websites, and eventually mobile games, none of which were part of his school curriculum, by reading the programming textbooks which an uncle who came visiting from the US had left behind. By the time graduation came around, Ghartey graduated top of his class and secured a scholarship to do a master\u2019s in software development, in a partnership programme between his alma mater in Accra and Coventry University, UK.\n\nHis prolonged stay in Accra meant that he would not be able to go back home to continue helping his grandmother. For a while, his younger sister stepped in to assist her, but eventually she moved out, too. Even after Ghartey received his master\u2019s, he stayed back in Accra and went on to build his mobile app development company, Mobobi LLC. But he knew he needed to come up with a solution to assist his grandmother in operating her tech devices and performing little chores, and quickly. After years of obsessive learning about computers, he knew the solution would be AI-driven, but at the time, he knew nothing about AI development.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I remember the sleepless nights reading research papers and benchmarking frameworks and tools to find the right solution for my grandmother. I knew that if I intended to bootstrap and ship a production build to the masses, I\u2019d need to further hone my skills in AI, so I set on a mission to educate myself on what was required, \u201d Ghartey told TechCabal.\n\nFirst, he addressed the most immediate need: that of his grandmother. Using her voice and that of his sister\u2019s as data, he built Kofi, a voice assistant that supported Fante, his grandmother\u2019s preferred language and one spoken by 6 million Ghanaians. The product enabled her to use mobile apps without having to scroll through the home screen, which was difficult for her due to her impaired vision. All she had to do was tap the side of the button to launch the Kofi app, and she could instantly receive news updates, play music, stream radio programmes, and follow Twitter trends\u2014curated by the AI with human moderators to prevent misinformation\u2014without having a Twitter account.\n\nGhartey said that when he introduced her to Kofi and asked her to try it out, she initially thought she was interacting with a real person and became frustrated at times when the voice assistant didn\u2019t comply with some of her commands. Ghartey had to explain to her some of Kofi\u2019s limitations, but that process helped him recognise how useful a native voice assistant could be for the wider public. In order to serve them, he would need to build a voice assistant in Ghana\u2019s most widely spoken language: Twi.\n\nThis would prove to be a much larger undertaking than Kofi. First of all, Ghartey didn\u2019t have nearly as much data to work with initially, and he already knew the next iteration would require a large data set so that he could offer the product in several different dialects in order to avoid bias toward certain intonations. Secondly, Twi, like many other languages in the south of the Sahara, is tonal; accent marks dictate tones and make a difference in communication, which demanded even more research.\n\nAnother important factor to consider was access. In Winneba, where he lived with his grandmother, internet connection was patchy and inconsistent. Ghartey didn\u2019t want his users to worry about constantly having to purchase data in order to use the app, which meant that Abena would need to function offline. (For context, with Apple\u2019s Siri, this offline feature is only available to users with iOS 15.) Abena\u2019s offline operation was also an effort to cut costs on his end; online operation would have required a server that processed thousands of user requests from users in real time, and thus enormous computing power from costly cloud servers.\n\nBut Ghartey knew his efforts would be worth it. He spent 6 years building Abena AI, and released it in the Google Play Store this April as a Mobobi product. (At that point, Mobobi had already gained some traction for Real Piano Teacher, a popular game that has amassed more than 20 million downloads and is the first Ghanaian-made game on Google Play Pass.) Just like the features offered on Kofi, users can check trending news on Twitter; follow weather reports; check, transfer, and recharge their airtime balances; and transfer money with their preferred mobile payment app, all using voice commands on Abena AI. The offline mode also supports an in-app community feature that allows users to send text messages, images, and videos with each other.\n\nThe reception was immediately enthusiastic. Just a few days after launching Abena AI, a health influencer shared a demo of the app on Twitter, which catapulted it to trending topic popularity and demonstrated the need of a voice assistant offered in a language that was the second most spoken in the country after English.\n\nSimilar to the way his grandmother benefitted from Kofi, Ghartey realised that in addition to being more linguistically inclusive, Abena AI also served people with visual impairments who speak or preferred to speak Twi, many of whom were elders. They became fast fans of Abena AI, he said, because it made it easier for them to check and recharge their credits from their phones, which otherwise required tech-savviness or Western language literacy.\n\nOnce Abena AI was out in the world, it was time to refine it, a task that turned out to be just as challenging as building the voice assistant in the first place. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay professional linguists to help him with the training data for Twi, so he crowdsourced translation data from users by using third-party pop-up apps that requested translations. That proved unsuccessful when he discovered that the responses users provided were either inaccurate, or complete diversions of the words he asked them to translate. He tried incentivising users by offering to pay 5 cedis ($0.6) per translation, which worked for a while, but eventually he ran out of money. He remained tenacious, though, and eventually hired religious translators who worked on church-related translations in Twi. Still, he said he is always on the lookout for more ways to gather information about the language.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d he said, adding that he accounts for the context of every word and crowdsources information about dialects from Abena AI app users. \u201cYou need lots of data to build these models.\u201d\n\nLike Google Nest and Amazon Echo\u2014both hardware using their respective company\u2019s voice recognition software\u2014Abena also functions as a home automation system. Abena AI works with smart lights, smart plugs, and other smart home devices.\n\nIn the nearest future, Ghartey is looking to ship an update that will see Abena support 5 more Ghanaian languages and hire professional natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning engineers to speed up his work and help him ship updates to other African languages like Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Afrikaans, Sesotho, and isiZulu.\n\nGhartey works on Abena AI for 3 hours on workdays, while working full time at his company Mobobi, to allow him to keep bootstrapping it.\n\n\u201cThe feedback from a few people who tried Abena AI out before it was released kept us going. That smile on a 60-year-old\u2019s face as he listened to his airtime being read out without stress\u2014it was paving the way for people to perform tasks easily, tasks they\u2019d never been able to do in the past,\u201d Ghartey said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was co-authored by Koromone Koroye, Hannatu Asheloge, and Ngozi Chukwu\n\nAfrica\u2019s technology ecosystem as we know it is thriving and primed for astronomical growth and success in this decade. Over the past 5 years, our ecosystem has celebrated several key milestones:\n\nExits and acquisitions in the millions.\n\nImpressive funding rounds ranging from seed to Series C.\n\nThe arrival of new angel investors and venture funds eager to serve African entrepreneurs.\n\nBusiness and product expansions into multiple regions within Africa.\n\nWhile these milestones are valid and deserve amplification, we cannot ignore the diversity elephant in our meeting rooms, tech conferences, pitch stages, and panel sessions. Funding received by female-owned startups is still significantly low compared to what their male counterparts receive from foreign and local investors. In this widely-read piece by Max Culliver and Africa: The Big Deal, they paint a gloomy picture of existing gender disparities within Africa\u2019s venture funding space. In 2021, 93% of the funding in Africa went to male-led startups \u2013 a pretty shocking figure by any standard.\n\nBut the news isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. This year alone, we\u2019ve seen more African female founders raise capital for their startups and get accepted into reputable accelerators like Techstars Toronto Accelerator (Techstars Toronto) and Y Combinator (YC). This article aims to recognize some African female founders making great strides across various industries and sectors on the continent.\n\nThis list comprises women who are mothers, advocates, readers, dancers, hikers, swimmers, entrepreneurs, founders, and so much more.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Many questions are currently running riot in the minds of many Nigerians about the next job of the out-going Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State.\n\nWith the conclusion of the off-season gubernatorial election in the state Saturday to early morning of Sunday (today), his exit from the Government House Ado-Ekiti has become sacrosanct.\n\nFayemi has enjoyed his tenure as the job has taken him to every part of Nigeria by virtue of his position as Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF).\n\nBefore he mounted the soap box the second time to seek for a fresh mandate in 2018, Kayode had been a made-man, having held different influential positions across the globe.\n\nAs he takes a bow from office in a few months time, having installed a successor, he must have envisioned his future, part of which must have informed his recent foray into the presidential race that suffered a hiccup.\n\nIndeed, he must have wished to step up on the nation\u2019s political ladder when he purchased his party\u2019s form to contest for its presidential ticket for the 2023 general election. But the high wire politics in the All Progressives Congress (APC) forced him to recant, stepping down at the eleventh hour for Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a development many analysts have described as a trade off.\n\nFayemi was among the 23 presidential aspirants screened by his party. While a number of them were reportedly not cleared, he was among the lucky ones that scaled through.\n\nRead also: Ekiti elects 7th governor since return of democracy\n\nIn Nigeria, the dream of many governors in their last tenures, is to go to the Senate, where elder politicians who had been everything in the nation\u2019s political arena, retire to after active service. But Fayemi neither picked a form for the senatorial race nor coerced the headquarters of his party to retrieve a mandate already given to another person to enable him be at the Senate by all means. Observers say that the only hope for him to remain politically relevant could be if his party wins the presidential election in which case he could be given a ministerial slot.\n\nFayemi was minister of Solid Mineral Development before he stepped back to Ekiti to contest the 2018 gubernatorial election and won.\n\nIt is unlikely if he would return to his teaching or journalism profession or other fields of endeavour where he had excelled before venturing into politics, after the expiration of his tenure of office.\n\nThe experience in Nigeria is that political office holders who left their professions never return to such professions. They hang around the corridors of power.\n\nIt is also expected that he would take active role in the presidential campaign of Tinubu by investing time and resources for an expected harvest.\n\nHaving nursed and helped Oyebanji to win a resounding victory at the election, Fayemi must however, avoid the mistake of his colleagues who failed to realise that yesterday is no longer today.\n\nBeing meddlesome has created a lot of bad blood between many predecessors and successors. He will do well to resist the urge to think he is still in charge of Ekiti when Oyebanji should be calling the shots.\n\nA peep into Fayemi\u2019s life\n\nAfter his first degree in 1984, he proceeded on the mandatory one year National Youth service Corps from 1985 to 1986, during which he was a lecturer at the Nigeria-Police Training College in Sokoto. After his service year, he served as a Research Officer at Development & Management Consultants in Ikeja between 1987-1989.\n\nWhen he moved to the UK to pursue his doctoral studies between 1991 to 1993 he worked as a Research Officer at the African Research and Information Bureau in London. In 1992, he was a Tutorial Fellow at the War Studies Department at Kings College, London during his doctoral studies. Later between 1993 to 1995, he was the Strategy Development Adviser of Deptford City Challenge in London and later served as the Secretary General of the Media Empowerment for Africa (The Radio Foundation) in London between 1995-1997.\n\nHe was also a journalist with The Guardian and City Tempo; and the Editor of Nigeria-Now, a defunct political monthly magazine.[6] In 1997, Fayemi returned to Nigeria where he established the Centre for Democracy and Development Centre for Democracy & Development, a research and training institution dedicated to the study and promotion of democratic development, peace-building and human security in Africa, where he served as Director from 1997 to 2006.\n\nKayode Fayemi has taught in Africa, Europe, the Americas and Asia. He has also served as an adviser on transitional justice, regional integration, constitutionalism, security sector reform and civil-military relations issues to various governments, inter-governmental institutions and development agencies. He was the main technical adviser to Nigeria\u2019s The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission (Oputa Panel), which investigated past abuses and served on the Presidential Implementation Committees on Security Sector Reform, NEPAD and the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nFayemi was technical expert to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on small arms and light weapons and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa on governance issues.[7] At other times he has served as a consultant to the OECD on Security Sector Reform and chaired the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative\u2019s Committee of Experts on developing guiding principles and mechanisms of Constitution making in Commonwealth Africa.\n\nNow, with a robust international exposure, would Fayemi return to his forte in the academia of continue to loiter on the corridors of power.\n\nIt is said that once one is politically exposed in Nigeria, the aroma of free food and perks of office no longer allows one to leave the arena. This can be confirmed from the array of old politicians who before their forays into politics were accomplished technocrats, medical doctors, among others, but who after leaving political office refused to go back to their professions.",
          "summary": "Observers say that the only hope for him to remain politically relevant could be if his party wins the presidential election in which case he could be given a ministerial slot.\nFayemi was minister of Solid Mineral Development before he stepped back to Ekiti to contest the 2018 gubernatorial election and won.\nHaving nursed and helped Oyebanji to win a resounding victory at the election, Fayemi must however, avoid the mistake of his colleagues who failed to realise that yesterday is no longer today.\nAfter his service year, he served as a Research Officer at Development & Management Consultants in Ikeja between 1987-1989.\nNow, with a robust international exposure, would Fayemi return to his forte in the academia of continue to loiter on the corridors of power.",

The internal wrangling is the only thing that can stop us as it has stopped PDP in Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cIf we sue for peace in the party, we will certainly find one. We should try to resolve the internal wrangling within the party as no court case can bring peace unless we sit together to resolve our quarrel.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cOur aim is to be in power and to be the ruling party. Our collective interest should be our major focus, not our selfish interest which is at the root of the crisis of the party.\u201d\n\nObaseki urged leaders of the party to make ward meetings important and compulsory from this month.

However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers. We hope to build an evidence base for positive economic, social and political change.\n\n\u2013 Margee M. Ensign",

Most go unannounced, unreported.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe attack on Roboh village, Kajuru LGA today where 36 people were kidnapped and 3 killed wasn\u2019t the first attack. On 5th January 2022, it was attacked and some kidnapped. On 27 April, 2020, the community was attacked again and this time some houses were burnt. Then the attack of today, 19 June, 2022.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, because of the constant attacks on the community and surrounding ones, \u201cthe people in the village decided to start holding church services early by 7am so that people can hurriedly go back to their homes. It was some few minutes after 7am today, while both the Catholic and Baptist churches were holding their services when the kidnappers attacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spoke to a man whose wife, mother and daughter were taken from the Baptist church today. The anguish in his voice is something none of us should experience. The worrisome part of the insecurity is that most in Roboh have difficulties cultivating their farms. Moreover, because villages like Bakin Gada, Ungwan Pada, Maikori, Dogon noma, that surrounds Roboh have all been attacked at different times, people find it difficult to venture far to their farms.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, this man and others would wait for when the kidnappers would call and ask for ransom. They would start borrowing, begging and selling anything to raise the ransom. After it\u2019s paid, the kidnappers would come again, kill and again kidnapped,\u201d he.said\n\nMeanwhile, Samuel Aruwan, Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna State,said Security agencies have reported to the Kaduna State Government that bandits attacked worshippers and locals at Ungwan Fada, Ungwan Turawa and Ungwan Makama in Rubu general area of Kajuru local government area.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Aruwanon Sunday, the bandits stormed the villages on motorcycles, beginning from Ungwan Fada, and moving into Ungwan Turawa, before Ungwan Makama and then Rubu.\n\n\u201cIn Rubu village, the bandits attacked worshippers in the Maranatha Baptist Church and St. Moses Catholic Church,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThree locals were confirmed killed in the attacks. They were identified as\n\n\u201cPeter Madaki (Ward head of Ungwan Fada), Elisha Ezekiel (Resident of Ungwan Fada) and Ali Zamani (Youth leader of Rubu).\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo persons were left injured in the attacks: one Aniro Mai, and a yet-unidentified woman. An unspecified number of locals were also kidnapped, according to the received reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bandits looted shops and carted away some valuables from the villages.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Acting Governor , Dr Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe, expressed deep sadness, and condemned the attack in the strongest terms. She sent her sincere condolences to the families of the deceased victims, as she prayed for the repose of their souls.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Acting Governor also commiserated with the attacked churches, and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.

Abdullahi Adamu, and the uncommon commitment of other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of our great Party.\n\n\u201cAs we inch towards the 2023 general elections, we urge the people of Ekiti State and Nigerians, in general, to sustain their support for our party by voting overwhelmingly for all APC candidates as the party remains unwavering in its commitment to improving the quality of governance and standard of living of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn his part, presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, congratulated Ekiti State governor-elect, Oyebanji, and the party for winning the governorship election, saying it was the progressive leadership of Governor Kayode Fayemi in Ekiti State that made it possible.\n\nHe commended Oyebanji for the steadfastness and passion he brought into the campaign, which he said paid off with the emphatic and outstanding victory.\n\nHe praised the party\u2019s governors and members of National Working Committee of the APC under the leadership of Senator Abdullahi Adamu for recording their first major electoral victory, charging them not to relent in their efforts to lead the party to greater victory in 2023 general elections.\n\nThe APC presidential candidate said: \u201cI congratulate our Governor-elect Abiodun Oyebanji and his Deputy, Mrs. Monisade Afuye, for their great success at the election. This victory is our victory as members of the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cI salute the people of Ekiti State for voting for progressive leadership and continuity. I commend the leadership of our party for leading APC to this major victory in Ekiti. Also deserving of praise are our party\u2019s governors led by their Chairman and Governor of Kebbi for their hard work and tenacity to achieve victory for the party.\n\nThis feat should motivate and inspire us as we go for more victories in the coming elections. I must commend the now outgoing-Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and his team whose progressive leadership in Ekiti made it possible for APC to retain government for the next four years. I am confident that the Governor will finish well and strong.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking the people of Ekiti once again for standing by APC, I urge them and indeed the generality of Nigerians to continue to maintain their faith and confidence in our party,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "A former Special Adviser on Media to the Governor of Kaduna State, Mr. Reuben Buhari said the attack on Roboh village, Kajuru LGA where 36 people were kidnapped and 3 killed wasn\u2019t the first attack.\n\nAccording to him, \u201d attacks on rural communities by kidnappers have been going on without respite. Most go unannounced, unreported.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe attack on Roboh village, Kajuru LGA today where 36 people were kidnapped and 3 killed wasn\u2019t the first attack. On 5th January 2022, it was attacked and some kidnapped. On 27 April, 2020, the community was attacked again and this time some houses were burnt. Then the attack of today, 19 June, 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said because of the constant attacks on the community and surrounding ones, \u201cthe people in the village decided to start holding church services early by 7am so that people can hurriedly go back to their homes. It was some few minutes after 7am today, while both the Catholic and Baptist churches were holding their services when the kidnappers attacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI spoke to a man whose wife, mother and daughter were taken from the Baptist church today. The anguish in his voice is something none of us should experience. The worrisome part of the insecurity is that most in Roboh have difficulties cultivating their farms. Moreover, because villages like Bakin Gada, Ungwan Pada, Maikori, Dogon noma, that surrounds Roboh have all been attacked at different times, people find it difficult to venture far to their farms.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, this man and others would wait for when the kidnappers would call and ask for ransom. They would start borrowing, begging and selling anything to raise the ransom. After it\u2019s paid, the kidnappers would come again, kill and again kidnapped,\u201d he.said\n\nMeanwhile, Samuel Aruwan, Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna State, said Security agencies have reported to the Kaduna State Government that bandits attacked worshippers and locals at Ungwan Fada, Ungwan Turawa and Ungwan Makama in Rubu general area of Kajuru local government area.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Aruwanon Sunday, the bandits stormed the villages on motorcycles, beginning from Ungwan Fada, and moving into Ungwan Turawa, before Ungwan Makama and then Rubu.\n\n\u201cIn Rubu village, the bandits attacked worshippers in the Maranatha Baptist Church and St. Moses Catholic Church,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThree locals were confirmed killed in the attacks. They were identified as\n\n\u201cPeter Madaki (Ward head of Ungwan Fada), Elisha Ezekiel (Resident of Ungwan Fada) and Ali Zamani (Youth leader of Rubu).\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo persons were left injured in the attacks: one Aniro Mai, and a yet-unidentified woman. An unspecified number of locals were also kidnapped, according to the received reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bandits looted shops and carted away some valuables from the villages.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Acting Governor , Dr Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe, expressed deep sadness, and condemned the attack in the strongest terms. She sent her sincere condolences to the families of the deceased victims, as she prayed for the repose of their souls.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Acting Governor also commiserated with the attacked churches, and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured. Security patrols were being conducted in the general area as investigations proceed.\u201d",

Teachers who scored 75 per cent and above were recognised as those who passed the test and qualified for attending courses in leadership and school management.\u201d\n\nHauwa said qualified teachers will be included in Teacher Professional Development (TPD) programmes to enhance their capacities to deliver quality teaching to pupils.\n\n\u201cTeachers who scored between 40 and 74 per cent did not meet up with the minimum pass mark, they will be given a second chance to improve their capacities. KADSUBEB has initiated viable training programmes for teachers under its statutory TPD with support from the state government and development partners.\n\n\u201cThe training programmes will be conducted during the end of term vacation and in their respective schools, to minimise disruptions of teaching and learning. They are also encouraged to complement the government\u2019s efforts and seek personal development for their own good.\n\n\u201cThe board is assuring teachers and the public that it remains committed to ensuring their continuous professional development and the improvement of the learning outcomes of pupils and students,\u201d she said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, PDAC, International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government was seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, was the reason Nigeria has been seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP, designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements, PGEs, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdegbite also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey, BGS, to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA.\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further stated that this has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury.",

I was a principal actor from the beginning to the end.\u201d\n\nReacting to the arrest of some persons by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over allegations of vote-buying, Fasuyi stated that the APC has no connection with the activities of the suspects.\n\nAccording to him, it could be a ploy by perceived opponents seeking to link the ruling party to a crime it has not committed.",

I took up the fight to break this jinx. The battle to secure the APC ticket was hard. When I was almost fed up, I resorted to prayers.

We need to take this message to our people across communities and sensitise them on the need to vote in the general elections.\u201d\n\nAkiolu, in his response, described Tinubu as his \u201cstubborn son\u201d, saying it was time for political leaders in South West to close ranks and work for the victory of Tinubu at the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe stressed that the massive support received by the APC chieftain across the country must be complemented by politicians in the region.\n\n\u201cYour emergence as the presidential candidate of your party is the beginning of another journey in your political career,\u201d the monarch said. \u201cAll Yoruba ancestors shall be with you on this journey to make our fatherland a better place.\u201d\n\nTinubu left the palace to his house on Bourdillon Road in Ikoyi, where some APC governors led by the chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum, Atiku Bagudu, were waiting to receive him.\n\nEarlier, all roads leading to the presidential wing of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA) were a beehive of activities as supporters trooped to the airport to receive Tinubu.\n\nTinubu\u2019s arrival in the state is the first since he won the APC presidential ticket.

          "title": "French President Macron Loses Parliament Majority In Stunning Setback",
          "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron and his allies on Sunday lost their absolute majority in the National Assembly and with it control of the reform agenda, a crushing outcome for the newly re-elected president.\n\nFor sure, Macron\u2019s centrist Ensemble! alliance were set to end up with the most seats in Sunday\u2019s election, followed by the left-wing Nupes bloc headed by the hard left veteran Jean-Luc Melenchon, initial projections showed.\n\nBut Macron and his allies would fall well short of the absolute majority they would need to control parliament, and ministers and close aides acknowledged that, saying they would now have to reach out to others beyond their alliance to govern the country.\n\nFinance Minister Bruno Le Maire called the outcome a \u201cdemocratic shock\u201d and said they would reach out to all pro-Europeans to help govern the country.\n\n\u201cThe rout of the presidential party is complete and there is no clear majority in sight,\u201d Melenchon told cheering supporters.\n\nUnited behind him, leftwing parties were seen on course to triple their score from the last legislative election, in 2017, but they failed to secure the outright win Melenchon had hoped for.\n\nIf confirmed, a hung parliament would open up a period of political uncertainty that would require a degree of power-sharing among parties not experienced in France in recent decades, or political paralysis and even possibly repeat elections.\n\nRachida Dati, from the conservative Les Republicains, called the result \u201ca bitter failure\u201d for Macron and said he should name a new prime minister.\n\nThere is no set script in France for how things will now unfold as Macron and Ensemble will seek to find a way forward to avoid paralysis.\n\n\u201cThere are moderates on the benches, on the right, on the left. There are moderate Socialists and there are people on the right who, perhaps, on legislation, will be on our side,\u201d government spokeswoman Olivia Gregoire said.\n\nMacron, 44, became in April the first French president in two decades to win a second term but he presides over a deeply disenchanted and divided country where support for populist parties on the right and left has surged.\n\nHis ability to pursue further reform of the euro zone\u2019s second biggest economy would hinge on his ability to rally moderates outside of his alliance on the right and left behind his legislative agenda.\n\nForecasts by pollster Ifop, OpinionWay, Elabe and Ipsos showed Macron\u2019s Ensemble alliance winning 210-240 seats and Nupes securing 149-188.\n\nThe former head of the National Assembly, Richard Ferrand and Health Minister Brigitte Bourguignon lost their seats, in two major defeats for Macron\u2019s camp.\n\nIn another significant change for French politics, Le Pen\u2019s party could score a ten-fold increase of its MPs, and win as much as close to 100 seats, the initial projections showed \u2013 its biggest number on record.\n\nThe Les Republicains party and its allies could also get as much as 100, potentially making them kingmakers, as their platform is more compatible with Macron\u2019s than any other group.\n\n\u201cDISORDER\u201d?\n\nIf official results, that have started trickling in, confirm Macron and his allies missed an absolute majority by a wide margin, they might either seek an alliance with Les Republicains or run a minority government that will have to negotiate laws with other parties on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMacron had appealed for a strong mandate during a campaign held against the backdrop of a war on Europe\u2019s eastern fringe that has curbed food and energy supplies and sent inflation soaring, eroding household budgets.\n\n\u201cNothing would be worse than adding French disorder to the world\u2019s disorder,\u201d the president had said ahead of the second-round vote.\n\nMelenchon\u2019s Nupes alliance campaigned on freezing the prices of essential goods, lowering the retirement age, capping inheritance and banning companies that pay dividends from firing workers. Melenchon also calls for disobedience towards the European Union.",

Notwithstanding, the party reportedly has uploaded the Senate President and the Minister of Niger Delta as senatorial candidates, although they did not participate in a valid primary.\n\n\u201cSubmitting names of persons who did not win duly conducted primaries on INEC portals is contrary to the electoral law.\n\nThe electoral law requires that only persons who won duly conducted primaries should be submitted as candidates. It is INEC that determines what is a duly conducted primary, based on its guidelines and the electoral law.\n\n\u201cThe practice in the past where INEC allowed parties to make wrong and fraudulent entries and hoped that the courts will reverse them has gone with the new Electoral Act which now empowers INEC to reverse such fraudulent and wrong actions by the parties,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigeria and China have mapped out ways to strengthen the movie industries of both countries as a collaborative effort at alleviating poverty in the West African country.\n\nThis was the focus of the launching of the Doc-China Festival, co-organised by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China and China Global Television Network (CGTN) in Abuja during the week.\n\nCultural Affairs Counselor of the Chinese Embassy and the Director of the China Cultural Centre in Nigeria, Mr Li Xuda, in his remarks said the effort is to boost Nigerian Nollywood with some assistance to help use the platform to fight poverty in Nigeria.\n\nXuda said: \u201cFor many years, the Nigerian government has been working hard to lift more ordinary people out of poverty. From what I know, in 2021, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari Inaugurated the Steering Committee of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to achieve his mission of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade.\u201d\n\nAt the event a documentary entitled \u201cvoices from the frontline: China\u2019s War on Poverty\u201d jointly produced by CGTN and the Kuhn Foundation of the United States, was presented. The documentary provided an intimate portrayal of China\u2019s historic anti-poverty campaign, which in the last 40 years has removed over 800 million people out of extreme poverty and the lessons for Nigeria.\n\nThe collaboration was also aimed to promote the cultural exchange between China and other countries, and to provide the world a better understand China, people as well as its culture. Over 50 of the CGTN\u2019s best video production including award-winning documentaries will be screened at selected television channels from around the world during the Doc-China Festival, which will kick off with a grand ceremony in Beijing in June and go on till the end of this year.\n\nThose video productions will explore themes including food, travel, people\u2019s lives, social development etc.\n\nXuda said: \u201cAs we know, both China and Nigeria are large countries with developed film and television industries. There are not only many film studios, productions companies in the two countries, but also numerous excellent professional talents including screenwriters, directors and movie stars. In 2021, China\u2019s movie industry produced over 700 movies.\n\n\u201cThanks to the rising living standard and entertainment demand in China, there were over 10, 000 cinemas in China. From this you can imagine how many moviegoers there are in China. The Box Office revenue was growing as well. In the same year, China reported the highest box office revenue worldwide, at over $7 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Director, International Cultural Relations of the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, Memunat Ladi Idu-Lah, in her remarks praised the efforts of China in the movie industry.\n\nShe said: \u201cChina and Nigeria have huge potential for cooperation in the film industry. Nigeria film production ranks among the best in the world and China is the world\u2019s film industry market and so we can see the collaboration.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the Nigeria-China collaboration in the industry has a brighter future.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
