          "title": "I\u2019m \u2018somehow\u2019 related to Tinubu, says female presidential candidate, Khadija Okunnu-Lamidi",
          "text": "Female presidential candidate, Khadija Okunnu-Lamidi, has said despite the respect she has for the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, she still believes Nigerians are yearning for a young person with a vibrancy to steer the country out of its current woes.\n\nThis is as she revealed that she\u2019s \u201csomehow related\u201d to Tinubu who recently declared his ambition to run for the presidency in 2023.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Pidgin, Okunnu-Lamidi said, \u201cHe\u2019s the national leader of the APC; he has contributed to national politics and I have great respect for him. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Nigerians are looking for a young person with vibrancy. Nigerians are looking for a way out of poverty, they want 24 hours electricity supply, good health care and good roads which are what I\u2019m here to provide.\u201d\n\nAsked if she has political experience, she said, \u201cMany people will say they have never heard of my name but I\u2019ve been in politics for at least 20 years learning. Many people do declare their political ambition before they are actually ready, which is quite a problem. I\u2019ve learnt the work and seen how others do it, which I don\u2019t find satisfying, it gives me stomach ache.\n\nOn when she decided to run for office, she said, \u201cIt was shortly after the EndSARS protests in October 2020,\u201d adding that she started engaging with youths and the late singer, Sound Sultan, towards the goal of fielding some youths to contest for public office.\n\nShe said most of those whom she discussed with were sceptical about the idea.\n\n\u201cAt that point, it occurred to me that if I truly have the passion, I should be the one to step out and take the risk for us to have a better Nigeria,\u201d she said.\n\nOn how serious she is about her ambition, she said, \u201cAs you can see, my entrance into the race has not been a joke.\u201d\n\nAsked to speak about the political platform she\u2019s running on, Okunnu-Lamidi said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about party because, for me, it doesn\u2019t really bring solution. I\u2019ve never seen any party talking about how to make life better for everybody, it\u2019s just about their own selfish interest.\u201d\n\nOkunnu-Lamidi said Nigeria needs to include women in the scheme of things to enable the country to experience change which is one of the driving factors in the world.\n\n\u201cInnovation and change are the driving factors of progress in the world these days. The whole world is experiencing change. You can\u2019t do the same thing and expect a different result. The only difference we can add to what we have been doing is to include women,\u201d she said.\n\nOn if women will vote for her, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a woman who doesn\u2019t want to support another woman. All the women I\u2019ve known have been supportive.\u201d\n\nStating how she intends to tackle insecurity in Nigeria, she said, \u201cThe meetings I hold these days are all about finding solutions to governance. With security, the thing is that you cannot secure the outer borders without securing the locality. We\u2019ll first of all start with the localities, make use of local monitoring units because they are the ones who will give information and also watch out for their neighbours. This measure will assist the national security agencies.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Ugwuanyi at the Government House, Enugu, yesterday, for the amicable resolution of the issues surrounding the zoning of the Ezeagu LGA Chairmanship position under the arrangement of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu State.\n\nThe people said they were delighted at the manner, and wisdom, the governor displayed in handling the zoning of the Chairmanship position to Ezeagu South without rancour, during the PDP consultative meeting.\n\nLed by the former member of the Federal House of Representatives who represented Udi/Ezeagu Federal Constituency, Rt. Hon. Ogbuefi Ozomgbachi, the delegation maintained that the decision reached at the consultative meeting demonstrated that Gov. Ugwuanyi is an ardent apostle of equitable zoning.\n\nHon. Ozomgbachi said that \u201cthe act and wisdom applied was amazing but not surprising because those of us who have associated with you and the residents of Enugu State that have watched you for over six and half years have come to appreciate the manner in which you make difficult tasks easy\u201d.\n\nHe added that Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s wisdom has helped the people of Ezeagu LGA to sustain their zoning arrangement, stressing that the governor exhibited similar gesture when he chaired the National Zoning Committee of the PDP, preparatory to the Party\u2019s National Convention which took place in October 2021.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, when the PDP charged you with the task of leading the committee that was supposed to determine the zoning of PDP national offices before the National Convention, all eyes were on Enugu State Government House.\n\n\u201cThe manner in which you led that committee plus the outcome of that committee\u2019s deliberation was what laid the foundation of the unprecedented success at the last National Convention, no protest or rancour.\n\n\u201cThe entire country, the entire PDP family across the country were applauding what you did. It is still the same pattern that you applied in this situation.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, we appreciate what you have done. You have helped us to sustain the zoning arrangement and subsequently, with what you did, we are sure it is going to help us sustain the arrangement going forward. We thank you\u201d, Hon. Ozomgbachi said.\n\nThe people of Ezeagu therefore reassured Gov. Ugwuanyi of their unflinching support, saying: \u201cAny time we are called upon to demonstrate our support, we are going to do so, even after your office as the governor because you are like a brother to our people\u201d.\n\nResponding, Gov. Ugwuanyi, who attributed the success recorded during the zoning deliberations to God Almighty, told the delegation that he saw the visit as an opportunity for him to join them in thanking God.\n\nThe governor emphasized the importance of taking the right decision and sustaining it, pointing out that such gesture promotes peace, unity and progress.\n\nHe therefore advised the people of Ezeagu LGA to officially document their zoning arrangement for posterity.\n\nThe Deputy Governor of Enugu State, an indigene of Ezeagu LGA, Hon. Mrs. Cecilia Ezeilo; the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Rt. Hon.

          "text": "By Vincent Ujumadu \u2013 Awka\n\nWith the increasing hardship occasioned by the bad economy in the country, many residents in Anambra State say they have been forced to relocate to the hinterland as they could no longer cope with the demands of residing in the cities.\n\nInvestigation by Vanguard showed that those most affected were civil servants whose salaries can no longer meet their monthly expenditure, as well as pay children\u2019s school fees.\n\nNarrating how he had to pack out from his three-bedroom apartment in the heart of Awka to Isuaniocha in Awka North local government area of the state, a civil servant, Mr. Onyebuchi Nwofor said the relocation was inevitable if he had to continue to manage life under the present situation in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cI moved into a three-bedroom flat in Awka in 2008 when I got married at a rent of N150000 per annum. Two years later, the rent was increased to N200000 and to N250000 after another two years.\n\nIn 2017, the landlord said he would renovate the house and after the exercise, he increased the rent to N400000 per annum.\n\n\u201d With this increase, I knew I had been priced out of the house and I decided to look for another apartment. It was then I discovered that the average house rent in Awka had become N450000 and I had to make a decision.\n\n\u201d This was how I went to the rural area of Isuaniocha where I pay N100000. The problem here is that the area does not have a regular electricity supply, while we rely on tankers for water supply.\n\n\u201cThe midst of all these, my salary has not increased much, and even at the rent of N100000, my family still finds it difficult to eat three square meals a day.\n\n\u201d My wife who teaches in a private school does not earn much and our combined salaries are not enough to pay rent, eat and pay school fees for our three children\u201d.\n\nAnother civil servant, Mr. Obiadi Christian said he had to move his family to his village, Ichida in Anaocha local government area when he could no longer cope with house rent in the city. He said his children also had to relocate to the public school in his village as it is not possible to be bringing them to Awka every day.\n\nAnother resident of Awka, Mr. Modestus Obiorah said he had to become an artisan when urban authorities demolished his shop and he had no money to pay for a shop.\n\nAccording to him, touts were collecting N200 daily from him until the government decided to demolish the roadside shops.\n\nHe added: \u201cI was just managing to feed my family from the business, but when the shop was demolished, I started working at construction sites where I make an average of N3,000 daily.\n\n\u201cMy desire is to get a Keke on a hire purchase because the construction work is seriously affecting my health.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Federal Government has applauded the commitment and dedication of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) towards enhancing digital skills development among youths through implementation of various Information and Communication Technology skill acquisition programmes.\n\nMinister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, and the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, gave the commendation during the inauguration of a Digital Nigeria Centre (DNC), a project executed by the Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF), an arm of NCC, at the Ijesa Muslim Grammar School, Ilesa, Osun State recently.\n\nRepresenting President Muhamadu Buhari at the event, Aregbesola commended the NCC for timely and thorough implementation of the project, saying he was confident that the project will promote the connection of public secondary schools to broadband internet in Ilesa community and ultimately equip beneficiaries with 21st century skills.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank my very good friend and brother, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, for assenting to our request to have the first of this remodeled project in Osun State sited in Ilesa. I will also like to thank the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta and the entire Management and staff of NCC and the USPF, as well as their technical partners for a timely and successful completion of this laudable project,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the sideline of the commissioning, Aregbesola also announced the establishment of President Muhammadu Buhari N100 million Technology Fund for Youth Empowerment, to nudge the emergence of world class technology experts. The Minister of Interior stated that the Fund targets 2,000 youths in the next two years, who will be provided with devices for training in different areas such as software development and design, amongst others.\n\nThe Governor of Osun State, Adegboyega Oyetola, who was represented by the State\u2019s Commissioner for Innovation, Science and Technology, Dr. Babatunde Olawale, expressed the gratitude of the State Government to the Federal Government, the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy and the Nigerian Communications Commission, for initiative and particularly for inaugurating the pioneer remodeled DNC project in Osun State. Oyetola also informed the enthusiastic gathering that Osun State Government was willing and ready to collaborate with NCC to replicate the project in other parts of the State\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Pantami, who was represented at the event by the Chairman, Board of Commissioners of NCC, Prof. Adeolu Akande, also commended the NCC and USPF on the delivery of the DNC project on behalf of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He declared that the project and similarly instituted ones were initiated by the government to give expression to its vision to effectively digitise the nation\u2019s economy for increased prosperity for all Nigerians.\n\nPantami stated that the Federal Government is focused on promoting the digital economy across the country and that this had informed the renaming of the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. On the heels of the re-christening, Pantami recalled that the Federal Government emplaced Digital Nigeria-oriented policies to reinforce the focus of existing policies in order to accelerate the delivery of derivable benefits of digital economy to Nigerians, regardless of their locations and circumstances.\n\nVery central among the policies is the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030, a 10-year, eight-pillar focused blueprint for actualising the Federal Government\u2019s digital economy agenda unveiled in November, 2019.\n\nPantami asserted that the DNC inaugurated at Ilesa was a concrete implementation of the Digital Literacy and Skills, the second pillar of NDEPS.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the overarching objective of the DNC project is to facilitate adoption of digital lifestyle in the schools as well as in the school communities. The Minister averred that the project\u2019s significance cannot be under-estimated, considering its ability to improve digital skill for the youths and subsequently make them globally competitive.\n\nPantami said the Nigerian government is determined to arm the youths with digital skills, strong literacy and numeracy skills, critical and innovative thinking skills, complex problem solving aptitude, the ability to collaborate, and deploy socio-emotional skills, which they require to transform their lives and build the economy.\n\n\u201cWe have already made a number of giant strides in the development of our digital economy culture and the deployment of initiatives such as the Digital Nigeria Centre eloquently demonstrates the current administration\u2019s commitment to connecting all Nigerians,\u201d Pantami said as he equally expressed Federal Government\u2019s commitment to its tripartite agenda of improving the economy, curbing corruption and enhancing national security through effective deployment of ICT in all nooks and crannies of the country.\n\nIn his remark, Danbatta, who was represented at the event by the Commission\u2019s Director of Projects, Iyabode Solanke, said all the regulatory activities, initiatives and programmes that the Commission had undertaken since 2019, in collaboration with its critical stakeholders, including its arm, the USPF, have been targeted at giving concrete expression to Nigeria\u2019s deliberate policy to migrate to a full digital economy.\n\nHe said the Commission achieves this by consistently committing itself to expansion of appropriate infrastructure to enhance digital literacy and skills in view of the economic and social impact of digitization on all sectors.\n\nThe NCC Chief Executive restated the Commission\u2019s commitment to the overall objective of bridging the digital divide through the provision of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as well as broadband access to the unserved and underserved institutions and communities in the country.\n\nEarlier, the Principal of Ijesa Muslim Grammar School, Ramota Ilesanmi, thanked the President Buhari-led Federal Government for the project, saying that it will go a long way in meeting the ICT needs of students and residents of the city.\n\nThe DNC, formerly known as School Knowledge Centre (SKC), is one of the projects in the Access Programme framework of the USPF, conceptualized to promote the availability and utilisation of ICT and resources of the Internet in teaching and learning in public schools in underserved, unserved and rural areas.\n\nSpecific objectives of DNC are to increase ICT literacy among school teachers and students; provide a platform for accessing online educational resources; equip students with ICT skills; facilitate ICT adoption in teaching and learning; as well as increase pass rate in Mathematics, English language and other science subjects",
          "summary": "The Federal Government has applauded the commitment and dedication of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) towards enhancing digital skills development among youths through implementation of various Information and Communication Technology skill acquisition programmes.\nPantami stated that the Federal Government is focused on promoting the digital economy across the country and that this had informed the renaming of the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy.\nVery central among the policies is the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030, a 10-year, eight-pillar focused blueprint for actualising the Federal Government\u2019s digital economy agenda unveiled in November, 2019.\nPantami asserted that the DNC inaugurated at Ilesa was a concrete implementation of the Digital Literacy and Skills, the second pillar of NDEPS.\nAccording to Pantami, the overarching objective of the DNC project is to facilitate adoption of digital lifestyle in the schools as well as in the school communities.",

          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\nThe Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), an initiative of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has been described as a major agricultural breakthrough and a source of pride to the country, as rice farmers continue to count gains under the scheme.\n\nTo mark the successes recorded under the programme, particularly, in the area of rice cultivation, the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), in collaboration with the CBN, would tomorrow unveil the world\u2019s largest rice pyramid in Abuja. President Muhammadu Buhari would unveil the mega pyramid.\n\nOther special guests expected to support the president at the event include the presidents of Benin Republic, Niger Republic, and Chad, as well as governors of Cross River, Ebonyi, Kebbi, Jigawa, Ekiti, and Sokoto states.\n\nRIFAN stated in a publication to announce tomorrow\u2019s programme, \u201cRIFAN will also use the occasion to flag off its 2021 \u2013 2022 Dry Season Farming activities and celebrate the Annual Rice Festival. RIFAN has been the major driver of the rice value chain under the ABP for the past six years. Join us in celebrating rice revolution in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s celebrate President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s initiative on food security and self-sufficiency in rice together with the Governor, CBN, Godwin Emefiele.\u201d\n\nLaunched by Buhari in 2015, ABP is designed to assist small-scale farmers to increase the production and supply of feedstock to agro-processors with the aim of creating an ecosystem that would link out-growers (smallholders) to local processors. The thrust of ABP is the provision of inputs in kind and cash (for farm labour) to smallholder farmers with a view to boosting the production of rice, maize, poultry, sorghum, cassava, tomatoes, cotton, palm oil, soybean, among others. The idea is to stabilise input supply to agro-processors and address the country\u2019s negative balance of payment on food.\n\nIt is also a loan to farmers without collateral and the benefitting farmers are given farm input and cash to cultivate their farms, including the experiment on rice.\n\nAccording to the structure of the ABP, a farmer who wants to repay his loan can either do so with cash or give the central bank his/her produce of same value, after which officials of CBN\u2019s Development Finance Department would sell and recover the loan.\n\nThe programme has increased banks\u2019 finance to the agricultural sector, enhanced capacity utilisation of agricultural firms involved in the production of identified commodities, as well as the productivity and incomes of farmers.\n\nFrom an average yield of 1.8 metric tonnes per hectare in the pre-ABP era, the initiative has increased the country\u2019s average yield per hectare for rice paddy and maize to about five metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nSimilarly, the average capacity utilisation per annum of domestic integrated rice mills has jumped to 90 per cent, from the 30 per cent that was the case in the era preceding the advent of the ABP.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a significant reduction in the country\u2019s rice import bill, from a monstrous $1.05 billion prior to November 2015, to the current figure of $18.50 million, annually. The programme has also created an estimated 12.3 million direct and indirect jobs across the different value chains and food belts of the country.\n\nNotwithstanding the disruptions caused by the COVID-19, the challenges of insecurity, among others, the Emefiele-led CBN, in collaboration with some state governments, has continued to encourage rice farmers to cultivate the crop and support the federal government\u2019s quest for food security.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun has said his administration would continue to work assiduously to improve the state\u2019s internally generated revenue (IGR).\n\nThis, according to him was to ensure Ogun surpasses its number three position in IGR generation in Nigeria and become second to Lagos State in revenue generation.\n\nSpeaking after inspecting facilities at Proforce, an indigenous firm specialising in the manufacturing of security equipment in Ode-Remo, Remo North Local Government Area, a statement quoted the governor to have emphasised that his administration had made access to land easy, just as a friendly tax concession policy had been put in place to attract more investors to Ogun.\n\nAbiodun stressed that the incumbent government would continue to do all it can to increase the state IGR.\n\n\u201cLast year, the National Bureau of Statistics came up with a report that showed Ogun State was the state with the highest improved Internally Generated Revenue. By June last year, our IGR had improved by 131.5 per cent.\n\n\u201cBy November, we had raked in about N85 billion in IGR. This is unprecedented in the history of this state; our state had been number three last year. I\u2019m sure by this year, we will be number two next to Lagos State in Internally Generated Revenue,\u201d the governor said.\n\nAbiodun, who noted that his administration had put in place policies such as deployment of information communication technology to ensure the blockage of leakages in order to increase in the ranking of the state on the Ease of Doing Business Index.\n\nThe governor further disclosed that his administration would continue to provide employment opportunities for the youths so that it could sustain its position as the safest state in the country.\n\n\u201cJust being safe is not just by providing equipment for the police, but by ensuring that youths in the state are well educated and provided with employments,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also informed the gathering that no fewer than 5,000 fibre optic cables were currently being laid across the length and breadth of Ogun to provide WiFi access, adding that his administration would not relent on its infrastructural transformation in the state.\n\nOther measures put in place according to the governor included good road network, friendly business environment and abundant human resources.\n\n\u201cMy advice to other investors is that they should come to Ogun to enjoy the hospitality, infrastructure put in place, availability of land, abundant human resources, friendly tax concession and all that we have done to ease business. If you are not in Ogun, you are not in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are here to see where Proforce can partner with us and how we can support them, how we can also encourage them. We are very proud that this is happening right here in Ogun State. We have seen others from different parts of the world. Definitely, this facility compares to any other anywhere in the world,\u201d he explained.\n\nAbiodun added that the visit was to have a first-hand experience of the firm\u2019s operations and see areas his administration could collaborate and give it the needed support.\n\n\u201cI must say that I am very impressed with what the Chief Executive and his team is doing here. This is a first class manufacturing concern particularly against the background of the level of insecurity that we are witnessing in recent time across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEverything that is happening here is basically to support the law enforcement architecture of the state. Prior to the launch of Operation MESA, my administration will go into discussion with the company to provide the outfit with the needed equipment and logistics to make it carry out its assigned duties effectively.\n\n\u201cToday, Ogun State is one of the safest states in the country and we intend to sustain it, but it is not only by equipment and gadgets to the security agencies. We must understand that there is a nexus between security and illiteracy, unemployment and drug abuse. However, we like to ensure that our law enforcement agencies are properly equipped and battle ready to tackle insecurity\u201d, the governor submitted.\n\nHe, however, reiterated his warning that cultists, criminals and those who engage in any form of violence, unwholesome conducts and vandalism to desist or face the wrath of the law.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court has set aside its earlier ruling which dismissed Guaranty Trust Bank\u2019s (GTB) appeal against a N2.4 billion judgment in favour of Innoson Motors Nigeria Limited.\n\nThe apex court set aside its own decision on Friday, while delivering judgment in an application by GTB seeking the re-listing of the appeal on the grounds that it was wrongly dismissed.\n\nThe apex court in reversing itself relied on Order 8 Rules 16 of the Supreme Court\u2019s rules that empowers it to set aside its decision in certain circumstances, like any other court.\n\nSpecifically, the five-member panel, led by Justice Olukayode Ariwoola in a unanimous decision on Friday, held that the apex court erred in its ruling of February 27, 2019, wherein it erroneously dismissed GTB\u2019s appeal with number: SC/694/2014 against the decision of the Court of Appeal, Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nThe apex court in the lead judgment written by Justice Tijani Abubakar, but read by Justice Abdu Aboki, claimed that it was misled by its Registry, which failed to promptly bring to the notice of the panel that sat on the case on February 27, 2019, that GTB had already filed its appellant\u2019s brief of argument.\n\nThe apex court noted that had the panel that sat on the case on February 27, 2019, notified it of the existence of the appellant\u2019s brief of argument, it would not have given the ruling which dismissed GTB\u2019s appeal on grounds of lack of diligent prosecution.\n\nThe apex court justices explained that the court has powers to reverse itself where there was any reason to do so, especially where any of the parties had obtained judgment by fraud, default or deceit; where such a decision is a nullity or where it is obvious that the court was misled into giving a decision.\n\nAccording to the judgment, the circumstances of the GTB case falls into the category of the rare cases where the Supreme Court could amend or alter its own order on the grounds that the said order or judgment did not present what it intended to record.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that at the material time that the appellant\u2019s appeal was inadvertently dismissed by this court, there was in place, a valid and subsisting brief of argument filed by the applicant.\n\n\u201cIt will be unjust to visit the sin of the court\u2019s Registry on an innocent, vigilant, proactive and diligent litigant.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious from the material before us, that there were errors committed by the Registry of this court, having failed to bring to the notice of the panel of Justices that sat in chambers on February 27, 2019 that the appellant had indeed filed its brief of argument. This is a case deserving of positive consideration by this court.\n\n\u201cHaving gone through all the materials in this application therefore, I am satisfied that the appellant/applicant\u2019s brief of argument was filed before the order of this court made on February 27, 2019 dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cThe order dismissing the appeal was therefore made in error. It ought not to have been made if all materials were disclosed. The application is therefore, meritorious and hereby succeeds,\u201d the apex court held.\n\nHe proceeded to set aside the court\u2019s ruling of February 27, 2019 dismissing GTB\u2019s appeal and ordered that the appeal marked: 694/2014 \u201cbe relisted to constitute an integral part of the business of this court until its hearing and determination on the merit.\u201d\n\nOther members of the panel were John Okoro and Helen Ogunwumiju.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

If we continue to borrow and do nothing about growing our revenue base as other countries are doing, a severe debt crisis awaits us.\"\n\nIt said that, \"the Federal Government has no clear strategy on revenue generation, relying mainly on borrowing such that the country spends 98% of its revenue on debt servicing.\n\n\"There is no evidence of a coherent strategy by the Federal Government to improve our revenue substantially and to manage our debts. Even the Director-General of the Debt Management Office has warned that unless the country's revenue profile is raised significantly, the country will face debt sustainability challenges.\n\n\"Shockingly, we are currently borrowing to fund a high recurrent expenditure, petrol and electricity subsidy, an expensive National Assembly, over-bloated civil service and the largess of politicians. Meanwhile, the government plans to spend only 5% of the budget on health and 7.9% on education, both of which are less than UNESCO's recommendation of 15% for developing countries.\"\n\nThe Youth Party urged the government, \"to adopt its Bold Revenue Plan to rescue the economy.\u201d\n\n\"Some of the recommendations in the plan include: the immediate implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act, implementation of the Stephen Oronsanye report to reduce the cost of governance, phased removal of petrol and electricity subsidy, and strict adherence to the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which states that budget deficits must not exceed 3%,\" the party added.",

          "text": "The Imo state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says the state has collapsed under the administration of Hope Uzodimma, the governor.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by Emenike Nmeregini, its state publicity secretary, said the 2020 supreme court judgment concerning the state governorship election \u201cfoisted the most reprehensible administration\u201d on the people in the last two years.\n\nThe party said instead of securing the lives of the people of the state, Uzodimma has politicised the security situation in Imo and allowed the state to be overrun by kidnappers and terrorists.\n\nThe PDP said Imo has become the most indebted state in the south-east owing to the governor\u2019s borrowing spree and with no meaningful project to justify the huge borrowings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe illegitimate regime of Senator Uzodinma has without remorse, abdicated the primary obligation of government as prescribed by the Constitution, which is the security of lives and property. Rather, it has politicized an unfortunate security situation in the state which has continued to gulp countless innocent lives, everyday. Today, bandits, terrorists, cannibals, kidnappers and unknown gunmen are almost overrunning the State,\u201d the party said.\n\n\u201cOur party and indeed the people of Imo State regret that Senator Uzodinma suspended and summarily dismantled all the foundations and programmes our Rebuild Imo administration painstakingly put in place in all the sectors towards the rebuilding of Imo State.\n\n\u201cThese and other programmes of the Rebuild Imo Administration were dumped by Uzodinma even when he embarked on a borrowing spree, in most cases, nocturnally, which has placed Imo as the most indebted state in the entire South East. This is worrisome given that the regime still cannot point to any landmark project it has done in two years to justify the huge borrowings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cImo has collapsed under Gov. Uzodinma. In the past two years, Senator Uzodinma has willfully denied workers and retirees their salaries and pensions. When workers stage protests, they are tagged fake and brutalized by agents of the government. Also, the local government system has been completely emasculated, defunded and stripped of autonomy, thus, giving way for mass misery at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously not the Imo State we envisioned for our children. Within the years under review, Senator Uzodimma has had neither a well-researched policy nor direction in the various sectors of the state. This is the calamity that has befallen our State.\u201d\n\nThe party alleged that within two years, Uzodimma has made Imo the unemployment capital of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that the relevant rating board, the Presidential Business Enabling Environment Council, has consistently placed Imo at the lowest rung of the ladder in terms of ease of doing business in Nigeria. Worse still, within two years, our state ranks highest in the South East in terms of infant and maternal mortality rates,\u201d the PDP said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe wish to encourage the people of Imo State to keep the spirit alive. This regime must expire very soon to give way for a PDP led government for the good of the people.\u201d\n\n",

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily. I\u2019ll do my best to help with some free promotions. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0e \u2014 Frank Donga\u2122 (@frankdonga_) January 12, 2022\n\nMid-way through the suspension period, during his Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence Day anniversary presidential speech in October, President Buhari said the ban would only be lifted if the social media giant met certain conditions.\n\nA number of notable conditions include Twitter setting up a local office or a legal entity in the country, paying taxes locally and cooperating with the Nigerian government to regulate content and harmful tweets.\n\nThe statement on the lifting of the suspension indicates that these conditions have been met\u2014in the first quarter of this year Twitter is expected to establish a legal entity in Nigeria and in 2023 appoint a country representative to interface with Nigerian authorities. The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "ThankUCash targets the BNPL opportunity in Africa after raising $5.3m seed",
          "text": "Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL), a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees, is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, where most people are credit-averse, BNPL activity is just beginning to pick up. But there\u2019s a sense that consumers on the continent will embrace low or no-interest point-of-sale financing options, going by the rate at which Africans now take on loans at ridiculous interest rates to finance their needs. Last September, Australian company Zip acquired South Africa-based BNPL player Payflex, a deal that indicates Africa may be ripe for buy-now-pay-later services.\n\nA number of companies\u2014including neobanks, payment service providers, and traditional banks\u2014have already launched or are looking to roll out BNPL services in Africa. ThankUCash, a Nigeria-based multi-merchant rewards platform, this week said it has raised $5.3 million in seed funding, part of which it plans to spend on adding BNPL infrastructure to its suite of services, which already includes cashback on purchases and deals from merchants.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gone into lending and it is gaining traction, but the main issue has been using the loans for other things rather than for why it was obtained,\u201d co-founder and CEO Simeon Ononobi told TechCabal. \u201cSo we had two options: build out the infrastructure for collecting and paying merchants directly (BNPL) or give out the tokens for such ourselves.\u201d\n\nConsidering there are already several companies offering consumer loans, ThankUCash decided to play in the infrastructure side of things. \u201cWe already have a merchant network and we will keep building it out, so why not use and extend that to our merchants?\u201d the CEO said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThankUCash will provide the tech infrastructure that will connect merchants with loan facilities such that customers can pay directly for goods and services through its Super App, with loans. The company expects to kick off with the Beta \u201cin a few weeks\u201d, according to Ononobi.\n\nIn Nigeria, the majority of existing BNPL services are manual, provided by asset financing companies and sometimes merchants themselves. ThankUCash\u2019s platform will automate this process for its users and merchants. In line with its mission to build infrastructure that powers the emerging industry, Ononobi reveals the startup is currently approaching most players within the space.\n\n\u201cWe will have our machines in stores. So, as customers request loans, we generate a code for it; customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited directly. The code can only be used in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested. Ultimately, the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d Ononobi explained in a statement.\n\nThe opportunity to spread payment over an agreed period is sure to appeal to African consumers, especially in Nigeria where paying the total cost of acquiring high-ticket products at once has become more difficult, due to high inflation (currently at over 15%) and declining purchasing power. For merchants, embracing BNPL helps drive sales and bring in new customers.\n\nThankUCash has already signed a partnership with Nigerian fintech Interswitch to onboard all of the latter\u2019s merchants to boost its network. The company is also in talks with \u201cabout 7 other national and multinational banks\u201d for potential partnerships. \u201cWe\u2019re opening this infrastructure to everybody and want to actually give that platform to loan companies,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Ononobi, Suraj Supekar (Chief Technology Officer), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP, Engineering), Connected Analytics, the parent company of ThankUCash, currently operates in 3 of Nigeria\u2019s major cities\u2014Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt\u2014with a staff strength of about 45 employees.\n\nThe startup claims to have recorded over 600,000 users, with more than 1,000 stores on its platform and processed $80 million-plus in transaction volume within 2 years. Part of the fresh capital will be used to scale operations to other cities across Nigeria, expand to Ghana and Kenya, as well as add a new remittance product.\n\nThe ultimate goal for ThankUCash, according to Ononobi, is to create sustainable solutions for small businesses and merchants to succeed while increasing customer buying power. \u201cThe vision for us is not just for our merchants to be happy because they are staying in business and making money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also want to make spending fun, because with us there is always an opportunity for you\u2014be it cashback, deals, BNPL, or remittances.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What YCombinator\u2019s new $500,000 deal means for African startups",
          "text": "American startup accelerator Y Combinator on Monday, January 10, 2021 announced that it has updated its standard deal for investing in startups, bumping the investment sum from $125,000 to $500,000\u2014still investing $125,000 for a 7% equity stake but now with an additional $375,000 on an uncapped SAFE with Most Favored Nation (MFN) terms.\n\nConsidering that in its 17 years of existence, this is the fourth time the accelerator\u2014which has funded 3,306 startups and 66 African startups\u2014is changing its standard deal, it\u2019s worth looking into what the change means.\n\nInvesting with SAFEs\n\nIntroduced by Y Combinator in late 2013, the SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) is an agreement that gives an investor a future right to own a part of a company (equity).\n\nFor an investor, investing with a SAFE option means putting money into a startup without a set valuation. That is, the investor is providing funding without knowing how much their investment is worth. This is beneficial to founders as they are not pressured early on to give their startups a valuation.\n\nTo protect the investors, SAFEs tend to include a valuation cap\u2014a maximum price at which an investor\u2019s contribution will be converted into equity at the next funding round. This gives investors the right to better terms in a subsequent financing round.\n\nIn the case of YC\u2019s new deal, the accelerator is investing $375,000 at an agreement that it\u2019ll own a future part of a startup. Uncapped means that there\u2019s no defined maximum price at which the $375,000 will be converted to equity. However, the MFN clause implies that instead of fixing a valuation cap, Y Combinator will automatically adopt the lowest cap (or other most favourable terms) issued by another investor the next time the startup raises money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so straightforward, YC is saying that whenever you raise your next round, whatever best terms you get, they\u2019ll match that as the terms for giving you the $375,000,\u201d Zacharias George, Managing Partner at Launch Africa Ventures told TechCabal.\n\nIyinoluwa Aboyeji, General Partner at Future Africa explained that this new deal makes things simpler as before the $125,000 investment issued by Y Combinator was made up of $25,000 for 6% and 1% for a $10m cap i.e $100,000.\n\n\u201cThe additional $375,000 is at no valuation, it\u2019s at the valuation you get when you\u2019re raising from other investors. Startups pick their next valuation, now there\u2019s no expectation that you make it $10m,\u201d Aboyeji said.\n\nNotably, the new deal retains Y Combinator\u2019s 4% pro-rata right\u2014a right that is given to an investor allowing them to maintain their initial level of ownership percentage during later financing rounds. This means Y Combinator still has the right to defend 4% of their stake in companies by investing at a follow-up round.\n\nMore money for growth but potential dilution\n\n\u201cNow startups that get into YC have more money to take on serious growth endeavours,\u201d Aboyeji said. \u201cOne of the issues I\u2019ve had with YC is that $125,000 couldn\u2019t help you in some cases achieve the kind of growth you need to be able to come up on demo day and put up an impressive pitch to get a higher valuation. But with $500,000, there\u2019s a lot you can achieve.\u201d\n\nThe positives are glaring and the announcement is a good move that\u2019s been welcomed by the African startup community. While Hannah Subayi, a board member of the African Business Angel Investors Network (ABAN) agrees with this, she pointed out a potential downside that has been echoed by other investors.\n\nThe MFN clause compels startups to raise at a higher valuation in the next round in order not to give up too much of their ownership to Y Combinator. For instance, if a company raises its next round at a $1 million valuation, the $375,000 investment means that YC gets to own 37.5% of the company!\n\nGeorge believes this isn\u2019t a one-sided affair as Y Combinator\u2019s potential stake could also be heavily diluted if the startup\u2019s next round is at a high valuation. \u201cImagine if the startup raises $10 million at a $100 million valuation, then YC\u2019s $375,000 will be worth just 0.375%,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "How Wiicreate is helping African startups improve brand visibility with branded merchandise",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor anyone familiar with the Nigerian startup space, branded merchandise is often given out as part of the onboarding process or to reward loyal users. Before it became cool, Nigerians frequently used it during naming ceremonies, weddings, and even funerals.\n\nHowever, Oreoluwa Shonibare, Co-founder and CEO of Wiicreate, saw an opportunity to help startups improve their offline marketing campaigns using branded merchandise.\n\nAs a student at Bowen University studying Mass Communication, Public Relations, and Advertising, Shonibare became interested in graphic design. Starting with logos and fliers for students who had events on campus or small businesses looking to create awareness, he soon built a steady list of clients.\n\nDesigning flyers and logos was not all he did, though. He occasionally wrote poetry and soon started putting some of his art on T-shirts. He sold over 100 T-shirts and, in the process, learnt how merchandise could be used to communicate a brand\u2019s value proposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe power of Twitter\n\nAbout to graduate from the university, he saw a tweet from Donald Onwochie, who would later become his first partner. Onwochie was about to start a company and was looking for a co-founder with a graphic design background. Shonibare fit the bill, and he reached out to him.\n\nThis was in 2017, and for a start, they focused on T-shirts, spending time understanding the market and building a sustainable business model. Over the next two years, they designed T-shirts for students and over 30 Nigerian startups, including fintech startups, Cowrywise and PiggyVest.\n\nArmed with more knowledge, they decided to create a product \u2014 Merch box \u2014 in November 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the Wiicreate website\n\n\u201cWe basically help companies curate, ship, and brand merchandise ranging from T-shirts to water bottles, hoodies and thank you cards, just name it. Anything that can help you physically market your brand.\u201d\n\nWith Merch box, Wiicreate has been able to automate the entire process of sourcing, printing, and shipping merchandise for brands and individuals. On the website, users can choose from a wide range of merch options, put in their required quantity, and place their orders.\n\nAssuming the desired merch option is not available, users can place specific requests on the platform. They can choose from three product options \u2013 the starter, classic, and premium pack for \u20a615,000 ($27), \u20a625,000 ($45), and \u20a635,000 ($63), respectively.\n\n\u201cWe handle everything from the design to distribution basically. One thing that we are doing is that we are trying to automate the process and actually just change the way people see the ordering of merchandise.\u201d\n\nFor Shonibare, branded merchandise is capable of communicating a brand\u2019s personality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA lot of people say fintechs have very similar brand elements. Everybody uses blue, but when you see a Cowrywise merch, you know it\u2019s a Cowrywise merch. When you see a PiggyVest merch, you know it\u2019s a PiggyVest merch, and it is in the personality of these different brands even though they offer somewhat similar values.\u201d\n\nShonibare reveals that Wiicreate worked with over 100 startups across Africa in 2021, including Mono, Brass, and Thepeer, shipping to five countries and making $200,000 in revenue.\n\nA4 documents everywhere you go\n\nBranded merchandise is not all that Wiicreate does, as the company has recently launched Qwiik, an online printing service for A4 documents. With Qwiik, users can print and have their A4 documents delivered to any part of the country. Shonibare believes that this is the future of cybercafes.\n\n\u201cA4 documents are the most printed and probably the most essential print product in the world because you need A4 documents for basically anything you want to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerch for AfriChange. Source: Twitter\n\n\u201cSay you want to fill a form for visa application, you want to get a transcript, you want to send your transcript somewhere, you want to send your account statement; there are just so many use cases. If you want to send your documents to somebody, you don\u2019t have to go to the place. Qwiik is basically what the future of cybercafes looks like.\u201d\n\nThe cost of printing documents on Qwiik is similar to what you\u2019ll get at most cybercafes. Delivery options include same-day delivery, which costs \u20a61,200 ($2), next-day delivery for \u20a6800 ($1.5), and standard delivery (1-3 days) for \u20a6500 ($0.9).\n\nFor a one-page document that I wanted to be delivered to Osun State, the delivery fee was \u20a62,500 ($4) with an estimated delivery time of 1-3 days. In addition to printing documents online, Qwiik also provides PDF tools that let users edit, merge, or delete parts of their documents.\n\nOn challenges and building for the future\n\nBuilding a business usually comes with peculiar challenges, and Shonibare reveals that those that Wiicreate has faced are a bit different from what most Nigerian companies encounter. For starters, while merchandising is not a novel concept in the country, only a few companies have used tech in the way Wiicreate has done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerch for Pandar. Source: Twitter\n\nThat means that the company has had to chart its course, discovering unique challenges and adapting to them without any manual. He, however, admits that they have been able to draw inspiration from foreign companies like SwagUp and Canva.\n\nBalancing growth and learning is another area where the startup has faced some challenges, with Shonibare revealing that growth has not always been at the same pace as learning.\n\n\u201cSometimes we\u2019re growing faster than our learning, and some other times, we\u2019re learning faster than we\u2019re growing.\u201d\n\nWith a team strength of about 20, Shonibare reveals that the plan is to become the biggest merchandising company in Africa, working with more startups on the continent and growing revenue to millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cWe currently have seven unicorns in Africa, and there will be more. Just like we have been able to play our part with 95 startups, we hope to do that for 5,000 startups on the continent.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Apart from the rare acquisition or the glance at funding news headlines, the startup scene was not really my thing.\n\nFast forward a few weeks into my internship, and you\u2019d usually find me on Twitter, doom scrolling Lists and Profiles. On one such occasion, I found WiiCreate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe brainchild of Oreoluwa Shonibare and David Onwochie, WiiCreate was founded in 2017 after a tweet by the latter. Onwochie was looking for a co-founder with a graphic design background, and Shonibare fit the bill to a tee.\n\nSince 2017, the company has served over 100 startups across Africa with companies like Cowrywise, Bumpa, Piggyvest, Klasha, among others choosing to throw in their hats with WiiCreate\n\nAlso, WiiCreate currently boasts two products: Merch box and Qwiik. While Merch box helps companies brand, ship and curate merchandise, Qwik allows anyone to send A4 documents anywhere in Nigeria.\n\nLet me explain: Say you are in Lagos and want to apply for a job in Abuja, which requires you to submit your documents physically. All you have to do is go to Qwiik\u2019s website, upload the necessary documents in PDF format, choose how you want them to be printed, fill in the address, and voila, your document is on its way.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m letting too much out of the bag here, but if you are still curious, please watch out for Chimgozirm\u2019s article later today. There\u2019s some inside gist I\u2019m not telling you yet.\n\nMorocco\u2019s digital nation ambitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarrakech. Djemaa el Fna.\n\nCrazy things are happening in Morocco: On Friday, January 14, 2022, Ghita Mezzour, Minister Delegate to the Head of Government in charge of Digital Transition and Administration Reform, announced the launch of the initiative \u201cMoroccoTech.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe not so crazy, but what\u2019s MoroccoTech? According to Mezzour, it is the national brand to promote the Moroccan digital sector. The idea is to position the country as a digital destination of choice internationally while creating a global dynamic that will benefit all Moroccan ecosystems in their digital transformation.\n\nIn 2021, Moroccan startups hit a record-high of $29 million in funding, perhaps an indication of the country\u2019s burgeoning tech ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was worse: In 2017, the Moroccan government sought a $50 million loan from the World Bank to close the funding gap for tech startups and going by this analysis, there was quite a lot wrong with the ecosystem.\n\nFrom a nascent private equity scene to lack of access to credit to restrictive regulations, Morocco\u2019s investment scene required some push. Personally, I\u2019m not sure most African countries were all that different.\n\nAt some point in the country\u2019s recent history, Moroccans could not enjoy the use of WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, or even YouTube.\n\nThe launch of MoroccoTech should hopefully see more Moroccan startup success stories. At least, much better than has been heard in the last few years.\n\nTL;DR: Morocco is looking for outside investments into its tech ecosystem.\n\nWhat you missed last week, maybe\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nThis weekend, I finally listened to/watched Stromae\u2019s Racine Carr\u00e9e concert. All the chills! Also listened to his latest song and I can\u2019t wait for the album to go live. Emphasis on can\u2019t wait.\n\nA lot of people have been quick to cash in on the NFT craze, some in ways you wouldn\u2019t believe. Here\u2019s a restaurant selling memberships through NFTs\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to visit Japan. Right now, however, I have to settle for videos like this. On a totally unrelated note, I watched this immediately after.\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Build 2021 is this week!!! Register here.

          "title": "Real estate as NFTs, social media in the metaverse: Projections for blockchain in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn December 9, 2021, Technext held the maiden edition of Technext Coinference, a cryptocurrency and blockchain event, in Lagos, Nigeria. Barely a month later, some of the discussions at the event are becoming very key crypto and blockchain innovations to look out for in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event kicked off with a keynote by the Nigerian Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.\n\nEven though the Nigerian government has not been particularly fond of cryptocurrencies, Agba made some interesting comments about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. He mentioned use cases for blockchain that could turn the tides in some sectors of the country.\n\nStoring land as NFTs\n\nThe Minister said blockchain technology \u201copens up numerous possibilities for optimisation in our current systems across industries. And could be the biggest disruptor in finance and governance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCiting how blockchain could be harnessed to store real estate information, he said, \u201cin real estate and trade, we can harness blockchain to create and store all lands in their base units of a plot as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\u201d\n\nThis could go a long way in tracking the historical ownership of land on the blockchain. People can own lands and list them for sale the same way they own art on OpenSea, Rarible, and other NFT marketplaces.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nA piece of land has to be tokenised, just like artworks, collectables, and music. Information about the land will be included, and it will be uploaded (minted) on a blockchain.\n\nAccording to Finextra, tokenising real estate could also mean that several people can own a property together, giving more people without the financial wherewithal the opportunity to invest in real estate.\n\nOwning real estate outside the country would also be possible. Buying a house in another country could be as easy as shopping online. Once a property is listed on a marketplace with all the necessary information stored on a blockchain, ownership details go to the buyer. And with the help of smart contracts, third parties would not be needed.\n\nWhile these sound very interesting, Agba believes regulation still has to be put in place.\n\n\u201cTo have a fruitful conversation about the regulation of any industry, it is first important to have an understanding of the structure of governance overseeing the industry .\u201d\n\nThis, however, remains a challenge. The Minister said there is the question of who has the power to regulate cryptocurrency, a decision that can only be reached based on how cryptocurrency is classified \u2014 as a security, currency, or an asset.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto and naira will work together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R Uzoma Dozie, Sparkle CEO and Buchi Okoro, Quidax CEO. Source: Technext\n\nFor a while, there has been a narrative that cryptocurrencies will replace fiat currencies such as the naira and the dollar. However, Buchi Okoro, CEO of crypto exchange, Quidax, doesn\u2019t think so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really had the thought that Bitcoin would replace the naira. I believe that it is supposed to be a collaborative system where crypto works with local currencies to make life better for everybody,\u201d Okoro said.\n\nHe believes fiat currencies will continue to be relevant to finance the same way digital communication will not replace physical communication; they will work together to enhance each other.\n\nOne area crypto will enhance fiat currencies is cross border transactions. This use case has been one of the earliest for cryptocurrencies. A trader in Nigeria, for instance, can swiftly pay his Chinese counterpart with crypto.\n\nOne of the conventional methods of cross border transfers is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). Transactions on it take up to four days to be completed. Sending via crypto takes a significantly less amount of time with lower fees.\n\nSocial media is going to the metaverse\n\nThe metaverse, NFT, and Web3 were some of the biggest buzzwords of 2021 in the crypto sphere. When social media giant, Facebook, changed its name to Meta, the metaverse got even more attention, and according to Forbes, it is a trillion-dollar revenue opportunity.\n\nDuring a panel session at the Technext Coinference, Okoro said, \u201ca lot of engagements that will happen in the future will happen in the metaverse. The things we do on Twitter and Instagram will be done in the metaverse.\u201d\n\nHe added that it will change the way we interact and how we live day-to-day life. Life as we know it could move to a virtual world. Digital platforms already play a vital role in many aspects of human life.\n\nAlthough Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, did not say Meta\u2019s social media platforms will be turned into a metaverse, he did say, \u201cFrom now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first.\u201d\n\nLike most innovations, the metaverse is still at the very early stages, and only a few people have experienced it. But with the commercial perks cited by Forbes, more investments could go into the metaverse, and we could subsequently see it go mainstream.\n\nSolana is the blockchain to watch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanu Fejiro Abodje, Patricia CEO.

The chain has been praised for its fast transaction speed of over 2000 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin that are only capable of about 15 transactions per second.\n\nDespite the rapid transaction speed, the fees are very low, with an average cost per transaction of $000.25.\n\nFast transactions and low fees aren\u2019t the only things that make Solana a blockchain to watch. It brings ease and simplicity to using crypto platforms, reducing the financial barrier of participating in activities such as NFTs and decentralised finance (DeFI).\n\nAfrican NFT project, Afrobubble, was created on the Solana blockchain because of the ease the chain brings to buying and selling NFTs.\n\nAccording to Chainalysis 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index, worldwide adoption jumped over 880%, with Nigeria and Kenya among the top ten countries with the highest adoption rate. If this trend continues, we could see some of these projections come true in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s 3 presidents since 1999 have mixed legacies",
          "text": "No Nigerian president has ever won the coveted Mo Ibrahim leadership prize, which recognises exceptional leaders and rewards them with an enormous $5 million lump payment spread over 10 years. That in itself is an indictment on the legacy of Nigerian leaders since the awards began in 2006.\n\nAfter eight tumultuous years of social, political and economic experimentation on Nigeria and its citizens, General Ibrahim Babangida was forced to leave office. Hounded by a citizenry fatigued of being trialled with, and angered over the annulment of what would be one of Nigeria\u2019s freest elections, Babangida handed over power to an interim government led by a businessman, Ernest Shonekan.\n\nThat arrangement was not to last, as Shonekan was booted out of office less than three months later, on November 17, 1993, by the military. It was a palace coup that was executed against the background of a High Court ruling in early November 1993, that the Interim National Government \u2013 Babangida\u2019s stop-gap measure on the eve of his \u2018stepping aside\u2019 from power, was illegal. General Sani Abacha installed himself as Nigeria\u2019s new ruler.\n\nHaving spent much of his time as a political general in the shadows of Babangida, Abacha\u2019s politico-psychological profile was almost a mystery to Nigerians.\n\nPolitical scientist and the Warren Weinstein Chair of African Studies at Johns Hopkins University, Peter M. Lewis, noted of Nigeria\u2019s military regimes, that the fall-outs from a series of coups and counter-coups had fragmented and demoralised the military organisation. Also, the dissolution of parties and legislative bodies, the intrusive manipulation of the judiciary throughout the transition crisis had depleted other institutional pillars of the state thereby widening the realm of personal control.\n\nAbacha, Peter noted, fully availed himself of these instruments of control, extending repression, enervating the political class and conducting pre-emptive indictments against perceived opponents.\n\nHe rapidly sought to maximise his powers. It was a predatory regime that Professor Kunle Amowun, noted, was characterised by a distinctive pattern of economic management, including arbitrary change, deficit financing, capital flight and the chronic and unrecorded leakage of funds.\n\nIn the realm of social choice, the \u2018rationality\u2019 of the market was vitiated by the \u2018logic\u2019 of rent-seeking. By dismantling SAP, through the 1994 budget, in favour of a statist or dirigiste economic policy \u2013 but certainly not a nationalist agenda, as Lewis observed \u2013 Abacha set the tone and tenor to pocket the economy and privatise state finances.\n\nThe process of disintegration of the state was set in motion through a combination of repressive tactics, with the intent of ensuring both a physical and political withdrawal, from the social space, of notable politicians and key citizens that could threaten a planned self-succession bid.\n\nAbacha\u2019s attempt at economic positivism included creating the Failed Banks Tribunal set up to investigate thieving bank chieftains, which soon degenerated into a witch-hunt. While he promised fiscal discipline like all before him and increased the country\u2019s foreign reserve from less than $1 billion to over $8 billion, Abacha was loose with Nigeria\u2019s finances.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy, argued Kayode Fayemi in 1999, did not escape Abacha\u2019s grip. He ran it as a personal fiefdom. Unlike Babangida who parcelled out the state to friends and mentors within the military, Abacha kept the spoils of office for himself and his family, a small coterie of his security apparatus and his small circle of foreign friends.\n\nAbacha, Nigeria\u2019s maximum leader ruled the country until June 8, 1998, when he died. At the time of his death, Abacha\u2019s personal wealth was estimated to be around $3 \u2013 $6 billion.\n\nGeneral Abdulsalam Abubakar took over as Nigeria\u2019s head of state after Abacha\u2019s death. Plucked from political obscurity where he had been known as the uninspiring name behind the constitution of coup panels as Chief of Defense Staff, Abubakar tried to liberalise Nigeria\u2019s noxious socio-political space. He let political prisoners go, repealed repressive edicts and paid some of the country\u2019s debts.\n\nTo acquire international legitimacy, Abubakar began a transition programme midwifed by the newly created Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). On May 29, 1999, less than a year after he assumed power, he left office after handing over to Olusegun Obasanjo and brought into fruition Nigeria\u2019s Fourth Republic, the longest in the country\u2019s political environment, for which he is fondly remembered, and remains his most obvious legacy.\n\nThe great debt relief\n\nPerhaps, Nigeria\u2019s most consequential president, Obasanjo, a former military Head of State, retired general and political prisoner under General Abacha assumed office on May 29, 1999. Obasanjo had assumed office in a season of despair.\n\nAs president, Obasanjo polished his legacy of engagement in two transitions from military dictatorship to constitutional government by affirming his resolute opposition to militarism as a form of government. In 2005, though, a dark splodge nearly ruined the former president\u2019s legacy of commitment to democracy. As noted by the Journal of Democracy in 2006, \u201cHe evidently favoured consideration of a constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to seek a third term despite widespread public disapproval of any such manoeuvre. By graciously accepting the defeat of the amendment, Obasanjo has solidified his contribution to Nigerian democracy, but much remains to be done.\u201d\n\nInternationally, Obasanjo restored Nigeria\u2019s status as a major African power after years of isolation under Abacha, a feat yet to be matched since he left office in 2007.\n\nHe launched a war against corruption and created the two major agencies that drive anti-corruption efforts in the country today: The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC).\n\nRead also: The \u201cBMC\u201d phenomenon \u2013 Buhari\u2019s worst legacy\n\nIt is on the macro-economic level that Obasanjo gets top marks. He brought in economic reformers whose budget discipline enabled Nigeria to build over $40 billion in foreign reserves and persuaded creditors to write off $18 billion in debts. A 2007 IMF report noted then that, \u201cGDP growth and increases in per capita income have doubled in the last five years compared with the previous two decades.\u201d Inflation is down to single digits. Reserves have risen to $41 billion.\n\nNigeria under Obasanjo shook off the economic malaise of the 1980s and 1990s; a time says Jonathan Power, \u201cof recession, declining incomes and rapid inflation\u2014as well as at least some of its maladministration and corruption.\u201d The country\u2019s credit rating appreciated enough to issue bonds on the global market.\n\nUnder Obasanjo, the prevalence of fake drugs in the country fell from 41 percent to 17 percent, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nMore than anything else, Obasanjo\u2019s major legacy would remain the debt relief he secured for the country. He would always be remembered as the only Nigerian leader who unchained his country from the debilitating debt burden that arrested economic growth and development. While he met a debt of some $32 billion in 1999, Obasanjo helped to negotiate a debt relief that left the country with less than $3 billion in debt in 2006.\n\nPeace in the delta\n\nOn May 29, 2007, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, then governor of Katsina State, succeeded Obasanjo as president. He was Obasanjo\u2019s handpicked candidate; a hitherto unknown and publicity-shy politician who\u2019d lived most of his political life under the shadow of his more powerful and influential brother, Shehu, who had served as Obasanjo\u2019s deputy between 1976 and 1979.\n\nFor many in Lagos, Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s legacy is assured. For almost four years, former President Olusegun Obasanjo had refused to release federal allocations to Lagos State, claiming the creation of 37 Local Council Development Authority (LCDAs) by former Governor Bola Tinubu was an assault on the nation\u2019s Constitution. A couple of months after assuming office as president, Yar\u2019Adua reversed the policy and released all the withheld allocations, running into billions, to Lagos.\n\nPerhaps Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s greatest legacy is the peace he brought to the Niger Delta. Against the tense background of violence, agitations and attacks on oil infrastructure by militants in the region, Yar\u2019Adua in 2009 granted unconditional amnesty for violent actors operating there as a means of ensuring sustainable peace and development in the oil-producing region.\n\nThe granting of amnesty was unmistakably innovative as a mechanism for peace-building. On June 24, 2009, the Federal Government officially opened a two-month amnesty window to all militants in the Niger Delta region in exchange for their demobilisation and disarmament. Upon surrendering their weapons, militants began to receive financial compensation from the government over a period of time.\n\nWhile the rationale for the amnesty and its effectiveness remains debatable, the cessation of almost a decade long armed struggle by the militants was as dramatic as it was surprising. It brought relative peace to the Niger Delta region.\n\nHowever, no doubt, one of Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s biggest failures was the fact Boko Haram began their murderous rage during his reign.\n\nVictory in defeat\n\nGoodluck Jonathan had been personally handpicked by former President Obasanjo as vice-president to Yar\u2019Adua. A former teacher and civil servant, he was the governor of the oil-rich Bayelsa State when he was tapped to run alongside Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nHis biggest achievement during his five years in office is the legacy of a tremendously improved electoral system to such an extent, which he admits, \u201cthat I, as an incumbent lost to an opposition candidate; a personal loss I consider a win for the Nigerian nation. I had every instrument of state coercion at my disposal to undermine and compromise the electoral process to my incumbent advantage but I refused to do so because I placed the interest of Nigeria ahead of my personal interest.\u201d\n\nHis government promulgated the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act in 2011, to expand media freedom and give people reasonable access to information on the activities of government for the good of society.\n\nNo other leader in the history of the country has encouraged female participation in governance as Jonathan did. Some 35 percent of profile appointments made by Jonathan went to the women. In addition, he also opened up the Nigerian Defense Academy (NDA) to women.\n\nWhile the jury is still out on the outcome of the process, Jonathan privatised the power sector, taking the inefficient power infrastructure that bedevilled the country out of the hands of the government, thus saving billions of taxpayer funds.\n\nHis biggest failure, no doubt, was his inability to end the Boko Haram crisis that has devastated the Northern region. Under his leadership, Boko Haram kidnapped 276 secondary school girls from Chibok in Borno State in April 2014. Before then, in February that year, 59 boys had been killed at the Federal Government College of Buni Yadi in Yobe State when it was attacked by Boko Haram.",

Despite his obvious struggles on the stage that was clearly bigger than him at that point in his career, I noticed a group of people a few tables away who seemed to be having the absolute time of their lives.\n\nNone of us knew this upcomer or the songs he was performing, but the people at that table seemed to know all the lyrics. They sang along enthusiastically and even got up to dance. Soon, by the sheer power of peer pressure, people at the tables around them \u2013 myself included \u2013 began to bop their heads and tap their fingers to a performance that was markedly mediocre. These guys whooped and hollered their way through his entire performance, having a similar effect on everyone around them until he left the stage to the sound of what was definitely a warmer applause than his performance deserved.\n\nIt was not until I saw him after the show with the people from that table and I recognised some of them, that I realised what had just happened. The table in question was a corporate table given to a radio station that was a media partner to this event. Those sitting at the table were in fact radio personalities who were involved in promoting new artists, and he was one of the artists under their management. They strategically placed themselves in the audience to shill for him, and I had been suckered into putting my hands together for a forgettable performance. With this experience, I was able to comprehend the depths of a different type of shilling which came to my attention a few months later.\n\n\u201cBuhari new media centre\u201d \u2013 A propaganda machine\n\nIt started out as a bunch of rumours within the media industry, about a well funded but secretive organisation working at the junction of parastatal, political action group and media agency. The Buhari New Media Centre, or Buhari Media Centre, according to these rumours, was an entity spun out of the Buhari Media Organisation, which primarily worked from locations in Lagos and Abuja, with strong funding and logistical support from people inside and close to the Buhari administration. This shadowy but well-connected entity apparently existed to do only one thing \u2013 to push any narrative that glorified or boosted the Retired General\u2019s image and to vehemently attack anything else.\n\nSlowly the rumours of the existence of a \u201cBMC\u201d became self evident truths, as almost overnight, a new genre of agenda-driven commentators appeared across Facebook, Nairaland, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Instagram. These commentators sometimes posted under the real accounts linked to their everyday lives, but more often than not, they employed a dizzying number of sock-puppet social media accounts. All of these efforts were deployed to push the sole narrative of the president\u2019s purported excellence.\n\nRead also: Buhari charges EFCC board to strengthen war against financial crimes\n\nWhat made the phenomenon even more concerning was that it was not restricted only to so-called New Media. In 2017, I was friends with a radio host who would complain bitterly to me about a group of callers who had somehow managed to hijack and monopolise the call-in segment on her daily morning talk show. These callers, she said, had only positive things to say about General Buhari and the government, even to the point of sounding delirious and losing credibility. The problem was that it was her show that would suffer credibility loss and haemorrhage listeners. The callers would simply move on to the next popular show to repeat the trick.\n\nPrint media was not spared either. Seemingly every other day, there would appear an op-ed, an opinion column, an analysis piece or a sponsored news story planted by this pro-Buhari, pseudo-parastatal entity. All the major terrestrial television stations would bring on people to speak on current affairs as \u201copinion makers,\u201d but the only qualification that apparently qualified them for this status was the caption \u201cAPC Member.\u201d In one especially shameful episode in 2020, one Ayodele Oyalowo \u2013 an individual of exactly no prior pedigree \u2013 appeared on Channels Television to inform a national audience that a VAT increase would only affect those who buy their consumer goods from supermarkets.\n\nWhy BMC is Buhari\u2019s worst legacy\n\nGeneral Buhari has done some terrible things over the past 6 and a half years. As we meander into the final 17 months he will ever spend at the helm of Nigeria, he will probably add to that list. He has overseen the massacre of thousands of unarmed members of the Shia Islamic Movement of Nigeria. He has overseen the massacre of unarmed protesters at Lekki Toll Gate, who were simply demanding an end to wanton police brutality. He has taken on the biggest local and external debt burden in Nigeria\u2019s post-colonial history. He has banned a major social media app because of a personal temper tantrum. He has overseen an unbelievably illiterate and counter-productive border closure on Nigeria\u2019s busiest international trade route.\n\nAll of these are objectively terrible things, but none of them come close to the spectre raised by the so-called BMC. This is my personal assessment and I will explain why. Now Buhari did not invent the use of shadowy propaganda outfits by state actors looking to engage with their audiences below the line. Former South African president Jacob Zuma famously used the British PR agency Bell Poittinger to push divisive narratives at home so as to keep negative political attention resulting from corruption scandals off him. Even ex president Goodluck Jonathan allegedly had a \u201c40 Laptop Crew\u201d doing something broadly similar to what the BMC does, at the time working under the supervision of former Information Minister Labaran Maku.\n\nThe reason why the BMC phenomenon is so much worse than all these is the sheer scale of it. If you want to have an idea of how big and sprawling this BMC monster is, you can type \u201cBNMC\u201d into your Twitter search box, and observe the number of handles belonging to BNMC state chapters across Nigeria. The lowest level operatives whose job is to deny, dissemble and disinform allegedly get paid a regular monthly stipend of N30,000. This figure goes all the way up to N500,000 for certain senior BMC employees. I have one question about all of this:\n\nWhere a president and his administration already have NTA, Radio Nigeria, Voice of Nigeria, a Minister of Information, and no fewer than 6 media and new media aides \u2013 each with their own fully funded and equipped office, what more does he need to have in order to get his point across? If despite being able to get his point across using any of this plethora of channels, the president decides that his interests are best served by equipping a group of online criminals to shill relentlessly and fight guerrilla warfare for him, then what are his goals exactly?\n\nMore importantly, what happens to the infrastructure built around the BMC phenomenon when General Buhari leaves power? Does it simply cease to exist, or does the next guy merely take it to another level, like Buhari himself did with President Jonathan\u2019s \u201c40 Laptop Crew?\u201d\n\nQuestions, questions.",

We don\u2019t need that central model. We don\u2019t need a central hospital any more.

          "text": "Nigeria exported 17.9 million metric tons (MMT) of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in 2021 to top African exporters chart.\n\nThis is according a report published by leading information provider IHS Markit.\n\nNigeria was followed by Algeria with 12.3 MMT, while Egypt came third with 6.9 MMT.\n\nThe United States added 25 million metric tons of LNG capacity owing to an expansion in liquefaction capacity, coupled with average utilization of plants increasing to 98 per cent in the third quarter of last year.\n\nThe report tipped U.S. and China to represent the top export and import markets, respectively, for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in 2022.\n\nFor the U.S., the position represents a shift upward from being the third-largest LNG exporter in 2021 at 73.6 million metric tons (MMt), following Australia (83 MMt) and Qatar (81.3 MMt).\n\nLNG development in the U.S. accelerated pre-pandemic due to the U.S. shale revolution and growing liquidity in LNG markets, including the commissioning of Venture Global\u2019s 10 million tons per annum (MTPA) Calcasieu Pass LNG project, Tellurian\u2019s 27.6 MTPA Driftwood LNG project and Cheniere\u2019s Sabine Pass Train 6 facility.\n\nInvestments in gas and LNG capacity over the past 24 months were made under the assumption that oversupply in the LNG market would dissipate after 2021, and that demand growth would exceed incremental supply thereafter. While short- and medium-term demand for LNG exports faced uncertainty in the early part of the pandemic, industry experts remained confident that demand would recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2021 and beyond in mature markets, and even expand in emerging markets due to a low-price environment that would boost consumption.\n\nOn its part, China already represented the top importer of LNG in 2021, importing 81 MMt in 2021 and replacing Japan as the largest LNG importer globally.\n\nThe leading Asian country has witnessed a significant surge in natural gas demand in the last year, with economic growth reaching 8 per cent and electricity consumption growing by 10 per cent.\n\nThe IHS report stressed that, \u201cLNG Trade in 2021: Runaway Recovery,\u201d over 65 MTPA of long-term contracts were signed in 2021, rebounding to an all-time high after pausing in 2020. Even before the pandemic, the global LNG market was experiencing a shift away from long-term contracts with minimum purchase obligations and complex pricing structures, as LNG spot cargo was available at nearly half the price as LNG cargo under long-term contracts.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, the report notes that spot LNG prices have skyrocketed above their oil price equivalent, settling at $40 per million British thermal units by December 2021 and no doubt contributing to the return to long-term contracts.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigeria exported 17.9 million metric tons (MMT) of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in 2021 to top African exporters chart.\nThe report tipped U.S. and China to represent the top export and import markets, respectively, for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in 2022.\nFor the U.S., the position represents a shift upward from being the third-largest LNG exporter in 2021 at 73.6 million metric tons (MMt), following Australia (83 MMt) and Qatar (81.3 MMt).\nOn its part, China already represented the top importer of LNG in 2021, importing 81 MMt in 2021 and replacing Japan as the largest LNG importer globally.\nThe IHS report stressed that, \u201cLNG Trade in 2021: Runaway Recovery,\u201d over 65 MTPA of long-term contracts were signed in 2021, rebounding to an all-time high after pausing in 2020.",

          "text": "The Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock rose from N32.9tn as of December 2020 to N39.6tn in November 2021, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, has disclosed.\n\nAhmed, in her presentation of the 2022 approved budget, revealed that the government borrowed N6.7tn between January and November 2021.\n\nThe new borrowing in the period under review consists of N5.1tn domestic debt and N1.6tn foreign debt. The domestic debt, however, includes borrowing from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), according to the presentation document.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) had In March 2021, disclosed that the country\u2019s total public debt stock was N32.9tn as of December 2020.\n\nAn additional N6.7tn loan means the total public debt stock would be about N39.6tn as of November 2021.\n\nAccording to the DMO, the country\u2019s total public debt increased to N33.1tn at the end of the first quarter of 2021, from N32.9tn in December 2020, showing an increase of about 200bn.\n\nIn Q2 2021, the total debt stock rose by N2.4tn to N35.5tn by June 2021.\n\nThe increase continued by N2.5tn to hit N38tn by Q3 2021, which was the last figure provided by the DMO.\n\nHowever, based on the minister\u2019s presentation, there was an increase of N1.6tn from September to November 2021.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that that within the 11-month period, debt servicing gulped N4.2tn which represents 76.2 per cent of the N5.51tn revenue generated during the period.\n\nThe minister defended government borrowing and the country\u2019s debt level, insisting the country had a revenue challenge, and not a debt problem, adding that the debt level was still within sustainable limits.\n\nShe had said, \u201cThis is to restate, that the debt level of the Federal Government is still within sustainable limits. Borrowings are essentially for capital expenditure and human development as specified in Section 41(1)a of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\n\u201cHaving witnessed two economic recessions we have had to spend our way out of recession, which contributed significantly to the growth in the public debt. \u201cIt is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have been as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded partly by debt.\u201d\n\nHowever, economic experts, including a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria and former presidential candidate, Kingsley Moghalu, have countered the minister.\n\nMoghalu had said, \u201cThere are many ways through which we can improve Nigeria\u2019s domestic revenue situation without selling the future of our country. As to the argument that Nigeria does not have a debt problem but a revenue problem, that is mere sophistry. If you\u2019re spending 90kobo of every one naira you earn repaying debt, you are insolvent.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say that we have a debt-to-GDP ratio that allows you to continue borrowing. No! That is an argument for sustainable economies. You cannot be comparing Nigeria with advanced economies. We are in an economy that is still very basic.\n\n\u201cIf you are not earning enough revenue, why are you borrowing? You are just compounding your problem. Why don\u2019t you focus on where to get the revenue from instead of lazily ignoring that problem and just trying to survive with borrowing?\n\n\u201cIf an individual was living a life that way, it would be a calamity. That is why Nigeria is in a calamitous situation today economically,\u201d he said.\n\nThe World Bank had recently said Nigeria\u2019s debt was vulnerable and costly, adding that the country\u2019s debt was at risk of becoming unsustainable in the event of macro-fiscal shocks.",

Mai Mala Buni, on Sunday, praised President Muhammadu Buhari for his untiring efforts at restoring peace and normalcy particularly to the troubled north-eastern part of the country.\n\nBuni acknowledged that there is now a significant improvement in the security situation in the North-East particularly in Yobe State.\n\nThe Yobe governor also commended the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan. for providing the right leadership at the National Assembly and for providing the much needed support and cooperation to enable the executive arm of government perform.\n\nBuni spoke at the 2022 Annual Machina Cultural Festival which started on Monday and ended on Sunday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBuni said the large and peaceful congregation that witnessed the cultural festival was an evidence that the security situation had improved.\n\nHe thanked President Buhari for providing the security personnel the required resources to secure lives and property in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this, the people in the north eastern part of the country can now sleep with their two eyes closed.\n\n\u201cIn case there is still anybody in doubt, this large congregation at this event is enough proof that the security situation has improved,\u201d Buni said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBuni also thanked the traditional rulers, other community leaders and Imams for their prayers which, from evidence, had been answered by God.\n\nGovernor Buni also made glowing remarks about the Senate President for leading a legislative arm which provided cooperation and support needed for the executive arm to deliver on its mandate to the people.\n\nHe said the various projects that the government had executed or are now being implemented were the results of the cooperation and support which once eluded the Buhari\u2019s administration the first four years but are now being provided by the current Assembly.\n\n\u201cI have earlier acknowledged Ahmad Lawan as Sardaunan Bade. He is not Sardaunan Bade alone but Sardaunan of Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe was voted here as a Senator because this is his constituency. But God has made him Senate President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u201cSince he assumed office as Senate President, the support and cooperation that he gives the executive arm of government led by President Muhammadu Buhari has brought about the development in the country that we are witnessing today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat cooperation and support by the current National Assembly is what is responsible for the development we are seeing today in Nigeria because the first four years of President Buhari, he did not enjoy this kind of cooperation and support by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis is why we are seeing projects of national and rural development and the likes and these projects will get to you here very soon,\u201d Buni said.\n\nBesides Lawan and Buni, governors of Jigawa State, Alhaji Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and Kebbi State, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu were also at Machina to witness the cultural festival.\n\nLawan and the three governors were all honoured with chieftaincy titles by the chief host, the Emir of Machina, HRH Alhaji Dr. Bashir Albishir Bukar Machinama.\n\nThe Machina Paramount ruler gave Lawan letter of appointment as the Danmasani Machina.\n\nLawan was once Danmasani Bade but having been elevated by the Bade Emirate Council in Yobe State as Sardaunan Bade, his first son, Ibrahim Ahmad Lawan now bears the title.\n\nBuni received a letter of appointment as Zanna Gargamma, Jigawa State Governor as Dugajin Machina and Kebbi State Governor as Dan Maliki Machina.\n\nThe week-long activities which became an annual event in 2006 were rounded off on Sunday with grand Durban which was a beautiful display of horsemanship and led by the Machina Paramount ruler himself, HRH Alhaji Dr. Bashir Albishir Bukar.\n\nThe colourful event was also witnessed by the Shehu of Borno, HRH.

Make this facility impregnable.\n\n\u201cIt is a red zone, dangerous zone. Whoever attempts to breach the security here is already dead. He must not live to tell the story. Other people will tell his or her story.\n\n\u201cAny effort to breach our facility is not acceptable. Don\u2019t shoot to injure, shoot to kill. Don\u2019t shoot to disable, shoot to kill.\n\n\u201cThis is a total embodiment of the state to guarantee the security of the people.\n\n\u201cWe will do our best regarding your welfare to ensure effective service. I must commend your work for not recording any case of COVID-19 in your facility.\n\n\u201cBut most importantly, you must be effective in preventing the penetration of this facility. You must have the capacity to repel viciously any attempt to penetrate this facility.\u201d\n\nAregbesola at a recent Ministerial Press Briefing at the Aso Villa, 4,860 inmates of the Nigerian correctional centres have escaped from those facilities between 2020 and 2021 alone following successful jailbreaks in Benin, Owerri, and Oyo, among others.\n\nAlso, only 954 of that number have been rearrested. That was before the recent jailbreak at the Jos Medium Security Custodial Centre, which resulted in 9 fatalities and escape of 252 inmates. The 252 on the loose are apart from the 10 rearrested",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari will Tuesday unveil the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\u2019s huge Rice Pyramids in Abuja.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the mega rice pyramids project is a collaboration of the CBN with Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN).\n\nInformation obtained from the apex bank\u2019s official website stated that the pyramids, which it described as the largest in the world, were enabled by the CBN\u2019s Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP).\n\nIt stated that the ABP, since inauguration in November, 2015, had increased the average yield of rice per hectare from 1.8 metric tonnes to five metric tonnes, while discouraging importation of the commodity.\n\n\u201cThe ABP has enabled 95 per cent reduction of Nigeria\u2019s annual rice import bill from 1.5 billion dollars in 2015 to 18.5 million dollars.\n\n\u201d It has also created 12.8 million direct and indirect jobs across different value chains and food belts of the country, \u201d it said.\n\nThe CBN said in spite of challenges of flooding during the wet season, the COVID-19 pandemic and lingering insecurity in 2020 and 2021, it was still able to work with other stakeholders to inspire farmers to reap a bountiful harvest.\n\nIt added that similar rice and maize pyramids had been unveiled in states like Kebbi, Niger, Gombe, Ekiti, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, some stakeholders have commended the apex bank for the ABP initiative and support to farmers.\n\nA farmer, Abubakar Alli, said the idea of the ABP, and CBN supporting state governments to boost food production had been encouraging.\n\n\u201cI must commend the CBN for its support through the ABP, toward rice production in Nigeria and supporting different state governments to boost production,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso commending the initiative, Chinonso Elendu, urged the authorities to ensure farmers were safe in their farms.\n\n\u201cThis is a very good move, but we need to make sure our farmers are safe and crops should be affordable to everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Hussein Ibrahim, the unveiling of rice pyramids across the country, which indicates improved capacity to cultivate rice, should also make it cheap and affordable to the common man.\n\nNAN) reports the Abuja mega rice pyramids are located at the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Trade Fair Complex, Abuja.\n\nASJA lauds partnership\n\nMeanwhile, the Advocates of Social Justice for All (ASJA) has commended the strategic partnership between the CBN and RIFAN under the Anchor Borrowers Programme of the federal government.\n\nAccording to the group, the partnership had increased rice and other cereals in the country.\n\nIn a statement by ASJA Executive Director Felix Adadu, the group expressed confidence in the Buhari administration and the laudable initiatives of the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, which it said, had helped to strengthen the economy and the well-being of ordinary citizens of the country.\n\nAdadu said the intervention of the CBN is gradually returning Nigeria to the era of the Rice Pyramid, creating jobs and stimulating the economy.\n\nThe statement reads in full:\n\nThe recent bountiful harvest recorded by Rice Farmers across the country is indeed pleasant news in the sense that the quest for food security and sufficiency might be around the corner.\n\nThe strategic partnership between the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria under the Anchor Borrowers Programme of the federal government is ingenious and potentials to increase rice and other cereals in the country.\n\nThe intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria is gradually returning Nigeria to the era of the Rice Pyramid. It is indeed a statement that CBN intervention has also helped with the crash of the price of rice and created jobs, and boosted Nigeria\u2019s local capacity to meet demand.\n\nThis is commendable and an indication of the federal government\u2019s commitment through the Central Bank of Nigeria towards boosting food production in the country. According to reliable information at the public disposal, the CBN, in partnership with the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, is targeting one million farmers for rice production in the 2021-2022 dry season farming.\n\nThis is highly commendable, and the Advocates of Social Justice for All sees this as a step in the right direction for the cultivation of rice and other cereals in the country. According to statistical information, the 2021-2022 dry season farming, though targeting one million farmers but by extension will employ over 10 million farmers across production, processing and marketing value chains.\n\nThe provision and sale of Rice paddy at subsidized rates to farmers across the country is a strategy to make rice affordable to consumers. Thus, our position is that the CBN has once again positioned itself as a contributor to sustainable growth and development in the country.\n\nWe wish to commend the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emeifele, for his continuous support to the critical agricultural sector in Nigeria through various fare reaching initiatives, all aimed towards food security and sufficiency.\n\nWithout a doubt, we state that the efforts of the CBN so far have the potential to transform Nigeria into a major exporter of rice and other farm produce. It is also worthy of note that earlier in 2021, the CBN flagged off the first-ever rain-fed wheat programme in the country, seeking to slash the importation of the food commodity by 60 per cent and save $2 billion annually in foreign exchange.\n\nIt is on record that between September and October 2021, under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme, the Central Bank of Nigeria disbursed N43.19 billion to support the cultivation of 250,000 hectares of maize, sorghum, soybeans and rice during the 2021 dry season farming and N5.88 billion to finance six large scale agricultural project under the commercial agricultural agri-business scheme. These and many more intervention by the Central Bank of Nigeria has positioned the Apex bank as an ardent contributor to the development of the agricultural sector in Nigeria.\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, is by all indication a visionary leader who has consistently displayed an unalloyed passion for not just implementing sound monetary policies in the country; he has also demonstrated a commitment to supporting causes within the provisions of the CBN Act in addressing some of the developmental challenges in the country.\n\nThe Advocates for Social Justice for All sees the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria in the cultivation of rice and other cereals in the country as critical and timely by all ramifications and should be sustained.\n\nWe call on stakeholders in the agricultural sector in Nigeria to see in the Central Bank of Nigeria a worthy partner in the government\u2019s efforts towards harnessing our agricultural potentials towards food security and sufficiency.\n\nWhile it can be overemphasised that the Central Bank of Nigeria has done well to create jobs in the value chain, it has addressed to some extent the issue of unemployment.\n\nIt consequently behoves well-meaning corporate bodies and individuals to either emulate the CBN example or seek collaborations with other associations in the agricultural sector in the country.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered major military operations in Niger state to ward off ceaseless attacks by terrorists on its communities.\n\nThe state has continued to face attacks on its communities by bandits (now called terrorists) and remnants of Boko Haram terrorists fleeing theaters of war in both the North-west and North-east.\n\nThe president\u2019s reassurance followed the spate of killings in some parts of the state, with the latest being the 13 persons slain in fresh bandits\u2019 attacks in Shiroro local government area of the state.\n\nThe order is coming barely nine days after the federal government formally gazetted bandits, kidnappers and related criminals as terrorists.\n\nAnnouncing the presidential order in a statement Sunday in Abuja, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu, said the president asked the military to respond robustly to the cases of killings and kidnappings in the state and to give effect to the strategic objectives through the use of force.\n\nIn his message to the government and people of Niger state, President Buhari said, \u201cI would like to express sincere sympathies to the government and people of the State following recent security incidents.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari reiterated that \u201csecurity is a responsibility of every member of the community and only through solidarity and cooperation with law enforcement agencies can we defeat the problems finally.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is willing to strengthen support and cooperation with all the states. I believe that with the full cooperation of the citizens, we will surely overcome this problem,\u201d the President said.\n\n15 abducted in fresh attack\n\nMeanwhile, the state police command has confirmed the abduction of 15 persons by some gunmen in Kulho village of Mashegu local government area of the state.\n\nPolice spokesperson in the state, Wasiu Abiodun, confirmed this Sunday in a statement in Minna.\n\nAbiodun, a deputy superintendent of police, said on January 14, at about 2 a.m., suspected bandits attacked Kulho village, a remote community via Ibbi in Mashegu and abducted 15 persons.\n\nHe also said on the same day at about 1 a.m, suspected bandits/terrorists entered Mashegu village through Jigawa and stole a yet to be ascertained number of cattle.\n\nThe police image maker said a team of operatives had been drafted to the area for search and rescue of the abducted victims.\n\n\u201cWe solicited the support of local residents to volunteer reliable information that could aid in apprehending the miscreants,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from Niger State, states like Kaduna and Zamfara also remain a hotbed for bandits who have become almost uncontrollable despite the efforts of the country\u2019s military to tackle them. (NAN)\n\nCommander arrested\n\nIn a related development, a stalwart of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara state, Dr. Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi, has said a notorious bandit identified as Katare was arrested Saturday.\n\nShinkafi, who said this while briefing journalists in Gusau, said Katare was usually operating along Lambar Bakura-Tureta and Raba forest in Sokoto state.\n\nHe listed exhibits recovered from him to include 200 AK-47 rifles while trying to escape to other forest in the state.\n\nAccording to him, the top leader of bandits who is in his late 20\u2019s, had already confessed to receiving supply of weapons from Niger Republic and using them in his deadly operations.\n\nHe said Katare had been terrorising the people along the Sokoto-Talata Mafara highway and also part of Rabah and Maradun local government areas of Sokoto and Zamfara states.\n\n\u201cThe security challenges faced by Zamfara state is a collective concern of all-inclusive of Ulama, politicians including those in the PDP, APC, APGA regardless of what political ideologies we all belong in Zamfara state,\u201d Shinkafi stated.\n\nHe urged the good people of the state to remain calm and report any suspicious movement by some people in their respective domains to security agencies for urgent response.\n\nN200m ransom\n\nAlso, a community in Nahuche town of Bungudu local government area of Zamfara state Sunday staged a peaceful protest in Gusau, the state capital over what they described as rampant kidnap and attack by terrorists in their domains.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, spokesman of the community and former chairman of the local government council, Alhaji Musa Abdullahi Manager said the level of attacks had become outrageous.\n\nHe said they spent over N200 million as ransom and also on vigilante group for self-defence through fund raising in the last three years, during which the terrorists launched 12 attacks on the community.\n\nManager said over 50 people were lost in the attacks under the same period, even as 13 people kidnapped in the community were still in captivity in the last one month.\n\nHe appealed to Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle to intervene and help secure the release of those in the terrorists\u2019 den.\n\nThe community leader also appealed to the federal government to complement Governor Matawalle\u2019s efforts by deploying more troops in the state to tackle the dreaded terrorists.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to Federal Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to send Super Tucano and send adequate security personnel to Zamfara state to end the lingering insecurity we are facing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe for council boss also suggested the need to have permanent military base and police division in Nahuche to take on the hoodlums as they strike.\n\nKidnapped students freed\n\nSimilarly, Vice-Chancellor University of Lafia in Nasarawa state, Prof. Shehu Abdul Rahman has confirmed the release of the four kidnapped students of the institution.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by Head of Information and Public Relations Unit of the University, Abubakar Ibrahim and made available to Blueprint in Lafia, Sunday.\n\nHe said the four students of the university who were kidnapped by unknown gunmen, Thursday, were released by their abductors in the late hours of Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof. Shehu Abdul Rahman, therefore, on behalf of the management of the institution, wishes to express his profound gratitude to the Nasarawa state government and the general public for their contributions, prayers and support during the trying moment.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, the vice-chancellor expresses the University\u2019s special appreciation to the security agencies for their timely interventions that led to the quick and safe return of the students.\n\n\u201cConsequently upon their release, the students have undergone medical checks and they were all found to be in good conditions to immediately resume their studies,\u201d the statement added.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the students to remain calm and go about their normal activities on both campuses of the university.\n\nShe also assured the parents, students and public of his administration\u2019s commitment to make lives and property safe in and around the campuses.\n\nBuhari, Lawan hailed\n\nMeanwhile, Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni has showered encomiums President Muhammadu Buhari for his untiring efforts at restoring peace and normalcy, particularly to the troubled north eastern part of the country.\n\nBuni , who spoke Sunday, also acknowledged that there was now a significant improvement in the security situation in the Northeast particularly in Yobe state.\n\nThe governor also commended Senate President Ahmad Lawan for providing the right leadership at the National Assembly and for providing the much needed support and cooperation to enable the executive arm of government perform.\n\nGovernor Buni spoke at the 2022 Annual Machina Cultural Festival which started Monday and ended Sunday.\n\nBuni said the large and peaceful congregation that witnessed the cultural festival was an evidence that the security situation had improved.\n\nHe thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for providing the security personnel the required resources to secure lives and property in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this, the people in the north eastern part of the country can now sleep with their two eyes closed.\n\n\u201cIn case there is still anybody in doubt, this large congregation at this event is enough proof that the security situation has improved,\u201d Buni said.\n\nBuni said the various projects the government had executed or now being implemented were the results of the cooperation and support which once eluded the Buhari\u2019s administration the first four years, but now being provided by the current Assembly.\n\n\u201cI have earlier acknowledged Ahmad Lawan as Sardaunan Bade. He is not Sardaunan Bade alone but Sardaunan of Northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe was voted here as a Senator because this is his constituency. But God has made him Senate President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSince he assumed office as Senate President, the support and cooperation that he gives the executive arm of government led by President Muhammadu Buhari has brought about the development in the country that we are witnessing today.\n\n\u201cThat cooperation and support by the current National Assembly is what is responsible for the development we are seeing today in Nigeria because the first four years of President Buhari, he did not enjoy this kind of cooperation and support by the National Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides Lawan and Buni, Governors of Jigawa, Alhaji Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and Kebbi, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu were also at Machina to witness the cultural festival.\n\nLawan and the three governors were all honoured with chieftaincy titles by the chief host, the Emir of Machina, HRH Alhaji Dr. Bashir Albishir Bukar Machinama.\n\nThe Machina paramount ruler gave Lawan letter of appointment as the Danmasani Machina.\n\nLawan was once Danmasani Bade but having been elevated by the Bade Emirate Council in Yobe State as Sardaunan Bade, his first son, Ibrahim Ahmad Lawan now bears the title.\n\n",

It is good, it should be done but if we proceed to do it the way we are trying to do it now, we are likely to create more problems than it will solve,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also: I Will Sign Electoral Bill If NASS Includes Consensus Candidates, Indirect Primaries \u2013 Buhari\n\nPresident Buhari had declined assent to the bill in December 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political actors as part of the reasons for his decision.\n\nBut in a recent interview with Channels Television, he noted that for him to accent to the Bill, changes must be made to include the addition of consensus candidates, indirect primary options to the mode of selecting a candidate for an election, as against the initial direct mode as the only option to conduct primaries by political parties.\n\n\u201cThere should be options, you can\u2019t dictate to people and say you are doing democracy.

Hamza Mathlouthi and Seifeddine Jaziri also found the back of the net in the expected win.\n\nOn Monday, hosts Cameroon, who have already secured passage to the next round, take on Cape Verde, while Burkina Faso play bottom-of the-group Ethiopia, in the final day of Group A fixtures.

All are being tried together.\n\nThe deal could be signed as early as this week, a person involved in the talks told The Associated Press news agency on Sunday. Any deal could spare Netanyahu an embarrassing and protracted trial over an issue that has gripped the nation.\n\nA source briefed on the matter told the Reuters news agency that talks have snagged over a condition that would remove Netanyahu from politics.\n\nThe source said Netanyahu, 72, was discussing a deal with Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit under which he would plead guilty to reduced charges and have any resulting jail term commuted to community service.\n\nBut the talks have hit a bump over Netanyahu\u2019s demand to be spared a conviction carrying a \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d clause, which under Israeli law would force him to quit politics for years, said the source, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The State Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\n\nReports of a deal angered critics who said it would undermine the rule of law.\n\n\u201cThe man who worked to destroy the public\u2019s trust in the foundations of democracy for personal reasons is not eligible for deals,\u201d Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz tweeted.\n\nHorowitz was referring to Netanyahu\u2019s attempts after he was indicted to cast doubt on Israel\u2019s justice system, saying it was biased and pursuing a witch-hunt against him.\n\nDemonstrators gathered against the developing deal outside the attorney general\u2019s house on Saturday evening. Any deal will likely be challenged in court.\n\nA lawyer for Netanyahu, who has denied all charges and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated witch-hunt, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nNetanyahu has pledged to unseat his successor, Naftali Bennett, a nationalist straddling a coalition of highly diverse parties.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud party failed to form a new government last year in part because kindred parties refused to join Netanyahu, citing the ongoing trial.\n\nWith his legal troubles behind him, Netanyahu might in theory be able to muster a broad new rightist coalition. If he were barred from politics, right-wing members of Bennett\u2019s coalition could opt to form a new government with a Likud party under new leadership.\n\nThe idea of a plea bargain was promoted by a former Supreme Court president, Aharon Barak.\n\nHe told Kan radio it would ease the pressure on the justice system, which has spent years defending itself against allegations from Netanyahu loyalists that he was being denied due process.\n\nA Likud spokesman said he did not know about any such negotiations.",

          "text": "North Korea has fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in its fourth weapons test this month, South Korea\u2019s military said, as Pyongyang continues a wave of missile launches that have triggered condemnation at the United Nations.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Monday that the North likely fired two ballistic missiles from the Sunan airport in the capital, and that they travelled 380km (236 miles) to a maximum altitude of 42km (26 miles)\n\nJapan\u2019s government also reported the launch and condemned the tests as a threat to the region\u2019s peace and security.\n\nNobuo Kishi, the Japanese defence minister, said the missiles appeared to have landed in the ocean near North Korea\u2019s east coast.\n\n\u201cIt is self-evident that the aim of North Korea\u2019s frequent missile launches is to improve their missile technology,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cThe repeated launching of North Korea\u2019s ballistic missiles is a grave problem for the international community, including Japan,\u201d Kishi added.\n\nThe United States military\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command said it assessed that the launch did not pose an immediate threat to the US or its allies, but \u201cthese missile launches highlight the destabilising impact of (North Korea\u2019s) illicit weapons programme\u201d.\n\nNorth Korea has carried out a series of launches since the start of the year, announcing last week the successful test of a hypersonic weapon observed by leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nOn Friday, it also fired two missiles from a train.\n\nNuclear-armed Pyongyang is banned from testing ballistic weapons by the UN, and denuclearisation talks have been stalled since 2019 when a summit between Kim and former US President Donald Trump collapsed over North Korean demands for sanctions relief.\n\nThe North Korean foreign ministry on Friday chastised the US for imposing new sanctions in response to the tests, accusing Washington of a \u201cconfrontational approach\u201d.\n\nThe US is also urging the UN to take firmer action against North Korea over the latest tests.\n\nSome experts say Kim is returning to his old technique of using weapons launches and threats to extract concessions from the US in any future engagements.\n\n\u201cThey [North Korea] are very clearly developing a missile force and Kim Jong Un wants to test them and there\u2019s no reason not to any more because there\u2019s not much going on in the negotiation front,\u201d said Robert Kelly, professor of political science and diplomacy at Pusan National University in South Korea.\n\n\u201cThe regime in North Korea has always put its security, its own protection, ahead of the interests and welfare of its own population,\u201d Kelly told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cNorth Korean elites have said for many years, going back decades, that they were interested in getting the economy off the ground, operating more functionally, and being less corrupt. But that has never really come through\u2026 North Korea has been dependent on food aid now at least since the 1990s, arguably going back further than that. Kim could change that. But it really would require a major redirection of state resources away from the military, some kind of effort to get the sanctions rolled back, and boost North Korea\u2019s internal self-sufficiency. And the regime hasn\u2019t done that.\u201d\n\nThe latest launches came as North Korea, more isolated than ever under self-imposed border closings aimed at keeping COVID-19 out, appeared to be preparing to open at least some trade across its land border with China.\n\nChinese brokers told Reuters news agency they expect the resumption of regular trade with North Korea as soon as Monday after a North Korean train pulled into a Chinese border town on Sunday in the first such crossing since anti-coronavirus border lockdowns began in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis timing suggests Beijing is more than complicit with Pyongyang\u2019s provocations; China is supporting North Korea economically and coordinating with it militarily,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul told the BBC.\n\nLast week, China criticised the new US sanctions, but also called on all sides to act prudently and engage in dialogue to reduce tensions.\n\nBeijing says it enforces existing international sanctions but has joined with Russia to urge the UN Security Council to ease the measures on North Korea.",
