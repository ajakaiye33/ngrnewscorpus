NAAT is calling on relevant agencies of government at all levels to ensure adherence of all building projects with the building regulations\u201d.\n\nOn vaccination, he said, \u201cOur position on compulsory vaccination for our workers is that we are of the view that it is very wrong for the government to say that vaccination should be compulsory. Vaccination cannot and should not be made compulsory for citizens.\n\n\u201cWe will rather plead with the government to work on the conscience of the people or encourage people to go and do vaccination if anybody thinks he should take it. We are asking the government to please withdraw that deadline as it is not proper to ask citizens to be compulsorily vaccinated.\u201d",

          "text": "By Christopher Oji, Lagos\n\nThere was violence in Ipaja, Lagos Thursday morning following the reported stabbing to death of a commercial tricycle (\u201cKeke\u201d) rider by a police officer, purportedly over a N100 bribe\n\nThe killing triggered a riot, with Keke riders clashing with the police in the area, resulting in the death of three people, including a 16-year-old boy, by the police during the exchange of gunfire that ensued, witnesses said.\n\nThe Keke riders threw stones and other weapons at the police patrol team, commandeering the road as they protested the killing of their colleague.\n\nThe policemen, who opened fire to scare off the rioting Keke riders, reportedly called for reinforcement from other police formations, who came to their rescue.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nA witness who is also a Keke rider told Daily Sun that the violent incident occurred Thursday morning.\n\n\u2018Our member, CK, was conveying passengers when he was stopped by police officers who asked him for a N100 bribe; but he told them that he just resumed work and had not collected money from his first trip, promising to give them their request when he would come back. But one of the officers picked a quarrel with him. It was in that process that he stabbed CK in the chest with a jackknife, who died a few minutes after the fatal injury,\u2019 the witness said.\n\n\u2018It was after the killing that some of our members wanted to avenge his death; but the police, after firing some shots, took to their heels and escaped after firing many gunshots.

After the police, we will settle Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LATSMA), Road Safety, Vehicle Inspection Officers, and motor touts.

          "text": "\u2022Vows to prosecute election offenders\n\n\u2022IG issues stern warning, says heavy deployment to protect all\n\n\u2022IPAC demands fairness, transparency from commission, security operatives\n\n\u2022US threatens visa restriction on violence instigators\n\n\u2022Obaigbena thanks CDS, Police Chief, DG SSS for providing robust security during ARISE News debate\n\nChuks Okocha, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and\n\nDavid-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nAs the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) moves both personnel and materials to Anambra State in readiness for the governorship election yesterday, INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmoud Yakubu, has said the commission would do everything in its powers to ensure only eligible voters determine the next governor of the South-east state. Yakubu stated this on Wednesday in Awka during a pre-election stakeholders meeting with the political parties, religious leaders, traditional rulers, and civil society groups.\n\nBut the commission was quick to add, \u201cWe are also determined to prosecute perpetrators of electoral malpractice, including any election duty staff found to be complicit. The choice of the next governor of Anambra State is in the hands of the eligible voters and their will must prevail.\u201d\n\nInspector General of Police (IGP), Mr. Usman Baba, issued a stern warning on the general conduct of people during the election. Baba said the police were determined to guarantee a peaceful election in the state. He explained that the heavy deployment of security personnel to the state was not to scare away voters, but to protect everyone.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Chairman of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, thanked the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, and the Director General of the Department of State Security, DSS, Mr. Yusuf Magaji Bichi, for providing solid security during the ARISE News and Enough is Enough group jointly organised governorship debate in Awka, the Anambra state capital on Monday. He explained that other media houses pulled out of participating in the debate because of security concerns, \u201cessentially, other media houses had pulled out of the debate; some wanted it done in Abuja, owing to security fears, but Arise News Channel refused, insisting that we can\u2019t run away from any part of the country. The CDS assured of security and he lived up to his word.\u201d Obaigbena urged the security forces to provide the same security so that voters will come to go and cast their vote for candidate of their choice and \u201cwe are urging them to extend same security for the election to encourage people to vote.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, Tthe Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), on its part, asked INEC and all the security personnel deployed for the governorship election to ensure the process was credible, fair, and transparent.\n\nAccordingly, the United States warned that anyone, who interfered with the lawful conduct of the election or instigated violence, would face visa restrictions along with their families.\n\nYakubu, speaking at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting, said some of the sensitive materials had been secured at the Anambra State branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Awka.\n\nThe INEC chairman said as a usual practice on the eve of major elections, INEC would invite political parties, civil society organisations, and the media to the CBN on Thursday to inspect the sensitive materials and witness their movement to the various local government areas under security escort.\n\nBy the same arrangement, Yakubu said the materials would be delivered to the Registration Areas or Wards on Friday to facilitate the opening of Polling Units at 8.30am on Election Day.\n\nHe assured voters in the state that in designing the sensitive materials for the election, the commission had introduced additional visible and invisible security features, including different colour codes. He said election materials had also been customised according to local government areas and polling units, warning those who may attempt to compromise the process that INEC has put in place sufficient security features to detect counterfeits.\n\nThe INEC chairman stated, \u201cOn Saturday, 6th November 2021, Anambra State will make history as the first governorship election in Nigeria in which the commission will deploy the Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) device. This new device replaces the Smart Card Reader (SCR) used in previous elections since 2015.\n\n\u201cWe are satisfied with the pilot deployment of the BVAS in the Isoko South I State Constituency bye-election in Delta State on 11th September 2021. The BVAS has the dual capacity for fingerprint and facial authentication of voters. This is to guard against voting by identity theft, where one person uses another person\u2019s Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC) to vote using the incident form.\n\n\u201cWith this development, the use of the incident form is abolished. No voter without genuine PVC will vote. No voter, who has not been successfully accredited electronically, using the BVAS, will vote.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the BVAS is also equipped with a camera. Therefore, it has the capacity to snap Polling Unit level result and upload same to the INEC Result Viewing (IReV) portal, so that citizens can view results as election is concluded in each Polling Unit.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is no need for the Z-Pad since its functions have been embedded in the BVAS. I am glad to report that all the BVAS required for the election on Saturday have been configured and delivered to Anambra State. Election duty staff have also been trained on the use of the device and we have sufficient technical staff to respond to any glitches that may occur.\u201d\n\nYakubu acknowledged concerns expressed about the availability of PVCs for new registrants in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the end of the recent Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, a total of 138,802 citizens completed the registration. After cleaning up the data, the commission identified and archived 62,698 multiple registrants. Consequently, the number of valid registrants is 76,104.\n\n\u201cThis figure has been added to 5,674 requests for transfer, update of voter information and replacement of lost or damaged PVCs, bringing the total of valid registrations to 81,774. I am glad to report that the PVCs have been printed and delivered to all the local government areas for collection by voters.\n\n\u201cWe have also contacted the voters by text messages and email addresses and informed them of the exact locations to collect their cards. Through the media, we have also been sensitising them to the availability of the cards for collection. Many of them have done so already. Let me, therefore, once again appeal to those that have not done so that their cards are available for collection.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of voters\u2019 distribution by polling units, Yakubu stated, \u201cAbout four weeks ago, the commission published the register of voters for the election on 7th October 2021 i.e. 30 days to the election as required by law. Each of the 18 political parties was given a soft copy of the register here in Awka. In addition to meeting, the requirement of the law, the presentation of the register is significant for another reason.\n\n\u201cThe Anambra governorship election is the first time that voting is taking place in polling units since the recent successful conversion of voting points arising from the expansion of voter access to polling units in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAn additional 1,112 polling units were established in Anambra State in addition to the existing 4,608 locations. This brings the total number of polling units in the state to 5,720. Voters were encouraged to seize the opportunity of the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise to transfer to the new polling units most convenient for them. Many did not do so.\n\n\u201cThis can be partly attributed to the security situation in the state, which has affected the commission\u2019s pre-election outdoor activities, including voter education and sensitisation. Understandably, the voters have also been cautious.\u201d\n\nYakubu explained that out of the 5,720 polling units in the state, 86 (1.5%) had no voters. He said the commission would not deploy personnel and materials to these polling units. \u201cFurthermore, 894 (15.6%) of the polling units have between one and 49 voters. Election will hold in these polling units. We will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that all Polling Units have voters allotted to them ahead of the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.\n\nIG Issues Stern Warning, Says Deployment Not to Scare Anyone\n\nInspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Baba, yesterday, read the riot act to troublemakers ahead of the Anambra State governorship election. Baba said at a meeting with political parties, religious leaders, and traditional rulers that the police were determined to ensure a peaceful election.\n\nHowever, he allayed fears and concerns about the heavy security deployment in the state, saying it is not meant to scare away voters, but to reassure them of their security and safety.\n\nThe IGP said, \u201cIt is to be additionally emphasised that aside these sets of guidelines, which fall under the provisions of the Electoral Act, any person that violates any components of the criminal laws, including being in possession of weapons of violence of any description, either on the streets or around the polling units, engages in any violent act, attacks critical national assets, engages in corrupt inducement of the electorate, or threatens public peace in any manner before, during and after the election, shall be apprehended and dealt with in accordance with the requisite criminal law.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, call on all the political parties to embrace the virtues of democracy by seeing elections as a call to service by the people and not \u2018a-do or die\u2019 affair.\u201d\n\nBaba implored parents and guardians to discourage their children and wards from being used to foment trouble or subvert the election process, warning, \u201cSuch will be forcefully resisted by the Nigeria Police, the military and other security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe IGP said residents and voters should be guided by the following rules, as contained in the Electoral Act, on the election day.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNo one is allowed to wear any cloth, emblem or colour signifying any political party to the polling units.\n\n\u201cNo person is allowed to move around with security details around the polling units. Indeed, appropriate directives have been given for the withdrawal or scaling down of such security details around politically exposed persons and other personalities in the state until after the elections.\n\n\u201cEveryone is enjoined to vote and return to their respective houses or remain peacefully within approved perimeters of the polling centres. No one is allowed to move about from one polling unit to another, as there shall be restriction of movements on the day of the election.\n\n\u201cOnly INEC accredited Election Monitors/observers are allowed to move around for the purpose of election monitoring and they must all wear their INEC accreditation tags. Only accredited journalists are allowed to cover the election. All such journalists must carry their accreditation tags.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the massive deployment of security was \u201cnot designed to intimidate the law-abiding, as being insinuated in some quarters. In the contrary, it is to re-assure them of adequate protection by deterring misguided political elements as well as non-state actors that might be bent on threatening the elections through acts of armed violence or other conducts that violate the provisions of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cIt is to also serve as a strong warning that the government is determined to bring such subversive characters to justice should they advance their ignoble, undemocratic and unpatriotic intents. The overriding objective of our operational action plan is to ensure an environment that is peaceful enough to encourage the law-abiding people of Anambra State to exercise their electoral franchise.\n\nIPAC Demands Fairness, Transparency from INEC, Security Agencies\n\nInter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and all the security personnel deployed for the election in Anambra State to ensure a credible, fair and transparent electoral process. It urged the youth in the state to eschew violence and \u201cshun political buccaneers masquerading as democrats, whose stock in trade is to use them for electoral thuggery, ballot snatching and rigging to thwart the people\u2019s mandate\u201d.\n\nIPAC said it had received assurances from relevant quarters that the result of the election would be transmitted electronically.\n\nAddressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, National Chairman of IPAC, Mr. Leonard Nzenwa, who is also National Chairman, African Action Congress (AAC), said it was important for INEC and the security agencies to commit to fairness and transparency during the election, and not compromise their integrity.\n\nNzenwa stated, \u201cINEC should provide a level playing field to all political parties and their candidates participating in the election and ensure electoral materials are provided, and that voting starts as scheduled in all polling units in the state.\n\n\u201cThe neutrality of INEC in this election will determine the survival of democracy in Nigeria. All eyes are on the commission and its officials as they discharge this onerous civic responsibility. Security agents should also discharge their duties professionally and ensure adequate protection of lives and property during the exercise.\u201d\n\nUS Threatens Visa Restriction on Violence Instigators\n\nThe United States warned that visa restrictions would be imposed anyone who interfered with the lawful conduct of the Anambra election or instigated violence. A statement on Wednesday from the US Embassy said the American government looked forward to a peaceful and transparent governorship election whose results would accurately reflect the will of the people of the state.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe will be paying close attention to actions of individuals, who interfere with the democratic process or instigate violence against civilian populations before, during, or after the elections.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to consider consequences, including visa restrictions, for those found to be responsible for election-related violence or undermining the democratic process.\u201d\n\nThe statement further explained, \u201cUnder US immigration law, certain violations also may lead to restrictions on family members.\u201d\n\nIt called on citizens, electoral officials, party members, and security force personnel to do their part in ensuring a credible and secure electoral process.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Appoints town planners\u2019 president as chairman, team gets 30 days to submit report\n\n\u2022Femi Osibona, owner of building, friend, Wale Bob-Oseni, still unaccounted for\n\nSegun James\n\nThe six-man independent investigation team set up by Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to probe the remote and immediate causes of the collapse of a 21-storey building in Ikoyi has 30 days to submit its report. Sanwo-Olu disclosed this yesterday as he named members of the probe panel at the site of the incident.\n\nHowever, it was all tears yesterday as the body of Nifemi, the personal assistant to Femi Osibona, the owner of the building, which collapsed in Ikoyi area of Lagos on Monday, was recovered.\n\nBut Managing Director of Fourscore Heights Limited, Osibona, who was trapped under the rubble alongside Nifemi and Wale Bob-Oseni, his friend, were yet to be recovered 48 hours after the incident.\n\nA source said, \u201cThe dead body of the PA (Personal Assistant) to the owner of the collapsed Lagos building has been recovered. The police orderly of the owner says Osibona is trapped in the rubble with his friend, Wale Bob-Oseni.\u201d\n\nBob-Oseni is also a property and real estate dealer like Osibona.\n\nA father whose son\u2019s body was recovered cried uncontrollably at the scene.\n\nAt the time of this report, 23 people had been confirmed dead since the building located on Gerrard Road collapsed. Rescue efforts were still on-going, as families and friends of those trapped in the rubble quailed and hoped for good news.\n\nNine persons were evacuated alive from the rubble.\n\nMembers of the probe panel announced by Sanwo-Olu comprised a professional builder, town planner, structural engineer, and legal practitioners \u2013 all from the private sector.\n\nAccording to a statement signed by Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, President of Nigeria Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Mr. Tayo Ayinde, is the chairman of the panel, while Ekundayo Onajobi, a lawyer in a private law firm, is the secretary.\n\nOther members of the panel are a structural engineer, Dr. Akintilo Idris Adeleke; an architect, Yinka Ogundairo; representative of Institute of Builders, Mr. Godfrey O. Godfrey; and Mrs. Bunmi Ibrahim, a property lawyer.\n\nThe panel\u2019s terms of reference include ascertaining whether there was a compromise of the building codes by the developer, his contractor, and statutory regulatory agencies.\n\nAlready, General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Arc. Gbolahan Oki, had been suspended indefinitely by the governor.\n\nSanwo-Olu was on an official visit to Rome in Italy for the G-20 Summit when he learnt of the incident on Monday. The governor cut short his trip and returned to Lagos on Tuesday to attend to the emergency.\n\nArriving at the scene in the wee-hours of yesterday, the governor met with the victims\u2019 family members, raising their hopes and showing compassion to calm them.\n\nHe described the incident as \u201ca monumental disaster\u201d, hinting that mistakes must have been made in the process of developing the collapsed structure. The governor promised a thorough inquiry into the matter, adding that the full wrath of the law would be brought on anyone found to have compromised.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cWe\u2019ve promised to be open and thorough in investigating the cause of the collapse. In that regard, I have set up a high-powered professional investigative panel whose membership consists of professionals outside of the government.

The investigation will start from the heads of regulatory agencies. Be rest assured that if there are other people that are found wanting in the course of investigation, everybody will face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cMembers of the panel are people of impeccable integrity and I will be signing an Executive Order to give the panel a legal backing.\u201d\n\nOther terms of reference of the panel include determining whether there was full compliance with physical planning and building materials laws of the state; determining whether there was supervisory or oversight lapses on the part of regulatory agencies; and making necessary recommendations to guard against reoccurrence of similar incidents.\n\nSanwo-Olu maintained that it was difficult for the government to know the exact number of people trapped, noting that none of the people linked to the housing project has come forward to offer information on the manifest.\n\nHe said, \u201cI express my deepest sympathy to the families of those that have been involved in this unfortunate incident. For the bodies recovered from the site, we are currently conducting systematic process of identifying them.\n\n\u201cBefore the end of today or tomorrow, the process would have been completed and family members can come forward to identify them.\u201d\n\nThe state government set up a medical base and information desk at the site of the building collapse, and urged those whose family members were still missing to offer information on their identities. There is also a website (www.lagosmind.org/help) and helpline number (09090006463) for the distressed families.\n\nThe multi-sectoral search and rescue operation was ongoing at press time. The effort was led by teams from Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), with the support of construction giants, Julius Berger, Craneburg, HiTech, and China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC).\n\nThose rescued from the rubble were Oduntan Timilehin, 26; Sunday Monday, 21; Adeniran Mayowa, 37; Sholagbade Nurudeen, 33; Waliu Lateef, 32; and Ahmed Kanleku, a 19-year-old Beninoise.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Rallies IOCs to embark on major oil, gas devt projects\n\n\u2022OPTS seeks commission\u2019s support to address operational challenges\n\n\u2022Promotes 195 staff\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nIn continuation of his ongoing engagements with critical stakeholders in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURC), Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, yesterday met with oil majors operating in the country on the aegis of Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS).\n\nAt the meeting held in Lagos at the commission\u2019s oil and gas excellence centre, Komolafe, while responding to concerns raised by the operators, assured them that the commission would work towards removing all forms of bureaucracies that could escalate high cost of oil production in the country.\n\nMembers of OPTS who attended the meeting were their Chairman and Managing Director of Chevron Nigeria Limited, Mr. Rick Kennedy; immediate-past OPTS Chairman and Managing Director of TotalEnergies EP Nigeria Limited, Mr. Mike Sangster; and Managing Director of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) Nigeria Limited, Mr. Osagie Okunbo.\n\nOthers were Managing Director of ExxonMobil Nigeria Limited; Mr. Richard Laing; and his counterpart at Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC), Mr. Roberto Daniele.\n\nThe OPTS had in the session, listed some of their concerns that needed to be looked into by the commission as security, lengthy contract cycle terms, administrative complexities, the timelines in certain areas in the PIA, and the uncertainty on some issues, like the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) that are being renegotiated.\n\nKomolafe said the overriding objective of the meeting was to enable him familiarise himself with the oil producers as critical stakeholders, adding that he wanted to hear their challenges while seeking their partnership in the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nHe said as a business enabler, the upstream commission would operate and regulate with best industry practices and would continue to remain very transparent.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe will try as much as possible to remove all forms of bureaucracies that could escalate cost of production in the upstream.\u201d\n\nHe told the international oil company (IOC) chief executives that the implementation of the PIA was very germane to President Muhammadu Buhari, saying the task before the commission was to see critical deliverables from the Act within 12 months.\n\nHe urged the OPTS to support the commission in ensuring that key upstream development projects were started.\n\nKomolafe said, \u201cAs a matter of fact, the task for us is to see how, within the next six to 12 months, to begin to see critical deliverables from the Petroleum Industry Act -I mean, development of key upstream projects. And we really need your support as critical stakeholders in this respect.\u201d\n\nNoting that he was aware of the challenges facing them in the course of their activities in the upstream, Komolafe, who admitted that the industry, generally, was facing a critical period especially in this energy transition era, added that they were monitoring critically, the discussions in Glasgow, Scotland, on climate change.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe realise that the outcome is really posing challenges to which we need to address. We understand that at the moment, the upstream business is facing critical funding challenge, among other challenges that are very particular to our terrain.\n\n\u201cSo, my overriding key objective here today like I said, is to first and foremost, familiarise myself with you, realising that for us to be efficient regulator, we really need to be able to identify with your activities and know your challenges. At least, with that, we will be able to regulate objectively.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m using this opportunity to give credence to you as our critical operators. So, I want to solicit your cooperation and to assure you that we shall work as partners, we will work in synergy in a manner that we would be able to achieve the overall intendment of the Petroleum Industry Act, in a manner that would achieve optimal benefit to the Nigerian federation from our God-given hydrocarbon resources.\u201d\n\nThe Head, Legal, NURC, Dr. Tolorunse Joseph, while reacting to the issues raised by the operators regarding compliance to the PIA transition timeline, said the regulator was working with the PIA implementation committee to ensure that the timelines were met and the transition taken place smoothly without any hiccup.\n\nOn the conversion of oil mining licenses (OML) to oil prospecting license (OPL), Joseph explained that the even though it was provided that that should happen with 18 months, the decision to convert remained the decision of the operator.\n\n\u201cFlexibility is provided under the law in which the decision to convert is left for the operator. It\u2019s not a compulsion. So, the timeline, even though it\u2019s stipulated to be within 18 months, it\u2019s at the discretion of the operator.\n\n\u201cSo, there are many timelines stipulated for certain activities in the law, like the Host Community that says within one year, they should incorporate the Host Community Development Fund,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the issue around the ongoing renegotiated Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and how the PIA applies to it, Joseph explained, \u201cYou also raised the issue of Deep-water renegotiated PSC. I think the Deep-water Renegotiated PSC that have taken place before the Act was passed, also will continue under the old regime unless it is converted to the new regime as provided under the Act.\n\n\u201cSo, the Renegotiated PSC is a contractual arrangement. Definitely, it\u2019s going to be given effect within the law. It\u2019s going to remain substantially the same, unless you convert it to the new law.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Head, National Data Repository, NURC, Mr. Indabawa Bashari, responding to the issue about the compliance to the gas flare out deadline, said 2030 remained the compliance deadline as fixed by to United Nations.\n\nHe urged the operators to working towards complying before the 2030 deadline.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues raised is on gas flare elimination. We still maintain the 2030 deadline set by the United Nations. So, we expect every company to work toward achieving that deadline. From now till 2030, we have nine years. You should work towards achieving flare out before the deadline\u201d, Bashari said.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of OPTS, Kennedy listed some of their concerns that needed to be looked into by the commission as security, lengthy contract cycle terms, administrative complexities, the timelines in certain areas in the PIA, and the uncertainty on some issues, like the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) that are being renegotiated and how the PIA affects them.\n\nHe said OPTS had been looking deeply into the PIA and had identified a number of opportunities for collaboration and partnership with the commission.\n\nHe said, \u201cOne, is really on transition timeline, to be in compliance with the terms with the PIA. There is a number of compliance and mandatory items that the industry really has to get in place very quickly. And so, we look to collaborate with you and your team on those areas, hoping we can manage that effectively.\n\n\u201cA couple of examples in that area is incorporation of the Development Trust with the host communities, and it requires some alignment with multiple stakeholders. So, we have to manage that transition very effectively.\u201d\n\nKennedy said the OPTS had gone through the PIA and identified potential ambiguities on areas where they were not quite clear on the intent of the law.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have areas where regulations will get to be issued and potentially, this needs further guidelines. So, we stand ready to work with you and your team to provide inputs and supports as appropriate, in the development of new guidelines. An example is, the regulation on the decommissioning fund probably needs to prepared.\n\n\u201cThere is a number of ongoing discussions on renegotiation of existing Production Sharing Contracts in the Deep-water between the operators and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). And the PIA has a provision to allow those ongoing negotiation to be completed within 12 months of the enactment of the Act.\n\n\u201cWe have finished that work with the NNPC, but we have to come through the commission to let you know that we are still on that stage. We will be looking to work with you and your team to try to bring closure to those within the allotted time.\n\n\u201cThe other things are things around relative security, lengthy contract cycle terms, general administrative complexities, the industry is currently burdened with a number of fees and levies, and through the PIA, we see the potential of additional levies will be applied to the industry. So, we will be happy to work with you and your team to perhaps, identify opportunities to manage and improve cost.\u201d\n\nHe said energy transition offered the country an opportunity around developing the gas resources, adding however, that something has to be done around the fiscal environment to encourage investment in that area.\n\nAccording to him, some of the regulations would need to be tailored towards further enabling development of dry gas and associated gas and in the area of supporting domestication of gas.\n\nKennedy earlier congratulated Komolafe for his appointment and inauguration, the launch of the commission represents a major milestone in the reform and operationalisation of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry, given the long journey to finally enact the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\n\u201cSo, we are just happy to be here and part of this milestone in the industry -a really significant milestone for the country and federation of Nigeria. We would gladly engage with you and your team on discussions towards understanding the challenges that we all face.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to a collaboration where we can work together, perhaps, on future regulations on how we manage the business effectively on behalf of the Government of Nigeria, the people of Nigeria and all relevant stakeholders\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Komolafe has approved the immediate promotion of 195 members of staff of the new commission.\n\nSpeaking on the matter on Tuesday, the NUPRC boss noted that human capital remained a critical factor in the oil industry, declaring that the decision was part of the determination of the federal government to look after the welfare of the staff of the organisation.\n\n\u201cIt is only when staff are happy that we can talk of improving our crude oil production quota, which is presently below what we should be producing.\n\n\u201cIn that line, I have approved the promotion of 195 union staff that have been stagnated in the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to stave off industrial crisis.\n\n\u201cAny crisis can further harm the low daily oil production in Nigeria and worsen the nation\u2019s federally generated oil revenue,\u201d Komolafe argued.\n\nThe NUPRC boss said the decision to promote the staff followed his engagements and assurances to the agitated staff, adding that the measure would help boost staff morale.\n\nHe further promised to ensure that the staff are not short-changed in the unfolding transition and manpower reorganisations as the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) begins in earnest.\n\nHe noted that there remains a positive correlation between boosting the nation\u2019s crude production for optimised federation revenue and elevated staff morale in the commission.\n\nKomolafe who emphasised the critical nature of the oil and gas sector to the Nigerian economy, noted that with the call for divestments in the sector by key global stakeholders, it was best to maximise the benefits from fossil fuels to improve the welfare Nigerians and those who toil to get it out of the ground.\n\n\u201cSo, what we have done is by extension to improve the nation\u2019s revenue by increasing crude oil production from the current level of 1.4 mbbls/d to 2.4 mbbls/d,\u201d he added.\n\nHe urged the staff to reciprocate the gesture with enhanced service delivery in their determination to leave a legacy as a 21st century regulator and business enabler.\n\nKomolafe had last week during a podcast to staff across the country, promised to be fair to all and sundry, vowing to do all in his capacity to address issues of workers\u2019 welfare and give priority to good industrial relations.\n\n\u201cHuman capital capacity development will be stringently pursued to ensure high standard of professionalism at all times,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe commission\u2019s chief executive disclosed that the exercise was in recognition of the resilience and hard work put in by staff to meet the aspirations of government for the upstream sector of the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, has finalised plans to tie the nuptial knot with a 16-year-old Kano State girl, identified as Hussain on Friday (tomorrow), SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that the event is set to take place at 274 Daurawa, Maiduguri Road in Kano.\n\nAhmed Idris\n\nThe source added that the marriage between the underage girl and the Accountant General may likely be consummated before Juma\u2019at prayers on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Accountant General is planning to marry the underage girl on Friday at House D24, Dabah Homes Estate, opposite Tulsi Chanrai Eye Hospital, Oladipo Diya Street, Kukwaba\n\n\"At No. 274 Daurawa Maiduguri Road, Kano at the office named Bagudu Kebbi Nigeria Limited. It is adjacent to Tarauni Market Junction.\n\n\"You will notice that things and preparation are taking place and I'm suspecting the marriage might hold before Juma'at Prayer or after. They may decide to beat people's intelligence. His marriage will be consummated tomorrow.\"\n\nSee Also Scandal Family Kicks As Accountant-General, Idris Secretly Marries 16-year-old Girl As Fourth Wife\n\nSaharaReporters had last month reported how the family members of the young girl kicked against her marriage to the Accountant-General of the Federation.\n\nThe family accused Idris of luring the teenager with millions of naira.\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that Hussain\u2019s family had kicked against the wedding but Idris insisted on marrying her despite being 44 years older than the underage girl.\n\nIdris will turn 61 on November 25, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is our late sister\u2019s daughter by name Hussain; she\u2019s just 16, not long that she clocked 16 years old but it\u2019s very unfortunate that a lady called Amina was the one that linked or brought the Accountant-General to our house in order to seek her hand in marriage.\n\n\u201cThis, she did, knowing that this is a very young girl, what does that mean? It shows the Accountant General is just after that small girl to take advantage of her youthful age.\n\n\u201cImmediately I heard, I messaged him because when I was working with the then Head of Service, I had the opportunity of having his contact when we met over a serious matter about the country. So I messaged him on WhatsApp regarding his wedding; I sent him my picture, that of my son, my late sister and the daughter, Hussain. He replied that it\u2019s a small world which confirmed the wedding was true,\u201d a top family source had confided in SaharaReporters.\n\nThe family source added that the Accountant-General had bribed some media organisations they contacted for help and their request to expose his atrocities was, therefore, turned down.\n\n\"He went as far as bribing this girl with gold of over N200 million, iPhones, buying cars for her, giving her millions of naira \u2013 all to buy her attention. He started meeting different people that he wanted to know the girl\u2019s family; he married the girl, just like that.\n\n\u201cThere was no investigation just because he is the Accountant General of the Federation. Why are things happening in this country like this? He even told the girl to go and look for any house of her choice in Abuja, that he is ready to purchase it for her.\n\n\u201cHe is spending the government money and every media house we go to report him, he pays them not to air or report the story. Please help us for justice to be done. This girl is just sixteen years old,\u201d the source had added.\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of detailed investigations exposed how Idris acquired several properties whose value run into many billions of naira since he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as the administrative head of the treasury in June 2015.\n\nA visit to Gezawa Commodity Market Limited and Gezawa Integrated Farms Limited owned by Idris lend credence to the allegations made by concerned citizens and some stakeholders on how and where the AGF got the money he used in acquiring the multi-billion naira firms, both in Kano through his direct family members.\n\nThe shareholdings of both firms indicate a spread of Idris family members on the official board.\n\nThere have also been questions asked about how the AGF bought 'Sokoto Hotel' in Kano with N500 million cash.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Idris upon acquiring the hotel, ordered its immediate demolition to build a multi-billion naira shopping mall on the property.\n\nDespite turning 60 in 2020, Idris succeeded in pulling different strings in the Presidency to secure an extension of his appointment beyond the legal limit.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that he engaged the services of highly placed persons including governors, senators and emirs who prevailed on President Buhari to give him the extension.\n\nThe action is however against the civil service rules, which state that a career civil servant must disengage from service either after attaining 60 years of age or having worked for 35 years, whichever comes first.\n\nIt was also against a recent circular from the office of the Head of Service to all agencies of the Nigerian Government which says, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt and in order to maintain discipline and integrity of the extant public service rule which prescribed 60 years of age or 35 years of service for mandatory retirement, should strictly be complied with.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the following guidelines shall apply. (I) that career officers who take up tenured appointments should at the point of taking up the appointment retire from service to ensure they run their term uninterrupted.\n\n\u201c(II) that career officers who have not retired from service before the commencement of their tenured appointment must leave office on the attainment of mandatory age/years of service for retirement and (iii) that career officers who are currently holding tenured appointment are required to retire from service with immediate effect and continue to run their term. Failure to do so would mean that they would vacate office on attaining the mandatory age or at the expiration of their term whichever comes first.\u201d",

          "text": "The Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, has finalised plans to tie the nuptial knot with a 16-year-old Kano State girl, identified as Hussain on Friday (tomorrow), SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that the event is set to take place at 274 Daurawa, Maiduguri Road in Kano.\n\nAhmed Idris\n\nThe source added that the marriage between the underage girl and the Accountant General may likely be consummated before Juma\u2019at prayers on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe Accountant General is planning to marry the underage girl on Friday at House D24, Dabah Homes Estate, opposite Tulsi Chanrai Eye Hospital, Oladipo Diya Street, Kukwaba\n\n\"At No. 274 Daurawa Maiduguri Road, Kano at the office named Bagudu Kebbi Nigeria Limited. It is adjacent to Tarauni Market Junction.\n\n\"You will notice that things and preparation are taking place and I'm suspecting the marriage might hold before Juma'at Prayer or after. They may decide to beat people's intelligence. His marriage will be consummated tomorrow.\"\n\nSee Also Scandal Family Kicks As Accountant-General, Idris Secretly Marries 16-year-old Girl As Fourth Wife\n\nSaharaReporters had last month reported how the family members of the young girl kicked against her marriage to the Accountant-General of the Federation.\n\nThe family accused Idris of luring the teenager with millions of naira.\n\nA source told SaharaReporters that Hussain\u2019s family had kicked against the wedding but Idris insisted on marrying her despite being 44 years older than the underage girl.\n\nIdris will turn 61 on November 25, 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is our late sister\u2019s daughter by name Hussain; she\u2019s just 16, not long that she clocked 16 years old but it\u2019s very unfortunate that a lady called Amina was the one that linked or brought the Accountant-General to our house in order to seek her hand in marriage.\n\n\u201cThis, she did, knowing that this is a very young girl, what does that mean? It shows the Accountant General is just after that small girl to take advantage of her youthful age.\n\n\u201cImmediately I heard, I messaged him because when I was working with the then Head of Service, I had the opportunity of having his contact when we met over a serious matter about the country. So I messaged him on WhatsApp regarding his wedding; I sent him my picture, that of my son, my late sister and the daughter, Hussain. He replied that it\u2019s a small world which confirmed the wedding was true,\u201d a top family source had confided in SaharaReporters.\n\nThe family source added that the Accountant-General had bribed some media organisations they contacted for help and their request to expose his atrocities was, therefore, turned down.\n\n\"He went as far as bribing this girl with gold of over N200 million, iPhones, buying cars for her, giving her millions of naira \u2013 all to buy her attention. He started meeting different people that he wanted to know the girl\u2019s family; he married the girl, just like that.\n\n\u201cThere was no investigation just because he is the Accountant General of the Federation. Why are things happening in this country like this? He even told the girl to go and look for any house of her choice in Abuja, that he is ready to purchase it for her.\n\n\u201cHe is spending the government money and every media house we go to report him, he pays them not to air or report the story. Please help us for justice to be done. This girl is just sixteen years old,\u201d the source had added.\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of detailed investigations exposed how Idris acquired several properties whose value run into many billions of naira since he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as the administrative head of the treasury in June 2015.\n\nA visit to Gezawa Commodity Market Limited and Gezawa Integrated Farms Limited owned by Idris lend credence to the allegations made by concerned citizens and some stakeholders on how and where the AGF got the money he used in acquiring the multi-billion naira firms, both in Kano through his direct family members.\n\nThe shareholdings of both firms indicate a spread of Idris family members on the official board.\n\nThere have also been questions asked about how the AGF bought 'Sokoto Hotel' in Kano with N500 million cash.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Idris upon acquiring the hotel, ordered its immediate demolition to build a multi-billion naira shopping mall on the property.\n\nDespite turning 60 in 2020, Idris succeeded in pulling different strings in the Presidency to secure an extension of his appointment beyond the legal limit.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that he engaged the services of highly placed persons including governors, senators and emirs who prevailed on President Buhari to give him the extension.\n\nThe action is however against the civil service rules, which state that a career civil servant must disengage from service either after attaining 60 years of age or having worked for 35 years, whichever comes first.\n\nIt was also against a recent circular from the office of the Head of Service to all agencies of the Nigerian Government which says, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt and in order to maintain discipline and integrity of the extant public service rule which prescribed 60 years of age or 35 years of service for mandatory retirement, should strictly be complied with.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the following guidelines shall apply. (I) that career officers who take up tenured appointments should at the point of taking up the appointment retire from service to ensure they run their term uninterrupted.\n\n\u201c(II) that career officers who have not retired from service before the commencement of their tenured appointment must leave office on the attainment of mandatory age/years of service for retirement and (iii) that career officers who are currently holding tenured appointment are required to retire from service with immediate effect and continue to run their term. Failure to do so would mean that they would vacate office on attaining the mandatory age or at the expiration of their term whichever comes first.\u201d",

          "title": "Mohammed Abacha admits in court: I used a different name to acquire OPL 245 (transcript)",
          "text": "Mohammed Abacha admitted before the FCT high court sitting on Thursday that he used a different name \u2014 Mohammed Sani \u2014 to register Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd, the company that was awarded the controversial OPL 245 in 1998.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMohammed Sani\u201d originally had 50 percent in the company, with \u201cKweku Amafegha\u201d; a pseudonym for Dan Etete, who was minister of petroleum at the time, owning 30 percent; and Wabi Hassan, the wife of Hassan Adamu, Nigeria\u2019s then-ambassador to the US, was credited with 20 percent.\n\nMohammed\u2019s father, Sani Abacha, was the Nigerian head of state at the time Malabu got the oil block.\n\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s administration revoked the allocation in 2001 but, after a legal tussle, agreed to return it to Malabu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this was not effected until 2010, after which Malabu sold the block to Shell and Eni for a total of $1.1 billion \u2014 with the multinational oil companies also paying a signature bonus of $210 million to the federal government.\n\nHowever, Abacha\u2019s oldest surviving son has told the court that while he was in detention between 1999 and 2002, his partners in Malabu expunged his name from the company\u2019s registration documents.\n\nHe said that in 2010, he petitioned the EFCC as well as Mohammed Adoke, then attorney-general of the federation, over the development and warned Shell and Eni not to buy OPL 245 from Malabu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdoke, who is the first defendant, previously alleged that the Abacha family was using the EFCC to persecute him because they believed he did not allow them to profit from the OPL 245 sale.\n\nEFCC denied the allegation at the time but has now presented Abacha as the prosecution witness in the case of alleged fraud filed against Adoke, the former AGF, Aliyu Abubakar, a businessman, and Rasky Gbinigie, company secretary of Malabu.\n\nAlso on trial are Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited (Eni), Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited.\n\nWHAT DID ABACHA SAY IN COURT?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the hearing on Thursday, Bala Sanga, the EFCC prosecutor, presented Abacha as the only witness he brought to the court before Justice Abubakar Kutigi.\n\nThe following conversation ensued.\n\nSanga: Tell the court your full name\n\nAbacha: Mohammed Sani Abacha, also known as Mohammed Sani\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanga: What do you do for a living?\n\nAbacha: I am a businessman\n\nSanga: You know the defendants in the suit\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanga: Can you inform to the court the capacity and circumstances you know them?\n\nAbacha: 1st defendant (Adoke) was company secretary of Kabo Airlines. He is former attorney-general of the federation. I paid him a courtesy visit when he became AGF and informed him of my problems with OPL 245 and Malabu Oil and Gas. He asked me to officially write him and indicate all the issues and problems I had. I did and submitted in 2010.\n\nSanga: What\u2019s the basis of your appearing in court?\n\nAbacha: Based on being a member and shareholder of Malabu Oil and Gas which was incorporated in 1998 to seek allocation of oil prospecting licence with the petroleum ministry. OPL 214 and 245 were subsequently granted to Malabu. At the time of granting the licences, the shareholders were Mohammed Sani, 10 million shares; Kweku Amafegha, six million shares; and Wabi Hassan, four million shares; Kweku was a pseudonym of Chief Dan Etete and Hassan was a pseudonym of Hassan Adamu (Wakilin Adamawa).\n\nSanga: When did you become aware of irregularities in company documents?\n\nAbacha: After the death of my father (in 1998), I was handed some documents and I was made aware of alterations and changes in Malabu. Subsequently, I gave a power of attorney to late AVM Mukhtar Babagana to kindly oversee the affairs of Malabu. He travelled to London to see Chief Dan Etete who had fled the country then. It became impossible for him to see him (Etete). Subsequently, I sought the help of my lawyer, Abubakar Malami (the current attorney-general of the federation), to go to CAC and conduct a search. After sometime, with no luck and response, I got R. O Atabo to conduct a search at CAC and it was discovered that several alterations had already been done in June 1998 and November 1998 where my name was totally removed and other changes in 2000 where shares were altered and converted and my name no longer appeared. That was when the other company, Petros Energy Limited, was introduced which is controlled by Chief Oyewole Fasawe.\n\nSanga: Did you at anytime authorise or attend meetings to change the name?\n\nAbacha: No, I did not. I never did.\n\nSanga: Kindly tell the court what steps you took after discovering the alterations.\n\nAbacha: First step was to file a suit at FHC, Abuja, seeking the court to assert my ownership of the 10 million shares in Malabu. Then I asked my lawyers in London to write Shell and ENI Agip cautioning them against going entering any agreement, JV or of sorts, with Malabu and I intimated them of being a director and shareholder. It was a caveat to Shell and Agip. I got R. O. Atabo to write a letter to the Netherlands and Italian embassy, the home embassies of Shell and Agip, to pass the information that the oil companies should not participate in any relationship with Malabu. Finally, I asked Atabo to publish in two newspapers cautioning anyone and forbidding anyone from entering into any negotiations, event or partnership with Malabu. Unfortunately, all fell on deaf ears.\n\nSanga: You told Atabo to conduct search. Can you inform the court on any specifics of these alterations?\n\nAbacha: The lawyer that falsified [the documents] went to CAC to make changes in Form Co2. I got Atabo to write a petition which was duly received and CAC responded, guiding and directing that they had forwarded a letter to the EFCC seeking them to investigate and prosecute the issues raised.\n\nSanga: Are you aware of any details of the disposal of OPL 245 and the proceeds therefore that you may want to tell the court?\n\nAbacha: While my case was pending in FHC, Chief Dan Etete and his cohorts had sold Malabu\u2019s oil block to Shell and ENI Agip. Unfortunately, the proceeds were paid without my knowledge, approval and consent as a shareholder.\n\nCROSS EXAMINATION BY PAUL EROKORO, FIRST DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL\n\nErokoro: You told the court that you bear two names. Please, repeat the names.\n\nAbacha: Mohammed Sani and Mohammed Sani Abacha\n\nErokoro: What is the name on your international passport.\n\nAbacha: It was Mohammed Sani and now Mohammed Sani Abacha\n\nErokoro: In what year did it change to Mohammed Sani Abacha\n\nAbacha: I can\u2019t remember.\n\nErokoro: Can you show this court a copy of any old passport that has Mohammed Sani?\n\nAbacha: I don\u2019t have a copy but can make available to the court.\n\nErokoro: Do you have any other official documents nearing Mohammed Sani apart from your international passport?\n\nAbacha: I have many.\n\nErokoro: Please, show them to the court.\n\nAbacha: I don\u2019t have them with me. If I was prepared, I would have brought them with me.\n\nErokoro: Do you have a driver\u2019s licence with you?\n\nAbacha: I don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s licence.\n\nErokoro: When you went to school, did you hear the name Mohammed Sani?\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nErokoro: Do you have anything to show that you were referred to as Mohammed Sani?\n\nAbacha: I don\u2019t have\n\nErokoro: At the time of your birth, your surname was Sani?\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nErokoro: Your have brothers and sisters?\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nErokoro: What are their surnames?\n\nAbacha: Sani Abacha.\n\nErokoro: So, you are the only one who did not carry his name at birth?\n\nAbacha: Not me alone, my late brother too.\n\nErokoro: By late, you mean Ibrahim\n\nAbacha: Ibrahim\n\nErokoro: I live in Ibrahim Abacha Estate. It\u2019s not true that he didn\u2019t bear your father\u2019s name.\n\nAbacha: It\u2019s the government that named the estate and not him.\n\nErokoro: So the government knew him as Ibrahim Abacha\u2026 You are the original shareholder of Malabu and so you have copies of the original incorporation documents.

          "text": "Mohammed Abacha admitted before the FCT high court sitting on Thursday that he used a different name \u2014 Mohammed Sani \u2014 to register Malabu Oil and Gas Ltd, the company that was awarded the controversial OPL 245 in 1998.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMohammed Sani\u201d originally had 50 percent in the company, with \u201cKweku Amafegha\u201d; a pseudonym for Dan Etete, who was minister of petroleum at the time, owning 30 percent; and Wabi Hassan, the wife of Hassan Adamu, Nigeria\u2019s then-ambassador to the US, was credited with 20 percent.\n\nMohammed\u2019s father, Sani Abacha, was the Nigerian head of state at the time Malabu got the oil block.\n\nPresident Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s administration revoked the allocation in 2001 but, after a legal tussle, agreed to return it to Malabu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this was not effected until 2010, after which Malabu sold the block to Shell and Eni for a total of $1.1 billion \u2014 with the multinational oil companies also paying a signature bonus of $210 million to the federal government.\n\nHowever, Abacha\u2019s oldest surviving son has told the court that while he was in detention between 1999 and 2002, his partners in Malabu expunged his name from the company\u2019s registration documents.\n\nHe said that in 2010, he petitioned the EFCC as well as Mohammed Adoke, then attorney-general of the federation, over the development and warned Shell and Eni not to buy OPL 245 from Malabu.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdoke, who is the first defendant, previously alleged that the Abacha family was using the EFCC to persecute him because they believed he did not allow them to profit from the OPL 245 sale.\n\nEFCC denied the allegation at the time but has now presented Abacha as the prosecution witness in the case of alleged fraud filed against Adoke, the former AGF, Aliyu Abubakar, a businessman, and Rasky Gbinigie, company secretary of Malabu.\n\nAlso on trial are Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited (Eni), Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited.\n\nWHAT DID ABACHA SAY IN COURT?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the hearing on Thursday, Bala Sanga, the EFCC prosecutor, presented Abacha as the only witness he brought to the court before Justice Abubakar Kutigi.\n\nThe following conversation ensued.\n\nSanga: Tell the court your full name\n\nAbacha: Mohammed Sani Abacha, also known as Mohammed Sani\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanga: What do you do for a living?\n\nAbacha: I am a businessman\n\nSanga: You know the defendants in the suit\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSanga: Can you inform to the court the capacity and circumstances you know them?\n\nAbacha: 1st defendant (Adoke) was company secretary of Kabo Airlines. He is former attorney-general of the federation. I paid him a courtesy visit when he became AGF and informed him of my problems with OPL 245 and Malabu Oil and Gas. He asked me to officially write him and indicate all the issues and problems I had. I did and submitted in 2010.\n\nSanga: What\u2019s the basis of your appearing in court?\n\nAbacha: Based on being a member and shareholder of Malabu Oil and Gas which was incorporated in 1998 to seek allocation of oil prospecting licence with the petroleum ministry. OPL 214 and 245 were subsequently granted to Malabu. At the time of granting the licences, the shareholders were Mohammed Sani, 10 million shares; Kweku Amafegha, six million shares; and Wabi Hassan, four million shares; Kweku was a pseudonym of Chief Dan Etete and Hassan was a pseudonym of Hassan Adamu (Wakilin Adamawa).\n\nSanga: When did you become aware of irregularities in company documents?\n\nAbacha: After the death of my father (in 1998), I was handed some documents and I was made aware of alterations and changes in Malabu. Subsequently, I gave a power of attorney to late AVM Mukhtar Babagana to kindly oversee the affairs of Malabu. He travelled to London to see Chief Dan Etete who had fled the country then. It became impossible for him to see him (Etete). Subsequently, I sought the help of my lawyer, Abubakar Malami (the current attorney-general of the federation), to go to CAC and conduct a search. After sometime, with no luck and response, I got R. O Atabo to conduct a search at CAC and it was discovered that several alterations had already been done in June 1998 and November 1998 where my name was totally removed and other changes in 2000 where shares were altered and converted and my name no longer appeared. That was when the other company, Petros Energy Limited, was introduced which is controlled by Chief Oyewole Fasawe.\n\nSanga: Did you at anytime authorise or attend meetings to change the name?\n\nAbacha: No, I did not. I never did.\n\nSanga: Kindly tell the court what steps you took after discovering the alterations.\n\nAbacha: First step was to file a suit at FHC, Abuja, seeking the court to assert my ownership of the 10 million shares in Malabu. Then I asked my lawyers in London to write Shell and ENI Agip cautioning them against going entering any agreement, JV or of sorts, with Malabu and I intimated them of being a director and shareholder. It was a caveat to Shell and Agip. I got R. O. Atabo to write a letter to the Netherlands and Italian embassy, the home embassies of Shell and Agip, to pass the information that the oil companies should not participate in any relationship with Malabu. Finally, I asked Atabo to publish in two newspapers cautioning anyone and forbidding anyone from entering into any negotiations, event or partnership with Malabu. Unfortunately, all fell on deaf ears.\n\nSanga: You told Atabo to conduct search. Can you inform the court on any specifics of these alterations?\n\nAbacha: The lawyer that falsified [the documents] went to CAC to make changes in Form Co2. I got Atabo to write a petition which was duly received and CAC responded, guiding and directing that they had forwarded a letter to the EFCC seeking them to investigate and prosecute the issues raised.\n\nSanga: Are you aware of any details of the disposal of OPL 245 and the proceeds therefore that you may want to tell the court?\n\nAbacha: While my case was pending in FHC, Chief Dan Etete and his cohorts had sold Malabu\u2019s oil block to Shell and ENI Agip. Unfortunately, the proceeds were paid without my knowledge, approval and consent as a shareholder.\n\nCROSS EXAMINATION BY PAUL EROKORO, FIRST DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL\n\nErokoro: You told the court that you bear two names. Please, repeat the names.\n\nAbacha: Mohammed Sani and Mohammed Sani Abacha\n\nErokoro: What is the name on your international passport.\n\nAbacha: It was Mohammed Sani and now Mohammed Sani Abacha\n\nErokoro: In what year did it change to Mohammed Sani Abacha\n\nAbacha: I can\u2019t remember.\n\nErokoro: Can you show this court a copy of any old passport that has Mohammed Sani?\n\nAbacha: I don\u2019t have a copy but can make available to the court.\n\nErokoro: Do you have any other official documents nearing Mohammed Sani apart from your international passport?\n\nAbacha: I have many.\n\nErokoro: Please, show them to the court.\n\nAbacha: I don\u2019t have them with me. If I was prepared, I would have brought them with me.\n\nErokoro: Do you have a driver\u2019s licence with you?\n\nAbacha: I don\u2019t have a driver\u2019s licence.\n\nErokoro: When you went to school, did you hear the name Mohammed Sani?\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nErokoro: Do you have anything to show that you were referred to as Mohammed Sani?\n\nAbacha: I don\u2019t have\n\nErokoro: At the time of your birth, your surname was Sani?\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nErokoro: Your have brothers and sisters?\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nErokoro: What are their surnames?\n\nAbacha: Sani Abacha.\n\nErokoro: So, you are the only one who did not carry his name at birth?\n\nAbacha: Not me alone, my late brother too.\n\nErokoro: By late, you mean Ibrahim\n\nAbacha: Ibrahim\n\nErokoro: I live in Ibrahim Abacha Estate. It\u2019s not true that he didn\u2019t bear your father\u2019s name.\n\nAbacha: It\u2019s the government that named the estate and not him.\n\nErokoro: So the government knew him as Ibrahim Abacha\u2026 You are the original shareholder of Malabu and so you have copies of the original incorporation documents. Please, show them to the court.\n\nAbacha: They are all in the custody of the EFCC.\n\nErokoro: Did you keep any copy for yourself?\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nErokoro: Did you ever hold board meetings\n\nAbacha: There was never a board meeting.\n\nErokoro: And all the original shareholder had pseudonyms?\n\nAbacha: No. The others yes, but me, no.\n\nCROSS EXAMINATION BY JOE-KYARI GADZAMA, COUNSEL TO ENI/AGIP\n\nGadzama: You signed the CAC registration form\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nGadzama: Ahmed Mohammed Sani is the name you signed\u2026 You told the court that you sent a letter to the 1st defendant but not copied to the 5th defendant (Eni).\n\nAbacha: Yes\n\nGadzama: You also told the court that you wrote letters to the Dutch and Italian embassy.

It\u2019s never our intention to add to the pains of our people, hence our decision to suspend the sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cIPOB leadership is only interested in our referendum and peaceful agitation for self determination, and cannot by under any guise be seen to be interfering with any electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe people of Anambra State should go out en masse and peacefully exercise their franchise come 6th November 20121 and accordingly, chose a leader of their Choice and should not be intimidated by anybody, group of persons or security agents.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group also warned supporters against attacking voters in Anambra under the guise of enforcing the suspended sit-at-home directive.\n\nIPOB, however, said it remains committed to the agitation for secession.\n\n\u201cAnambrarians should vote and standby to protect their votes. No rigging of any kind will be tolerated on the Anambra State governorship election. It must be transparent, free and fair to all,\u201d IPOB said.\n\n\u201cWe wish to thank Biafrans, IPOB members worldwide, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom for their continued support for our dogged struggle for independence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMay we, therefore, warn detractors, traitors and enemies of Biafra not to cause confusion by imputing motives to our decision. IPOB doesn\u2019t expect anybody to observe, monitor or enforce the suspended order, otherwise such action will be considered a rebellion to the highest leadership of our global movement.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, our oppressors should not take our decision as an act of cowardice. IPOB still believes that our elders, religious leaders, political leaders and various stakeholders will live up to their promises in their engagements and efforts towards securing the unconditional release of our leader.\n\n\u201cWe therefore urge all Biafrans and residents of Biafra to go about their lawful businesses without fear of any molestation.

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango/bird\n\nSupport for small businesses keen to trade across the continent\u2019s single market is being eyed as a potentially lucrative market by more and more African fintech startups.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech startups are rapidly expanding beyond their host countries\u2019 borders to tap into the anticipated surge in trade and investments with the opening up of the world\u2019s largest single market, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nSurge in intra-continental expansion\n\nIn the last month alone, a number of startups have either raised growth funds, acquired another player present in regional markets within the same vertical, or tapped top talent in the telecoms industry. Their intention appears to be the targeting of small industries and traders seeking cross-border opportunities in new African markets.\n\nKenyan based Asante Financial Services Group, focused on supporting the growth of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME\u2019s), has raised 7.5 million US dollars in series A funding to scale business credit offering to small businesses in Kenya and Uganda access to new markets across Africa.\n\n\u201cThe investment enables Asante to scale its credit offerings to the underserved segment of MSMEs in Kenya and Uganda, and expand to Nigeria and Rwanda,\u201d the start-up said in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTala, with African Operations in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania has begun a \u2018Rebuild Fund Business Program\u2019 targeting Kenya\u2019s hard-hit micro, small and medium-sized enterprises it say will help them build back better post-COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe program comes barely a month after Tala raised 145 million dollars in equity, hinting that part of the growth funds would go toward supporting its geographical expansion.\n\nThe World Bank puts the annual SME credit gap in Sub Saharan Africa at about 330 million US dollars, with traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d lenders turning a blind eye to small traders on account of lack of \u2013 among others \u2013 collateral, high costs of due diligence, customer acquisition, distribution and servicing.\n\n\u201cMSMEs\u2014particularly those in the informal sector\u2014are being held back by a lack of responsible lending from traditional financial services providers who are unable to run accurate credit checks and offer profitable loans to this segment of the market,\u201d said Bitta Wycliffe, Senior Investment Associate at Goodwell Investments.\n\nPan-Africa fintech firm, MFS Africa is also making inroads in Nigeria through the acquisition of Baxi, a Nigerian start-up with a 90,000-agent network. The October move gives Nigerian SME\u2019s listed on Baxi access to MFS Africa\u2019s multiple mobile money payment wallets, currently serving up to 320 million customers in more than 35 African countries.\n\nAnother Pan-African fintech venture, Yabx, with a presence in 12 African countries recently tapped a telecoms industry expert with over 15 years in experience as a new director for its business.\n\nEunice R. Gatama, who has worked for, among others, Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, in its mobile money (M-Pesa) division, as well as NCBA bank, has been tasked with pushing the growth of Yabx digital lending services in new African markets.\n\nUntil recently, a lack of local knowledge and access to trade and market information has been linked to low trade volumes and value. With more money pouring into the hiring of top regional talent, that scenario, too, is likely to change.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "There\u2019s a new exciting trend in the African tech ecosystem: African founders backing fellow founders especially in pre-seed and seed funding, which is an indication that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\nOn Wednesday, Payhippo, a fintech startup providing capital for small businesses in Nigeria, was another example of the existence of this trend when it announced that it has closed $3 million in seed funding led by a number of African tech founders.\n\nThe round was led by Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, co-founders Chipper Cash; Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, founder Flutterwave; Bolaji Balogun, CEO Chapel Hill Denham; and Hakeem Belo-Osagie, founder Metis Capital Partners.\n\nAngel investors from Paystack, Brex and Tala also participated in the round. TEN13, VentureSouq, and Prodigio Capital were the only institutional ventures that wrote a check for this round.\n\nThis investment comes barely 5 months after the startup raised a $1 million institutional pre-seed. Besides the earlier undisclosed capital raised from friends and family, the company\u2019s total fundraised is now at $4 million.\n\nCapital is a lifeline of business\n\nThere are over 40 million small and medium businesses (SMEs) in Nigeria. These businesses account for 96% of its total companies, 84% of employment, and 48% of the national GDP. But only a few of these businesses have access to capital, mostly due to heavy collateral requirements and long time of loan processing.\n\nPayhippo is at the forefront of solving this problem. Founded by Zach Bijesse, CEO, Chioma Okotcha, COO, and Uche Nnadi, CTO, Payhippo provides small businesses with short-term working capital with average loan amounts of $1300. The company also allows SMEs to build their credit score based on their track record of repaying their loans on time. SMEs even become eligible for higher amounts of capital as their credit score goes up.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIf capital is a lifeline of a business, then it\u2019s safe to say Payhippo is guarding the lifeline of Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cThis funding will allow us to invest in hiring more engineers and data scientists. We aim to improve our technology and enhance our lending offerings as we continue to address the persistent financing gap for small businesses in Nigeria,\u201d Okotcha, COO at Payhippo, said. \u201cAt Payhippo, our vision is to provide millions of small businesses with sufficient and available capital to run and grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nThe company said it has disbursed 5000 loans to SMEs since it launched in January 2020. In September 2021, the Payhippo reportedly earned $64,000 in revenue from $900,000 disbursed, experiencing 25% monthly growth with a 97% repayment rate on loans.\n\nCommenting on his investment in Payhippo, Bolaji Balogun, founder/CEO at Chapel Hill Denham said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited at how Payhippo is using technology to provide SMEs in Africa with access to finance required to run their business needs. By lending to small businesses, Payhippo is allowing business owners access to much-needed working capital to grow their businesses and create jobs in the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Serunjogi and Moujaled, the two co-founders of Chipper Cash, the African fintech which attained a unicorn status on Tuesday, they are bullish on supporting new financial technologies being developed and implemented to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector in Africa.\n\n\u201cAccess to credit is a critical necessity for small businesses to manage their daily challenges. Payhippo helps address this need through its innovative approach that provides loans to small businesses in less than three hours, enabling them to access sufficient working capital to grow.\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nPayhippo plans to use the new funding to improve its technology capabilities and expand its talent pool.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to DappRader, $10.7 billion had traded hands by the end of Q3 2021.\n\nArts and collectibles continue to be a big deal in the market, allowing artistes to monetise their craft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, NFTs come in other forms besides art, and one of them is music.\n\nAccording to Statista, NFT music sales in March 2021 reached $26.7 million, a small number, given that a single art NFT sold for $69 million.\n\nHowever, rapper turned music label owner, Henry Coco-Bassey sees the potential in musical NFT and tells the story that led to the sale of Africa\u2019s first music NFT.\n\nYou can read it here: Blockchain meets music: How music label owner promotes artistes and sells their music as NFTs\n\nCloudy with a chance of funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s raining funds in Egypt; three Egyptian startups \u2014 Breadfast, Bypa-ss, and Appetito \u2014 have announced some big cheques. Let\u2019s meet them.\n\nBreadfast: I know someone that\u2019ll get a craving for bread, hearing the name of this startup. However, this is not a bread-tech startup; it is an Egyptian grocery delivery company that has just raised $26 million in a Series A round.\n\nThe round was co-led by Vostok New Ventures and Endure Capital. Other participants include JAM Fund and Abudawood Group.\n\nWhile it might not be a bread-tech startup, it started as a bakery back in 2017. According to Mostafa Amin, Co-founder and CEO, \u201cWe started out baking and delivering fresh bread, and today we are able to give Egyptians access to thousands of items of their basic supermarket supplies at the click of a button.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup now offers scheduled and on-demand delivery of over 2,500 supermarket items via its app.\n\nBypa-ss: Away from bread and groceries, Egyptian healthtech startup, Bypa-ss has raised $1 million in a pre-seed round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, investors include MAGIC Fund and Launch Africa. Founded in 2019 by Andrew Saad, the startup provides easy and rapid access to a patient\u2019s medical history via its flagship product, HealthTag.\n\nSaad got the idea for the company back in medical school. A patient needed medication, but doctors were hesitant to administer any medicine because medical records for the patient weren\u2019t available.\n\nThe funding will help Bypa-ss expand its customer base and increase its network of over 3000 healthcare providers.\n\nAppetito: Now, let\u2019s go back to groceries and eCommerce, a sector that\u2019s been getting some attention in Egypt lately.\n\nBreadfast isn\u2019t the only grocery delivery startup getting an avalanche of cash in this funding storm. Appetito also joined the party, bagging $2 million in a pre-Series A funding round.\n\nAppetito, which launched in 2017, delivers fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) directly to customers. While its model might seem similar to Breadfast, Appetito is more concerned with offering affordable services.\n\nThe startup\u2019s CEO, Shehab Mokhtar, told TechCrunch that the company is \u201ctrying to provide customers not only with a convenient experience but also an affordable one by sourcing the products directly from the manufacturers and selling them directly to them.\u201d\n\nHe says the company is trying to mix convenience and affordability, saying that while 10 to 15-minute delivery sounds good, it comes at a high price. Appetito, on the other hand, completes deliveries within an hour or the next day at an affordable price.\n\nPayhippo raises $3m seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayhippo co-founders: L-R: Zach Bijesse (CEO), Chioma Okotcha (COO), and Uche Nnadi (CTO). Source: Supplied\n\nNigerian fintech startup, Payhippo, has closed a $3 million seed funding round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round saw funding from angel investors, including Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, and Ham Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled, Chipper Cash Co-founders.\n\nFounded in 2020, the startup\u2019s goal is to provide African small businesses access to finance while helping them to build their credit history.\n\nThe lending and business financing platform also got accepted into Y Combinator\u2019s Summer 2021 cohort in August and closed a $1 million pre-seed round back in July 2021.\n\nAccording to PwC, the financing gap for Nigerian MSMEs is \u20a6617.3 billion ($1.59 billion) annually, and less than 5% of them have access to adequate credit facilities.\n\nConsidering small businesses contribute 48% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, their importance cannot be overestimated, hence the need for adequate financing.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Chioma Okotcha, Payhippo Co-founder and COO, says the startup wants to disburse at least 40,000 loans a day, 1% of Nigeria\u2019s 40 million SMEs.\n\nThe fund will go into hiring more talents so that it can provide credit to more SMEs rapidly.\n\nOpibus, electric mobility company, gets $7.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 2, 2021, Swedish-Kenyan technology company, Opibus received $7.5 million in funding from investors, including At One Ventures and Ambo Ventures. $5 million in equity and $2.5 million in grants make up this financing.\n\nThe company produces heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) such as buses and trucks by converting petrol and diesel-based vehicles into electric, reducing cost and, in a way recycling older vehicles.\n\nOpibus has been manufacturing EVs since 2017, intending to make electric vehicles affordable in Africa.\n\nAccording to Filip Gardler, Opibus CEO, \u201cWe have together reached a clear strategic and visionary alignment \u2013 with the conviction that mass manufacturing of electric mobility solutions in Africa will not only make the products more accessible and affordable but also lead to one of the largest industrialisation and welfare transitions of the region in modern time.\u201d\n\nManufacturing electric vehicles or hardware production isn\u2019t a space filled with many African startups.\n\nHowever, we still have the likes of Jet Motor Company that announced a $9 million funding in 2020, Siltech, and Ampersand playing in the space.\n\nWith the road being the most dominant means of transportation in Africa, accounting for 90% of passenger traffic, EVs have a huge addressable market. However, the high cost of production is still a significant entry barrier.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nNigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay to think non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are overhyped. It seems almost everyone on Twitter has added the suffix \u201c.eth\u201d to their username.\n\nBut when you observe the amount of money exchanging hands in the NFT market, you might understand why everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nData from NonFungible shows that in Q1 2021, more than $2 billion was traded in NFTs. Recent data by DappRader reveals that number surged to $10.7 billion in Q3, representing a 38,060% increase year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating; billions have traded hands in exchange for virtual kittens and images of anthropomorphised apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile art is popular with NFTs, it can take several other forms, one of which is music.\n\nNFT untapped\n\nThe rarity of musical NFTs in Africa is one of the reasons that led Henry Coco-Bassey \u2014 popularly known as Hector \u2014 musician turned label owner, to enter the NFT space, where he\u2019s making not only money but some pretty exciting discoveries.\n\nRecounting when he discovered NFTs, he said, \u201cI started seeing NFTs in the news, a way you could take your creativity and turn it into a digital asset and earn in crypto. It was interesting, and I was like, \u2018I need to know more about this.'\u201d\n\nHector the rapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Coco-Bassey aka Hector\n\nHector\u2019s love for music is huge, and while this might come off as an NFT story, it is more of a music story.\n\nAs a child, he sang everywhere \u2014 school, church, and especially in the shower.\n\nWhile he loved music generally, he was captivated by rap.\n\n\u201cI started falling in love with rap music when I was young because my dad used to play Tupac all the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tupac Shakur\u2019s politically charged music, his love for rap was also deepened by the satiric and controversial American animated series, The Boondocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made sense for Hector to join the church choir \u2014 a place to create or at least participate in creating what he loved. He tried to infuse rap into church music, but that didn\u2019t fly with the church folk. From what he told me, the idea of rapping in the church was equivalent to or worse than lighting a cigarette at the altar.\n\nBut, he didn\u2019t give up on rap. He released his first song before getting into the university and kept making music till he graduated, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the earnings he made from music.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be doing music anymore.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the fact that I put out music and I didn\u2019t earn. I recorded my last song with another rapper from Colorado, US. It was the first song I had on TuneCore and other platforms, so I made some money from it after a couple of months.\u201d\n\nHector\u2019s decision to stop making music didn\u2019t mean he was done with it; as I said, he loved it. So, the proceeds from his final record went into learning about the music business.\n\nAfter much thought, he told himself, \u201cI could be a music agent, helping other artistes that don\u2019t really know how to put out their music. So I started learning and exploring.\u201d\n\nHector spent a long time on the Internet trying to figure out the music business. \u201cI was on YouTube every night,\u201d he laughingly told me.\n\nThe YouTube vigils paid off; he took on his first client, and it was a success.\n\n\u201cI worked with artistes from the US and UK to help them put out their music.\u201d\n\nHaving gained some experience, Hector decided to launch his record label, Unique Sirius. But it was unlike any label on the continent; it connected artistes and fans in the NFT metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHector and some artistes\n\nCall to NFT\n\nWhile running his label, Hector still sought ways to get additional income. He met a friend who was into forex and crypto trading. He found it interesting and started following crypto news and trends, and he caught wind of the NFT craze circling among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNFT is incredible, and he has seen an avenue where his artistes could earn more for their music. But tokenised music has not caught on in Africa.\n\nPer NonFungible, artworks and collectibles are still the most popular in the NFT market. But music NFTs are gaining some wind too.\n\nIn August 2021, Tory Lanez, an American singer, sold a million copies of his NFT album in 57 seconds.\n\nHector saw the potential in NFTs. An opportunity for artistes to connect with fans better and make lots of money in a very short time\n\nHe reached out to influential artistes in the Nigerian music industry because he knew a big artiste could get the NFT ball rolling in Africa. But no one took him up on his offer.\n\nLuckily, he met Challex D Boss, a Nigerian artiste with a strong following in Cross River, Akwa Ibom, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallex D Boss performing on stage\n\nAlthough Challex didn\u2019t have the kind of global influence Hector wanted, he was still an excellent pick for launching what he calls \u201cthe first NFT music in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe first song to be minted as an NFT in Africa was My Fans. It was perfect, not only because Hector loved the sound, but it also preached the NFT message \u2014 a way to connect with fans while they also got rewarded. It was a win-win situation.\n\nThe song was minted on Rocki, an NFT music platform on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Bjorn Niclas, Rocki CEO, was also thrilled at the idea of launching Africa\u2019s first musical NFT on the platform and paid the gas fees.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost 10,000 units of the 100,000 units of My Fans had been sold. Hector was excited. The numbers were good, but more importantly, history had just been made \u2014 the first tokenised afrobeat music.\n\nHector said, \u201cNothing felt like it. I\u2019d just done what I needed to do. I want artistes to eat off their music too. I\u2019ve tested the market, and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe artistes weren\u2019t the only ones eating from the market. Fans who bought the NFT gained their share, receiving 20% of the royalties from every secondary sale.\n\nNFTs are transforming the music business\n\nHector believes NFTs are going to be a big part of the music business in a few years. It will take power from big corporations and give it to artistes and listeners.\n\n\u201cIt will be great for independent artistes,\u201d he says, explaining how hard it is for them to make money with their creativity. When they finally do, a large percentage goes to the platforms that list the music.\n\nFor context, an artiste makes $0.0084 per stream on Spotify, a music streaming platform. If the song gets streamed one million times, the artiste makes $8,400. This means if Tory Lanez were to put his song on Spotify rather than minting them as NFT, he\u2019d make $8,400 after a million streams instead of $1 million after a million purchases.\n\nBut, what\u2019s in it for the fans? Why buy music NFTs? The fans can easily resell for a higher price. For example, Tory Lanez minted a million copies of his song for a dollar each. This means a fan can sell for $5, making $4 in profit.\n\nThe only drawback is, Tory Lanez was able to pull that off because he was already famous, a feat impossible for an upcoming artiste.\n\nHector believes it\u2019s possible due to the win-win nature of the transaction. He believes if an upcoming artiste makes good music and can gather a small number of followers, his fans will buy his NFT and promote him so they can increase the value of what they\u2019ve bought.\n\nIt seems like a lot to take in, but Hector believes strongly in the future of NFTs as the disruptor of the music business as we know it. He\u2019s currently creating a crypto token and, at the same time, building a blockchain metaverse where crypto and NFTs reign supreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And no, lack of money was not the reason. Seeing this, Chris Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s CEO and Founder started the company to bridge the gap between African shoppers and these eCommerce platforms.\n\nAided by an influx of Africans to the Internet, the startup grew steadily, gaining attention and support from investors and media houses like CNN.\n\nHere are some things to know before you read the article. First, the company has shut down its operations with plans for a rebranding in place. According to Folayan, this is due to the devaluation of the naira and some CBN policies.\n\nAlso, while orders are no longer being accepted on the platform, those placed before the shutdown would still be delivered. However, Folayan reveals that owing to a reduction in the number of staff, this could take longer than usual.\n\nRevved up yet? You might want to get a cup of tea as you read this: Nigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams\n\nIn this age of eight-figure pre-seed rounds by African startups, stories of entrepreneurs who have slowly but steadily built their businesses are rare.\n\nFor Affiong Williams, Founder and CEO of agritech startup, ReelFruit, starting a fruit processing business in Nigeria with no template to draw from was a bold move.\n\nFor her first degree, Williams studied Physiology and Psychology. Like a lot of Nigerians, the goal was to become a medical doctor. However, those plans flew out the window while in school so to increase her options, she did a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing this, she started at Endeavour South Africa, where she worked closely with entrepreneurs, supporting them in running their businesses. This was where her interest in entrepreneurship was born. Contrary to the expectations of her immediate family, she left her job and, with her savings, returned to Nigeria to set up ReelFruit.\n\nWhat you may not know is that she hoped to win a UN grant for her business, but just three days after she returned, she got the rejection letter.\n\nIn this episode of Founder\u2019s Table, Williams shares from her over eight years of experience running ReelFruit, while revealing the company\u2019s plans for global expansion. There are also some fundraising tips for those struggling to get buy-in from investors.\n\nRead more: Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months after raising a $100 million Series C round, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash has raised $150 million in a Series C extension round at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nThe extension round was led by crypto exchange platform, FTX with SVB Capital, Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, and Tribe Capital participating.\n\nCurrently serving seven African countries, Chipper Cash was founded in 2018 by Sam Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled to facilitate cross border payment in Africa. This year, it initiated international expansion plans, starting with the UK and the US.\n\nThe cost of sending money to and within sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world. This is where Chipper Cash has found a sweet spot. Serunjogi reveals that Chipper Cash offers remittances at \u201cconsiderably cheaper\u201d prices than other competitors. These competitors include long time players like Western Union and World Remit.\n\nViolence against journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the Austrian-American journalist, Henry Grunwald, who said, \u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\u201d Yet, for so many African journalists, speaking could result in their death.\n\nSince 1992, 265 journalists have reportedly been killed in 51 African countries. Somalia and Algeria account for the majority of these murders with 70 and 60 respectively. On this year\u2019s International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, here are the top 20 African countries with the most deaths of journalists.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to Find The Secret to Meaningful Work.

          "title": "COP 26: Nigeria\u2019s coal deposit gets 2030 final development deadline",
          "text": "Nigeria and other developing countries with huge coal deposits have till the end of this decade to completely move away from coal as 190 countries and big financiers have pledged to phase it out.\n\nAt least, 23 countries have made new commitments to phase out coal power, including five of the world\u2019s top 20 coal power-using countries. 25 countries and public finance institutions have committed to ending international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022. Major global banks have also said they would no longer fund coal projects.\n\nThese decisions were taken at the Climate Change of Parties taking place at Glasgow, in the United Kingdom. This is significant, the UN said, because it could shift an estimated $17.8 billion a year in public support out of fossil fuels and into the clean energy transition.\n\nHowever, for this to happen, some rich nations committed to helping countries who rely on coal for power generation.\n\nSome experts say Nigeria holds over 2.8 billion tons of coal but proven reserves were put at 379 million tons by the Ministry of Solid Minerals, making it the world\u2019s 44th largest proven reserves. Large swaths of coal deposits can be found in Nasarawa, Enugu, Gombe, Kogi states and in 15 other states, much of which may never be tapped.\n\nUpon his appointment as minister of solid minerals, Kayode Fayemi in 2016 said within the next four years, Nigeria would be generating over 1,000mw of electricity from coal. That dream never materialised.\n\nPrior to the indigenisation policy of 1972, Nigeria was a key producer of coal and it was used in electricity generation. The policy, which sought to increase local participation, excluded key foreigners with the superior technology and resources to develop the commodity. Nigeria\u2019s obsession with oil further put paid to any ambition to develop coal. With the developments from COP 26, Nigeria\u2019s vast coal resources may not only be untapped, the country will get nothing from abandoning it.\n\nRead also: COP 26: UNECA establishes $30bn facility for Africa\n\nTo persuade coal dependent countries to join the plan to phase out the commodity, rich nations led by the United Kingdom promised a raft of financial support.\n\nSouth Africa, which depends on coal for 85 percent of its power generation, received a ground-breaking $8.5 billion support to transition to clean energy on Tuesday. This has buoyed other countries depending on coal to ramp up their commitments.\n\n\u201cSecuring a 190-strong coalition to phase out coal power and end support for new coal power plants and the Just Transition Declaration signed today, show a real international commitment to not leave any nation behind,\u201d said Alok Sharma, COP 26 president.\n\n\u201cTogether we can accelerate access to electricity for more than three quarters of a billion people who currently lack access, consigning energy poverty to history as we create the clean power future needed to keep 1.5 alive,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2019, 37 percent of the total energy produced in the world came from burning coal, but as of today, a new pledge has been signed by over 40 countries at COP 26 to move away from coal as an energy source to more renewable energy sources.\n\nSignatories to the pledge include Indonesia, Vietnam, Poland, South Korea, Egypt, Spain, Nepal, Singapore, Chile, Ukraine and South Africa.\n\nAs part of the pledge, all signing nations are now committed to ending all investment in new coal power, both at home and abroad, with additional promises to phase out coal in developed countries by 2030 and developing countries by 2040.\n\n\u201cThe world is moving in the right direction, standing ready to seal coal\u2019s fate and embrace environmental and economic benefits of building a future that is powered by clean energy,\u201d said Kwasi Kwarteng, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy of the United Kingdom.\n\nA just transition to clean energy and the rapid phase-out of coal has been at the heart of the COP 26 talks as part of its efforts to minimise temperature rises in line with the Paris Agreement. The breadth of commitments in Glasgow on Thursday at Energy Day signalled the world moving towards a renewable future.\n\nIn a new \u2018Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement,\u2019 countries also committed to scaling up clean power and ensuring a just transition away from coal.\n\nBanks and financial institutions also made landmark commitments at COP 26 today to end the funding of unabated coal, including major international lenders like HSBC, Fidelity International and Ethos.\n\nAt the ongoing COP 26, China, Japan and South Korea have announced that they would end overseas coal financing, which now means all significant public international financing for coal power has effectively ended.\n\nIn addition, a group of 25 countries including COP 26 partners Italy, Canada, the United States and Denmark together with public finance institutions have signed a UK-led joint statement committing to ending international public support for the unabated fossil fuel energy sector by the end of 2022, and instead prioritising support for the clean energy transition.\n\nDeveloping countries including Ethiopia, Fiji and the Marshall Islands offered their support, signalling growing unity. This is an inclusive agenda that must recognise the development and energy needs of all economies.\n\nThis is a historic step. It is the first time a COP presidency has prioritised this issue and put a bold end date on international fossil fuel finance. COP 26 has set a new gold standard on the Paris Alignment of international public finance and sends a clear signal for private investors to follow.\n\nOn Thursday, 28 new members also signed up to the world\u2019s largest alliance on phasing out coal. The Powering Past Coal Alliance launched and co-chaired by the UK and Canada. New members include Chile and Singapore, joining more than 160 countries, sub-nationals and businesses.\n\nTwenty new countries, including Vietnam, Morocco and Poland committed to building no new coal plants, matching similar announcements over the past year by Pakistan, Malaysia and the Philippines, and building on the No New Coal Power Compact launched in September by Sri Lanka, Chile, Montenegro and European partners.\n\nThere has been a 76 percent drop in the number of new coal plants planned globally over the last six years since the Paris Agreement was adopted, said the UN. This equates to the cancellation of more than 1000GW of new coal plants.\n\nIn separate announcements, major emerging economies today took significant steps to move from coal to clean power. India, Indonesia, the Philippines and South Africa announced partnerships with the Climate Investment Funds to accelerate their transitions away from coal power, backed by a dedicated $2 billion facility.\n\nIndonesia and the Philippines announced pioneering partnerships with the Asian Development Bank to support the early retirement of coal plants.",

          "text": "As rescue operations continue with more survivors and dead bodies being pulled out from the rubbles of the collapsed 21-storey building in Ikoyi, Lagos, experts have faulted Lagos State government on regulatory compliance in the state\u2019s building sector.\n\nThe experts described the otherwise ambitious collapse building as bad construction with serious engineering issues. The pillars were too weak which explains why the building collapsed like a pack of cards with the deckings (slaps) falling on one another as if it were controlled demolition.\n\n\u201cWhat we see here is a clear case of failure on the regulatory authority and greed on the part of the developer. We learnt that this project was stopped in June this year and the site sealed; what happened that led to resumption of construction work\u201d? MKO Balogun, CEO, Global PFI, queried.\n\nDebo Adejana, chairman, Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), South West Zone, agrees, saying that as a nation, we should be burying our heads in the sand like the Ostrich as this kind of incident happening in a prime location like Ikoyi is unheard of in other climes.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened is grievious because it is not an act of God. The developer, we learnt, also practices outside the country and therefore should know the right thing to do. Why has this happened? I expect that heads will roll when the panel that is to be set up concludes its investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nUndoubtedly, the collapse of a building of this magnitude, which is the first of its kind in the history of building construction in Nigeria, comes with grave implications for the country\u2019s real estate market, especially the high-rise luxury sub-market.\n\nThough Tayo Odunsi, CEO, Northcourt Real Estate, does not see the incident affecting both supply and demand for luxury apartments in high-rise buildings, he sees a significant increase in construction risk financing going forward.\n\nRead Also: More evidence shows Ikoyi collapsed building developer flouted permit\n\n\u201cFinanciers are going to be a lot more cautious and will be asking a lot of questions on developers\u2019 antecedents before committing funds to a project. They will be making demands from the developers on issues bordering on regulatory compliance and the kind of project partners they have assembled,\u201d he said\n\nThere is, however, a positive side to the collapse, according to Odunsi, explaining that big developers who are known for their integrity and quality work delivery will now have to name their prices and people will be compelled to pay because they are sure of what they are paying for.\n\nOladipo Agida, CEO, Dradrock Real Estate, shares this view, saying that because there are fakes which are found across sectors, there also genuine developers who take the pain and commit resources to doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cFor a whole 21-storey building to collapse completely means the structural engineering was faulty. As a developer, before you start any development, you should do your soil test which determines the kind of foundation you are to do for the project,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that government approved 15-floors for the developer, but he added six more floors, That alone says it all that the building was a disaster waiting to happen because the six more floors came with additional load which the building was not prepared to carry,\u201d added.\n\nA professional builder, who did not want to be named, noted that for the building to collapse means there were no professionals on ground to supervise the construction as it progressed. The builder wondered why work had to resume on a building that was sealed and stop work order issued, yet the regulatory authority looked away.\n\n\u201cWhy was the building sealed in the first place; what was wrong that led to the stop work order; what did the developer do differently that made the government to unseal the building; who was the project supervisor from the government building control agency\u201d? the builder asked.\n\nMeanwhile, fresh facts have emerged on the collapsed building that are not only big slap on the regulatory authority, but also a dent on the integrity of the developer and the building industry in Nigeria in general and Lagos State in particular.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that since February 20,2020 to when the building collapsed on Monday, November 1, 2021, it did not have a supervising consultant as Prowess Engineering Limited, the lead consultant on the project, withdrew its services, citing lack of confidence in the project.\n\nThe company, in a letter dated February 20,2020 and signed by its managing director, Muritala Olawale, which was sighted by BusinessDay, stated that they could no longer guarantee the integrity of the building since \u201cwe do not have the concrete cube test result for each stage of the building till date.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a visit to the construction site of the collapsed building shows a phony Project Board that smacks of deceit and lack of seriousness in a very serious real estate business.\n\nThe first thing that assaults a visitor\u2019s eyes is that the client\u2019s name is abbreviated and given with a phone number. The main contractor\u2019s name is also given with a phone number which appears like same client\u2019s construction company.\n\nConcept Designer and Project Manager are not any different as they also have no name, but only a phone number. Though the name of the Structural Engineers was given, the phone number was covered and concealed , making it even more suspicious.\n\nThe Architect has no given name, just a phone number. The same way, the Mechanical Engineers have no given name, just a phone number.\n\nInformation given on this Project Board makes it look as if there were just two distinct personnel on this project and these were the client who was the same owner of the construction company and the Structural Engineer. All these have subjected activities on the building to various interpretations.\n\nThe collapsed building, standing on 21 floors on Gerard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, was being developed by Fourscore Homes Limited which is owned by Olufemi Adegoke Osibona, who is said to be an international real estate developer with footprints in London and South Africa.\n\nThe building would have offered homes to 42 families since each floor comprised two apartments of 3-bedroom each. Given an average of five persons per family, the building would have been home to about 210 persons.",

          "text": "As it eyes expansion in infrastructure deployment in Nigeria in the next three years and debt refinancing, MTN Nigeria is intensifying activities around growing its cash reserve.\n\nThe largest telecom operator in Nigeria had on Thursday, November 4, concluded the signing ceremony of the N89.999 billion, 12.75 percent 10-year fixed-rate bond that was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October.\n\nThe nearly N90 billion bond is the second tranche of the N200 billion bond issuance programme by MTN Nigeria. The first tranche of the bond was oversubscribed and enabled the telco to raise more than N110 billion of a 7-year 13 percent fixed-rate bond due in 2028. The company expects it to be paid twice in 2027 and the next year.\n\nMTN Nigeria had in August said it planned to invest N600 billion to expand its network infrastructure nationwide over the next three years to improve telecommunications services across Nigeria. At the signing ceremony, Karl Toriola, CEO of MTN Nigeria, said the bond issuance was part of efforts to source funding for the N600 billion plan.\n\nThe South African-owned company has also commenced the sale of N101 billion (244 m) worth of shares in its Nigerian unit.\n\nRead Also: MTN Nigeria compensates subscribers for network downtime\n\nMTN Nigeria\n\nAccording to Toriola, the primary focus of the share sale will be the retail segment in the Nigerian economy. The company plans to make retail operators part of its future growth strategy by making them investors in the company.\n\nA statement from the company\u2019s headquarters in Johannesburg notes that the telco will offer 575 million shares in MTN Nigeria Communications plc, which has been listed in the Nigerian Stock Exchange since 2019.\n\nThe process to sell shares will be done by way of a bookbuild to institutional investors and a fixed price to retail investors. The offer opened in November with a bookbuild to institutional investors, after which a fixed price will be announced for retail investors. The offer is expected to close in December, and analysts expect this to bring significant buzz to and further help to deepen the Nigerian stock exchange.\n\n\u201cThis is the first step in our previously communicated statement of intent to sell down approximately 14 percent of MTN Group\u2019s current shareholding in MTN Nigeria,\u201d the company says.\n\nA spokesperson for Chapel Hill Denham said on Thursday the price for the retail investors would be reflective of the market.\n\nMTN Nigeria also wants to be seen as an indigenous company contributing to the economic development of the country. In recent times, the telco had taken its ambition to the Federal Government where it sought its approval to reconstruct the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway under the road infrastructure task credit (RITC) scheme.\n\n\u201cThis is in response to the government\u2019s drive towards public-private partnerships in the rehabilitation of critical road infrastructure in Nigeria,\u201d Toriola had said in a statement, noting, \u201cWe intend to participate in the restoration and refurbishment of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway.\u201d",

You will only complete the formalities to get employed.\n\n\u201cI want to appreciate the management of the institution for keeping to the vision of our government to build a world-class university in Edo. I urge you to keep to the good works of bringing more Laurels to the university and our state.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI am impressed with what you are doing in this school; that gives us the impetus to continue to do more for the institution. We believe that if we endow the university with world-class infrastructure and facilities, it will be able to run itself on a sustained basis.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we will fulfill our obligations to the university.

To that extent, we introduced different reforms to assure and guarantee that favouritism does not have a role to play in the appointment of permanent secretaries.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the model that we have since adopted has helped us in identifying top performing civil servants who are indeed deserving to be permanent secretaries. And again in our usual style, they don\u2019t need to have seen me, met me, known me and they don\u2019t have to lobby; all they have to do is to be consistent, dedicated and continue to improve themselves,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nAbiodun, while noting that his administration would continue to put issues that has to do with the welfare of civil servants on the front burner, added that the administration would continue to be creative with its Internally Generated Revenue in order to be able to meet all obligations that has to do with the welfare and wellness of the people.\n\n\u201cThere are issues that we are discussing that affect the welfare of our people, we will continue to put all their issues on the front burner. We are also looking at issues of deductions, contributory pension scheme and gratuity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to be creative about increasing our Internally Generated Revenue for this same purpose, because any sub-national that solely rely on money from the Federal Government will not be viable. So, we will continue to be very creative about our IGR so we will be able to meet all this obligations that has to do with the welfare and wellness of our people, whilst at the same time ensuring that we continue to invest in transformational infrastructural activities across the state.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the Association for coming up with the idea of erecting a befitting structure as its secretariat that would have a health care center for the elderly, wellness and fitness center and an old people\u2019s home, the he declared that his administration would support the body.\n\nThe Chairman of the Association, Babatunde Osokoya, lauded the governor for the prompt payment of salaries and the release of the quarterly five hundred million naira for the payment of gratuities of pensioners in the state.\n\nHe also commended him for resuscitating the long dream of the state by establishing the Lagos-Ogun Joint Development Commission and the signing of a memorandum of understanding, to espouse rapid and mutual development.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "summary": "He equally noted that the model his administration adopted has helped in identifying top performing civil servants who are indeed deserving to be permanent secretaries.\nAbiodun stated this shortly after he was decorated as the Grand Patron of the Association of Retired Heads of Service and Permanent Secretaries, held in Abeokuta, Ogun state capital.\n\u201cSince when we assumed office, we\u2019ve put different policies in place to ensure that the Ogun State civil service is known to be that which merit is placed above anything else.\nTo that extent, we introduced different reforms to assure and guarantee that favouritism does not have a role to play in the appointment of permanent secretaries.\n\u201cConsequently, the model that we have since adopted has helped us in identifying top performing civil servants who are indeed deserving to be permanent secretaries.",

Dave Umahi, thanked the federal government and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for their efforts in ensuring that Saturday\u2019s Anambra State governorship election holds.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the various illegal orders of sit-at home by different groups of state agitators for our people of South East to sit at home every Monday and from 5th to 10th November 2021,\u201d the governors said.\n\n\u201cWhereas we have identified some of the spokespersons of some of these groups and we have been engaging them to stop all forms of violence and illegalities in South East and allow South East leaders to address all issues raised by them, we are however working with security agencies, our local security and our leaders to protect the lives of our people and to address all issues raised.\n\n\u201cWe thank Ohaneze Ndigbo for a good job they did through their various committees in raising various solutions towards addressing all issues raised by our young children. South East Governors are studying their reports with the elders and leaders of the various South East States and very soon, we will be meeting with Federal Government of Nigeria on these issues including deploying political solutions in the case of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu which we have already initiated.\n\n\u201cWe thank our religious leaders, Conference of Bishops and Archbishops of South East, the traditional institutions of South East and Christian Association of Nigeria of South East for their interventions and mediations on this matter. We will work with them to achieve the desired result for our people and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe plead with all security agencies deployed for Anambra election to please secure the lives of our people in Anambra State while playing within the rules of their engagements.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the insecurity in South East has gone beyond IPOB. Cultists, armed robbers and kidnappers have recruited themselves and are using the name of IPOB to be killing innocent citizens. We will not allow this to continue.\n\n\u201cWe thank Federal Government of Nigeria and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for their determination to hold Anambra election on 6th November, 2021. We will give them every support and shall help them to ensure a free, fair and violence free election. We therefore ask our people to go out and vote for candidates of their choice as we have been assured of adequate security measures to secure their lives and properties.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that through our mediation, that of religious leaders, Ohaneze Ndigbo and traditional rulers, IPOB will see reasons to call off all sit-at-home orders including the recent one of 5th to 10th November, 2021. We as South East Governors are committed to political solutions over the present situation in South East and this will be achieved faster if all the illegal sit-at-home orders and violence by the various state agitators are stopped in South East.\n\n\u201cWe wish Anambra people a peaceful election on 6th November, 2021.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

Pat Asadu, said: \u201cWe are now looking at the difference between project D which is the construction of 284 kilometers Nigeria-Maradi railway standard world-class line against Project C where you talked about the total rehabilitation and reconstruction of Port Harcourt to Maiduguri eastern rail network defined as narrow gauge.\n\n\u201cFor a segment of this country that is known for trade and commerce, they need railway as they need air. If the Ministry feels that doing a 287 kilometer of railway track from Kano to Maradi that you will fund with Nigerian money borrowed for Nigerians to be paid by our children to do a world class railway to Maradi.\n\n\u201cI also know the economy of Niger Republic and I believe the economy of the South-East is bigger than that of Maradi. I am not even talking of South-South. So what policy guide, what need assessment, what study of federal character integration would make the Ministry of Transportation to put 284 kilometers railway from the end of the North to Maradi and then constructing a narrow gauge in the South-East and South-South.\n\n\u201cThis to me is why the integration of this country will always be challenged because things are done with so much impunity. This is our commonwealth. So if we approve this budget for you, you will go and do Kano-Maradi standard rail line and do a narrow gauge rehabilitation for the South-East. My heart bleeds. Instead of doing the right thing, you are now giving us this one as what will enhance the economy of Niger and Nigeria, while the economy of Nigerians especially those who have the containers and who are always on the road are given a narrow gauge rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor his part, chairman of the Senate Committee on Marine Transport, Senator Danjuma Goje, also criticised the rail projects.\n\n\u201cWhy will you give those of us from the eastern part of Nigeria, from South-East, North-Central, North-East the archaic, old-model narrow gauge, then you are now spending a lot of money to do the modern standard gauge to another country.\n\n\u201cAre people from the South-East, North-Central and North-East not Nigerians? Why should there be double standard in this matter? That is why we are quarreling.\n\n\u201cYou are telling us you are designing Ibadan to Abuja, you are doing Kaduna to Kano, you are doing Abuja to Itakpe and to Warri.

I completely concur with Honourable Pat Asadu 100 per cent,\u201d Goje said.\n\nBut responding to the issues raised by the lawmakers, the minister said, \u201cthe total cost for the construction of the Eastern line which begins from Port Harcourt to Borno State is between $12billion and $14billion.\n\n\u201cIf we start looking for the money now and it takes time before we get that money, you will say it is Amaechi that refused to give you railway. Because already as we are talking, we don\u2019t even have the money to do Ibadan to Kano. That is why on our own, we are funding Kano to Kaduna while looking for the money.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for $11.1billion for Lagos to Calabar. Do you want us to include you on that where we are searching for money or to be practical?\n\n\u201cHe (Mr President) wants a standard gauge from Port Harcourt to Maiduguri. But when I laid the cards on the table and explained that if we start looking for money, we will not construct. I said to the President give me two approvals so that every part of the country will have a rail line.\n\n\u201cThe first approval is to reconstruct and not rehabilitate the narrow gauge. Then give me a second approval that will enable me to look for the $14billion to construct standard gauge.\n\n\u201cSo with the two approvals, anyone I get money for I will go ahead. But the one that is quicker to get the money is $3.020million. So that by the time you finish it, the rail is running while we are looking for money to construct standard gauge.\n\n\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake what is the difference between standard and narrow gauge? The difference is speed which is about 20 kilometers. Whatever weight of cargo that narrow gauge will carry is the same weight of charge that standard gauge will carry.\n\n\u201cNow as a Minister, my mind tells me you won\u2019t go home if you don\u2019t provide railway for your people. I now said since it will be difficult for me to get $14billion, let me ask for the small one of $3billion so that I can at least reconstruct this one to run between 80 and 100 kilometers. Standard gauge for Christ\u2019s sake is 120 kilometers. So, the difference is if you take off from Lagos, you may get to Ibadan 20 minutes ahead of the person using narrow gauge.\u201d",

          "text": "The managing director, North-East Development Commission (NEDC), Mohammed Alkali, has disclosed that about 2,295 teachers lost their lives while 19,000 others displaced in the over 11 years of Boko Haram insurgency in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States.\n\nThe NEDC boss further disclosed that an estimated 1,500 schools were destroyed in 2014 , with over 1,280 casualties among teachers and students, saying that the Boko Haram crisis has further devastated the education system as children, teachers and schools were on the frontline of the conflict.\n\nHe made the disclosures on Thursday while flagging off a five-day basic education workshop for 300 basic education teachers at the Sir Kashim Ibrahim College of Education, in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe state of education in the North-East region has been in regression even before the insurgency and has declined further following the Boko Haram attacks on educational infrastructure in the region.\n\n\u201cOver 2,295 teachers have been killed and 19,000 others displaced in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States in the last eleven years. An estimated 1,500 schools have been destroyed since 2014, with over 1,280 casualties among teachers and students. The crisis has further devastated the education system as children, teachers and schools were on the frontline of conflict.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of attacks on education include high student drop-out rates, reduced enrollment, lower rates of transition to higher education levels, overcrowding, and loss of instructional hours.\u201d\n\nAlkali noted that adolescent girls and boys were at higher risk of joining armed groups or criminal gangs and levels of exploitation and abuse, including trafficking and sexual violence also increased.\n\nHe said as a matter of fact, the North-East region has the lowest literacy rates as well as poorest performance in examinations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe activities under the Commission\u2019s Education Revitalization Programme such as teachers training and education support are a few of such creative efforts that aspire to reverse the negatives that are associated with the education sub-sector in the North East as highlighted above.\n\n\u201cUnder the first phase of its Teachers\u2019 Capacity Building Programme, the Commission plans to train over 1500 teachers starting with 300 in Borno State and subsequently in the other five states of the region,\u201d Alkali added.\n\nHe added that the training was for a duration of five days and the venues are Maiduguri and Biu.\n\n\u201cWe have two hundred teachers here from Borno Central and Borno North. The training for the 100 teachers representing Borno South shall hold from the 15th to 19th of this month at Biu Central Primary School.\n\n\u201cThe teachers training aims to boost teachers\u2019 capacity in pedagogy, safety and trauma counselling skills amongst others. The training aims to ensure that teachers would learn to improve their educational skills, improve overall organization, time management, technical knowledge and learn better ways to motivate the students,\u201d he stated.",

So that, some divide and rule will not be exploited to the detriment of our people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, former Senator Lee Maeba said the Ogonis are resolved to file behind the leadership that will be provided by Governor Wike concerning the setting up of a multi-consultative forum.\n\nMaeba stated that President Buhari had issued directives, particularly as it has to do with the OML 11 whose licence has been granted to NPDC, there is need for the NNPC to consult and dialogue with Ogonis.\n\n\u201cSo, this meeting today was the Ogonis coming to tell the governor about that and we have resolved that the governor must lead the multi-consultative forum to discuss with the federal government about any issue concerning OML 11 resumption or non- resumption of oil. So, we are united under the State government.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Senator Olaka Nwogu, said they are resolved and have willfully given authority to Governor Wike to offer the leadership that will serve as a pathway to multidimensional, multigroup and elicit multi organisational response to the oil issue in Ogoni land.\n\nOn his part, Senator Barry Mpigi, said before any further discussion with the Ogonis, the presidency should quickly complete the East-West road and expedite action on the clean up exercise.\n\nA prominent Ogoni women leader, Chief Priscilla Vikue said her people are united and will not allow anyone pass through back door to take Ogoni oil.",

          "text": "A man identifying himself as the father of Emmanuel, one of the victims of the 21-story building fall in Ikoyi, Lagos, has expressed his sorrow over the tragic event.\n\nThe enraged father explained that his son, along with his coworkers, was at the construction site with the boss when the structure fell.\n\nOnly one person escaped, according to him, after roughly five individuals from Emmanuel\u2019s office visited the spot.\n\nHe also revealed that Emmanuel\u2019s supervisor is no longer alive.\n\nThe bereft father pleaded with the state authorities to step up rescue efforts so he could learn if his son was dead or alive.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the site, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been calling his boss, his colleagues in Abuja said they have been unable to get him. I came here and saw things myself. I have seen the picture of his boss, he\u2019s dead.\n\n\u201cFive of them came here, only one person survived and that person came either to charge his phone or to rest because he took drugs, according to what they told me, and the person came out and saw the building going down.\n\n\u201cEver since then, I have been trying to speak to my son and to also get to speak with his boss but his number was not available until I came here yesterday and stood here and I was shown the picture of the boss, he\u2019s dead.\n\n\u201cIt is painful, I am devastated, I have pleaded with the state governor yesterday when he came to address us.

          "text": "Worried by the security challenges afflicting the region, the South-East Governors\u2019 Forum (SEGF) Thursday said they would soon meet with the federal government on the issue around leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe forum said the meeting would ensure that political solutions were deployed in the case of the IPOB leader currently in the custody of the Department of State Services and facing treason-related charges.\n\nThey said the meeting would also address the pockets of violence in the region and the sit-at-home orders issued by different groups of agitators.\n\nEbonyi state Governor and SEGF Chairman David Umahi announced this at Abakalilki during a media parley.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the various illegal orders of sit-at-home by different groups of state agitators for our people of South East to sit at home every Monday and from 5th to 10th November 2021.\n\n\u201cWhereas we have identified some of the spokespersons of some of these groups and we have been engaging them to stop all forms of violence and illegalities in South East and allow South East leaders to address all issues raised by them, we are however working with security agencies, our local security and our leaders to protect the lives of our people and to address all issues raised.\n\n\u201cWe thank Ohanaeze Ndigbo for a good job they did through their various committees in raising various solutions towards addressing all issues raised by our young children. South East Governors are studying their reports with the elders and leaders of the various South East States and very soon, we will be meeting with Federal Government of Nigeria on these issues including deploying political solutions in the case of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu which we have already initiated.\n\n\u201cWe thank our religious leaders, Conference of Bishops and Archbishops of South East, the traditional institutions of South East and Christian Association of Nigeria of South East for their interventions and mediations on this matter. We will work with them to achieve the desired result for our people and Nigeria,\u201d Umahi said.\n\nOhanaeze kicks\n\nIn a related development, Chairman Ohanaeze Ndigbo Council of Elders Engineer Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu has described as provocative and insulting the action instituted by a group described as northern elders requesting the court to order the National Assembly to make a law expelling Igbo from Nigeria.\n\nIwuanyanwu, who said this in a statement issued Thursday in Abuja, recalled that a few years ago, some northern leaders rose from a meeting in Kaduna state and issued a communiqu\u00e9 calling for the expulsion of Igbo from Nigeria.\n\nHe also observed that some months ago, many news media carried the demonstration of some northern youths and women insisting that Igbo should leave Nigeria.\n\nThe elder statesman said since these attacks on Igbo nation in Nigeria, he has received lots of curious enquiries from many Igbos within and in Diaspora as regards their safety.\n\nHe described the situation as very embarrassing to not only Ndigbo but also to all patriotic citizens of Nigeria, maintaining that in a larger sense, the action of these northerners was treason against Nigeria.\n\nIwuanyanwu insisted that the action is very hostile against the unity, peace and stability of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and urged all patriotic Nigerians to view this action with great concern.\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s meeting with South East leaders during his visit in Owerri was highly commended and indeed a good and strategic step towards reconciliation and reassuring to Igbo.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari made it clear that Igbos were domiciled in virtually all communities in Nigeria and in those communities, they are pursuing their businesses with peace and love. And that Igbos wherever they go obey the laws of the land and respect the customs and traditions of the indigenes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear that no group in Nigeria can claim greater ownership of Nigeria today than the Igbos. And at every stage of the nation\u2019s history since 1914, Igbo have played major roles in all activities that shape the destiny of Nigeria everywhere.\n\n\u201cIn the struggle for independence, Igbo championed the crusade. In other areas, economy, education, industry, sports, etc, Igbo have continued to play their roles and make tremendous contributions.\n\n\u201cIgbo will therefore want to make it abundantly clear to all and sundry that if anybody plans to expel Igbo from Nigeria and dispossess them of their hard earned assets they have all over the country, Igbo will never accept that.\n\n\u201cFor avoidance of doubt, the name Nigeria is derived from one of the biggest rivers in Africa- River Nigeria. In Nigeria, this river traverses through substantial part of Igbo land. It is important to note that most of the people who want to expel Igbo and seize their assets do not have their states anywhere near the River Nigeria. We now want to tell Nigerians that Igbos are substantial owners of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn some geopolitical zones, militants, Boko Haram and Herdsmen are operating dangerously, killing many innocent people. These people are secessionists. They have even mounted their flags in some Local Governments and collecting taxes. I want to point out the fact that Nigeria flag is flying everywhere in Igbo land,\u201d the statement said.\u201d",

          "text": "Barely six months after Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello warned terrorists and related criminals were just \u201ctwo hours from Abuja\u201d, the Federal Capital Territory has come under attack by the criminal elements.\n\nFollowing series of attacks on people of the state, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello raised the alarm that the Boko Haram terrorists were trying to make Kaure their home and headquarters like they did in Sambisa forest.\n\n\u201cI have been engaging the federal government, and unfortunately, it has gotten to this stage, and if care is not taken even Abuja is not safe. We have been saying this for long and all efforts have been in vain,\u201d Bello had said.\n\n\u201cWhile Sambisa forest is several kilometers away from Abuja, Kaure is only two hours drive to Abuja,\u201d the governor further added.\n\nThe attacks\n\nIn May this year, some students and staff members of the University of Abuja were reportedly held hostage by unknown gunmen for over six hours until the military formation located adjacent the school came to their rescue.\n\nAlthough no report of casualties in all the attacks so far recorded, Blueprint gathered that in just five days of their incursion into the nation\u2019s seat of power and its environs, the criminal elements have abducted not less than 11 people at different times from different locations.\n\nWhile there had been pockets of abduction around Abuja and its environs, the intensity in the last five days is causing tension and has become a source of worry and concern to residents who \u201cdo not have the feeling of being safe again.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the security breach started Saturday when gunmen hit the staff quarters of Junior Secondary School Yebu in Kwali Area Council of Abuja and abducted the Vice Principal, Mohammed Nuhu.\n\nNuhu\u2019s abduction was not in the public domain until after a similar one at the University of Abuja where a lecturer and some five others were kidnapped in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nAccording to reports, the gunmen came in numbers and began to shoot fiercely into the air to wade off possible opposition from other residents who might attempt coming to the VP\u2019s rescue.\n\nAnd to further ease their operations, sources told Blueprint the security personnel manning the gate was tied by the hoodlums.\n\nChairman of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) wing of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Comrade Stephen Knabayi, confirmed the abduction and said the captors were yet to reach out to relations of the victim as at the time of this report.\n\nThe UNIABUAJA attack\n\nAnd following closely Tuesday was another abduction of a University of Abuja teacher and Professor of Economics, his two children and some three others.\n\nReports said they were all abducted within the university quarters.\n\nThe abductors, we reliably gathered, had since reached out to the families of their victims.\n\nTo let them off the hook, the criminals are placing a N300 million ransom on the six persons at N50 million per head.\n\nYet another attack on UniAbuja\n\nAnd just 24 hours after, the university came under yet another attack Wednesday.\n\nA student who craved anonymity for fear of possible target by the hoodlums or their informants told Blueprint some unknown persons with suspected stolen vehicle stuffed with weapons gained entry into the school, harnessed some students at the entrance and collected their belongings.\n\n\u201cThey still went into an office, and attacked a lecturer with Economics Department Professor David Okoroafor. The lecturer teaches Mathematics in the department.\n\n\u201cThey made attempts to collect the lecturer\u2019s phone and other belongings before students who saw them earlier raised the alarm, then security men within the school went after them.\n\n\u201cDue to fear and anxiety, a scheduled lecture in our class was hastily put off because the lecturer in charge called to tell us he won\u2019t be in class again. By the time we came out, others were already leaving the school premises,\u201d said the source.\n\nAlso, another anonymous student said students living within and outside the school premises now lived in fear, as cultists now attack students and others around.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe cultists harass people mostly at night around Bob H area, behind the boys\u2019 hostel in Gwagwalada.\n\n\u201cIn the past three weeks, the unknown persons with weapons have been terrorising female hostel close to school. They collect their phones and other belongings unchallenged.\u201d\n\nThese ugly developments had put a number schools in Kuje Area Council of the FCT on red alert.\n\nBlueprint had reported that schools within these places had taken extra security measures to safeguard the students, while the police were said to have agreed to establish their presence at strategic locations around the schools in these places.\n\nSuleja attack\n\nAnd from Suleja, a suburb of Abuja in Niger state, the Police Thursday confirmed the abduction of four women by gunmen at Haske Dabara community, Angwan Gwari Kwamba of Suleja local government area of the state.\n\nNiger state Commissioner of Police Monday Kuryas confirmed the incident in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna.\n\n\u201cYes it has happened at about 1 a.m. last night and already anti-kidnapping team, the army and vigilante had been deployed to rescue the victims.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything humanly possible to apprehend all those miscreants undermining the peaceful coexistence among residents.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to residents, especially rural dwellers, to come forward with credible information on movement of strange faces among them to the nearest security personnel for necessary security action\u201d, he said.\n\nThe commissioner solicited more working support by coming forward with intelligence information that could aid the security personnel deployed across the state in the ongoing fight against kidnapping, banditry and other criminal elements in the state.\n\nAn eyewitness said the gunmen entered the community at about 12.46 a.m. with gunshots that scared the residents.\n\nResidents fear\n\nThe spate of attacks has become a major source of worry to residents of the FCT.\n\nIn a chat with our reporters, Asake Muftau who resides in Jikowyi, an Abuja suburb, said: \u201cWe woke up to gridlock on Wednesday and we were told that some people are plotting to attack Abuja. So, the soldiers stationed at Karu Bridge are searching vehicles. But is that the best way to prevent an attack? Certainly No.\n\n\u201cBecause of this threat, we now live in fear and the soldiers make it worse by mounting roadblocks on the road. Now, I am extremely careful where I go and who comes around me and my family.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, our security personnel need to change their tactics. This habitual roadblock or stop and search has never prevented an attack. When Shi\u2019ites wanted to protest they blocked the road, yet they protested inside the city centre. Despite the roadblock, attacks still occur. Would it not be more dangerous and deadly when motorists who are held up by their roadblock are attacked? So we now live in fear, even in traffic and the roadblock has created more hardship for many of us.\u201d\n\nAnother resident of Nyanya, Aminu Abdullahi said the tension over possible attacks on and in Abuja should be of concern to everyone, urging the security personnel to do more than \u201d stop and search.\n\n\u201cThe security situation in Nigeria and Abuja too is very worrisome. And this is affecting everything that we do. It is affecting our business, movement and our family. For how long are we going to continue?\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies must do more than stop and search, they should be very proactive in their operation. When you block roads, do you think criminals will not find alternative route? Our security personnel need to do more intelligence gathering and be very proactive in defending citizens.\u201d\n\nExpressing similar worry, a businessman and resident of the FCT, Alhaji Adamu Abdullahi, who resides at Nyanya area described the situation as a surprising development.\n\nAbdullahi said: \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the appalling security situation in the country. For me, it\u2019s a wakeup call on the authorities to think out of the box to nip the menace of banditry and kidnapping in the bud. The eye service approach of roadblock is simply scraping the problem on the surface.\n\n\u201cWe need intelligence gathering to fish out the bad eggs in our society. Those who steal our security votes should be reminded that they have no hiding place any longer as these bandits are beginning to zero in on the elites.\u201d\n\nAlso, Malam Sabi Baruten, an Abuja-based politician, said any attack in the FCT is an attack to the entire nation.\n\n\u201cLook, the situation in the FCT and even Nigeria as a whole concerning insecurity and the purported planned invasion of the nation\u2019s capital by bandits or whatever you call them, is something that should worry everyone.\n\n\u201cToday, FCT is home to Nigerians, there\u2019s no tribe no matter how micro it is, that is not represented here. So any attack in the FCT is an attack on the entire nation.\n\n\u201cWhat should concern us as residents here is the porosity of all the entry routes to the FCT. My humble appeal to the relevant authorities, especially those in charge of gathering intelligent reports is to collaborate and increase synergy to beef up security.\n\n\u201cI know they can do it the same way the current Buhari led administration has succeeded in stopping bombings within and around the FCT common during the last administration of PDP.\u201d\n\nAlso, Hajia Khadija Abdul, a respondent who lives in Kubwa, a satellite town in the FCT said, \u201cIt\u2019s high time the security agencies did more to stop this. Attack on Abuja has the tendency to spark off ethno-religious war. Truth be told, we just do not have the feeling of being safe again in Abuja.\n\n\u201cHere in Kubwa, we once experienced kidnap of people. The right attention was not given to the incident. Let us not pretend that all is well. Irrespective of whatever the government says, honestly Abuja is not safe. Let us continue to pray, be vigilant and cooperate with security agencies by giving the right information that could lead to neutralising these criminals.\u201d\n\n\u2018No cause for alarm\u2019\n\nAnd amidst the fear among residents, the FCT Police Command assured residents of their safety, saying there is no cause for alarm.\n\nAlthough Blueprint could not reach the command\u2019s spokesperson, DSP Josephine Adeh, Thursday, a statement issued on the UniAbuja attack Wednesday, had assured the FCT residents of their safety.\n\nQuoting FCT Commissioner of Police Babaji Sunday, the spokesperson said, \u201cthe command pledges its undeterred resolve to ensure lives and properties of residents within the FCT are protected and urge them to report all suspicious movements, emergency or distress, through these numbers: 08032003913, 08061581938, 07057337653 and 08028940883.\u201d",

Akpabio noted that the preparation of the ministry\u2019s budget was conceived in line with the Federal Government\u2018s2022 Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability premised on repositioning the economy on the path of growth and resilience.\n\nWhile presenting a total budgetary proposal of the sum of N28,131,295,396 allocated to the Ministry comprising, personal (N1,692,591,184) overhead (N877,089,120) and capital (N25,561,615,092), the minister noted that, \u201cthe Ministry ensured that core projects were consistent with the Administrations Agenda Policies/strategies contained in the Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), 2021-2025, according priority to on-going projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budgetary Allocation is meagre and significantly inadequate in the face of the mandate and goals of the Ministry to meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people. The volume of the outstanding liabilities with underfunding has affected ongoing projects/programmes of the Ministry across the region and this is gradually contributing to the resurgence of problems in some areas of the region,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, during the budget presentation the Chairman House of Representative Committee on Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs Hon. Essien Ekpeyong, assured that the Legislature is committed to the security of lives and investment in the Niger Delta region and for economic and social activities to strive. Therefore, he said, the budget proposal of N25.56 billion would be given due attention in line with the 2021 budgetary review.\n\nHe explained that there was need for the Executive and Legislature to work together to ensure that thousands of uncompleted projects scattered across the region are completed for the betterment of the life of the people.\n\nHe also noted that the House would also consider if there were challenges that would require legislative intervention, particularly in the area of funding in respect of the East-West Road by setting up committee to work with the ministry in this regard.",

          "text": "Britain on Thursday became the first country in the world to approve a potentially game-changing COVID-19 antiviral pill jointly developed by U.S.-based Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, in a boost to the fight against the pandemic.\n\nBritain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommended the drug, molnupiravir, for use in people with mild to moderate COVID-19 and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness, such as obesity, older age diabetes, and heart disease.\n\nIt will be administered as soon as possible following a positive COVID-19 test and within five days of the onset of symptoms, the regulator said, citing clinical data.\n\nThe green light is the first for an oral antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and comes ahead of potential U.S. regulatory clearance.\n\nU.S. advisers will meet this month to vote on whether molnupiravir should be authorized. read more\n\nTreatments to tackle the pandemic, which has killed more than 5.2 million people worldwide, have so far focused mainly on vaccines.\n\nOther options, including Gilead\u2019s infused antiviral remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, are generally only given after a patient has been hospitalised.\n\nMerck\u2019s Molnupiravir has been closely watched since data last month showed it could halve the chances of dying or being hospitalised for those most at risk of developing severe COVID-19 when given early in the illness.\n\nMolnupiravir, which will be branded as Lagevrio in Britain, is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and is taken twice a day for five days.\n\nProfessor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the National Health Service (NHS) in England, said the drug would be administered to patients at higher risk of complications as Britain heads into one of the most challenging winters ever.\n\nA wider rollout will follow if it is shown to be clinically and cost effective in reducing hospitalisations and death, he added.\n\n\u201cWe are now working across government and the NHS to urgently get this treatment to patients initially through a national study so we can collect more data on how antivirals work in a mostly vaccinated population,\u201d UK vaccines minister Maggie Throup told parliament.\n\nPRESSURES\n\nThe speedy approval in Britain, which was also the first Western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, comes as it struggles to tame soaring infections.\n\nBritain has about 40,000 daily cases of COVID-19, according to the latest seven-day average. That is second only to the roughly 74,000 a day in the United States, which has five times more people, and has fuelled criticism of the government\u2019s decision to abandon most pandemic-related restrictions\n\nData released on Wednesday night showed COVID-19 prevalence in England hit its highest level on record last month, led by a high numbers of cases in children and a surge in the south-west of the country.\n\nPressure is growing on the government to implement its \u201cPlan B\u201d aimed at protecting the NHS from unsustainable demands, involving mask mandates, vaccine passes and work-from-home orders.\n\n\u201cWith no compromises on quality, safety and effectiveness, the public can trust that the MHRA has conducted a robust and thorough assessment of the data (on molnupiravir),\u201d MHRA chief June Raine said in a statement.\n\nLast month, Britain agreed a deal with Merck to secure 480,000 courses of molnupiravir.\n\nTREATMENT RACE\n\nIn a separate statement, Merck said it expected to produce 10 million courses of the treatment by the end of this year, with at least 20 million set to be manufactured in 2022.\n\nThe U.S. based drugmaker\u2019s shares were up 2.1% at $90.54 before the market open.\n\nPfizer and Roche are also racing to develop easy-to-administer antiviral pills for COVID-19. Pfizer last month began a large study of its oral antiviral drug for the prevention of COVID-19 in people exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nMerck\u2019s molnupiravir is also being studied in a late-stage trial for preventing infection.\n\nViral sequencing done so far has shown molnupiravir is effective against all variants of the coronavirus, Merck has said, including the more-infectious Delta, which is responsible for the worldwide surge in hospitalisations and deaths recently.\n\nWhile it is not yet clear when Merck will deliver doses to Britain, the company has said it is committed to providing timely access to its drug globally with plans for tiered pricing aligned with a country\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nMerck is also in talks with generic drugmakers about expanding manufacturing licences to build supply of the treatment.\n\nAntibody cocktails like those from Regeneron and Eli Lilly have also been approved for non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients, but have to be given intravenously.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "As of October 29, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s external reserves have risen to $41. 83 billion compared with $33.40 billion recorded on July 30, 2021, data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed.\n\nThe accretion in external reserves followed the issuance of $4 billion Eurobond by the Federal Government and the receipt of the $3.5 billion Special Drawing Right (SDR) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on August 28, 2021\n\nHowever, the sustainability of this accretion has become a concern among analysts and stakeholders.\n\nAccording to a professor at the Department of Banking and Finance, Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, the current level of imports, especially fuel imports, and the pressure in the forex market which is yet to abate, the accretion to reserves does not appear sustainable especially against the backdrop of the fact that strong oil prices require a corresponding increase in crude oil production to make any significant impact on foreign reserves.\n\nHe admitted that the surge in external reserves was due to the recent Eurobonds issuance the country made.\n\nData from the CBN, according to FBNQuest show that gross official reserves rose by USD5bn (13.7% m/m), to hit USD41.8bn last month, its highest point since October 2019. This is its sixth consecutive month-on-month increase.\n\n\u201cFor a more accurate picture, we must adjust this gross figure for the pipeline of delayed external payments,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest said in a report.\n\nTotal reserves at the end of October covered 10 months\u2019 merchandise imports on the basis of the balance of payments for the 12 months to March 2021, and 7.7 months when we add services. This is a healthy buffer,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nMohamed Abu Basha, head of macroeconomy \u2013 EFG Hermes, had predicted that Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves would cross the USD40bn mark after reserves were boosted in August with the USD3.3bn SDR allocation, providing a significant liquidity lift to the country\u2019s foreign reserve position.\n\nDoyin Salami, Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee on the Economy noted in his October presentation that \u201cWeaker foreign investment inflows, high demand for foreign currency to finance imports and other needs and possible clearance of FX backlogs are factors that continue to weaken external reserves\u201d.\n\nA report by the FBNQuest noted that U.S Fed is set to taper its asset purchase programme and revert to monetary policy normalisation.\n\nThis move, which will eventually be mirrored by other advanced economies, the report said would likely result in a redirection of international capital flows away from emerging markets.\n\nOil prices remain high, supported by tight supply even as demand has rebounded stronger than anticipated. In its latest commodity markets outlook, the World Bank forecasts crude oil prices to average USD70/b this year, USD74/b in 2022 due to stronger oil demand, followed by a decline to USD65/b in 2023. To fully benefit from rising oil prices, Nigeria must ramp up its production. According to OPEC data obtained from secondary sources, Nigeria\u2019s oil output (excluding condensates) was up 12 percent m/m to about.45mbpd in September.\n\n\u201cWe believe the rise in gross official reserves is very close to its peak and expect to see a decline in coming weeks as inflow into the reserves wind down and the utilisation of education, health, and business travel allowances begin to reflect,\u201d said FBNQuest.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
