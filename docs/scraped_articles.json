          "title": "Why doctors are leaving Nigeria in droves \u2013 NMA President",
          "text": "President of the Nigerian Medical Association, Prof. Innocent Ujah, has given reasons why doctors are leaving Nigeria for other countries.\n\nSpeaking during an interview on Channels TV on Monday, Ujah listed circumstances found around the work environment, insecurity, among other issues as reasons for Nigerian doctors and other professionals to leave the country.\n\nThe NMA president also stated that half of the doctors trained in Nigeria have moved abroad because they do not have to worry about work equipment and the safety of their families.\n\nHe said, \u201cMany of the reasons are poor work environment, insecurity, poor remuneration and poor equipment to work with. I think these are some of the issues.\n\n\u201cRemuneration and environment in other countries like Europe, America and Saudi Arabia are far better than Nigeria. No doctor would want his children to be out of school, we want to have the best for our children.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the appropriate thing to do is to have a conducive environment to work. We have lost over 20 of our doctors to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cMany of our doctors are adopted and kidnapped; once there is insecurity in the land as it is, it becomes very difficult for people to stay.\n\n\u201cThe best thing for us to do is to find a solution to this hydra-headed monster. It is not too difficult to reverse but we need commitment, focus and a clear understanding of the need to ensure that the few that we train stay back to render service to our people.\n\n\u201cOver 50 per cent of our doctors are outside the country, we estimate that about 80 thousand Nigerians have been trained as doctors but only about 40 thousand are at home.\n\n\u201cAnd these surely are not enough and adequate. Even where they are going to, their services are better than our own, they also have more doctors than we have.\u201d\n\nThe Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, however, called on the president, Major Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to convene a meeting of stakeholders, which include agencies and ministries and government agencies, to stem the brain drain affecting the country in the medical sector.\n\n\u201cThe issue of brain drain has been a serious issue to medical practitioners. A lot of Nigerians are going out of the country for many good reasons.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the president needs to quickly direct the appropriate agencies and ministries to ensure that we have a roundtable meeting to be able to find out what could be done,\u201d Ujah added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "From Uche Usim and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja Abuja\n\nIn the spirit of equivalent retaliation, Minister of Aviation, Mr Hadi Sirika, yesterday announced the temporary ban of flights from all nations that put Nigeria on their red list following the discovery of a few cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant in the country.\n\nThe countries affected are Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Canada and Argentina. Flights from their territories into Nigeria have been banned till further notice tomorrow.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThis is as the Federal Government locks horns with the government of the United Arab Emirates over what it described as an insulting and unacceptable letter wherein it justified the reasons it granted only one slot a week to Air Peace but expected to enjoy 21 frequencies into Nigeria every week.\n\nSirika, in an audio message made available to Daily Sun, said the sovereign interest of over 200 million Nigerians was too important for any foreign government to toy with it.\n\nHe warned that any country that rubbishes all diplomatic etiquettes and bilateral agreements to slam unfair deals on Nigerians will be resisted and served in similar measures as tit for tat remains a fair play.\n\nOn the Emirates-Air Peace impasse, Sirika said the issue leaves a sour taste in the mouth, insisting that the Federal Government would stick to its guns until UAE allows for a level playing field.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in as a government, UAE requested 21 frequencies, meaning that they will be coming to Nigeria 21 times in a week or simplified as three times a day; two in Lagos, one in Abuja. Well, even this was something that the Buhari administration gave them. They had just 14 frequencies when we came, and it was seven for Lagos and seven for Abuja. They never operated Abuja daily until when we came.\n\n\u201cHowever, we\u2019ve got an airline, a Nigerian airline, which is Air Peace that applied to get only three out of the 21 frequencies, and I approved. So, Air Peace wanted to be going into the UAE three times a week. So, UAE refused to approve the three frequencies for Air Peace. They insisted on giving them only one frequency and it was in Sharjah not Dubai. Now, we are giving them 21 frequencies from our agreement, they ought to give us 21. So, what they\u2019re supposed to do is to give Air Peace 21. And then it is up to Air Peace to operate all the 21 or do three. So, we went back and forth with them. Right here in Colombia, we had a meeting with them and we said okay, well, we are going to also look at it and give you also one frequency as against 21. So, they wrote us a very insulting letter that referred to meeting discussions and agreement \u2018bla bla bla bla\u2019, in accordance with a bilateral agreement between the two countries and having looked at our operations with great pain we\u2019re giving you or Air Peace one slot in Sharjah. And that\u2019s the best we can do in the circumstance that our airports are full.\u2019\n\nSo, this is very insulting and this is not acceptable by international treaty, convention or agreement. And therefore, I directed that they also be given one frequency and into Abuja. So, whoever, and beginning from the 12th or 13th, they will only come once into the country. So, anybody who wants to get out using Emirates should get out on the 12th maximum. And then when he wants to return he should book his return, he should make sure that that return date is on a Thursday and that is to Abuja and get his booking confirmed.\n\n\u201cI know they can be under pressure because they\u2019ve lost a lot of money in the past. Honestly, who cares? But they are not coming. They are losing a lot of money. We also in Nigeria are losing the service they provide and are also losing some economic activity as a result of that coming. But the sovereignty of 200 million people is too important for us to toy with. So, on behalf of the 200 million Nigerians, we have taken the decision that they also be given one slot. And this is just for your information. And there\u2019s nothing grandstanding, it\u2019s just the way things are in civil aviation,\u201d the Minister explained.\n\nOn the series of travel ban, Sirika said he participated in a Zoom meeting of the COVID-19 tax force, stressing that the Nigerian government would draw strength from the agreements at the meeting to shut its doors on those who also shut out Nigerians.\n\n\u201cJust for your information, we recommended that those countries, Canada, UK, Saudi Arabia and Argentina, who banned Nigerians, we also put them on the red list, just the same as they did to us.\u201d\n\n\u2022We\u2019re in regular contact with other countries \u2013UK\n\nThe United Kingdom has said it is in regular conversations with other countries about their travel policies.\n\nThis was even as the United Kingdom said it has been clear that travel abroad will be different this year and countries may impose border measures at short notice in line with their own coronavirus policies.\n\nHead of Communications, British High Commission, Abuja, Dean Hurlock, stated this in response to the continuous criticism of the travel ban slammed on Nigeria by the United Kingdom as a result of the COVID-19 Variant of Concern (VOC) Omicron.\n\nHe said the Government of the United Kingdom proposed sticking to its standard background lines on whether a particular country will put the United Kingdom on the red list and avoid getting into hypothetical situations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that travel abroad will be different this year and countries may impose border measures at short notice in line with their own coronavirus policies.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

He spoke on various issues in this interview.\n\nFirst of all, what is your take on the state of affairs in the country especially with regards to security of lives and property of Nigerians?\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nI feel very sad; it is very debilitating and frightening because of what is going on about security in this country. Every time, the president assured us of our security, the next day you would hear that a major insecurity arises to one, two, three or more persons. It is sad that Nigerians, everyday they wake up, they hear that 100 people were killed in one place; thirty people were killed in another place. It is very sad and it is not reassuring. Just few days ago, about 39 people were burnt to death by terrorists in Sokoto State. They were hijacked from their bus and burnt to death. It is sad that these kinds of things could happen and President Muhammadu Buhari did not do anything about it. Instead, he flew to Lagos; it is only when pressure mounted on him that he now despatched his national Security adviser and other security personnel to go and assess the situation and make recommendations. While the Chief Of Army Staff is busy praising himself and the military in their fight against insecurity, the Niger State Governor has cried out loudly that Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters have taken over Shiroro and Borgu forests.\n\nNo statement from the military is re-assuring these days.\n\nAny insurgent group that has eyes on these forests of course has the Federal Capital as its ultimate objective. So nobody is safe. Not even the President.\n\nHow long would this kind of thing continue? It appears that the Federal Government is out of ideas and they do not know what to do. And they do not want to admit it. The major problem is that they are living in self denial.\n\nFew days ago, the revered spiritual leader and Sultan of Sokoto said the North is now a killing field. How did that melancholic statement come to you? Has the situation come to stay or do you hope that when Buhari leaves in 2023, the situation may change?\n\nThe problem is nationwide but there is no guarantee that any change of government would contain the situation until the political leaders change the way they handle public affairs. This is because it is the mismanagement of governance and maladministration by political leaders that feed this insecurity. What is bad is that the current administration and the political party they belong to have not shown any readiness to change their methods. For example, you have a party that is managed by a Caretaker Committee for one and half years. And this is a party that has produced the president which means the president is condoning all the unpalatable things within the party. We know that the All Progressives Congress(APC) is characterized by many factions. In many states, there are two, three or even four factions. This has arisen on account of the way and manner the party is being mismanaged. They are mismanaging their political party. While they are battling to solve the problems of their party, how do they concentrate on governing the country? But whatever party in power is not a guarantee that this security situation would just stop. The polity which consists of political parties and all other institutions should organize to manage the country in a manner that people will enjoy security. What is worse is that they don\u2019t even seem to understand the problem. And if they don\u2019t understand the problem, how can they solve the problem? This is the saddest aspect of the situation we have found ourselves in.\n\nThe issue of the President declining assent to the electoral bill including the Direct primaries has dominated public discourse recently. What is your take on that in view of the fact that the majority of Nigerians were for Direct primaries?\n\nHonestly, I am heart-broken that the president refused to assent to the bill and he does not have any valid reasons for refusing to assent it other than the fact that he has a vested interest in what happens in the parties and the country in the next general election. And this is what is before the president and the APC. They are preoccupied with how to continue to control people rather than securing the people. That informed the reasons he refused to assent to the bill, otherwise somebody who had confessed to be for the masses for over 16 years, how can he refuse to assent to an act that would now release the people from bondage and slavery? This is because Nigerians have been enslaved by their political parties and political operators because of the lack of doing Direct primaries. That is the only thing that would unlock the people from bondage. So, what is he running away from? Some people are alleging that it is because it is costly but isn\u2019t it costlier not to have direct primaries which would lead to good governance. When you adopt direct primaries, people would now begin to elect candidate that they like unlike a situation where you only allow delegates to vote. I believe that no price is too much for having good leadership. And it is only when you allow people freedom to choose that you begin to see who are good and bad leaders. It is very disheartening that the president refused to assent to the bill. He did not have any excuse to have not signed it into law.\n\nToday(Friday), your party inaugurated the Iyorcha Ayu-led team; what are Nigerians hoping to see from the PDP? With all the intra-party crisis in PDP, do you think the opposition party has what it takes to upstage the APC in 2023?\n\nWith the emergence of Dr Iyorcha Ayu as the National chairman of the PDP, I believe that a lot of things would be done to strengthen the party. And once the party is strengthened, and people become more aware of their responsibilities, and the operators respect internal democracy within the party, I believe that the party would have been reset to face the task facing the country.\n\nWhat is your position on the North retaining power in 2023 especially against the backdrop of the overwhelming call by Southerners for power shift to the region(South)?\n\nAs far as I am concerned, any Nigerian who has the capacity and the ability irrespective of where he comes from, should aspire to be the president of this country. Neither the North nor the South has the monopoly of producing a good president. None of the regions has the monopoly of good leaders. We all have potentially good leaders and we all have potentially bad leaders in all parts of this country. I am not going to support any candidate based on where he comes from; I will support any candidate whom I feel has the capacity to lead this country. Nigerians are tired of divide and rule by politicians. What benefit is it going to be to elect a particular candidate because he is from a particular region or tribe? The system has never been of any benefit to Nigerians to vote for somebody from a particular tribe or region.\n\nFrom your experience as a Speaker of the House of Representatives, what do you make of the rising debt profile of the nation? When are we going to pay this huge debt especially as the nation is literally operating a mono product economy?\n\nI don\u2019t know because nobody tells Nigerians the true situation. We only read the reports about the National Assembly approving loans being borrowed by the Federal Government. And unfortunately, the last time they approved such, they did not seem to care to look at under what conditions are we borrowing. So, in the absence of terms and conditions, we can hardly get what has been borrowed and when to pay and all that.\n\nWith the state of affairs in the country today, what do you project of the future of Nigeria? Do you see any hope based on where we are today as a nation?\n\nAs long as these leaders continue the way they are doing, we may not have a country for all Nigerians. Some of us are quite empirical and we analyse situations and predict. Nobody can predict that Nigeria would be Nigeria in the next few years because nothing is being done by this administration to reclaim the country and to get back to what it was during Independence. Things have broken down and because they are in self denial, they want to continue to operate the way they want. You cannot be united as a people just because people wish it. Let us work for it and they are not working for it.\n\nFrom the grapevine, the Former Vice president, Atiku Abubakar, is again warming up to contest the presidential election but many are saying it is time for younger people to take over. Do you support his ambition this time again?\n\nHe has not convinced me up till now that he should be the president of this country. He has to convince people to believe in him or does he want to become the president because he wants to be the president? Or does he want to become the president because he has something to offer Nigerians; something that would hold Nigeria together. Atiku has to convince us that he has something to offer.\n\nWhat is your advice to Nigerians ahead of the next general election?\n\nMy advice is that Nigerians should not wait for this administration to do anything because there is so much insecurity. People from all regions should gather together, sit down and discuss how they can defend themselves from what is going on because they cannot continue to live under circumstances where we have become prey to bandits and terrorists. All of us in this country should find a means to gather together, hold meetings and agree on what to do in the situation we have found ourselves. This is because these leaders have nothing to offer and they cannot secure us.\n\nYou have been so quiet; are you not getting ready to contest election in 2023?\n\nI do not believe in making a noise. I want to continue to remain myself. If I want to contest for any election, I will do that as honestly as possible. I don\u2019t believe in just making noise anyhow.\n\nSome people believe that based on your experience, your type should join the presidential race or are you intimidated by the names being mentioned already?\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "Buhari Never Promised Tinubu Running Mate, His Boys Fire Back at Akande",
          "text": "Insist what president promised was partnership\n\nObinna Chima\n\nThe last may not have been heard of some of the revelations in the newly published autobiography by a former governor of Osun State and erstwhile protem national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, who claimed in his book, \u201cMy Participations\u201d, that President Muhammadu Buhari, reneged in his promise to make a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, his running mate ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\nBut many of Buhari\u2019s close allies and foot soldiers, who were privy to some of the negotiations and horse-trading that preceded the 2015 elections, dismissed the account by Akande as being twisted and far from the truth, because according to them, \u201cBuhari truly and only promised Tinubu a workable partnership, which included conceding the vice presidential slot to the South-west as a bloc, not to exactly make him his running mate.\u201d\n\nA lot of the Buhari boys , yesterday, called THISDAY with respect to its lead story last Friday, titled: \u2018Akande: Buhari Promised to Pick Tinubu as Running Mate in 2015, Then Reneged,\u2019 which was an extract from Akande\u2019s autobiography, saying they were dismayed over the report and strongly disagreed with the author\u2019s account of events.\n\nAccording to them, all that Buhari said was that he was going to partner and work with Tinubu, in the context of a partnership between the South-west and North-west , reiterating that the p resident never promised Tinubu vice president or running mate, contrary to claims by Akande in the book.\n\nThis, the sources, who often glibly referred to themselves as Buhari\u2019s boys, added was because they recognised \u201c the role Tinubu played in helping them and the role of the South-west for voting en bloc during the convention that produced Buhari, which was pivotal and he presented the vice president ial slot in the partnership.\n\n\u201c And, in all of this, what Akande did not disclose was that Buhari sent a delegation of Farouk Aliyu, Hadi Sirika and Sarki Abba, to meet Tinubu and explained to him that the Muslim-Muslim ticket would not work, but that they would be partners to work together. \u201d\n\nThe Buhari boys, have however, concluded that the former Osun governor appeared to have taken up the task of \u201c a political bull, try ing to force Buhari\u2019s hands to support Tinubu in 2023 . But that, we will not accept, even though no one is opposed to his aspiration. \u201d\n\nThey maintained that Chief Akande\u2019s account was deliberately slanted, to not only make Tinubu look good and weep up sentiment for him, but also send the president on a guilt trip and compel him to side with the former Lagos governor, who has shown keen interest, albeit clandestinely, in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn the THISDAY lead report of Friday, which detailed how Akande, in his autobiography, published by Gaskia Media Limited, disclosed that Buhari, apparently under pressure from certain interests and forces, dropped Tinubu from running with him on the party\u2019s ticket, concluded that the then candidate of APC reneged on the agreement they had even after the merger had been sealed.\n\nIn the book , launched in Lagos, Akande, who also took a swipe at some Yoruba leaders including former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Chief Olu Falae and Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, claimed that despite the pledge to make Tinubu his running mate , Buhari later faltered, saying he only wanted the former Lagos governor to \u201cpartner with him.\u201d\n\nHis account stated thus: \u201cIn April 2014, I was in Abuja when Buhari called me and asked me to persuade Bola to run with him. Governor Masari was the one who came to call me. When I followed him into Buhari\u2019s private lobby, Bola Tinubu was already seated there.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket? I thought such information, if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate. I thanked Buhari for thinking so highly of our friend.\n\n\u201cBola later told me that Buhari\u2019s emissaries had been coming to him, but he tried to dodge the gesture and not to show interest. We agreed that we would reopen the matter , when Buhari had secured the ticket,\u201d he explained.\n\nH e, h owever, expressed surprise that , when Buhari became the party\u2019s candidate, things changed, with former APC chair, Odigie Oyegun, who was supported by Tinubu to become chairman of the party, asking for names from the geopolitical zones from where Buhari w ould pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cHe said it was from this list that Buhari would choose a running mate. I objected. I turned to Buhari. \u2018General, where are you choosing your running mate from?\u2019 He answered, \u2018The South-west.\u2019 \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t know,\u2019 Oyegun said. He apologised. I didn\u2019t know why Oyegun made that proposition and at whose behest. As the chairman of the party, maybe some people pushed him to do that .\n\n\u201cThen, I called Buhari aside. \u2018Is our arrangement still standing?\u2019 I referred him to our discussion in April. He said yes! \u201d\n\nAkande further said some members of the party eventually agreed that a committee should be set up to search for Buhari\u2019s running , a move himself and former g overnor of Edo S tate, Adams Oshiomhole, opposed.\n\n\u201cAdams Oshiomhole, then Governor of Edo State, stood up and said we were being dishonest. He said he was a serving governor and many of those in the Elders Committee had been governors.\n\n\u201c Did we set up a committee to give us our running mates?\u2019 He asked. \u2018It is not fair!\u2019 He further said what we were pushing was a dangerous act and that we should allow Buhari to choose his running mate. So, we left,\u201d he narrated\n\nAkande stated that he later came to know later that some people constituted themselves into a group, called the Northern Interest Group, and they prevailed on Buhari not to allow a Muslim-Muslim ticket , and that it was the following day after the Elders\u2019 Committee meeting , which was deadlocked, that Buhari phoned Tinubu to give him three names from which he would pick a running mate.\n\n\u201cWe were all in Abuja and Tinubu rushed to me with this information. He wanted to know whether the understanding we reached with Buhari had changed. I called Buhari and he told me he now needed three names from us. I was angry with him.\n\n\u201c General, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the north, including those who were Muslims. I told him the slot belonged to the South-West and among the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership .\n\n\u201cOshiomhole was surprised about the narration. \u2018If indeed you promised to make Asiwaju your running mate, it would not be fair to renege,\u2019 he said. Buhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him.\u201d\n\nThe former Osun governor explained that he didn\u2019t know what that meant because before they discussed the issue of Tinubu as the partner or vice-president\u2019s ticket, a merger had been accomplished and they had already partnered. \u201cWe were registered in July 2013, and he called me to prevail on Tinubu to be his running mate in April 2014. Buhari knew I was upset but we tried to manage the situation. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by all those pressures. We decided to let him go,\u201d Akande said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ayu: There\u2019ll Be No APC by April 2023",
          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja, George Okoh in Makurdi and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nWith a voice of undisputed charisma, and exuding confidence born of success in previous political assignments,\n\nNational Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday, sent a strong message to the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its government, saying by March or April 2023 there may not a party called APC in the country.\n\nAyu spoke at the weekend at Government House, Makurdi, when he addressed party stakeholders. He described the ruling APC as \u201ca contraption\u201d with neither programme nor ideological position, predicting its collapse by the next general election year.\n\nIn a related development, Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike urged the PDP chairman to bring his enormous political knowledge and experience to bear on his new assignment. Wike said the ultimate challenge for Ayu was the rebuilding of the main opposition party and its restoration to winning ways.\n\nWike made the assertions yesterday at an interdenominational thanksgiving church service and reception organised for the PDP national chairman by the Benue State government in conjunction with the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Benue State Chapter.\n\nAyu reiterated that PDP would win at least 25 of the states in the 2023 governorship polls.\n\nThe former senate president assured the stakeholders, who included aspirants to various elective positions, that the party would not impose candidates on the people ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nA statement from Ayu\u2019s media office said, \u201cBy March/April 2023, there will be no APC in Nigeria. APC is a contraption, a contraption to win power, but they have no programme or any ideological position on what to do with power.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we will be coming back in every state and at the federal level to take over power, with a coherent programme of action, and with which we will implement workable policies, as we were doing before.\u201d\n\nThe new PDP chairman was full of praises for the Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, saying he is following in the footsteps of the late Moses Adasu. He dismissed reports of competition between himself and former Senate President David Mark. Ayu disclosed that it was actually Mark, who advised him to go for the PDP national chairmanship.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am telling you this story, because it shows that at any one time we are united in Benue, definitely, Nigeria will not ignore us. This is not the first time we have attained victory by our collective effort. In 2019, when they said there was federal might, we said the allied forces of Benue were ready for the federal might, and we defeated that federal might.\u201d\n\nAyu emphasised the need for party unity and respect for popular decisions, stressing, \u201cI urge us to continue to work together. Don\u2019t be afraid of federal might. The allied forces of Benue are still as united as ever. And today, we are even stronger.\n\n\u201cI believe whoever emerges as a candidate for any elective position, once the list is forwarded to Abuja, I don\u2019t want Governor Ortom or his candidates to come to lobby. This is because the decision of Benue people will be respected at all times.\u201d\n\nHe bemoaned the deplorable security situation in the country, especially, the daily killings, but said Nigerians should not lose hope, as PDP was coming to rescue and rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cDo not lose hope, Nigerians,\u201d Ayu stated, adding, \u201cDo not lose hope in Nigeria just because a small group of people have come to destroy her. Let us join hands and get rid of them, and reclaim and rebuild our country.\u201d\n\nHe charged party faithful to intensify work at the ward levels so as to commence the rescue mission from bottom up, adding that the immediate task of the party is to ensure victory in Ekiti and Osun governorship elections.\n\nAyu said the party would work vigorously to regain leadership of the National Assembly, enlist more women and youths, as well as halt defection from PDP to other political parties.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor the presidency, we will be fair to all aspirants. There will be no favoured aspirant. We will provide a level playing ground for everyone.\n\n\u201cThe next president will be a product of the PDP. We will come up with a strong manifesto indicating what programme will be given to our candidate to prosecute, unlike the APC that had no programme in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe urge Nigerians not to lose hope, because a small collection of people have come together to divide us. We are a productive people, who are respected across the world. Do not allow the current leadership to destroy the tenacity of this nation.\n\n\u201cPDP will be back with good policy, the economy will come back to life, and we will start exporting again. As a party, we have done the needful. We will work hard to rebuild our nation and shame the foreign detractors, who say Nigeria will break up.\n\n\u201cWe will be in the forefront of world affairs again. I\u2019m determined to follow in the footsteps of Aper Aku, JS Tarka, and Adasu. APC is using propaganda to make it look like PDP is gone. We have mapped out strategies and agenda to take the party to the height. We will work as a team, leading the army to victory. Every member of the party will be carried along. PDP will fight to win Ekiti and Osun governorship elections.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the thanksgiving service, Wike admonished the PDP national chairman to restore the party by ensuring the reconciliation of aggrieved members, who had left the party, with a view to winning the 2023 general election. The governor extolled Ayu\u2019s vast political experience, but reminded him of the enormous task ahead to rescue Nigeria from the APC federal government in 2023.\n\nWike said, \u201cToday is not a day to talk about APC. Today is the day to join the people of Benue State in thanking God for His mercies. Today is a day we shall be able to tell our National Chairman plainly what the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) expects from him and how we are going to stand by him to make sure this party is rebuilt, in order to put themselves together and to take over power in 2023.\n\n\u201cHistory is beckoning on you. Yes, they have said you are former Minister of Industry, you are former Minister of Interior, you are former Minister of Education, even Environment. And former Senate President, but you have never been saddled with the responsibility to rescue Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs a former minister, you were not given the opportunity to rescue Nigeria. Nigeria was not what it is now. Therefore, the battle to rescue Nigeria, the battle to change leadership in 2023 is on you.\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be easy for you. The time for work has come and that is when we will know the experiences you have gathered, how you want to put it to use and rebuild the Peoples Democratic Party. It is very, very important.\n\n\u201cWe want you to use your experiences, as people have said, to make sure even those, who have left the party, should be brought back to the party.\u201d\n\nWike urged Ayu not to be distracted by the political ambitions of party members, but focus on rebuilding PDP into a formidable party.\n\nHe told the new PDP chairman, \u201cLet me also tell you, Mr. Chairman, do not be distracted about who will be presidential aspirant, let them not disturb you. Go, focus and rebuild the party. Once the party is rebuilt, I can assure you, you have somebody that will stand in this party, and Nigerians will vote for that person. What is important for you now is to see what you can do. Be focused; let nobody distract you.\n\n\u201cI want to plead with you, let people not tell you to begin to go to one governor\u2019s place or the other in order for the governors forum to be divided. At the end of the day, the party will suffer. Your business is, if the governors are not united, unite the governors, so that they can work for the interest of the party. It is very key.\n\n\u201cToday we have lost focus in the National Assembly, and so you have to put our party together to make sure our members of National Assembly speak with one voice and be opposition party they\u2019re supposed to be.\n\n\u201cYes, I supported you, I voted for you, because I have the belief you can turn PDP to success in 2023. But if you\u2019re not doing well, Mr. Chairman, I will shout, I will say, Mr. Chairman, this is not what we expected from you.\u201d\n\nWike commended the successful election that ushered in the new leadership of the party and assured the national chairman of his commitment, along with other governors of the party, to his success in the national rescue project.\n\nMark and former Senate President Bukola Saraki, while extolling the virtues of Ayu, said he had the competence to lead the party back to power in 2023.\n\nSaraki said, \u201cWe are here to give confidence and hope to Nigerians, but I see a brighter future. PDP always gets victory from Benue. North-central assures you of total cooperation. I do not have any doubt because you are a man of character.\n\n\u201cThe new leadership will address the myriad of problems confronting the country. We re ready to rescue the country. Passion and love will guide us to achieve our goals.\u201d\n\nHe called on Ayu to be honest and frank.\n\nMeanwhile, new National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, described the APC as a party of strange bedfellows, who were power grabbers. Ologunagba alleged, \u201cAPC is a gathering of strange bedfellows. Today, it has 90 states chairmen, instead of 36, and each of them loyal to a warlord. How can they elect their national leadership?\u201d\n\nHe also said the goal of the Ayu-led PDP was to improve the economy by implementing well thought-out policies and programmes, and pay special attention to infrastructure, especially, electricity and rail transport.\n\nIn a statement, Ologunagba said the National Working Committee (NWC) of PDP appreciated the unprecedented courage displayed by Nigerians in the last six years of the APC government.\n\nHe said, \u201cUnder the APC, Nigerians continued to experience insecurity ravaging the country, unprecedented unemployment, an economy in shambles, almost collapsing, the naira failing daily, industries are packing up daily, education standards falling, health sector in comatose, infrastructure decay and stagnation, and scaring disunity and suspicion pervades the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Can Kenya get out of the supply chain crisis?",
          "text": "Q4 is coming to a close, the holiday season is upon us, and Kenya\u2019s businesses are settling their accounts for the year.\n\nIn many ways, transport and logistics, which support numerous sectors of the Kenyan economy, seem to be on an upswing. The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reported a 4.4% growth in container traffic during the first eight months of the year, and Kenya\u2019s all-new port at Lamu launched in May.\n\nBut, alongside positive figures and groundbreaking infrastructure projects that point to an optimistic outlook for the logistics industry, Kenya\u2014just like the US, UK, and other countries throughout the world\u2014is also feeling the impact of a COVID-19-induced supply chain shortage.\n\nWill tech offer a solution to help the industry sustain itself?\n\nA global meltdown\n\nOn a global level, the supply chain meltdown began with a container shortage that cropped up at the end of 2020, with freight rates rising higher than 264%, compared to previous years. Prior to this, containers moved from China to Europe and North America, but COVID-19 restrictions limited air freight, creating an increased demand that prevented the flow of containers back to East Asia.\n\nFollowing that, demand for Chinese exports skyrocketed after a pandemic-induced slump. At this point, global supply chains were already out of balance, and demand for exports exceeded the supply of shipping containers.\n\nBy March 2021, shipping container rates from China to the US and Europe had increased by 300%, compared to the year before.\n\nTrade under lockdown\n\nIn Kenya, it began with a lockdown.\n\nThe start of the pandemic led to a gridlock in Kenya\u2019s transport industry that had an immediate impact on the country itself, and the region as a whole.\n\nIndustries with markets outside of the East African community were among the hardest hit. East Africa\u2019s flower industry, for example, which ships fresh flowers via air to European countries, suffered an estimated $1 billion in losses when European countries sealed their borders. Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-largest flower exporter, also reported an 80% reduction in flower export volume.\n\nDue to restricted sea and air routes, imports to Kenya decreased by 23%, but the permission of select land transport that allowed goods to flow by land between borders meant that \u201cother countries in the East African community benefited,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno, Trade and Policy Manager at the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). For example, trade between Kenya, an exporter of palm oil, petroleum oil, and salt, and Uganda, an exporter of milk, tobacco, cane, and energy, increased by 11.3%.\n\nBut transport by land between the countries was still slow and prohibitively expensive.\n\nAs positive COVID cases began to increase in East Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya agreed to test all truck drivers entering and exiting the three countries. However, unequal distribution of COVID-19 resources and inadequate supply chains to get them to East Africa meant a scarce number of test kits. This led to a buildup of drivers along the border, lost goods, an overall decrease of truck inflows into Uganda, and an increase in shipping cost at around 48%.\n\nWhile the flower industry is rebounding and trucks are moving more freely, the temporary dismemberment of the supply chain industry may continue to have knock-on effects on businesses in the East African economy.\n\nShortages\n\nThe US is already feeling inflationary pressures caused by supply chain issues that have resulted in a 6.2% increase in the US Consumer Price Index\u2014a measurement used to estimate price changes in a basket of goods\u2014compared to last year.\n\nKenya is experiencing a similar phenomenon.\n\nIn April, the cost of bread in Kenya increased by $.044 for the first time in four years and is set to increase yet again. The Cereal Millers Association (CMA) points to lower global wheat stocks, marine freight issues, and the rising cost of fuel to its highest levels in the past 10 years as the causes of the price increase.\n\nReliability is key\n\nKenya\u2019s potential supply chain crisis and its impact can be mitigated.\n\nA major aspect of the rise in prices caused by the current meltdowns is uncertainty, which can be costly in the logistics industry.\n\nThe market is currently highly uncertain, which can present difficulties for even the most well organised businesses.\n\n\u201cThe shipping lines are like a small mafia,\u201d said Dr. Simeon Obidairo, co-owner of BoConcept, a contemporary, Danish, luxury furniture line in the process of reopening in Nairobi.\u201cThey tell you transit times for the shipping is going to be six weeks; the shipment leaves, and they end up delivering it 12 weeks later. So, we\u2019ve seen at least double the typical transit times.\u201d\n\nA typical method of organising and tracking shipments to lessen supply chain disruptions is through the use of technology, which, when underutilised, creates major operational kinks that can be cumbersome to correct.\n\nLogi-tech\n\nA new Personal Information Protection Law out of China, for example, is preventing the provision of real-time shipping information by some China-based shipping companies, triggering fears of further shipping disruptions. As China is home to six out of 10 of the world\u2019s largest container ports, this has caused a 90% drop in terrestrial shipping data that companies use to track the arrival and departure of essential goods.\n\nEast Africa\u2019s logistics industry is still growing to a place where it is similarly tech-reliant. At present, most trade in the region happens informally. But more reliability is highly desired: \u201cWe need frameworks to support digital trade,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno. \u201cWhatever the client has ordered should be what they actually get. And if it isn\u2019t, there should be a mechanism to address these issues.\u201d\n\nDue to pandemic-induced demand shocks, transporters in the region also cut back. As consumption rises amid holiday festivities, and businesses increase capacity, those who fail to become more tech-reliant may find themselves \u201cill-positioned across the country primarily due to the low adoption of technology by the industry,\u201d said Tayo Oyegunle, COO of Moove, a logistics platform that offers on-demand solutions to both customers and businesses within East Africa.\n\nInvestor appetite for the transport and logistics sector was still high in 2021, with a total of $200 million raised by the industry as a whole in Africa during the first eight months of the year. But, much of this has been attributed to the January commencement of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a 34-member-state-strong agreement that aims to introduce non-tariff barriers throughout the African continent.\n\nBut, the AfCFTA\u2019s success for Kenya and the region as a whole also necessitates more coordination on a technological level. Without it, it may be years before we see supply chain issues corrected and an environment for freer trade realised.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How African startups can build multi-million dollar deals",
          "text": "The year 2021 has set many new standards for Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem. As reporter Alexander Onwukwue states, \u201cIt\u2019s the year African startups normalised $100 million rounds.\u201d It\u2019s the year francophone Africa produced its first unicorn, Wave, which raised $200 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.\n\nIt\u2019s also the year of mergers and acquisitions, with over 333 M&A deals worth $51 billion done in the first half of the year alone, a 567% increase in deal value from 2020\u2019s $8 billion. Following Stripe\u2019s acquisition of Paystack in a $200 million deal in 2020, quite a number of notable acquisitions have occurred. From Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha, MaxAB\u2019s acquisition of Morocco\u2019s WaystoCap, and even Piggyvest\u2019s acquisition of Savi, companies in the ecosystem are consolidating to solve some of the continent\u2019s taxing issues.\n\nOne of the biggest acquisition deals of 2021 is MFS Africa\u2019s deal with Capricorn. In October, MFS Africa\u2014the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa\u2014signed a deal to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies. While the amount is undisclosed, both parties confirmed that the deal is Nigeria\u2019s \u201csecond-largest\u201d fintech acquisition deal, second only to Paystack\u2019s $200 million acquisition deal with Stripe.\n\nBut how do hundred-million-dollar deals get made? And why are more startups hitching their wagons together? On December 3, TechCabal brought Dare Okoudjou, MFS Africa CEO, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn together in a live session to answer some of these questions.\n\nBig deals start out small\n\nFor Dare Okoudjou\u2014who has led MFS Africa\u2019s growth in 35 African countries\u2014big deals and acquisitions don\u2019t always start out as big deals. \u201cBig deals are done over time, and sometimes, they start off as minority investments talks which evolve into acquisition talks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time Degbola and I spoke in 2014, Capricorn had just started and we\u2014MFS Africa\u2014we\u2019re trying to help him raise money. Fast forward to 2020, and we\u2019re speaking about acquisitions.\u201d\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn.\n\nOn Capricorn\u2019s end, Degbola Abudu and his team had been fundraising for a while, and while they weren\u2019t planning on getting acquired, the deal was a realistic next step for them. \u201cInitially, MFS Africa was supposed to be an investor. Conversations for this present deal started even before COVID, and by the end of 2020, when it became clearer, we were more open to it. There were many conversations between myself and Dare, and many more between myself and the Capricorn board.\u201d\n\nWhile Capricorn\u2019s motivation for taking the deal was geared towards sustainability, MFS Africa\u2019s was targeted at growth and expansion. \u201cMFS has agent networks in 35 SSA countries and the opportunity to merge that with what exists in Nigeria isn\u2019t easily replicated,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cWe\u2019d been eyeing Nigeria for a while, hoping that the mobile money network would kick-off, but it didn\u2019t. On the other hand, there was Capricorn which had built a strong agent network of 90,000 agents. When we realised that, it was evident what the next steps were.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust and partnerships\n\nRecognising strategic partnerships is something that can be said of MFS Africa\u2019s earlier acquisitions. Prior to Capricorn, MFS Africa had acquired two other companies. In 2020, the company acquired Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech delivering payment management solutions to SMEs. That deal also started off with several conversations on strategic partnerships between Beyonic\u2019s CEO, Luke Kyouhere.\n\nIn 2016, MFS Africa acquired Sochitel\u2014a company that specialised in international airtime transfers into Africa\u2014and the acquisition, according to MFS Africa, helped create the largest transfer payment network which focuses on Africa.\n\nThe company has also made six minority investments in companies across the continent including Maviance, Numida, Julaya, and Inclusivity solutions. One crucial thing that has helped these relationships\u2014investments and acquisitions\u2014is trust.\n\n\u201cIn considering acquisitions at MFS Africa, we start with our destination, our North star. We want to be in all 54 African countries, and we don\u2019t want borders to matter. You can be in Benin and make transactions with people in Zambia, or in Nigeria. Over time, we\u2019ve calculated what that means, infrastructure and regulation-wise for us. And when we want to invest or acquire a company, we ask ourselves how or if that investment or acquisition will bring us closer to these goals. That\u2019s usually the starting point,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cThe thing that usually makes or breaks these things is the people. Because, in the end, if you can\u2019t work with the people, it doesn\u2019t matter what the spreadsheets say.\u201d\n\nAbudu also agrees that trust is a necessary ingredient to any big deal. \u201cOther than being realistic, trust was one thing we had to show, and for that to happen, we had to be open on our end. We had to be clear what the acquisition meant for our people and it was important to be open about everything. That\u2019s what startups need to understand. Hiding things won\u2019t help you in the long run, and with trust, you can even work towards solving some of those crucial points together.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Kwara raises a $4m seed to build Africa\u2019s first credit union-powered neobank",
          "text": "One of the beauties of fintech is its ability to either unbundle or seamlessly bundle fragmented and broken banking services. While some startups focus on building digital consumer banks, others focus on building banks for businesses, or for both.\n\nOne startup building for both is Kenya-based Kwara, a one-stop-shop core digital banking infrastructure for Savings and Credit Co-operatives (SACCOs) to manage all their activities, and it has raised $4 million seed funding.\n\nThe new investment will be used to facilitate the launching of its neobank; further develop its existing app; double down on its marketing efforts; and increase its talent pool.\n\nThe investment was led by Breega, with participation from SoftBank Vision Fund, Emerge, FINCA Ventures, New General Market Partners, Globivest, Do Good Invest, Raba Capital, Launch Africa, Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, DOB Equity, and fintech angels.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile many people think that SACCOs are a slow, vulnerable, and outdated way of saving and accessing credit, and that the market needs new agile products that could displace this model, Kwara, founded by Cynthis Wandia (CEO) and David Hwan (CTO), wants to keep it going by enhancing its efficiency through digitising all its core functionalities.\n\nA true cooperative guardian angel\n\nWendia had just rounded up her first startup and joined Finparx, a venture builder in Germany, to work as a venture developer; there she spent most of her days staring eye-to-eye at different problems. But what struck her the most was the problem of coffee farmers not getting much value for their hard work. Wendia\u2019s grandmother was a coffee farmer in Kenya so this was nostalgic.\n\nShe became curious and started digging. Her interest started off from a trade finance angle, looking at the supply chain, to see if there was something that could be done. But the more she looked at the value chain, starting from the farmer\u2019s point of view to export, she kept coming across this institution called the credit union or the cooperative, which is effectively like a financial institution or bank, but owned by its clients.\n\n\u201cI noticed, for example, that for my grandmother, the cooperative had walked with her on her entire economic journey. The more I looked into it, the more we saw just how incredible this institution is in offering extremely affordable financial products like savings, loans and pension,\u201d Wendia told TechCabal.\n\nSo, after further research on SACCOs in Kenya and across the world, Wendia and her team realised that these cooperatives are a sort of informal bank, \u201cthe fairest bank\u201d, in Wendia\u2019s words. But they saw how far behind they were in leveraging technology that could take their efficiency from zero to 100. \u201cSo, we launched Kwara as a technology infrastructure for SACCOs,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nIn 2019, the Kwara core banking product was launched and, ever since, has become a safe haven for Kenyan cooperatives. But the ambition has expanded from just being a banking infrastructure to becoming an operating system for every growth-oriented SACCO in Kenya.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nAccording to Wendia, the platform now powers over 50 cooperatives, with over 65,000 backend users. The company is reportedly growing its credit union customer base by 40% month-on-month, and the listed credit unions are growing their membership by 19% and their loan base by 46%, annually. There are currently more than $142 million assets under management at a $40 million monthly transaction across savings, loan disbursement, pension and lots more.\n\nBecause Kenya is a big market for cooperatives, the company is going through a product expansion as opposed to market expansion. Though it\u2019s reported to be courting some credit union clients in South Africa and the Philippines, which, according to the CEO, validates their solution across multiple markets. The company wants to focus on eliminating the existing frictions in the Kenyan market, a move that will somewhat guarantee seamless replication across other markets.\n\nFor instance, in a bid to become an operating system for SACCO, it has partnered with Workpay, a human resource management and payroll processing solutions company, to enable SACCOs automate their human resource (HR) processes as a complimentary service to Kwara\u2019s products. Onboarded SACCOs will be able to carry out seamless payroll processing into SACCO accounts and enjoy access to an HR module for efficient management of their staff.\n\n\u201cWe have also partnered with Lami insurance API provider, which plugs us into about 20 underwriters in Kenya. Now, our customers [SACCOs] can negotiate or choose fantastic insurance products right from our platform,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Kwara?\n\nThere are over 300 million people currently banking within emerging markets, and that number is growing at 6% year-on-year. Kwara aims to increase that to at least 1 billion by the end of the decade, positioning itself as the platform for $500bn in transactions between credit unions and their members.\n\nDue to that, it\u2019s launching a new bank that will be powered by its existing credit unions. The play here is to turn over 65,000 backend users into early users of its neobank while onboarding more credit unions to ramp up more users.\n\nThe neobank will allow members of credit unions to deposit money directly to their credit union accounts, repay their loans, and apply for instant loans while tracking their finances and payments, all in a seamless manner. In addition, Kwara is building an open banking infrastructure via an open API that allows credit unions to integrate with payment gateways, banks, and third-party vendors, enabling a full marketplace. Also, any unbanked individual can easily join a credit union and then enjoy the whole banking benefits.\n\nSpeaking on launching a neobank and on the investment that will make it possible. Kwara CEO, Cynthia Wandia, says, \u201cWe are building a solution for people\u2014an estimated 1 billion\u2014who do not currently have access to personalised banking services. This is the result of a gap in banking-grade technology and the lack of neobank-like experiences for the end clients.\u201d\n\nShe said they [Kwara] have been thrilled to see the \u201cexcitement around the Kwara brand among credit unions and their members, which is fast becoming synonymous with a superior user experience and the future of banking. Thanks to our investors, we will now be able to offer an end-client experience that is 100 times better than what they previously had access to\u201d.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve seen an increasing interest in how to build wealth through community, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards digital-first banking,\u201d said Ben Marrel, Founding partner at Breega, who led the investment. \u201cKwara\u2019s unique approach is a catalyst for a new way of retail banking through digital-first credit unions. We are both proud and excited to be helping this outstanding team scale across Africa and other emerging markets.\u201d\n\nKwara aims\u2014without branching away from its core mission of empowering credit unions across Africa and the rest of the world\u2014to help 1 billion people benefit from credit unions through its neobank by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\nShare this article",

Available in only Nigeria for now, users will be able to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and internet data.\n\nOver the next few years, there are plans to launch the service in other African countries, such as Ghana, where GIGM expanded into two years ago.\n\n\u201cMobility is more versatile than it is generally perceived to be,\u201d Jude Odum, GIGM\u2019s Chief Operating Officer told TechCabal, explaining the rationale behind the company\u2019s move. \u201cIt is the ability to be moved or move freely and easily. The freedom associated with mobility is the experience we are making available to customers.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAccording to Odum, the new service was tested for about four months, during which the GIGM processed \u201cthousands of transactions valued at millions of naira\u201d.\n\nWith the launch of the e-wallet and payments features, GIGM will be competing in a space where a plethora of fintech apps already operate. But Odum is upbeat about the company\u2019s chances, riding on its reputation as a leading mobility brand, and expects its app user base to hit one million by the first half of next year.\n\n\u201cCredibility is a very critical factor for making buying decisions. Customers would rather choose to deal with reliable brands over popular ones,\u201d Odum said. \u201cWe may not be popular in the fintech space just yet [but] we are optimistic that our user base will grow rapidly in the coming months.\u201d\n\nGIGM\u2019s new bills payment and e-wallet features\n\nGIGM\u2019s transition from a traditional transport and logistics company to a technology-first business model began with an official name change in 2019. Odum tells TechCabal that the tech unit is the second-largest, after its core operations.\n\n\u201cWe have a robust tech team that has gleaned experiences from fintech and other sectors critical to the successful development and management of our products,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the capacity to play in this [tech] space.\u201d\n\nIn the long run, GIGM wants its app to become a one-stop shop that caters to the needs of its customers by leveraging its tech capability. Such a super-app would eliminate the need to use multiple apps to carry out daily tasks. Hence payments and e-wallet are the first of many non-core mobility features that the company intends to offer.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic gave insights to the unimaginable capabilities of technology and its application,\u201d Kenneth Nwanganga, GIGM\u2019s Chief Technology Officer said in the statement. \u201cAs all aspects of life become digitised, Nigerians now have more reasons and opportunities to connect with the GIGM brand, beyond transportation\u201d.\n\nAsked what other non-mobility solutions GIGM plans to launch soon, Odum said GIGM will continue to explore new offerings for its users.\n\n\u201cToday it\u2019s bills payment, tomorrow it could be a crowdfunding-based investment platform or a crypto wallet.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nAuthor Mu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 I bully myself because I make me do what I put my mind to.\n\n\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For one, it meant not having to deal with uncooperative neighbours who refuse to pay to install an already bought water pumping machine. It also meant some level of monetary security.\n\nSadly, for many Nigerians, owning a property is an out-of-reach dream. Only 2% of Nigerians have \u20a6500,000 ($870) in bank deposits. For people looking to own a house in Lagos, that\u2019s not enough to buy bare land.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter Enterprise Hotel: Think of what fintech startups like Bamboo, Chaka, Trove, and Risevest are doing to aid fractional investing in Nigeria, and you can get an inkling of what Enterprise Hotel does.\n\nThe company is offering Africans the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate with as little as \u20a630,000 ($52).\n\nOur Reporter, Chimgozirim Nwokoma, had a chat with Uche Ajaere, Co-founder and CEO of Enterprise Hotel, to get a feel of what the company is doing.\n\nEnjoy this interesting read when you click on this link: Enterprise Hotel is democratising real estate investments for regular Africans\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s crypto regulations expected by 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s financial regulator, Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FCSA), has said it would unveil crypto regulations in early 2022.\n\nWhy is this interesting? It appears South Africa might be the first African country to set out comprehensive regulation on crypto. So far, the general stance on the continent has been regulators\u2019 directives cautioning banks and customers from transacting in digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nNot so surprising, though. The country has been the subject of two of the world\u2019s largest crypto scams: Mirror Trading Investment\u2019s $170 million scam in January 2021 and, most recently, Africrypt\u2019s $3.8 billion theft in June 2021.\n\n\n\nDid you know? Kidnappers have demanded ransom money in Bitcoin in South Africa on several occasions. I found some stories here and here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve brought you news on possible cryptocurrency regulations in South Africa in June and July, but what do we know now?\n\nIn an interview on Friday, December 10, 2021, Unathi Kamlana, FSCA Commissioner, revealed that the regulations are being designed in collaboration with the Prudential Authority and South Africa Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) \u2014 apex bank \u2014 Financial Surveillance Department.\n\nThe regulations will establish how trading in cryptocurrency should be conducted and examine other issues like how the currencies interact with traditional financial products, the risks they pertain to bank balance sheets, and whether they threaten fiscal stability.\n\nHowever, Kamlana doesn\u2019t believe that they pose a risk to fiscal stability just yet, viewing them as assets rather than currency. Currently, the regulator is monitoring SARB\u2019s move to create a stable coin.\n\nInterestingly, South Africa is 16th on the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index 2021.\n\nThe weekend\u2019s money moves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican edtech startup, uLesson, has announced the raise of a $15 million Series B with investment from two new investors, Tencent and Nielsen Ventures. Other investors were returnees, Owl Ventures, TLcom Capital, and Founder Collective.\n\nThis comes after a $7.5 million Series A announced in January 2021 and marks the largest disclosed investment in an African edtech startup. The fund will be used to invest in product development, strengthen its core technology and add cohort-based learning features.\n\nOn to Egypt: Following a soft launch in October, Egyptian fintech startup, Sympl has revealed a $6 million seed investment led by Beco Capital. Other investors in the round were A15 and Global Ventures.\n\nFounded in August 2021 by Mohamed El-Feky, Yasmine Henna, and Karim Tawfik, Sympl is a buy now, pay later platform and has onboarded about 240 merchants. The fund will be used to expand its merchant network, build technical upgrades and enhancements, hire more talent, and expand its footprint across Egypt.\n\nAnother seed round: Kenyan fintech, Kwara has raised $4 million in seed funding, led by Breega Capital. Other participants include SoftBank Vision Fund Emerge, Finca Ventures, New General Market Partners, Globivest and Do Good Invest.\n\nKwara currently provides Backend-as-a-service to credit unions, helping to digitise their processes and has grown its customer base to 50 clients since its launch in 2021. The company says the funds will be used to develop a neobank app for these unions.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nThis weekend was a mashup of Afrobeats, a 70s Soul Classics playlist, and an introduction to Da\u00f0i Freyr\n\nI tried Jeff Bezos\u2019 morning routine of puttering around.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong before tech startups democratised investing in the stock market, anyone looking to invest in the stock market needed a significant amount of money. But that changed with the entrance of startups like Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka.\n\nFor the first time, Nigerians could buy stocks with as little as $10 (\u20a65,000). Although most stocks available are of foreign companies, that innovation provided Nigerians with a way to invest small sums of money.\n\nSimilarly, Airbnb upended the hospitality industry when it made it possible for individuals to rent out their homes. In the process, it allowed people to get a slice of the pie that is the hospitality industry.\n\nHelping Africans to own commercial real estate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some ways, owning a property is the Nigerian dream. However, the absence of suitable mortgage or financing options means one would require a considerable upfront investment to live their dream. With only 2% of Nigerians reportedly having up to \u20a6500,000 ($870) in bank deposits, owning a property is out of reach for most people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFractional investment startup, Enterprise Hotel, hopes to change this by offering Africans the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate with as little as \u20a630,000 ($52).\n\nLike the model used by investment tech startups, individuals can now own properties with minimal investments. The startup offers three product classes, the first being the room sale. Under this arrangement, individuals can outrightly purchase a room.\n\nThe block sale is the second level, and for this, Enterprise Hotel divides a room into ten blocks, allowing people to purchase each block. So, if the price for a room has been set at \u20a630 million, for instance, a block would cost \u20a63 million.\n\nThe unit sale is the last unit, and with this, Enterprise Hotel divides the room into a thousand parts. Consequently, it becomes easy for more people to purchase real estate regardless of their income levels.\n\nHow Enterprise Hotel makes money\n\nEnterprise Hotel makes money in two ways. The first is via the sale of the rooms and the second is through a management fee paid by the investors. With the management fee, Enterprise Hotel covers management costs, including recruitment on behalf of the investors.\n\nSo why real estate? Uche Ajaere is the co-founder and CEO of Enterprise Hotel. You may recognise the surname, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s a director of GIG Group.\n\nWhile the GIG Group is popularly known for the transport company, GIGM, it also has investments in other industries, including real estate. For over eight years, Uche has been involved in the operations of the real estate division. Simultaneously, he has kept an eye on developments in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nHis time working in real estate showed him that only a handful of people could afford to buy or own real estate. In Lekki, Lagos State, a four-bedroom duplex costs about \u20a6100 million ($173,913). This is out of the reach of most Nigerians who earn less than \u20a6150,000 ($300) annually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, he decided on a startup that gives people a chance to own real estate regardless of how much they have.\n\nChallenges and competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s startup space has been in fintech, with a handful of other industries represented. The real estate sector has seen very little innovation, with startups like Spleet and Muster attempting to solve the issue of rent for Nigerians.\n\nOne reason for this is that technology does not entirely solve the problems in real estate. At best, it only aids processes. Unlike other sectors, the barrier to entry in real estate is high. In addition, it could take as much as 15 years for investors to see a return on their investments. Consequently, it is not surprising that there is less investment going into real estate compared to other industries.\n\n\u201cPeople within the technology space will always think, \u2018how affordable is it to get this product? And how fast am I going to make my profit?\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the promise of higher returns in other industries, why would anyone want to invest in real estate,\u201d Uche asks.\n\nThis high entry barrier is what Enterprise Hotel is working to eliminate. If, for example, a room in an Enterprise Hotel is going for \u20a630 million ($52,173), when it is split into 1,000 units, that amounts to about \u20a630,000 ($60), which is a lot more affordable for most Nigerians.\n\nIn addition to affordability, Enterprise Hotel says it offers investors an opportunity to get a return on their investment within two to four years. That\u2019s impressive because it takes about 15 to 20 years for most real estate acquisitions to return the initial capital outlay.\n\nEnterprise Hotel provides its investors with several ways to earn. The primary route is through hotel bookings. However, that is not all, as investors can make money from every activity that takes place in the rooms they own as well as other services offered in the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for example, if a guest eats, drinks, or pays for dry cleaning services in the room, the investors also earn a cut of the earnings.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. One of the reasons many Nigerians buy land is that it often increases in value. Uche reveals that investments done through Enterprise Hotel would be evaluated with the value reflected on the app. Investors can also sell their properties, although Enterprise Hotel would require that they be given the right of first refusal on any property.\n\nAlready, Enterprise Hotel has properties in Lagos, Abuja, Benin, and Port Harcourt, with plans to add more across Nigeria. Uche reveals that the goal is to have an Enterprise Hotel in every major city in the world.\n\nFor Enterprise Hotel, building in a sector with little or no examples to follow could be tough. While there are startups currently offering fractional investment services in Nigeria, the majority are in the financial services space. Yet, a lot can be learnt from their success.\n\nAlthough Enterprise Hotel\u2019s model could see them offer real estate investment for as little as \u20a630,000 ($60), that is still a significant investment for most Nigerians. While the ability to invest small amounts is attractive, the reality is that the returns earned on such investments would be small, and this could discourage potential users. Therefore, it may be that the key to Enterprise Hotel\u2019s success lies in serving a market with higher disposable income.\n\nAttracting investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a startup like Enterprise Hotel requires enormous investments. So far, Enterprise Hotel has run without institutional investment. Uche discloses that while they are open to receiving investments, at the moment, the focus is on building significant traction before approaching investors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just selling an app like other startups. We want to make sure that in the next few months when we\u2019re talking to investors, we\u2019ll be talking based on value. We want to show them the first set of hotels that we have built and investors who\u2019ve bought into them and are already making money. Then we can start talking to investors.\u201d\n\nAside from helping more people gain access to real estate investments, Enterprise Hotel indirectly solves another problem. Uche reveals that users can use it as collateral when applying for loans since they own the properties outrightly.\n\nIn Nigeria, where Enterprise Hotel operates, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals outside their preferred high net worth group. And in cases where they are willing to do so, they require collateral. Enterprise Hotel offers users a way out. They can now invest in real estate while using the assets as collateral.\n\nBuilding a business of any sort is challenging. For Enterprise Hotel, operating in the real estate industry with its high financial requirements poses a significant hurdle. However, the success of startups like Bamboo and Risevest suggest that Enterprise Hotel might be onto something.\n\nAuthor Chimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.

For me, his name comes to mind whenever I hear or say the words fintech or finance.\n\nFor real? Oh yeah, Olowe has a wealth of experience in finance. He was an early advisor to Wallets Africa, used to be on the TeamApt board, and has spent over a decade in traditional finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Olowe did not study anything finance-related. His first and Master\u2019s degrees were in engineering.\n\nBut despite having an academic background devoid of finance, Olowe thrived in the space. From building an intranet platform at Standard Trust Bank to his data analytics system at Access Bank, he quickly became a force.\n\nHowever, the open banking system is arguably one of his most significant achievements. The system helps fintechs integrate with banks seamlessly, reducing a process that should have taken months to a day.\n\nBut what exactly is open banking, and how did one man get the Central Bank of Nigeria and every commercial bank in the country to \u201clike the idea.\u201d\n\nWell, Olowe took the first step and was surprised by the outcome.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole had a chat with the finance expert, and he dished about his career, life, and the open banking system.\n\nRead: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nAnd the nominees are\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the biggest tech event in West Africa \u2014 Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, we\u2019ve got news for you.\n\nNominees for Techpoint Awards (Nigerian edition) are out!

          "text": "Flour Mills Nigeria plc (FMN) will press ahead with its N80 billion acquisition of the flour mills unit of Honeywell Group Limited (HGL) and may escrow N900 million of the proceeds, BusinessDay has learnt.\n\nFlour Mills of Nigeria and Honeywell Group Limited last month agreed to combine operations of FMN through its affiliates and Honeywell Flour Mills plc (HFMP), a portfolio company of HGL, at a total enterprise value of N80 billion, which will make Honeywell Group dispose of a 71.69 percent stake in HFMP to FMN.\n\nThe proposed transaction will combine two businesses with shared goals and create a more resilient national champion in the Nigerian foods industry, ensuring long-term job creation and preservation.\n\nDays after this agreement to combine these two businesses, Ehimen Oriaifo, a lawyer representing Kunle Ogunba & Associates, widely circulated a caveat emptor warning against the transaction on the basis of an existing dispute over an alleged debt owed to Ecobank by Honeywell.\n\nFlour Mills does not see any good reason why it should not push ahead to close the transaction as the conglomerate will choose to escrow N900 million in response to the tussle between Honeywell and its bankers, Ecobank Nigeria.\n\nA combination of FMN and HFMP will bring together two trusted and iconic brands, creating a food business that is better positioned to benefit the growing Nigerian population, further enhance national food security objectives and leverage opportunities stemming from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement.\n\nRead Also: Flour Mills says acquisition of majority equity in Honeywell not in breach of any court order\n\nBusinessDay learns that this dispute relates to a matter dating back almost nine years when senior executives of both Honeywell and Ecobank reached an agreement on the outline of a deal for Honeywell to pay N3.5 billion as full and final settlement of a N5 billion claim by Ecobank.\n\nThe agreement was negotiated by a team of Ecobank led by its erstwhile CEO Jubril Aku on the one hand and the chairman of Honeywell Oba Otudeko on the other hand.\n\nHoneywell proceeded to pay the agreed N3.5 billion but about nine months after the deal was reached, the bank that had acknowledged receipt of the N3.5 billion came back to Honeywell to say management could not secure board approval for the settlement and that in any case Honeywell payment was not made within an agreed time frame.\n\nHoneywell would not budge, insisting that it had fulfilled its own side of the bargain and that Ecobank had to do the same. At this time, Honeywell had the sum of N600 million in one of its accounts with Ecobank.\n\nWhen Honeywell rebuffed requests by the bank for it to pay an additional N900 million to resolve the matter, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer approached a Federal High Court in Lagos to secure an exparte order \u201crestraining the respondent, chairman of Honeywell Group of Companies Limited, Oba Otudeko, its directors, staff, management, employees, officers, agents, privies or any other person or group of persons whatsoever under the respondent\u2019s authority or any other authority (whatsoever derived or sourced) from operating, withdrawing from or otherwise tampering with the respondent\u2019s funds under whatsoever name or guise in any bank or financial institution within Nigeria, pending the hearing and final determination of the application of the application for the appointment of provisional liquidator in furtherance of the petition herein.\u201d\n\nAs time passed, the injunction secured via the ex-parte motion was dismissed and this dismissal was upheld at the Supreme Court. But both parties are still in court.\n\nOpinion is divided on the appropriateness of the well published caveat emptor by Ecobank\u2019s lawyers.\n\nAccording to a senior business executive unconnected with the case, \u201cthere were questions to be asked as to why an aggrieved party should be aiming to spoil transaction of this size on account of a disputed claim of N900 million. You would have thought that the prospect of a massive acquisition like this will be seen as an opportunity for all credible and legal claims to be settled.\u201d\n\nHowever, others say it may well be an effective strategy even if strange to seek to declare a mighty man like Otudeko bankrupt.\n\nUnder the proposed transaction, which is subject to approval from the appropriate regulators, final equity price per share payable will be determined based on HFMP\u2019s adjusted net debt and net working capital at the date of completion.\n\nTo Flour Mills, the proposed transaction aligns with its vision not only to be an industry leader but a national champion for Nigeria. The conglomerate believes that this will create an opportunity to combine the unique talents of two robust businesses.\n\nAs a result, it will have a better-rounded and more comprehensive skill set available to the company as a combined diversified food business, thus enabling it to better serve its consumers, customers and other stakeholders, while providing employees with access to broader opportunities.\n\nTo Honeywell Flour, the business combination is in line with the evolution of the Group and its vision of creating value that transcends generations.\n\nFor over two decades, Honeywell Flour Mills has built a strong business with a production capacity of 835,000 metric tons of food per annum.

          "text": "The expected combination of Flour Mills Nigeria (FMN) and the flour mills unit of Honeywell Flour Mills plc (HFMP) will form a formidable entity and an unassailable market leader in the agro-allied sector in Nigeria, according to industry players and market analysts.\n\nLast month, Flour Mills announced it had reached a deal to acquire the flour mills business of Honeywell in an N80 billion deal that will significantly enhance its market leadership.\n\nFMN is believed to hold about 40 percent of the flour business in Nigeria and its leadership in the sector will become even more secure following the combination with Honeywell Flour, which has a production capacity of 835,000 metric tons of food per annum.\n\nBusinessDay learns that the deal has been helped by several factors including the fact that the combination is seen as a \u201cstrategic fit\u201d and also the leaders of the two businesses including their chairmen have known themselves for a very long time.

Energy requirement that will keep Lagos economy on the path of growth, Sanwo-Olu noted, has far exceeded the current 1,000 megawatts being supplied from the national grid, necessitating the move to explore alternative sources.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven Lagos State\u2019s status as the commercial nerve-center and economic hub of Nigeria, it is our firm belief that the attainment of universal electricity access in the State would accelerate the same across other parts of the country. Increased electricity access is one of the priority mandates of this administration, given its significance in driving sustainable economic development.\n\n\u201cThere will be no economic development without sustainable energy. The economy needs energy to run and our objective as a Government is to deliver sustainable, reliable and affordable electricity to all Lagosians. The electricity policy being unveiled today does not only articulate the problems in the sector, it is also futuristic in the implementation of its provisions.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu said the State would ramp up procurement of pre-paid meters for distribution to residents as part of the implementation of the electricity policy. This, he said, would promote transparency in the supply chain, while curbing electricity theft and discouraging estimated billing from the suppliers.\n\nThe Governor stressed that the set objectives of the electricity policy would only be realisable if the private partners showed equal commitment as the Government to boost capacity in off-grid generation and distribution network.\n\n\u201cAs a Government, we believe one person cannot do it all. We need ideas and knowledge from each other, and form real partnership for coordination in the implementation of this framework,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nThe State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Lere Odusote, said the electricity policy, apart from clearing out constitutional and legal framework for investors\u2019 assurance, also provided for the establishment of an autonomous regulatory body and independent system operator.\n\nOdusote said Lagos Government would hinge its partnership with the industry players on well-funded and well-managed generation, transmission and distribution.\n\nThe State\u2019s Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyo Onigbanjo, SAN, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Mrs. Titilayo Shitta-Bey, said the framework was the first step to bringing Lagos out from constitutional obstruction that restricted the State from exploring electricity supply options.\n\nThe tone for the Government\u2019s partnership with the private energy investors was set by a panel of discussion moderated by Soji Awogbade, an energy lawyer and founding partner of Aelex.\n\nThe panelists included chairman of Ikeja Electric Plc and Egbon Power Plc, Mr. Kola Adeshina; co-founder of Falcon Corporation, Mrs. Audrey Joe-Ezigbo; Chief Executive Officer, Infrastructure Credit Guarantee Company Limited, Mr. Chinua Azubuike; Deputy Chief of Party, Power Africa, Mr. Tunde Gbajumo and Dr. Dolapo Fasawe, General Manager, Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA).\n\nThe stakeholders praised the Lagos Government for its commitment to boost power supply through the electricity framework; they argued that the implementation must focus more on supply for industrial consumption and productive activities rather than residential for sustainability of the plan.\n\nStakeholders also urged the Government to explore the options of clean and renewable energy infrastructure in order not to worsen environmental challenges facing the State.\n\n...",

          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nDeposit Money Banks (DMBs) and Micro Finance Banks (MFBs) operating in the country have intensified their quest for the control of the instant loan market, Business Hallmark investigation has revealed.\n\nNigeria\u2019s instant loan market has continued to attract an unprecedented level of interest, after financial technology firms (FinTechs) stole the initiative from conventional banks by making it possible for Nigerians to get loans from the comfort of their houses or offices while using their mobile phones and without even owning an account.\n\nFor instance, two leading startups, Fairmoney and Carbon, boasted a combined loan disbursement of over N70billion in 2020 alone.\n\nExperts in the industry who spoke with our correspondent put the conservative size of instant loans paid out by FinTechs to borrowers in 2020 alone at over N550billion.\n\n\u201cThese (N70billion) are just the combined figures released by only two lenders. The actual payout for non-bank retail credit should be in the region of N550billion if large lenders who didn\u2019t report their numbers are factored in. The market is huge, really huge. In fact, presently, we have close to 50 lenders offering instant loans\u201d, declared Taiwo Oni, a credit manager in one of Nigeria\u2019s leading commercial banks.\n\nAccording to Oni, who underwrites and evaluate applicant\u2019s requests for credit using credit scores, projected profits and losses, as well and risk factors for his bank, available data put the the size of Nigeria\u2019s working population at 62.2million, with around 99 million unique mobile subscribers.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that we don\u2019t have enough data in the country to patch together to make accurate assumptions, we still have enough to know that there is a gold mine waiting to be mined.\n\n\u201cFor instance, a research done in 2020 shows that salaried workers take an average of N23,000 six (6) time s a year. If 50% of our 62 million-strong labor force takes an average of about N23,000 loan six times a year, that\u2019s a N4.3 trillion loan segment.\n\n\u201cAnd we are just looking at a conservative estimate. There is no doubt that we have a wide gap in the nation\u2019s credit market.\n\n\u201cWe (banks) also want a piece of the cake. The competition for the huge instant loan market, I assure you, is going to intensify\u201d, Oni claimed.\n\nOne of the banks aggressively competing for control of the instant loans market is Access Bank Plc. The bank, checks on its website suggest, have different packages for both public and private workers desiring instant loans. They include Pay Day Loan, Device Finance (DFPS) and Salary Advance (SADV).\n\nFor Access Bank\u2019s PayDay Loan, an applicant can borrow money at low interest rate with no documentation or collateral needed, as long as he receives salary regularly.\n\nTo apply, an applicant just needs to dial *901*11*1# or through internet banking such as WhatsApp banking, Access mobile app and quick bucks app. The service is 24 hours.\n\nFeatures of the loan package include: no documentation required; no collateral required and up to thirty-one (31) days tenor, with the loan amount automatically deducted from the applicant\u2019s salary account.\n\nHowever, the maximum amount an applicant is eligible to get is 75%of his or her monthly salary, subject to \u20a6500,000 disbursement cap.\n\nThe interest rate for pay day loan is 4%. Othercharges are 1%managementfee and0.3%creditlifeinsurance, which are taken upfront.\n\nFor Salary Advance (SADV), beneficiaries must be salary account holders with Access Bank who earn a minimum of N50,000. The applicant can access up to200%of his monthly salary.\n\nThe loan has 180days tenor (6 monthly instalment payments, interest rate of 3.9% (on reducing balance), management fee of 1% and Credit Life Insurance fee of 0.7%.\n\nThe Small Ticket Personal Loan (STPL) on the other hand, is for salaryaccountholderswithAccessBankwhoearnaminimumofN100,000. They can access up to 400%of their monthly salary, with 365daysrepayment tenure (12 monthly instalments).\n\nThe interest rate for the package, unlike SADV, is 3.7% (on reducing balance), while management fee of 1% and Credit Life Insurance fee of 1% is charged.\n\nAnother instant loan package offered to customers is Device Finance (DFPS). Like other packages, beneficiaries must be salary account holders with Access Bank.\n\nA beneficiary can access upto33%of his annual salary, but subject to a maximum of\u20a6500,000. The package comes with 365 days repayment tenor (12 monthly instalments; interest rate of27% (flat) and Credit Life Insurance of 1%.\n\nMeanwhile, benefiting customers of the packages will face 1% penalchargepermonthfordefaultingontheloanfrom31dayspastdue.\n\nAnother bank heavily involved in the instant loan scheme is GTBank. It\u2019s Quick Credit, which offers year-long loans at 1.33% interest rate per month, is the industry\u2019s lowest.\n\nThe bank has 3 packages on its bouquet lists, namely GT Salary Advance, GTB Quick Credit Loan and the GTBank School Fees Advance (GTBank Student Loan).\n\nThe GT Salary Advance offers account owners with the bank up to 50% of their monthly salary upfront. It is available to only private companies and government employees who have their salary accounts domiciled in GTBank.\n\nLikewise, the GTBank School Fees Advance, also known as the GTBank Student loan, is a GTB loan facility that provides account holders the opportunity to pay school fees for their children and wards.\n\nOne of the major conditions for accessing this loan is that the institution of learning must be in Nigeria. The credit facility is available to staff of private and public organizations who have their salary accounts with GTBank.\n\nLastly, the bank has the GTB Quick Credit Loan for both salary earners and self-employed. The quick credit loan facility provides account holders the opportunity to get cash instantly and pay back over a period of 6\u201312 months at an interest of 1.33%.\n\nApplicants for the loan have 3differentwaystoapply. They include using the GTBank internet banking platform; using the bank\u2019s loan code *737*8*2# or visiting any branch of GTBank or ATM.\n\nWhile banks are upping their games in the push to gain control of the market, microfinance banks are not relenting in their determination to protect their turf.\n\nOne of the MFBs at the forefront of the scramble is Spectrum Microfinance Bank which offers two instant loan packages, Salary Earners Loans and PayDay Advance Loans to civil servants and private sector employees.\n\nA civil servant or a worker with a private firm applying for the two loans will need to provide a valid means of Identification (Driver\u2019s License, National ID Card, International Passport, work ID Card, recent utility bill and a bank statement for the last 6 months (for private employees).\n\nThe interest payable on the loans starts from 2.8% and does not exceed 3%.\n\n\u201cWe will review our rates downward for you should you find a lower interest elsewhere\u201d, the firm promised Nigerians in an effort to win them over..\n\nThe beauty of the loan packages is that an application does not need to operate an account with Spectrum before accessing a loan.\n\nApart from this, marketers employed by the company, dressed up in customised attires, visit government and private owned offices, particularly schools, cooperative societies, secretariats and market boards, wooing staffers to come take loans from them.\n\nAside that, any worker who introduced a client gets a percentage as commission for his efforts.\n\nAnother MFB making wave is Ibile Microfinance Bank owned by the Lagos State government. Established in 2017, the firm is particularly favoured by workers in the state\u2019s civil service looking for loans, probably because it is owned by their employers and because they believe they will get the best deals.\n\nLike other firms offering instant loans to Nigerians, a salary earner can only access Ibile MFB loans if he works in a well established organization outside the MDA sector.\n\nTo qualify, an applicant must upload his statement of account (6months), letter of confirmation of appointment/employment, authorised a direct debit to be placed on his account.\n\nTenor of the loan is between3-6months, and it attracts a management fee of1% and insurance fee of 1%.\n\nAfter disbursements, the loan facilities are deducted from beneficiaries\u2019 monthly pay.\n\nMutual Trust Microfinance Bank is another dominant player in the instant loans market. However, its instant/payday loans can only be accessed by federal civil servants.\n\nAccording to MTMB, interested federal workers can apply for loan to pay house rent, medical bills, household projects, or personal expenses. The company charges between 2% and 2.50% interest rates on its pay day loans.\n\nNot to be left out is Zedvance Limited, a consumer finance company with headquarters in Lagos.\n\nThe firm, BH learnt, particularly targets public workers working with the Lagos and Rivers State governments and those with blue chip companies such as Dangote Group, BUA, Nestle Nigeria, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Guinness, Multichoice and other firms who get their salaries regularly.\n\nThe minimum loan an applicant in the private sector can get is N50,000, while the maximum is N5,000,000. A monthly interest fee of 3.5% is applied and a flat management fee is charged upfront.\n\nThe loan has a maximum tenor of 18 months, and comes with requirements such as the supply of official email, staff ID card, valid means of identification, employment letter, utility bill (not more than 3 months old), a passport photograph, up-to-date bank statementsofnotlessthan6months, repayment instruments to achieve easy repayment of loans and beneficiaries must be between 22 and 55 years of age.\n\nOn the other hand, applicants from the public sector can get a minimum loan of N20,000 and a maximum of N3,000,000, with maximum tenor of 24months. A monthly interest fee of 3.5% is applied and a flat management fee is charged upfront.\n\nRequirements needed are more flexible unlike those placed on their colleagues from the private sector.\n\nApplicants applying for Zedvance loans can apply for payroll loan via www.zedvance.com; chat with Zee on WhatsApp via 09095017151or down load MoneyPal from Google PlayStore; call customer center via 07001001000 or visit any branch of the firm.\n\nThe decision of the DMBs and MFBs to offer lower interest rates on its loans, BH gathered, is pulling the carpet off the feet of hitherto market leaders that charge a minimum of15% flat rates on two-week loans starting from N10,000 to N30,000.\n\n\u201cMost people are now abandoning them (fintechs) for conventional banks owing largely to the huge differences in their rates.\n\n\u201cIf the trend continues, FinTechs will soon be in trouble as they don\u2019t have the war chest to",

          "text": "Okey Onyenweaku\n\nThe times are not any less tough for businesses as they are for human beings in Nigeria at the moment. Not even the banks, the traditional engine of development and growth of the Nigerian economy, are spared. Stories of the effects of the harsh operating environment on business have hardly left the board rooms in recent times.\n\nFrom early 2020, when the Covid -19 pandemic was detected and the attendant lockdowns and disruptions in supply chains among other challenges became rife, the Deposit money banks have like many other sectors been struggling.\n\nThis is besides the high inflation rate which has however tampered from above 18.17 per cent earlier in the year to 15.99 per cent; high unemployment at more than 33 per cent; underemployment above 22 per cent; and high insecurity caused by the Boko Haram sect, insurgents, kidnappers and bandits. At the same time, Diaspora remittances inflow fell 27 per cent year on year (YoY) to $17.2billion in 2020 from $23.55billion.\n\nAlso remarkable is the country\u2019s heavy debt burden at almost N38 trillion and expected to hit N40 trillion and above at the end of 2021 and still growing. Of the budget of N13.08trillion for 2021, the budget deficit stood at N5.6trillion as over 90 per cent of revenues are now used to service debts.\n\nMore worrisome is that the country has set a new borrowing limit, up from 25 per cent of GDP to 40 per cent of the GDP. This was contained in the Medium Term Debt Strategy and continues to leave many analysts scratching their heads given that the major revenue earner for the country, crude oil price, which has hit $75 pbd and above presently still fluctuates.\n\nAt the same time, insecurity has not only hobbled agriculture, many parts of Northern Nigeria have been taken over by bandits such that not much business activities can subsist. The World Bank just noted that Nigeria\u2019s revenue to GDP ratio hovered between five and six per cent last year and remains the lowest in the world. These days almost everybody is aware that Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world, since over taking India with over 100 million people living in poverty. The Naira which exchanged at N220/$ by June 15, 2015 has depreciated by about 100 per cent to N565/$ this November 2021.\n\nDespite these challenges, the banks appear to have shown resilience and posted profits. But fears are beginning to creep in that it may not be all roses for the DMBs at the end of the business year 2021.\n\nZenith Bank\n\nFor instance, Zenith Bank had posted a growth of 4 per cent to N61.0billion in the first quarter ended 31st March 2021, compared to N58.8billion in the corresponding period of 2020. The largest bank by profit achieved a growth in profit before tax of 3.0 percent from N114 billion reported in H1\u201920 to N117 billion in H1\u201921. Zenith Bank also posted a profit Before Tax of N180 billion for the nine months period ended 30 September 2021, reflecting a one per cent growth over the N177 billion recorded in the same period in the previous year. This makes it tight for the bank\u2019s prospects of achieving a wonderful performance at the close of business in December 2021.\n\nGT Holdco\n\nGT Holdco, known as the best bank in service delivery reported profit before tax of N53.7 billion for the first quarter of 2021, ended March 31, representing a 7.8% decline compared to the N58.2billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020. In its half year 2021 results, it reported a profit before tax of N93.1billion, representing a dip of 15.2% compared to N109.7billion recorded in the corresponding period of June 2020.\n\nThe Group also reported profit before tax of \u20a6151.9billion, representing a drop of 9.2% over \u20a6167.4billion recorded in the corresponding period of September 2020.\n\nAccess Bank\n\nAccess Bank, the largest bank by assets solidly grew its Profit Before Tax (PBT) by 30 percent to N60.1 billion, from N46.2 billion recorded in the same period last year, an impressive performance despite the challenging operating environment.\n\nThe bank\u2019s profit before tax saw a significant increase of 31per cent y/y to N97.5billion (H1 2020: N74.3billion).\n\nIn the third quarter ended September 30, 2021, the bank\u2019s Profit before tax grew by 16% to N135bn from N116.623billion in 2020.\n\nFidelity Bank\n\nAs analysts surmise, the foundation for Fidelity\u2019s performance was laid right from the first quarter of 2021 when the bank\u2019s profit before tax (PBT) grew by 53.9 per cent: from N6.6 billion in the corresponding period in 2020 to N10.1 billion in the period under review.\n\nFidelity bank\u2019s PBT in half year 2021 also showed a 72.4 per cent growth when compared to the N12.0 billion recorded in the comparative period of 2020.\n\nAnd now, Fidelity Bank\u2019s 9-months results for the period ended September 30, 2021 results showed double-digit growth in revenues, deposits and profitability.\n\nGross earnings grew by 12.5 percent to N174.4 billion from N155.0 billion in the same period in 2020 while profit before tax (PBT) jumped by 31.4 percent to N28.1 billion from N21.3 billion in the first 9 months of 2020.\n\nFBNH\n\nFBNH\u2019s profit before tax had declined by 34% in the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 to N19bn from N28.680billion in 2020. Similarly, its Profit before tax declined by 9% to N45bn in the second quarter ended June 30, 2021 from N41.415bn in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nFBNH had also notified the regulatory authorities that it may be able to submit its results in October due the ongoing interim auditing of its financial statements for the period ended September 2021.\n\n\u2018\u2019In view of the on-going interim audit, the company is not able to submit results of its operations for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021 until the conclusion of the audit\u2019\u2019, the Holdco said.\n\nUnited Bank for Africa\n\nUBA displayed strength leveraging on modest growth in both interest and non-interest income as well as increased efficiency to deliver a 24 per cent in profit before tax (PBT), which printed at N40.6 billion, compared with N32.7 billion in 2020.\n\nAlso, the pan African financial institution delivered a 33.4 per cent growth in its profit before tax which rose to N76.2 billion as at June 2021, up from the N57.1 billion recorded in the same period of 2020.\n\nAlso in the third quarter ended September 30, 2021, UBA reported a 37 per cent rise in Profit Before Tax to close at N123.4 billion compared to N90.4 billion recorded at the end of the third quarter of 2020, while profit after tax rose significantly by 36 per cent to N104.6 billion up from N77.1 billion recorded a year earlier.\n\nFCMB GROUP\n\nFCMB group\u2019s Profit Before tax (PAT) of \u20a64.227 billion, for the first quarter of 2021, dropped 22.2% from N5.434billion in 2020. Profit before tax declined by -20% to N8.9bn in second quarter from N11.071billion in 2020.\n\nIn the third quarter ended 2021, Profit after tax dropped slightly by less than 1% Y-o-Y to N13.8 billion during the period under review. However, on a quarterly basis, the group recorded a 57% surge in its bottom line to N6.2 billion from N4 billion recorded in Q2 2021.\n\nSTANBIC IBTC GROUP\n\nStanbic IBTC Holdings Plc reported a 50 percent decline in profit before tax from N24.413 billion recorded in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020 to N12.142 billion in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIts audited result and accounts released to the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) also reported 52.9 per cent drop in profit before tax to N24.71billion in H1 2021 from N52.41billion reported in H1 2020.\n\nProfit before tax declined by 41% to N45.3bn in q3 2021 from N76.865billion in 2020.\n\nEcobank Transnational Incorporated\n\nEcobank Transnational Incorporated said its profit before tax rose by 22 per cent to N40.3bn in the first quarter of 2021 from N33bn reported at the same time in 2020.\n\nEcobank Transnational Incorporated Profit before tax grew by 33% to N85bn in Q2 ended June 30,2021 from N64.133billion in 2020.\n\nThe Board and Management of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated also took the decision to audit the 2021 Third Quarter Financial Results of the Ecobank Group. Consequently, the Audited Results will be published in compliance with the provisions of Section 1.1.3 of the Rules for Filling of Accounts and Treatment of Default Filing, Rule Book of The Nigeria Exchange Limited which states that \u201cAn Issuer that chooses, in addition, to audit its quarterly accounts shall file such accounts not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the relevant quarter, and publish it within five (5) business days after the date of filing.\u201d\n\nHaving duly notified the Nigerian Exchange, the Management of ETI wishes to notify the market and general public of its expectation to publish the audited 2021 Third Quarter Financial Results on or before 7 December 2021.\n\nWEMA BANK\n\nWema Bank\u2019s Profit before tax grew by 34% to N1.5bn for the period ended March 30, 2021 from N1.130 billion in 2020.\n\nThe bank also recorded impressive growths across major performance indices in the first half of this year with pre-ta profit rising by 149 per cent to N4.30 billion in six months, from N1.72 billion in 2020.\n\nThe bank announced its unaudited nine-month 2021 financial results, showing an increase of 135.8 per cent in profit before tax (PBT) to close the quarter at N7.2 billion.\n\nWhile these banks\u2019 results are seemingly impressive going by their performances in this year so far, it is particularly notable that Wema Bank, Fidelity Bank, United Bank for Africa, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated and Access Bank performed wonderfully, maintaining double digit profit before tax to stand tall among their peers in the industry, others have not done so well.\n\nThose who were carried away by the initial results of financial institutions which seemed very impressive are beginning to retrace their steps. Business Hallmarks research has, in fact, shown that the results were after all, mixed. While the likes of UBA, Access Bank, Wema Bank, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated and Fidelity Bank among others posted strong performances, others may not be as impressive. A critical observation of the third quarter results of the Deposit Money Bank (DMB) has shown a mixed bag. In an economy which has recorded slide in three successive quarters last in recent years, expectations will be very modest on performance. This harsh condition has been compounded by the devaluation of the Naira, restriction of access to foreign exchange for importers of 41 items and the devastating effect of Covid-19 and its mutating variants which become most troubling with travel restrictions.\n\nAvailable statistics from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) show that while some banks recorded strong improvements from the previous year results, others incurred declines, a development attributable to the unfolding economic realities in country.\n\nManaging Director of HighCap Securities ltd, Mr. David Adonri told Business Hallmark on a telephone interview that the financial year end for banks may not be too impressive.\n\nHe revealed that discerning analysts are not unaware that some of the delinquent facilities they gave to customers before the meltdown are bogging them down.\n\nAdonri who also said that insecurity has crippled banking business in many parts of Nigeria explained that the rate of yield from bonds and treasury bills which the banks have made huge revenues for banks is now very low.\n\n\u2018\u2019Therefore, I don\u2019t see their performance being much better than that of third quarter\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\nSimilarly, a financial analyst, Mr. Olisa Egbunike of the Renaissance group blamed the regulatory policy frame work for the changes the banks\u2019 appear to suffer currently which are likely to drag down profit margins of banks.\n\n\u201cIf nothing is done about these policies which levy 0.5% of banks\u2019 total assets for Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) and the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5% which remove huge money from the banks, their profit margin will continue to decline\u2019\u2019, said Egbunike.\n\n\u2018\u2019This will continue to incapacitate banks\u2019\u2019, he added.\n\nFinancial industry have barely recovered from the 2007/2008 global financial meltdown, also called subprime mortgage crisis, severe contraction of liquidity in global financial markets that originated in the United States as a result of the collapse of the U.S. housing market. This was even to be worsened by the disruptions from Covid-19.\n\nOur advice for shareholders and investors: fasten your seat belts; brace.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s \u2018Strategic Vaccine Roll-Out\u2019 programme aimed at vaccinating at least 50% of eligible Nigerians against the Covid19 plague by January 31, 2022, is currently plagued by human and operational challenges, Business Hallmark can report.\n\nIt would be recalled that Nigeria received the first consignment of about 3.92 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on March 2, 2021 through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Assess Facility (COVAX), with the Federal Government flagging off the vaccination exercise almost immediately.\n\nLess than two week later, the Lagos State government on March 12, flagged-off the first phase of the vaccination exercise in the state, with priority given to front line health workers to first access the 507,00doses it received from the Federal Government.\n\nThe state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, while speaking at the venue of the ceremony, urged residents of the state to disregard rumours and misinformation against the vaccine, describing them as unfounded.\n\n\u201cThe Federal and Lagos State Governments have done due diligence to establish the vaccines efficacy and safety\u201d, the governor had assured.\n\nHowever, checks by BH in many vaccination centres in Lagos show that the exercise is dogged by multiple challenges, including hesitancy displayed by many Nigerians towards the vaccine, unavailability of second doses for recipients of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines who had received the first jabs, payment of a \u2018token\u2019 by recipients to buy air time to help upload their data into the Primary Health Care Development Agency\u2019s (NPHCDA) portal and claims of non-payment of health workers allowances engaged for the exercise despite the availability of vaccines and billions of dollars spent by the government on the exercise.\n\nOne of the challenges observed by our correspondent during the visits, is the nonchalance of many Nigerians to the vaccinne. Their negative attitudes to the vaccine, it was learnt, is born out of rumours and misinformation against the vaccine by anti-vaccine crusaders who poisoned the minds of millions against it, as well as the low casualty figures recorded so far in the country which make many Nigerians not to take the disease seriously.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind them (government). They just want to make money from it. Please, can you tell me how many people have died from the virus.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, I have not seen anyone killed by the disease. It is just \u2018Ako Iba\u2019 (chronic fever) and nothing more\u201d, declared Mrs. Sarah Abaniwonda, a trader at the Jankara Market in the Ijaiye-Ojokoro area of the state.\n\nApart from not taking the disease and the vaccination exercise seriously, many Nigerians are also of the views that the vaccines were made by some \u2018forces of darkness\u2019, led by Microsoft\u2019s founder, Bill Gates and former American president, Barack Obama gunning for the \u2018New Order\u2019.\n\n\u201cA real Christian should not take the jab\u201d, said Prophet Samson Ademola, a pastor with the Christ Apostolic Church (Mountain of Deliverance) in Agege.\n\n\u201cIt is the sign of the beast as foretold in the Book of Revelation. The intention of those behind it is to control the world by implanting a chip in the body that will enable them to control people from a centralized computer system manned by the devil himself.\n\n\u201cAlready, you can\u2019t do anything again without getting the vaccine. To travel abroad, enter public/ government offices, attend social events, you need to get the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThey are even contemplating making it compulsory in churches. Can you believe that? God will not allow them. He will destroy their evil machinations like he did with theTower of Babel\u201d, the cleric decreed.\n\nAvailable data obtained by BH shows that in the last three weeks, the nation averaged about 150,407 doses administered daily.\n\nAs at December 8, atleast11,193,780 doses of Covid19 vaccines have been administered in the country. According to the NPHCDA, while 6.6 million Nigerians had taken the first dose, only 3.5 million had been fully vaccinated against the virus.\n\nThis means that just over 1.75% of the country\u2019s estimated 200 million-population has been fully vaccinated.\n\nIf the trend continues, it will take268 days (a full year) to administer enough doses for another 10% of the population, making the FG\u2019s 50% vaccination target by January 2022 a dream.\n\nLamenting the low vaccination rate, the Executive Director of NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, said Nigeria needed to push vaccination rate to about 70 percent of the nation\u2019s population to reach herd immunity against the virus.\n\n\u201c6.6 million Nigerians have taken the first dose. Another 3.5 million of the figure have taken the second dose. We are targeting 70 percent because the current numberi slow.\n\n\u201cThe risk this poses to the nation is that it would give a chance formutation of the virus.The virus mutates in an environment where herd immunity is low.\u201d\n\nApart from the apathy displayed by many Nigerians towards the vacination exercise, another challenge haunting it is the non-availability of vaccines for those already given appointments for second doses.\n\nOur correspondent observed during his visits to some centres in Lagos that many Lagosians coming for the second dose of the vaccine were told to come back later.\n\nParticularly affected are those who came for the second jab of the Oxford-Astrazeneca vacine.\n\n\u201cThis is my fifth time here without success. I took the first jab on July 29 and was given August 29 appointment to come back for the second jab.\n\n\u201cWhen I went bank on the appointed day, i was told that AstraZeneca vaccine is not available and that I should come back later. When I protested that I must be given from the one being given to people I met on ground, I was told that I can\u2019t receive is as those I met were receiving Moderna.\n\n\u201cSince the two vaccines can\u2019t go together, I was advised to come back again after one of the officials asked me to drop my number so that they can call me when my brand is available.\n\n\u201cAfter waiting endlessly without getting a call as promised, I visited again on September 29, two months after the first jab. Yet again I received the same news. \u2018No AstraZeneca vaccine on ground\u2019.\n\n\u201cI have been coming here every month since August to no avail. This is my fifth time here after receiving my first jab in July. And they are still telling me that I should come back. I don\u2019t know what to do know\u2019, a federal civil servant with the Ministry of Works and Housing, Mr. Chude Echezonanna lamented.\n\nAn official of the Isokan Health Centre in Ijaiye-Ojokoro owned by the Lagos State government, who did not want her identity revealed, told BH that what they are currently administering is the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t mince words with you. We are out of stock for some vaccines, particularly the AstraZeneca brand. The brand represents over 70% of what the nation got to be administered to it citizens. So, you will understand the present dilemma we are in.\n\n\u201cWe first started with AstraZeneca in March. And millions of Nigerians received the vaccines. And we didn\u2019t receive another supply until August ending. Unfortunately, the supply was low and if couldn\u2019t go round during the second phase of the AstraZeneca exercise between August 30 to September 24.\n\n\u201cThough, we asked people to come back a month later, the first comes were the lucky ones. The vaccines didn\u2019t go round as we soon ran out of stock. Since then, we have been waiting for another set of supply.\n\n\u201cWhat we have in stock now is Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. People should not panic. I advise them to exercise patient as they would be informed the moment the vaccine is available\u201d the health worker assured.\n\nAnother irregularity observed during a tour of some selected vaccination centres, is the payment of \u2018data token\u2019 by Lagosians to aid their vaccination process.\n\nMany Lagosian who spoke with our correspondent disclosed that they paid between N200 and N5,000 in order to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI have to give the guy handling the device N5,000 to purchase the data he will need to impute our information when I found that he had non to work with.\n\n\u201cI was not forced or mandated to give, but I gave out of my own free will. We should praise and encourage Nigerians health workers at the forefront of the vaccination exercise.\n\n\u201cThey are not well equipped or mobilized to do the job. Despite that, they are doing their possible best. The government should do the needful by providing the infrastructure needed for the success of the exercise. It is not enough just providing the vaccines without the logistics to make it go round\u201d, a community leader in the Ojokoro area of Lagos told BH at the Ojokoro Health Centre located at Ahmadiya.\n\nAn ad-hoc staff employed by the state government to upload people\u2019s data to the NPHCDA portal, confided in our correspondent that he and his colleagues had only been given money for data twice since they were recruited in March.\n\n\u201cWe are always told to go on working, that our allowances for data will be paid. Even the two times we received it, it was war. We have to resort to appealing to kind hearted Nigerians to bail us out with whatever they can spare. While some help out, most people abuse us.\n\n\u201cMy stipends have only been paid three times. They (government) is owing us outstanding of five months. We had planned to embark on strike on December 7, but we shelved it after some concerned stakeholders intervened.",

          "text": "FORMER interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bisi Akande, has alleged that the government of former President Olusegun Obasanjo was reluctant to find the killers of Bola Ige.\n\nAkande added that after Ige\u2019s murder, a copy of the former minister\u2019s letter of resignation from Obasanjo\u2019s government was found in his bedroom, in Abuja.\n\nIge, former Attorney-General of the Federation during Obasanjo\u2019s tenure, was killed on December 23, 2001.\n\nIn his autobiography, \u2018My Participations\u2019, unveiled on Thursday, Akande said some people in Obasanjo\u2019s government decided to deal with Ige because of the late minister\u2019s popularity.\n\nThe former governor of Osun state wrote: \u201cI believe what brought problem for Uncle Bola was his charisma, his relentless pursuit of the common good and his magical popularity with the Yoruba people. I knew he might be in trouble the day I witnessed what the PDP leadership later dubbed \u2018The Shame\u2019 at the Liberty Stadium.\n\n\u201cI believe it was after that outing that some elements close to the president met and decided to deal with Bola Ige. The next time Obasanjo would enter that stadium was to participate in the burial ceremonies of Ige.\n\n\u201cThere was enough evidence that the government of former president Obasanjo was reluctant to find the killers of Bola Ige.\n\n\u201cThe man, who came hunting for us was President Olusegun Obasanjo, Ige\u2019s friend for many years who became our relentless foe.\n\n\u201cHe and Ige met in the late 1960s when both of them served in the government of then Colonel Adeyinka Adebayo, the second military ruler of the old West. Since then, Obasanjo had dug Ige\u2019s path like an evil spirit. During his reign as military head of state, Ige gave him a wide berth, yet Obasanjo would not disappear from Ige\u2019s path.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll respond to your allegations in due time, Falae tells ex-gov\n\nMeanwhile, former Secretary to the Government of Federation, SGF, Olu Falae, weekend, promised to react to the allegations against him by Akande.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, has vowed to expose the former governor\u2019s lies on restructuring.\n\nVanguard gathered that the group would expose the lies of the national leader of the APC for denying that the party didn\u2019t have it in its manifesto for the 2015 election.\n\nAkande, in his autobiography, took a swipe at some Yoruba leaders, including Falae and Afenifere Leader, Ayo Adebanjo.\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard in Akure, Falae\u2019s Personal Assistant, Moshood Raji said: \u201cChief Falae will react appropriately to all what Chief Akande said about him at the appropriate time.\n\n\u201cChief will not rush to reply the former governor but will respond after reading the book. We will respond at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nOn Adebanjo, Akande wrote, among other allegations that the Yoruba leader \u201cbelieved, even in their old age, that they were the only people who could have gone to the 2014 National Conference. Sir Ajayi, who was close to 90 at the time of the conference, has since joined his ancestors. Adebanjo celebrated his 90th birthday in 2018. Falae is in his 80s. Note that Jonathan paid the conference delegates generous allowances.\n\n\u201cOlu Falae, a trained civil servant, who, after retirement became decorated into leadership by his former military bosses, has since been trying to blindly straddle Nigeria\u2019s complicated politics.\u201d Vanguard\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The story some sections of the media are deliberately misquoting to give a picture \u201cthat the brother of the person supporting the bandits has also been kidnapped\u201d is mischievous, misleading and diversionary.\n\n\u201cIt is actually from the content of an interview recently granted to some members of the press where Sheikh Gumi was saying he is surprised that some elements thinks he is unnecessarily supportive of the bandits, telling them that he is equally a victim of their terror as they have kidnapped his own biological brother about three years ago and that the security agents could not do anything which left them with the option of paying ransom before he was released. A driver of his father was also killed by the same bandits.\n\n\u201cFor Gumi, all this is not enough reason to say he will not seek for peaceful resolution of the crisis for the purpose of preserving peoples lives and properties especially if we look back at government\u2019s failure to address issues that will help in bringing last solution. Military power alone or declaring the bandits as terrorists cannot end banditry and killings in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay Allah forbid, in today\u2019s Nigeria where government has failed to address the root cause of the armed Fulani banditry and the security imbroglio particularly in the North West and to explore mediation like the Americans finally adopted after over two decades of failed military offensive in Afghanistan, people or the press should not be surprised if Gumi himself is abducted not to talk of his brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the said story as we mentioned is not true and we pray it will never happen not only to Gumi\u2019s brother but innocent Nigerians as a whole.\u201d",

Today\u2019s realities remind us of the need to continue to forge stronger solidarity in order to address the new challenges, including the current third wave of the pandemic and its new Omicron variant.\n\n\u201cI am glad that the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the West Africa Health Organisation (WAHO) are continuing to work with our respective National Disease Control Centres to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on our people and sub-region,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari commended Ghanaian President Nana Addo Dankwa Akuffo-Addo who is also the Chair of Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government for the purposeful leadership, commitment, and energy he continues to exert to resolve the challenges confronting the organization.\n\n\u201cDespite the enormity of these challenges, our Chair has navigated us well and continues to do so. We owe him enormous gratitude,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President noted that challenges of COVID-19 and the catastrophic consequences hoisted on the socio-economic environment had continued, adding that the regional resilience, determination, and resolution of working together, in solidarity with each other, assisted greatly to lessen the burdens of the Pandemic.\n\n\u201cExcellencies and dear colleagues, without doubt, the occasion for which we have gathered here today, is a clear demonstration of our resolute commitment to the effective integration of our sub-region.\n\n\u201cAs a people, we aspire to create a borderless, peaceful, prosperous and cohesive region, built on good governance and where people have the capacity to access and harness its resources through the creation of opportunities for sustainable development, job creation, and environmental preservation,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the President: \u201cFurthermore, threats are looming around, environmental degradation and climate change on our farming system.

          "title": "Tinubu Was Never Promised Running Mate Position, Buhari\u2019s Boys Fire Back at Ex-Party Chair Akande \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "The last may not have been heard of some of the revelations in the newly published autobiography by a former governor of Osun State and erstwhile protem national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, who claimed in his book, \u201cMy Participations\u201d, that President Muhammadu Buhari, reneged in his promise to make a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, his running mate ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\nBut many of Buhari\u2019s close allies and foot soldiers, who were privy to some of the negotiations and horse-trading that preceded the 2015 elections, dismissed the account by Akande as being twisted and far from the truth, because according to them, \u201cBuhari truly and only promised Tinubu a workable partnership, which included conceding the vice presidential slot to the South-west as a bloc, not to exactly make him his running mate.\u201d\n\nA lot of the Buhari boys, on Sunday, called THISDAY with respect to its lead story last Friday, titled: \u2018Akande: Buhari Promised to Pick Tinubu as Running Mate in 2015, Then Reneged,\u2019 which was an extract from Akande\u2019s autobiography, saying they were dismayed over the report and strongly disagreed with the author\u2019s account of events.\n\nAccording to them, all that Buhari said was that he was going to partner and work with Tinubu, in the context of a partnership between the South-west and North-west, reiterating that the president never promised Tinubu vice president or running mate, contrary to claims by Akande in the book.\n\nThis, the sources, who often glibly referred to themselves as Buhari\u2019s boys, added was because they recognised \u201cthe role Tinubu played in helping them and the role of the South-west for voting en bloc during the convention that produced Buhari, which was pivotal and he presented the vice presidential slot in the partnership.\n\n\u201cAnd, in all of this, what Akande did not disclose was that Buhari sent a delegation of Farouk Ahmed, Hadi Sirika and Sarki Abba, to meet Tinubu and explained to him that the Muslim-Muslim ticket would not work, but that they would be partners to work together.\u201d\n\nThe Buhari boys, have however, concluded that the former Osun governor appeared to have taken up the task of \u201ca political bull, trying to force Buhari\u2019s hands to support Tinubu in 2023. But that, we will not accept, even though no one is opposed to his aspiration.\u201d\n\nThey maintained that Chief Akande\u2019s account was deliberately slanted, to not only make Tinubu look good and weep up sentiment for him, but also send the president on a guilt trip and compel him to side with the former Lagos governor, who has shown keen interest, albeit clandestinely, in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIn the THISDAY lead report of Friday, which detailed how Akande, in his autobiography, published by Gaskia Media Limited, disclosed that Buhari, apparently under pressure from certain interests and forces, dropped Tinubu from running with him on the party\u2019s ticket, concluded that the then candidate of APC reneged on the agreement they had even after the merger had been sealed.\n\nIn the book, launched in Lagos, Akande, who also took a swipe at some Yoruba leaders including former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Chief Olu Falae and Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, claimed that despite the pledge to make Tinubu his running mate, Buhari later faltered, saying he only wanted the former Lagos governor to \u201cpartner withhim.\u201d\n\nHis account stated thus: \u201cIn April 2014, I was in Abuja when Buhari called me and asked me to persuade Bola to run with him. Governor Masari was the one who came to call me. When I followed him into Buhari\u2019s private lobby, Bola Tinubu was already seated there.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket? I thought such information, if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate. I thanked Buhari for thinking so highly of our friend.\n\n\u201cBola later told me that Buhari\u2019s emissaries had been coming to him, but he tried to dodge the gesture and not to show interest. We agreed that we would reopen the matter, when Buhari had secured the ticket,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe, however, expressed surprise that, when Buhari became the party\u2019s candidate, things changed, with former APC chair, Odigie Oyegun, who was supported by Tinubu to become chairman of the party, asking for names from the geopolitical zones from where Buhari would pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cHe said it was from this list that Buhari would choose a running mate. I objected. I turned to Buhari. \u2018General, where are you choosing your running mate from?\u2019 He answered, \u2018The South-west.\u2019 \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t know,\u2019 Oyegun said. He apologised. I didn\u2019t know why Oyegun made that proposition and at whose behest. As the chairman of the party, maybe some people pushed him to do that.\n\n\u201cThen, I called Buhari aside. \u2018Is our arrangement still standing?\u2019 I referred him to our discussion in April. He said yes!\u201d\n\nAkande further said some members of the party eventually agreed that a committee should be set up to search for Buhari\u2019s running mate, a move himself and former governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiohmhole, opposed.\n\n\u201cAdams Oshiohmhole, then Governor of Edo State, stood up and said we were being dishonest. He said he was a serving governor and many of those in the Elders Committee had been governors.\n\n\u201cDid we set up a committee to give us our running mates?\u2019 He asked. \u2018It is not fair!\u2019 He further said what we were pushing was a dangerous act and that we should allow Buhari to choose his running mate. So, we left,\u201d he narrated\n\nAkande stated that he later came to know later that some people constituted themselves into a group, called the Northern Interest Group, and they prevailed on Buhari not to allow a Muslim-Muslim ticket, and that it was the following day after the Elders\u2019 Committee meeting, which was deadlocked, that Buhari phoned Tinubu to give him three names from which he would pick a running mate.\n\n\u201cWe were all in Abuja and Tinubu rushed to me with this information. He wanted to know whether the understanding we reached with Buhari had changed. I called Buhari and he told me he now needed three names from us. I was angry with him.\n\n\u201cGeneral, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the north, including those who were Muslims. I told him the slot belonged to the South-West and among the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership.\n\n\u201cOshiomhole was surprised about the narration. \u2018If indeed you promised to make Asiwaju your running mate, it would not be fair to renege,\u2019 he said. Buhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him.\u201d\n\nThe former Osun governor explained that he didn\u2019t know what that meant because before they discussed the issue of Tinubu as the partner or vice-president\u2019s ticket, a merger had been accomplished and they had already partnered.\n\n\u201cWe were registered in July 2013, and he called me to prevail on Tinubu to be his running mate in April 2014. Buhari knew I was upset but we tried to manage the situation. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by all those pressures. We decided to let him go,\u201d Akande said.\n\nObinna Chima",

          "text": "The Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has expressed concern over the delay by President Muhammadu Buhari in assenting to the 2021 Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted to him by the National Assembly last month.\n\nThis is just as civil society organisations (CSOs) have written formally to the president urging him to assent to the Electoral Biil as his birthday gift on December 17, when he will be a year older.\n\nAlso, representative of the Center for Socio-Legal Studies (CSLS) and expert in Electoral Law and Justice, Dr. Akin Oluwadayisi, have said Buhari signing the bill into law, would not only make history but would have succeeded in enthroning himself as the \u201cfather of true internal democracy.\u201d\n\nThe deadline for the president to sign the bill into law or risk an override by the National Assembly expires this week.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PANDEF, Ken Robinson, told THISDAY on Sunday that PANDEEF as a responsible organisation stands for anything that would improve the nation\u2019s electoral process.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe want free, fair and credible elections in the country, 2023 and beyond. Where the votes of citizens would truly decide who gets elected at any level in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cAnyone, who for whatever reason, solicits the President not to sign the Bill is doing a great disservice to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPANDEF, therefore, calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to jettison partisan considerations and assent to the bill without further delay, to strengthen the nation\u2019s democracy\u201d.\n\nOn their part, CSOs under the aegis of the Civil Society Partners on Electoral Reform (CiSPER) and other concerned groups have written to President Buhari, urging him to invite representatives of youths, women, People Living with Disabilities and CSOs as well to the signing ceremony of Electoral Bill on his birthday.\n\nThe CSOs in the letter entitled \u201cElectoral Bill: Invite Representatives of Youths, Women, PLWD and CSOs to the Signing Ceremony,\u201d dated 11th December, 2021, expressed optimism that Buhari would sign the Electoral Amendment bill into law as he celebrates on his birthday.\n\nThe organisations stated that they were encouraged by Buhari\u2019s statement at the virtual summit on democracy organised by President Joe Biden of the United States that he would ensure elections are conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner.\n\nThey also said the invitation to grace the electoral bill signing ceremony would go a long way in assuring Nigerians and the International community of his commitment to inclusive participation in our democratic process.\n\nAccording to the CSOs, a new Electoral Act would help to put in place necessary legal framework to build back better democratic institutions and sustainable democratic values.\n\nThe letter read in part, \u201cAs the clock ticks, we are increasingly assured that you will side with the people and act in the overriding public interest to give your assent to the electoral bill as a legacy for deepening electoral reforms and strengthening our democracy.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know, Mr. President, that the Biden administration is already facing some criticism for its guest list for the virtual summit, and Nigeria is fingered as one of the \u2018nations with spotty records on democracy, the rule of law and human rights,\u2019 as reported the CNN and other global media.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that you used the occasion to state unequivocally that democratic rule in the West African sub-region \u201cis currently being threatened by undemocratic takeover of government by the military.\u201d\n\nThe CSLS\u2019 position was contained in a press statement dated December 12, 2021 and made available to journalists.\n\n\u201cThe current Electoral Amendment Bill before the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for assent demands immediate and urgent assent in the interest of the electorates and entrenchment of parties\u2019 internal democracy.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, Section 14(2) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) declares that sovereignty belongs to the people of Nigeria from whom government itself derives all its powers and authority. And it is through the direct participation in political parties\u2019 primaries that the participation by the people in their governments shall be ensured.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries deny them this right of grassroot participation\u201d, the statement read in part.\n\nThe law expert who remarked that political parties over the years had failed to allow direct election of delegates when primaries are conducted, argued that if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was given the powers to supervise the process, it would not only ensure credibility but also build confidence of the people in the future general elections that will be conducted.\n\n\u201cMr. President\u2019s will also be breaking the jinx governorship godfatherism and perhaps, father true internal democracy from political party level if he assents to the Bill.\n\n\u201cThe governors of states in Nigeria have been tested with the required true democratic involvement of local governments but failed through selfish interest, dominating control and financial manipulation of the local government authority,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, allowing indirect primaries into the legislative bodies is to further empower the governors to play the role of gods in determining the future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy, good governance and sacrifice direct participation of the electorates\u2019 desires.\n\nOluwadayisi stressed that the bill would benefit the political parties, especially the ruling party more in that when the party members are given the freedom to choose active and responsive legislators, their performances and delivery will go a long way to promote the party\u2019s image and collective interest of the people who have chosen them.\n\nHe noted further that major countries of the world including the United States where Nigeria borrowed the presidential system of government no longer practice indirect form of primaries for selection of candidates as voters can directly vote and determine the top candidates who will advance to the general election.\n\n\u201cThe presidential assent to the bill is the adoption of the ideal form of democratic practice now being practice by developed nations of the world that the nation emulates,\u201d he added.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Alex Enumah, Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria Calls on Western Allies to Declare Bandits, Boko Haram, IPOB as Terrorists",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Sunday said that it was continuing to put pressure on its western allies to \u201cproscribe\u201d bandits, Boko Haram and the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as terrorists.\n\nThe government said that doing so would severely reduce the funding for the groups, noting that it was doing all within its powers to ensure that a stop is put to the killings throughout the country.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, made the assertion yesterday in reaction to an editorial by Daily Trust newspaper titled: \u201cLife Has Lost Its Value Under Buhari\u2019s Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile the federal government had earlier designated both Boko Haram and IPOB as terrorist organisations, last month, it finally got a Federal High Court in Abuja presided over by Justice Taiwo Taiwo to add bandits to the list.\n\nThe presidential spokesman stated that aside proscribing the three groups, its friends in the West should partner Nigeria in areas of trade and investment to deplete the reservoir of unemployed Nigerians where the various violent groups recruit their members from.\n\nAccording to the presidency, the economic instability that the Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked has further proven an effective recruitment tool for bandits and terrorists across the nation in particular and the African continent as a whole.\n\n\u201cEven as the West continues to extricate itself from Africa militarily, we are lobbying our Western allies aggressively for partnership, investment and support in other areas, such as proscribing Boko Haram, bandits and IPOB as terrorist groups.This would severely dent their funding\n\n\u201c(We are asking) them for investment in trade and infrastructure, to help lessen economic instability; and to help with technical assistance, advanced weaponry, intelligence and ordinance,\u201d the presidency stressed.\n\nShehu explained that although this will likely be small comfort to the families and loved ones of those already lost, ridding the country of avoidable deaths is a battle the federal government is fighting without let up.\n\nStating that the growing instability and violence in the north of Nigeria and elsewhere were unacceptable, the federal government pointed out that no one, not least the presidency underestimates the seriousness of the situation.\n\n\u201cEvery day, the president holds the victims and their families in his thoughts and prayers. Above all, he wishes to reassure them \u2013 and all Nigerians \u2013 that tackling the scourge of banditry and terrorism remains this government\u2019s first priority,\u201d the government added.\n\nHowever, Shehu argued that in respect of violence and terrorism, Nigeria is not unique, arguing that violence and terror have risen steadily across the entire African continent over the last decade.\n\nHe maintained that the \u201cEconomist magazine\u201d in a recent publication wrote about \u201cThe Next Afghanistan,\u201d warning the global community of the horrifying security in its neighbourhood, citing specifically the states of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\nNoting that the presidency understood the frustrations of the newspaper and Nigeria\u2019s northern communities about the ongoing challenges of security, Shehu noted that the Buhari administration is no less worried by the situation.\n\nThe Buhari government argued that it is only fair to say that Nigeria\u2019s persistent and continued efforts to suppress the instability have seen results, with terror group Boko Haram, among others \u201creduced to a shell of its former self\u201d\n\n\u201cYet now we Nigerians face a new threat: the worst global health crisis in living memory. Even Nigeria that proudly holds the mantle of Africa\u2019s largest economy is not immune from the debilitating economic impact of COVID-19.\n\n\u201c The economic instability that the pandemic has wreaked has proven an effective recruitment tool for bandits and terrorists across the continent.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the Daily Trust has correctly identified the source of the violence as \u2018an amalgam of many complex issues\u2019 such as poverty and unemployment. It is equally right to note that, in tackling the violence, \u2018force alone will not be enough.\n\n\u201cIt is quite wrong, however, to suggest the problem of insecurity is intractable, and more wrong still to claim apathy on the part of the government,\u201d the presidency argued.\n\nContinuing on what the federal government was doing to ameliorate the situation, Shehu stated that the Nigerian military efforts have not let up, but admitted that it is true that in the face of today\u2019s growing number of threats from Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers and IPOB to run of the mill bandits, the forces were stretched increasingly thin.\n\n\u201cSecond, alongside military force, this government is seeking to address the violence at its economic source. Massive infrastructure projects like the coastal rail and new train from the southern coast through the north-east to our neighbour Niger aim to expand employment and opportunity across the country, bringing hope to our more remote and poorer regions where bandits and terrorists thrive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe spokesman maintained that the Daily Trust\u2019s suggestion that the president exchanges violence for the support he got electorally was \u201cbeneath a publication that claims any kind of political neutrality or integrity.\u201d\n\nAccording to the presidency, the focus as Nigerians must be on coming together and ending the violence pervading the country.\n\n\u201cAs President Buhari wrote recently of the terrorists in UK paper \u2018The Financial Times\u2019: \u201cWe will defeat them, one highway, one rail link \u2013 and one job \u2013 at a time,\u201d the statement added.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "There are indications that the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has tentatively settled for Saturday, February 19, 2022, as the date for its national convention.\n\nA competent party source hinted at this development at the weekend, saying although the date has not been communicated to other party members and stakeholders, it was however agreed to at the highest level of the party to hold the national convention on February 19, 2022.\n\nThe party leadership, THISDAY gathered last night, has also resolved, albeit with the consent of President Muhammadu Buhari, to zone the national chairmanship of the party to the north, while the national secretary has been moved to the south.\n\nAlso, in what seemed like borrowing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) template, the APC leadership has also agreed to swap positions of the sacked Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee of the party between the North and the South.\n\nThis, notwithstanding, the party leadership has remained silent on the presidential ticket, because according to sources, it was not yet a prerogative of the party.\n\nIn the same breath, some eleven national chairmanship aspirants of the APC have agreed to meet this Thursday, December 16, to brainstorm on how to move the APC forward ahead of the national convention.\n\nHowever, on the choice of February 19 as the party\u2019s best bet for the convention, THISDAY source hinted that since the primary election for the Ekiti State governorship election might likely be held around January 22, the party did not want the aftermath of the exercise to drag into the convention activities.\n\nIn other words, depending on the possible controversy that might trail the Ekiti governorship primary, especially, if there was a need for a rerun, the February 19 remained tentative as it could go a week before or after, technically.\n\nBesides, since the original four-year-term of the sacked Oshiomhole NWC was meant to end in February, the date therefore fits the party\u2019s calendar for the national convention to elect new NWC members.\n\nConsequently, the president was said to have approved the zoning of the chairmanship to the north, while the national secretary of the party has been zoned to the south.\n\nBut the party leadership has deliberately avoided the presidential arrangement within the party or whether or not the party zoning arrangement would inform the zoning of the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nIn a related development, the chairman of the Annual Public Lecture Summit of the APC Press Corps, Mr. Babatunde Ayeni, has said the event slated for 16th December, 2021, would be chaired by the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nAyeni, in a statement issued yesterday said, the annual public lecture with the theme: \u201cTowards Ensuring Enduring Democracy\u201d, was a platform designed by the APC Press Corps to contribute to the intellectual development of the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nAyeni noted that a chieftain of the party and the Director General of the Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr. Osita Okechukwu, would deliver a keynote address titled: \u201cAPC Beyond 2023: The Tasks Ahead \u2013 The Role of Stakeholders.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe summit aims at providing workable templates for good governance and serves as a medium for deepening democratic norms and institutions by engaging key players in politics, public administration, academia, and economy.\u201d\n\nAyeni noted that reports and recommendations from the lecture would be made available to the party and interested members of the public, adding also that the summit was designed to avail all the national chairmanship aspirants the opportunity to share their views, present their plans and programmes on how to move the party forward.\n\nThe eleven chairmanship aspirants includeed former Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Mr. Saliu Mustapha; former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Tanko Almakura; former governor of Borno State, Senator Alimodu Sheriff; the lawmaker representing Niger East in the Senate, Senator Mohammed Musa;former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari and former governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda.\n\nOthers are the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; former Borno State governor, Senator Kashim Shettima; former governor of Gombe State, Senator Danjuma Goje, Mr. Sunny Moniedafe, and Mohammed Etsu.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

He has delegated all responsibilities to Deputy President David Mabuza for the next week.\n\nRamaphosa, 69, is fully vaccinated. The statement didn\u2019t say whether he had been infected with the omicron coronavirus variant.\n\nLast week, Ramaphosa visited four West African countries. He and all members of his delegation were tested for COVID-19 in each of the countries during the trip. Some in the delegation tested positive in Nigeria and returned directly to South Africa. Throughout the rest of the trip, Ramaphosa and his delegation tested negative. Ramaphosa returned from Senegal on Dec. 8\n\nRamaphosa said his own infection serves as a caution to all people in South Africa to be vaccinated and remain vigilant against exposure, the statement said. Vaccination remains the best protection against severe illness and hospitalization, it said.\n\nPeople in South Africa who have had contact with Ramaphosa on Sunday are advised to watch for symptoms or to have themselves tested, it said.\n\nSouth Africa is currently battling a rapid resurgence driven by the omicron variant, health officials say.\n\nThe country recorded more than 18,000 new confirmed cases Sunday night. More than 70% of the cases are estimated to be from omicron, according to genetic sequencing surveys.\n\nAfter a period of low transmission of about 200 new cases per day in early November, South Africa COVID-19 cases began rising dramatically. On Nov. 25, scientists in southern Africa confirmed the omicron variant, which has more than 50 mutations. Omicron appears to be highly transmissible and has quickly become dominant in the country. So far, the majority of cases have been relatively mild and the percentage of severe cases needing oxygen have been low, say doctors.",
