          "text": "By Ibrahim Hassan \u2013 Kaduna\n\nSave the Children International has said that Child Marriage Kills more than 60 Girls a day, the organisation\u2019s Global Girlhood Report revealed on the International Day of the Girl.\n\nIt said an estimated 44% of girls in Nigeria are married before their 18th birthday, one of the highest rate of child marriage globally.\n\nAccording to a release from Kunle Olawoyin, Media and Communication Manager, Save the Children, \u201crates are not likely to decrease today as Nigerian girls are living in one of the most difficult times.\n\n\u201cAs a result of armed conflict, humanitarian crisis, kidnapping, natural disaster, displacement, COVID-19 pandemic and economic recession, the lives of millions of girls are threatened to be pushed into the basket of deprivation, including reduced access to education, nutrition, lack of protection and lack of access to basic social services, the State of Nigerian Girls Report showed.\u201d\n\nMore than an estimated 22,000 girls a year are dying from pregnancy and childbirth resulting from child marriage, new analysis from Save the Children released on International Day of the Girl revealed.\n\n\u201cWith the highest rate of child marriage in the world, West and Central Africa accounts for nearly half (9,600) of all estimated child marriage-related deaths globally, or 26 deaths a day. The regional teenage maternal mortality rate is four times higher than anywhere else in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cSouth Asia sees 2,000 child marriage-related deaths every year (or six every day), followed by East Asia and the Pacific with 650 deaths (or two every day), and Latin American and the Caribbean, with 560 annual deaths (or nearly two a day).\u201d\n\nALSO READ: ENDSARS: We\u2019ll use legitimate means within constitutional powers to suppress planned protest \u2013 CP Odumosu\n\n\u201cAlthough nearly 80 million child marriages globally have been prevented in the last 25 years, progress had stalled even before the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which has only worsened inequalities that drive child marriage.\n\n\u201cWith school closures, health services under strain or closed, and more families being pushed into poverty, women and girls face an increased risk of violence during lengthy lockdowns.\n\n\u201cA further 10 million girls are now expected to marry by 2030,[i] leaving more girls at risk of dying.\u201d\n\nInger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International, said: \u201cChild marriage is one of the worst and deadliest forms of sexual and gender-based violence against girls. Every year, millions are forced into wedlock with men who are often much older, robbing them of an opportunity to keep learning, be children, and in many cases, to survive.\n\n\u201cChildbirth is the number one killer of teenaged girls because their young bodies aren\u2019t ready to bear children.\n\n\u201cThe health risks of children having children cannot, and must not, be ignored. Governments must prioritise girls and ensure they\u2019re protected from child marriage and premature childbirth-related deaths.\n\n\u201cThis can only happen if girls have a say in the decisions that affect them.\u201d\n\nThe organisation noted that gender inequality continues to fuel child marriage, as revealed in a national report from Save the Children in Nigeria, The State of Nigerian Girls: An incisive diagnosis of child, early and forced marriage in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a survey carried out by the organisation, the belief that children born to young mothers are healthier and smarter is widespread among many communities. There\u2019s also a common perception that younger girls \u201crefresh\u201d older men with their \u201cyounger blood\u201d.\n\n\u201cEven in countries where child marriage is illegal, exceptions are common and the practice is still widespread, including in Burkina Faso\u2014which has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world.\u201d\n\nIn a global report released by Save the Children, Global Girlhood Report 2021: Girls\u2019 rights in crisis, the organisation called on governments to \u201craise girls\u2019 voices by supporting their right to safe and meaningful participation in all public decision-making.\n\n\u201cTo ddress immediate and ongoing risks of gender-based violence, including child marriage, by putting girls\u2019 rights and gender equality at the centre of COVID-19 and humanitarian responses, development policy, and wider efforts to build forward better.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo guarantee the rights of all girls, including those impacted by different forms of inequality and discrimination (including on the basis of gender, race, disability, economic background, etc.), by developing inclusive policies and programmes. Safe and ethical data collection must also be improved to better understand and respond in real time to COVID-19\u2019s impact on existing economic, climate and conflict-related crises.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also called on governments to ensure the safe and unrestricted participation of female humanitarian staff in all humanitarian response efforts, including needs assessments, and the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of all humanitarian services at every level.\n\nAlso, to join the Generation Equality movement, working to deliver on the Global Acceleration Plan for Gender Equality, which set a target to prevent nine million child marriages in five years.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Prisca Sam-Duru\n\nObviously, Imabong Martins wrote her book, \u201cTaking Care Of Me\u201d, while putting into cognizance, the severity of the times we are in now.\n\nGone are the days when women were housewives. As the world evolves and countries face daunting challenges especially those regarding the economy, most women find themselves becoming more hustlers than men; to keep the home front alive.\n\nHere in Nigeria, the bad economy is stinging harder by the day, forcing women into living a stressed-filled life; with many becoming depressed.\n\n\u201cTaking Care of Me: Because My World Needs Me Happy And Strong\u201d, is written and published in 2020 by speaker, writer and personal development coach, Imabong Martins.\n\nThe simple and life-changing material, documents stimulating topics designed to prevent women from breaking down while juggling between multiple roles. The 69-page book with five chapters, is a refreshingly handy companion for wives and mums who are often struggling to strike a balance between career, taking care of the home and, staying sane and happy.\n\nThe book helps readers nurture themselves while multi-tasking, hence, its relevance in today\u2019s world of women.\n\nEmbedded with a total of forty nuggets, carefully crafted by the author and arranged into daily, weekly, monthly, and annual action steps, \u201cTaking Care of Me\u201d, empowers women \u201cto make solid strides towards personal improvement decisions\u201d.\n\nAs part of the prescriptions to stay healthy, the author on page 33, advises that since unpleasant things happen, women should choose to focus their thoughts on the positive and the nice things. \u201cYour thoughts colour your world, so why not colour it with great stuff that make you happy? What we think about, influences who we become\u201d.\n\nThe women development consultant is known for her result-oriented homemaking solutions, further advises her readers to \u2018take a full day or half a day off a week of hard work, adding, \u201cyou will be amazed to discover how many ailments are linked to stress\u201d.\n\nImabong also emphasizes the importance of nutrition which she says, is basic to well being.\n\nAnother important issue covered in the book is the need to avoid negativism by all means possible. According to the author, negativity hurts as it is a confirmed predecessor to anxiety and stress.\n\nIn chapter four, the author examines the relationship between rest and sound mind. \u201cWe don\u2019t hate our bodies, we rather nourish and treasure them\u201d, she begins. Stress is a killer and in this same chapter, women are encouraged to make out time to \u2018refuel and kindle their fire\u2019. By that, the author is simply saying that there is a need to take some time off to have fun after at least a month of hard work.\n\nAnother method of preventing stress as documented in the book is by listening to inspiring songs. \u201cWhether on the podium or in the bathroom, singing is a way to relieve stress\u201d, because it reduces cortisol- a hormone associated with stress, in the body.\n\nCommendable is the prominence given to reading as pivotal to caring for one\u2019s health. The book advocates in Chapter five, subtitled, \u201810 Annual Actions\u2019, for reading good books to improve oneself. It notes that reading soul-inspiring materials makes life a lot easier. It recognises the fact that books on challenging or knotty issues for enlightenment and enablement have the capacity to significantly reduce or wash away some of our stresses and pain points. In addition, learning new skills and gaining new knowledge helps the woman or anyone for that matter, stay valued and relevant in the family and society at large.\n\nThe title of the book is apt; style and language are simple and engaging, making comprehension easy for all categories of female folks. \u201cTaking Care Of Me\u201d makes an excellent read for every woman.",

          "text": "ORDINARILY, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s approval of N75,000 for students of Education in our public universities and polytechnics and N50,000 in Colleges of Education per semester should be cheered by all education-loving Nigerians.\n\nMinister of Education, Adamu Adamu, said at the celebration of this year\u2019s World\u2019s Teachers Day in Abuja on Wednesday, October 6, 2021, that it was part of the president\u2019s package to attract the best brains into the teaching profession. The Minister also said that his ministry will work with state governments to make sure that when the bursary beneficiaries graduate, they will get automatic employment.\n\nWe must commend Buhari for his positive attitude towards teachers generally. Last year, he had approved the extension of retirement age of teachers from 60 to 65 years or 40 years of service up from 35. However, as nice as these gestures may be, they are hardly enough to change the fortunes of our education system.\n\nIn January 2018, Minister Adamu had promised that the Federal Government will declare a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d in education. That promise was never fulfilled. We had looked forward to it and hoped that it would provide the platform for a wholistic rejig of our educational system.\n\nWe had hoped that the federal, state and local governments as well as private educators will sit together and fashion a new roadmap for education. Adamu did not explain why the idea flopped. Also, in July this year, Buhari had promised to increase the federal education vote by 50 per cent and ensure that by 2025, it would have gone up to 100 per cent.\n\nIn the 2022 budget, he has already failed in his promise as Education got N1.29 trn, or 7.9 per cent of th N16 trn total appropriation. But these inchoate policy grabs which do not even factor in the struggling sub-national governments, may not take us far.\n\nHow far will the granting of these stipends to education students actually attract better brains to the teaching profession which is already bedevilled? In most states, to get a teaching job requires political connection, and politicians always favour their family and party members, thus shutting out many so-called \u201cbetter brains\u201d.\n\nIn any case, does being an Education student automatically make one a \u201cbest brain\u201d? What is the guarantee that beneficiaries of the bonanza (especially the talented ones) will not go abroad or ignore the signed bond and move on to other sectors?\n\nThe best way to attract the best brains to the teaching profession is to make teaching the best paying job as is done in more advanced countries. School environments should be made conducive for learning while teachers\u2019 welfare and regular upgrades are guaranteed. A situation where serving and retired teachers are always going on strike due to government neglect cannot sustainably attract the best to the profession.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Primary 5 pupil, Treasure Adigun reading to her classmates during a literacy lesson\n\nGender inequality is a socio-cultural phenomenon expressed in the form of a bias that places one lower than the other.\n\nOver the years, the world has witnessed remarkable progress in advocacy for gender equality especially for the female folk with positive results \u2013 more girls are in school compared to 20 years ago and a higher number of women occupy key positions in business and public service.\n\nHowever, large inequalities persist in some regions, with women and girls systematically being denied the same rights as men and boys. Sexual exploitation, disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, and discrimination from public office all remain huge barriers that women and girls face.\n\nThe United Nations holds the annual International Day of the Girl Child on October 11 to promote girls\u2019 rights and highlight gender inequalities all over the world. The theme for 2021 is \u201cDigital Generation. Our Generation\u201d.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic which disrupted the world as we knew it, also rocked education systems across the globe. This saw a move to greater use of digital innovation and technology for improved learning, development, and for accelerating achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 4, to complement traditional physical classroom learning methods for school-aged children. While the pandemic has accelerated digital platforms for learning, earning and connecting, some 2.2 billion people below the age of 25 still do not have internet access at home and girls are more likely to be cut off, according to UNICEF. It is worthy to note that the gender gap for global internet users grew from 11% in 2013 to 17% in 2019. In the world\u2019s least developed countries, it hovers around 43%.\n\nThe gender digital divide should however go beyond connectivity and access to devices, as girls still face having their ambitions questioned. It is only by addressing the inequity and exclusion that span geographies and generations that we can usher-in a digital revolution for all, with all.\n\nBridge Nigeria, a network of nursery and primary schools in underserved communities in Lagos and Osun States supports thousands of girls to become confident, empowered young women as they progress in learning each and every day. This is because educating girls and ensuring women are educated will have transformative effects at a local, national and global level.\n\nAs part of activities to celebrate this year\u2019s International Day of the Girl Child, Bridge hosted some successful women leaders to inspire pupils to dream and reach for the stars, and further enlighten them that every child has the right to be in charge of their future and to be successful in any career of their choice. These women leaders are Mrs Lola Esan, Partner and Workforce Advisory Services Leader (West Africa) at EY Consulting and Mrs Folakemi Fadahunsi, Chief Financial Officer of a real estate company and a transformation expert with over 19 years of experience in Consumer Markets, Telecommunications, Real Estate, Agriculture and the Public sector for some of the world and Nigeria\u2019s top companies. Recently, Nigeria\u2019s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was named in Time Magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People for 2021. Last March, she emerged as the first African and the first woman to rise to the position of a World Trade Organisation Director-General, a landmark development that has continued to earn her accolades globally. For Bridge girls and other young Nigerian girls and women, Okonjo-Iweala\u2019s appointment and global recognition is a reassurance that they can dream and aspire to reach the peak of their sector.\n\nElizabeth Williams-Charles\n\n10-year-old Elizabeth Williams-Charles is a Primary six pupil that loves to be in school learning new things with her friends. Unlike most children, Elizabeth loves mathematics and sees it as interesting and fun. When asked what she would like to be in the future, she didn\u2019t think twice or bat an eyelid before answering. She hopes to become a pilot in the future and hopefully fly her parents. She says it would give her immense joy flying a plane with her parents as passengers.\n\nApart from reading her books, Elizabeth likes singing during her space time. Her best musician is Osinachi Kalu Okoro Egbu, known professionally as Sinach, a Nigerian singer, songwriter and senior worship leader at Loveworld. Sinach is the first singer-songwriter to top the Billboard Christian Songwriter chart for 12 weeks in a row.\n\nElizabeth noted that she has attended a music talent competition and won prizes, including a voice training contract. She says she is inspired by Sinach because of her soul-uplifting songs.\n\nGrace Odoma is a 10-year-old girl who wants to become a doctor in future. Grace who loves reading said her decision to become a doctor started when she read about the life and times of Chief Abimbola Elizabeth Awoliyi, the first woman to practise as a physician in Nigeria. Awoliyi was also the first West African woman to earn a license of Royal Surgeon in Dublin. The late physician attended Queens College, Lagos, a school that Grace is hopeful to attend for her secondary school education.\n\nGirls and boys have the right to aspire to be whatever they want and be supported to achieve their dreams. Bridge is helping to build a prosperous future by creating classrooms and schools with equity of opportunity. The International Day of the Girl Child is marked every year, to recognise girls\u2019 rights and the unique challenges girls face around the world. Achieving the empowerment of women and girls is integral to each of the UN\u2019s 17 Global Goals, but particularly Goal 5 for gender equality. Bridge\u2019s message on the occasion is that every girl has the right to be in charge of her future and her fate, and we have the collective obligation to protect her rights and promote her wellbeing.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Monday in Abuja assured Nigerians that the 11.9km Second Niger Bridge, 120 km Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and other key projects under the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) will be completed within the second term of this administration.\n\nThe President gave the assurance at the opening of a two-day Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review Retreat organized to assess progress made towards the achievement of the nine key priorities of his administration.\n\nHis spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, made this known in a statement on Monday.\n\nBuhari used the occasion of the retreat, the third edition since the second term of his administration, to highlight some of the Federal Government\u2019s notable achievements in the last two years.\n\nHe listed accomplishments in the areas of infrastructure, transportation, economy, electricity supply, the petroleum industry, among others.\n\n\u2018\u2018On transportation, we are growing the stock and quality of our road, rail, air and water transport infrastructure.\n\n\u2018\u2018The PIDF projects are also advancing remarkably. These include the 11.9km Second Niger Bridge, 120 km Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, 375 km Abuja \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Zaria \u2013 Kano Expressway, and the East-West Road. Most of these projects are expected to be completed within this 2nd term of our Administration,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight that over the past two years, ministers have rendered reports to the Federal Executive Council on their activities related to the achievement of their ministerial mandates.\n\n\u2018\u2018Some of the notable achievements include the establishment of InfraCo Plc in 2020, as a world-class infrastructure development vehicle, wholly focused on Nigeria, with combined debt and equity take-off capital of N15 trillion, to be managed by an independent infrastructure fund manager.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund was also established in 2020 with more than USD 1Billion in funding.\n\n\u2018\u2018In addition, we have launched the Nigeria Innovation Fund by the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA). This is aimed at addressing investment opportunities in the domestic technology sector: data networking, data centers, software, Agri-tech, Bio-tech, and more,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nFurthermore, President Buhari noted that his administration had made tremendous progress on railway projects in the country, noting that upgrading of the railway network is being extended with the recent completion of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan line.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail line has finally been completed and commissioned after 30 years of its conception.\n\n\u2018\u2018Work is expected to commence very soon on the Port-Harcourt Maiduguri line and Calabar \u2013 Lagos Coastal Line to connect the Southern and Eastern States of our Country. Progress is also being made on the upgrading of our Airports, with the state-of-the-art facilities in line with world-class safety standards,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the economy, the President said the nation witnessed three consecutive quarters of growth, after negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2018The GDP grew from 0.8% in 2017 to 2.2% in 2019, but declined in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the downward trend in global economic activities triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018As of Second Quarter 2021, GDP growth rate was at 5.01%, the highest since the inception of this administration.\u201d\n\nOn security, President Buhari announced that the Ministry of Defence has been instructed to create a modest military-industrial complex for the local production of weapons to meet some of the requirements of the country\u2019s armed forces.\n\nThe President explained that the establishment of the industrial complex would address Nigeria\u2019s over-dependence on other countries for military equipment and logistics.\n\nHe said the project is being implemented under the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON), a military department responsible for arms manufacture.\n\nOn other efforts to strengthen national security, the President said it was gratifying to note that Nigeria has received six A-29 Super Tucano.\n\nHe said the propeller-driven aircraft are being used for training, surveillance, and attack by the military.\n\n\u2018\u2018As part of the efforts towards strengthening our national security, we have increased investments in arms, weapons and other necessary equipment; expanded the National Command and Control Centre to nineteen states of the Federation; and established a Nigerian Police Trust Fund, which will significantly improve funding for the Nigeria Police Force.\n\n\u2018\u2018We have also approved the sum of N13.3 billion for the take-off of the Community Policing initiative across the country, as part of measures adopted to consolidate efforts aimed at enhancing security nationwide,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the Power Sector, President Buhari noted that the implementation of a \u2018Willing Buyer-Willing Seller\u2019 policy has opened up opportunities for increased delivery of electricity to underserved homes and industries.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the execution of critical projects through the Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme, will result in achieving the national goal of improved power supply by 2025.\n\nOn the Petroleum Industry Act signed into law on 16th August 2021, the President reiterated his directive to the Implementation Committee to complete all processes for the successful operationalization of the Act within 12 months.\n\nIn efforts to empower the youth and other vulnerable groups by enhancing investments in the Social Intervention Programmes, the President said he has approved the expansion of the National Social Register (NSP) by 1 million additional households.\n\nThe NSP is the official database for the implementation of the Conditional Cash Transfer programme.\n\n\u2018\u2018We have established the N75 billion Nigerian Youth Investment Fund created to boost the Nigerian economy through leverage and access to finance for youths.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Fund should serve as a catalyst to unleash the potential of the youth and to enable them to build businesses that will stimulate economic growth and create jobs. These accomplishments are a testament to the fact that all hands are on deck in establishing a solid foundation for even greater successes in future,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "Former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has enjoined the Igbo in the diaspora to offer a strong voice against violent agitations and also bring their influences to bear in the search for security and stability in Igboland.\n\nThis was even as he gave assurances that the South East Caucus of the National Assembly, which he is the leader, was also working towards defusing tension in the region as well as finding a political solution that would result in the release of the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nEkweremadu blamed the agitations by various parts of the country on a flawed federal system, injustice, poor management of the nation\u2019s diversity, failure of the Federal Government to secure lives and property, and a needless clampdown on self-determination agitators when dialogue and giving every part of the country a sense of belonging could have sufficed.\n\nHe, however, insisted that violent agitation was not the answer.\n\nThe lawmaker bared his mind in a lecture entitled \u201cThe Igbo in Diaspora: A Perspective\u201d that he delivered virtually at the Igbo Heritage Lectures and Ugwumba Excellence Award event, which was held in Pretoria, South Africa, Sunday evening.\n\nHe observed that one of the worst things that could happen to Ndigbo at this time was to allow their homeland to be turned into a theatre of war.\n\n\u201cThe injustices and marginalisations are palpable and must be addressed. But by all means, we must ensure the stability of Igbo land because only by so doing can Alaigbo (Igbo land) prosper economically and also elicit local and international support and sympathy over their plights.\n\nNigeria\u2019s policing system has failed to solve insecurity \u2013 Ekweremadu\n\n\u201cWhat has happened in Alaigbo in the past few months is odd, \u2018un-Igbo\u2019, and sacrilegious. Destruction, waste of human lives, and economic losses have been the lot of our region. In particular, the sit-at-home has hemorrhaged Igbo lives and economy and it is good the IPOB has said they are no longer interested in the sit-at-home. No wise man brings war into his home. Our people prosper in industry, commerce, and the informal sector. Most of them survive on a daily income.\n\n\u201cTherefore, while we are at liberty to employ every legitimate and democratic means to press for justice and equity, we must all work together to condemn and end the violence, irrespective of whatever quarters it is coming from.\n\n\u201cThis is a special appeal to Ndigbo in South Africa, in particular, to wade into the orgy of violence in Igboland and help to restore normalcy. Ndigbo at home expect the Igbo in the diaspora to lead the campaign against violent agitations and insecurity in our region because threats to Igbo businesses, the peace, security, and stability of the South-East are threats to our very existence as Ndigbo\u201d, he stated.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cAs the intellectual bank of Ndigbo with extensive exposure to liberal and progressive democratic ideals, and access to international resources, the Igbo in the diaspora are well-positioned to elevate the intellectual content of the Igbo struggle for justice and equity.\n\n\u201cHow best can we address the issues of exclusion, imbalances, detention of many Igbo sons and daughters in various correctional centres across the country, the issues of a clampdown on unarmed protesters, and the challenge of extra-judicial killings in Igbo land without recourse to violent agitations?\u201d, he added.\n\nOn Nnamdi Kanu, Ekweremadu said: \u201cLet me also assure you that the South East Caucus of the National Assembly is not resting on its oars. We are working quietly and surely to address these issues, including finding a political solution to the Mazi Nnamdi Kanu matter.\n\n\u201cWe did it before in the case of Chief Raph Uwazuruike in 2007. We also did it in the case of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in 2017. And God willing, and with your support and prayers, we will succeed again in the matter of Nnamdi Kanu to promote peace and stability in our region\u201d.\n\nEkweremadu, however, enjoined the Igbo in the diaspora to show interest in leadership recruitment in Igboland.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo diaspora must show more than a passing interest in leadership recruitment at all levels in Alaigbo. If possible, please, come home and run for elective offices. Those who cannot come home should prompt and support other candidates of their choice. The bottom line is to ensure that our local, state and federal political offices are occupied by our best and those who have Igbo at heart. That to me is the beginning of the real emancipation struggle for Ndigbo because charity begins at home\u201d, he concluded.",

          "text": "Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has expressed optimism that Nigeria would emerge from its challenges stronger.\n\n\u201cWe have challenges just like any other country in the world but we are going to overcome. Some countries have not even experienced half of what we are going through before they collapsed but everybody must do his own bit.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate today that many people are waiting for the country to disintegrate and many of them are disappointed that we are still standing on our feet.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to wax stronger because these detractors and vocal nay-sayers are in the minority,\u2019\u2019 he said when he featured at a special forum of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe minister charged every Nigerian to take ownership of the country and ensure it is not plunged into war.\n\nHe said Nigerians should resist the temptation by some selfish elites campaigning that Nigeria was better divided.\n\n\u201cIt is because there is a country call Nigeria that is why there are journalists, professors, doctors and what have you. If you know what happened during the Liberian war, professors were working in bakeries in Lagos just to survive.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at some write ups in our newspapers and social media, you begin to wonder whether the writers are patriots. If you don\u2019t live in Nigeria and you are reading what they are writing, you will think every part of Nigeria is at war.\u2019\u2019\n\nMohammed urged social commentators and critics to be dispassionate in their assessment and judgment on issues.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying don\u2019t criticise the government, you are at liberty to do so. However, stop de-marketing Nigeria. Stop setting one ethnic group or religion against the other and have the courage to be honest and forthright.\u201d\n\nMohammed said Nigerians must take possession of their country because if they did not build it, nobody would fix it for them.\n\nHe described allegation that the Federal Government is pampering bandits and being hard on self-determination groups such as the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a misconception and fake news rolled into one.\n\n\u201cI want to say without any hesitation that this is a fallacy. It is a misrepresentation, misinformation and fake news all rolled into one.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that the Federal Government does not make a distinction between terrorists and bandits. As far as the Federal Government is concerned, they are all criminals and they are treated the same way. It is very important to set the record straight. Why do I say this? Because, it is a continuation of the destructive rhetoric of some commentators.\u201d\n\nThe ministercautioned against politicisation of security issue.\n\n\u201cSecurity is security. Bandits kill soldiers; they kill policemen and innocent people. So, why will the military be softer on one set of criminals than the other?\u201d\n\nHe said government is winning the war against insurgency in the North East, adding that the military has heightened assaults and attacks against insurgents which have enabled it to reclaim more territories.He insisted that the surrendering of Boko Haram insurgents shows that peace is returning to the war-ravaged region.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, when we came in 2015 \u2014 of the 20 local government areas in Borno, about 13 were under the effective control of Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cOn December 5, 2015, we travelled to Bama, Konduga, Kaure and Maiduguri. The distance from Maiduguri to Bama is about 78 kilometres, but no single vehicle is on the way. It was like a suicide mission.\n\n\u201cThe week after we left, a commander was killed on the same route. When we got to Bama, of the over 6,000 houses in Bama, not one was standing. They have all been bombed by Boko Haram. Today, go to Bama and see for yourselves. And when we went in 2015, you couldn\u2019t travel more than a few kilometres outside Maiduguri metropolis. So, there is no doubt in my mind that we are winning. And thousands of insurgents that are surrendering speak volumes.\n\n\u201cWe were in Maiduguri two weeks ago for another very successful town hall meeting where all stakeholders were in attendance like the traditional rulers, the military, police and CSOs. The governor confirmed that the heightened assaults and attacks by the military in the theatre had led to the surrender of many insurgents. And again, the military has recently acquired more platforms and these are making life difficult for the terrorists. That\u2019s why any time they attempt to come in, they are being repelled fiercely.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in our minds that the federal government is winning the war, very very much.\n\n\u201cIn some places, the activities of Boko Haram and bandits have dovetailed. This is because of the pummeling they are receiving from the military in the north-east, they are moving toward parts of the north-central.\n\n\u201cAnd here they are linking up with bandits, so there are some handshakes of some sorts. It is just like if you displace water, it will flow somewhere so that\u2019s what is happening.\n\n\u201cBut the military is aware of this and I can assure you that in the next few days; that also will be history. The military is doing its best and we are not giving up at all.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nServing Overseer of The Citadel Global Community Church (CGCC) and Convener, Save Nigeria Group (SNG), Pastor Tunde Bakare, has described the 1999 constitution as draconian and lopsided sham which must be torn down for the country to move forward.\n\nIn his State of the Nation address tagged: \u201cThe Black Box of Nigeria\u2019s Politics,\u201d which was relayed from his Lagos church, yesterday, he said if President Muhammadu Buhari does not tear the constitution down and push for restructuring of the nation, not only would history record that he failed to rise to the occasion, he would have squandered a great opportunity.\n\nHe said many of those who say Nigeria\u2019s unity is non-negotiable pay lipservice to a version of unity that serves their selfish interests.\n\n\u201cOur founding fathers signed a contract in 1960 detailing the terms and conditions of our union or unity following a series of negotiations. This contract was then updated in 1963 following due consultations. While the 1999 Constitution opens with the preamble: \u201cWe the people,\u201d \u2018we, the people of Nigeria\u2019 were neither duly consulted nor did we accept the conditions under which we are now being governed. How, then, can anyone hypocritically insist that our unity is non-negotiable? Did we not negotiate it in 1960 and 1963?\n\n\u201cThe majority of the champions, promoters and supporters of the \u201cour unity is non-negotiable\u201d slogan pay lipservice to a version of unity that serves their selfish interests. What they are insisting on, in reality, is that \u2018our disunity is non-negotiable\u2019 and that we must be forced to live together irrespective of the inherent dysfunctionality of the terms and conditions. The continued insistence on altering the set rules in the midst of our spirited game of national development, and the subsequent imposition of a draconian and lopsided concoction of a constitution in 1999 is the most inhibiting, corrosive spanner thrown into the wheel of our national unity and faith, peace and progress, from that time until now. I am fully persuaded, as are many fellow compatriots within and outside the shores of Nigeria, that the 1999 Constitution, whether as amended or to be further amended by the National Assembly is nothing more than a glorified death certificate.\u201d\n\nPastor Bakare added that what the country needed ws a geo-political structure that would provide an enabling environment for every zone to maximise its geo-economic opportunities and potentials under a strong country and that this can be achieved by a pragmatic approach to restructuring Nigeria rather than by mere zoning of the presidency.\n\n\u201cOnce upon a time, the Berlin walls separated Eastern Germany from Western Germany until President Ronald Reagan in his indomitable manner spoke lucidly on live television to the president of the then Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. Mr Gorbachev eventually did, and Germany is better off for it today. In the same spirit, I say to President Muhammadu Buhari. \u2018Mr President, stop passing the buck to the National Assembly. Tear down this inhibiting concoction of a constitution; tear it down so we can build a truly great nation.\u2019 This is one enduring legacy your administration can still secure before your time in power draws to a close. If you do, present and unborn generations of Nigerians will remember you for it and write your name in gold when the history of this period is written. If you don\u2019t, history will record that you failed to rise to the occasion and squandered a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nHe warned that those clamouring and waiting for genuine change to happen through the forthcoming 2023 presidential election without first insisting that the \u201cimposed sham of a constitution must be torn and discarded are merely putting the cart before the horse. This is nothing but a prescription for retrogression. No tangible progress can ever be made by such an exercise in futility. It would be tantamount to building a superstructure on a faulty or shaky foundation.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "By Chinwendu Obienyi\n\nThere are fresh concerns that Nigeria\u2019s 2022 budget presented last week to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari would widen the deficit and escalate arbitrage in the foreign exchange (FX) market.\n\nSome economic experts who spoke to Daily Sun at the weekend, based on some of the benchmarks highlighted by the president would mount undue pressure on the nation\u2019s reserves unless oil prices improve with the Federal Government ramping up production locally to increase its foreign currency earnings.\n\nPresident Buhari had stated that the 2022 Appropriattion Bill was meant to build on the achievements of previous budgets to deliver on the nation\u2019s goals and aspirations as encapsulated in its soon-to-be launched National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025.\n\nBuhari said the 2021 budget performance has seen actual revenues go 34 per cent below target as of July 2021, due to the underperformance of oil and gas revenue sources, citing that the Federal Government\u2019s retained revenues (excluding Government Owned Enterprises) amounted to N2.61 trillion against the proportionate target of N3.95 trillion for the period. He also stated that the priorities of the 2022 budget would be diversifying the economy, with robust MSME growth; investing in critical infrastructure; strengthening security and ensuring good governance; enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace; reducing poverty; and minimizing regional, economic and social disparities.\n\nBut according to some economic experts, the country spent big for the 2022 budget tagged \u2013 Economic Growth and Recovery, stressing that given the government\u2019s track record of revenue underperformance over the years and the absence of any major reform to drive this projection, time will soon tell on the achievability of the revenue projection. They also expressed concerns that pegging the naira official rate at N410 when exchange rate is almost at N600/$1 was an unrealist proposition.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun via a telephone chat, Head of Research at FSL Securities, Victor Chiazor, argued that even if the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) adjusts the Naira to N550 or N500, the parallel market will still move higher because the country is still not producing enough to send that signal that it does not have a liquidity problem in terms of dollar supply.\n\nCommending government\u2019s efforts towards meeting the invisibles, BTA, PTA, medical and hospital bills, Chiazor said the level of demand was not what Nigerians expect, adding that FX challenges still persist and that arbitrage was likely expected given the low supply capacity in the system.\n\nHis words, \u201cLuckily we just raised about N4 billion in the Eurobond and we expect that to hit the reserves which are already inching and that should take us up to above $40 billion of our reserves.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Osinbajo: Buhari is Nigeria\u2019s Most Popular, Only Credible Leader Ever",
          "text": "*Insists Nigeria better off united, optimistic nation will overcome challenges\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, said at the weekend in London that President Muhammadu Buhari was the only politician in Nigeria at this time with the charisma and credibility to rally the whole country behind the patriotic push to rise above its current challenges.\n\nOsinbajo stressed the need for Nigeria to remain an indivisible country, assuring that its challenges would soon be overcome.\n\nThe vice president spoke during an interactive session with top officials of the Nigerian High Commission in London.\n\nHe declared, \u201cIf you look at all of us sitting here, we represent all the geopolitical zones. This is the Nigeria that will succeed; anything else doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nDescribing Buhari\u2019s popularity and credibility as a crucial factor in galvanizing the entire system to resolve the challenges, Osinbajo said, \u201cThe president is possibly the most popular Nigerian politician that we ever had in generations. He is possibly the only person, who can go into a place or somewhere without bossing people to gather and they will come and listen to him speak.\n\n\u201cWe need that level of credibility to be able to solve problems in our country. And I think because of his level of credibility, despite everything, he is still the only one that can call everyone, and even people, who do not necessarily agree with him know that he is a man of his words.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo urged Nigerians at home and in the diaspora to promote the message of one country, noting, \u201cAnybody, who looks at how Nigeria operates will recognise that we are better off in this system, and that is the truth.\n\n\u201cYoruba are not better off on their own. Igbos are not better off on their own. The North is not better off on its own. We are better off as one nation, that is why we are strong and that is why we can face the world.\u201d\n\nFurther stressing the need for unity, he stated, \u201cIf you read of the economics of smaller nations, they are looking for how they can become stronger by aligning with other nations. How does a country with all the potential and everything that we have, think that the best way is to break up?\n\n\u201cWe are at a point in time in our history, where we have security challenges; we have economic challenges, and if you talk about security, there are so many dimensions to it. If you look carefully, all of these could happen to any government and I think we are in the very best position to solve the problems that face us today.\n\n\u201cSecurity challenges that we have didn\u2019t show up in one day but it is the government, the people, the men and women that will handle them.We happen to be that government, and I am very convinced that we are entirely capable of handling these challenges. I think we are in the best possible position to solve these problems.\u201d\n\nOsinbjo enjoined staff of the High Commission to remain good ambassadors of the country and endeavour to promote justice and fairness in their activities, even as they make more efforts to promote government\u2019s programmes and policies.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe must promote one country. But, of course, everybody talks about justice, fairness and balance, and that is what we must try to do on a continuous basis.\n\n\u201cLet us not be discouraged, let us be very confident, because our country will come out of all these problems and emerge stronger. So, I urge every person, who represents our country, to ensure that we represent the country well and be able to speak up at the right forum about the country and what we are doing.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Tinubu made the remarks on Sunday at the Lagos House, Marina, in his \u201cThank you speech\u201d during a reception to welcome him back home, organised by Governor Bababjide Samwo-Olu of Lagos State, on behalf of the state government. \u201cI am standing before you hale and hearty,\u201d the former governor declared at the event tagged, \u201cWelcome Back Home Asiwaju.\u201d\n\nTinubu, who returned to the country on Friday night after a successful surgery on his right knee, spent over three months in London. His arrival to the country came barely 24 hours after a campaign group, South West Agenda (SWAGA 2023), was launched in Lagos by Governor Sanwo-Olu to champion Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nThe reception featured prayers for Tinubu, who expressed gratitude to God for bringing him back to Nigeria safely. He also thanked all the political leaders and groups that had wished him well.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am a little emotional, but I am happy to be back home. God is the giver of life and He alone can take it. I\u2019m grateful to Him for giving me the privilege to be alive. I\u2019m Hale and hearty, I can\u2019t but praise and thank Him.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; and Senator Adeola Olamilekan, said in their speeches that they were working to ensure Tinubu\u2019s mandate in 2023.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cOn behalf of the teeming Lagosians that cannot come to this premises to welcome you back home. Today, being the 10th of October, God has brought you back home.\u201d\n\nThe governor thanked those who had prayed for the safe return of Tinubu, saying, \u201cThe best is yet to come.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila, too, prayed, saying, \u201cFrom today, the best days of your past will be the worst days of your future.\u201d\n\nHe added that the northern caucus of the House of Representatives\u2019 visit to Tinubu in London was a strong statement, and that the southern caucus had planned to make similar visit before Tinubu\u2019s arrival on Friday.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cWhere you are going, is destined. We are ready in the National Assembly. There are men and there are men. The history of Nigeria cannot be written politically without you occupying three quarters of the pages.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, said, \u201cIt is a great honour to be here and be part of this gathering, particularly, to welcome our leader and mentor. We told them you are hale and hearty. We thank you for your guidance, we pray, we will continue to enjoy your mentorship.\u201d\n\nHamzat said, \u201cIt is only God that is constant; He cannot sick. Any human being can be subjected to anything but we thank God that our father has come back.\u201d\n\nRepresenting Lagos Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Stephen Adegbite, quoting Psalm 91 from the Holy Bible, prayed copiously for Tinubu\u2019s good health and his 2023 ambition, saying, \u201cWe are praying for you. You will get there. You will not die.\u201d\n\nOthers at the reception included wife of the state governor, Mrs. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu; Tinubui\u2019s wife, Senator Oluremi; former Lagos Deputy governors, Mrs. Idiat Adebule, and Abiodun Ogunleye; members of the Governor\u2019s Advisory Council (GAC); local government chairmen; Secretary to the State Government, Folasade Jaji; Chief of Staff, Tayo Ayinde and other members of the state Executive Council, members of the House of Representatives; members of the Lagos State House of Assembly; party chieftains, clergymen, and market leaders.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nSenior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr. Femi Falana, has written to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, demanding the immediate enforcement of the judgment of the Supreme Court directing the federal government to recover the sum of $62 billion from six International Oil Companies (IOCs) over wrong sharing formula.\n\nFalana in the letter dated October 8, 2021, also threatened legal action against the AGF if he refuses to enforce the said judgment.\n\nHe wrote on behalf of his clients Professor Omotoye Olorode and Jaye Gaskia of the People\u2019s Alternative Political Movement (PAPM).\n\nThe letter titled: \u201cRequest For Compliance with Judgment of The Supreme Court of Nigeria in Suit No SC. 964/2016 Between Akwa Ibom and 2 Ors vs Attorney General of the Federation, is not unconnected to a recent statement credited to the Minister of State for Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, to the extent that it is near impossible for the federal government to recover the said sum from the IOCs.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court had in a judgment delivered on October 20, 2018, directed the federal government to immediately take steps to recover all revenues lost to oil-exploring and exploiting companies due to wrong profit-sharing formula since August 2003.\u201d\n\nFalana\u2019s client claimed that based on the aforesaid judgment, Malami had \u201crequest for the immediate payment of the sum of $62 billion owed by the six International Oil Companies with joint operating agreements with the NNPC.\u201d\n\nThe affected companies were: Shell Petroleum Development Company, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, Chevron Nigeria Limited, Nigeria Agip Oil Company, TotalElf Nigeria and Pan Ocean Oil Company.\n\nBut Falana\u2019s client had quoted Sylva as saying, \u201cWell, we have started discussions. Let us consider that as a lost opportunity, the money was not in a cupboard, they have taken it.\n\n\u201cNobody can bring out that kind of money, I mean we can\u2019t get $62billion. We can maybe get something from them but not $62billion. It\u2019s an opportunity we have lost. We have already started discussions with them but what is clear is that it is a lost opportunity really.\u201d\n\nBased on this they have now instructed Falana to request that Malami uses his good office to ensure that the said sum of $62 billion was recovered from the IOCs and paid into the federation account without any further delay.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you fail or refuse to accede to the request of our client we shall not hesitate to approach the Federal High Court to seek an order to compel you to comply with the judgment of the Supreme Court in accordance with section 287(1) of the Constitution which provides that the decisions of the Supreme court shall be enforced in any part of the Federation by all authorities and persons, and by courts with subordinate jurisdiction to that of the supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAs we await your reply to this letter please accept the assurances of our highest esteem and professional regards\u201d, the letter added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Electoral Act: Saraki Appeals to N\u2019Assembly on Direct Primaries",
          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nOpposition to direct primary election continued as a former Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki, has sent an appeal to members of the National Assembly, who were in the process of reconciling the different versions of the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill passed by both chambers to save the country the crisis and trouble that would result from the proposal to make direct primaries compulsory for parties in sourcing candidates for elections.\n\nSaraki, in a statement by Yusuph Olaniyonu, Head of his Media Office, noted that the decision to include a provision in the proposed Electoral Act which would make it compulsory for parties to adopt direct primaries would only create a fresh problem while trying to solve another.\n\nHe added that many of the political parties lacked the necessary infrastructure to successfully conduct direct primaries at all levels while the attempt would lead to hundreds of litigations that might jeopardise the general election.\n\n\u201cI feel compelled to once again appeal to Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the House of Representatives on the proposed Electoral Act, because I realise that while the focus of the general public has been on how to get the electronic transmission of results into the proposed law, another potential problem that may clog our electoral process is included in the Electoral Act and it\u2019s this provision on direct primaries.\n\n\u201cThe two options on the table are to make direct primaries compulsory for all the parties or to leave it open for parties to decide. We should take the latter option. Let us leave each party to decide how it wants to source its candidates. The experience we have in the past shows that direct primary will lead to a crisis if forced on the parties. We saw how people sent from the national headquarters to conduct primary elections stayed in hotel rooms and conjured up figures which were announced as the result of direct primary elections.\n\n\u201cEven if the big parties have the funds and facilities to organise direct primaries nationwide, how about the smaller parties? Can the big parties also provide the facilities and election officials that will be present in all the polling units in the country, either simultaneously or in staggered primaries?\n\n\u201cDo most of the parties have valid and verified membership registers and other logistics needed for the successful conduct of direct primaries? The direct primaries option will also put pressure on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), whose officials must monitor all the primaries.\n\n\u201cThe direct primaries provision may work for us in the future but not now that we are not prepared for it as the primaries may hold next June. That is just nine months from now. The time for adequate and necessary preparations towards direct primaries is even not there. There will be so many litigations arising from the process. Do we have the time to hold crisis-free primaries and not create booby-traps for the general elections?\n\n\u201cFrom my experience, this issue of direct primaries was raised in the Eighth National Assembly, when we passed the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill. It has always reared its head as a fall-out of the internal dynamics in certain parties, where legislators feel they have been short-changed in the congresses, where state governors seized the structure, because they felt the process was neither transparent nor free and fair. The legislators may now see the process of passing the Electoral Act as a means to settle the scores. However, in the process that we have now, it is the country that will lose. It is our electoral process that will be undermined.\n\n\u201cMy appeal goes to all members of the National Assembly. Please, do not let us take a position on critical issues based on partisan and personal consideration. Let us put Nigeria first and act in the best interest of our country. During our time in the National Assembly, whenever we were confronted with issues like this, we just appealed and prevailed on members to put the nation first before any other consideration. I believe the same appeal should go to the present federal lawmakers.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we also call on the leadership of the various parties to intervene and call all their stakeholders together to address the issues. The bulk of the responsibility to make the legislators do the right thing falls on the ruling party, the APC. It has the numbers to pass whatever bill the leadership desire in the National Assembly. The party should get its members to avoid including provisions in the proposed Electoral Act which may later become a major clog in the smooth conduct of our elections and the credibility of the electoral process,\u201d Saraki stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fresh moves by Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) to thwart the prosecution of suspects in the Malabu oil scam, including one of his predecessors, Mohammed Adoke have been uncovered.\n\nThe Malabu oil scandal involved the transfer of over $1 billion by Shell and ENI through the Nigerian government to accounts controlled by a former Nigerian Petroleum Minister, Dan Etete.\n\nFrom accounts controlled by Etete, about half of the money ($520 million) went to accounts of companies controlled by Aliyu Abubakar, popularly known in Nigeria as the owner of AA oil.\n\nAnti-corruption investigators and activists suspect he fronted for top officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration as well of officials of Shell and ENI.\n\nThe transaction was authorised in 2011 by ex-president Jonathan through some of his cabinet ministers and the money was payment for OPL 245, one of Nigeria\u2019s richest oil blocks.\n\nThe oil resources of the OPL 245 license have remained undeveloped since the controversies began.\n\nOne of those being prosecuted by the Nigerian government is Adoke.\n\nHe is facing trial over the alleged role he played in the \u201cfraudulent\u201d transfer of ownership of an oil bloc, OPL 245, regarded as one of the biggest in Africa.\n\nOther defendants include Abubakar, Rasky Gbinigie, and four companies- Malabu Oil and Gas Limited, Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited, Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Limited, and Shell Nigeria Exploration Production Company Limited.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that different moves to frustrate the prosecution were planned by Malami, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki (former Special Duties Minister and senior partner of Malami), and Adoke in the Maitama private office of AGF. See Also Scandal How Nigerian Police Misrepresented Facts On Mohammed Adoke\u2019s Email Requesting To Transfer $1billion From Government Account\n\n\u201cThe media was yesterday overwhelmed with the news of Nigerian government\u2019s action against anti-corruption and human rights activist, Olanrewaju Suraju over the allegations of forgery by Muhammed Bello Adoke, ex-Attorney General of the Federation standing trial over complicity and bribery in the Malabu case.\n\n\u201cThe speed of submission of the case file from the IGP office, dated 20th September 2021 and purported filing of action before a court in Abuja is more than telling. Most Nigerians don\u2019t know there is a conspiracy that was arched in the Maitama private office of Malami between Malami, Turaki, and Adoke. See Also Corruption Police IG Orders Fresh Investigation Into Alleged Forgery Against Ex-Justice Minister, Muhammed Adoke\n\n\u201cImagine, I was worried at the level of confidentiality exhibited during this meeting between the AGF and someone being prosecuted by his office on behalf of the government. Kabiru Tanimu was also spotted at Malami\u2019s office last Friday night.\n\n\u201cThis same Malami in the past attempted to thwart the government efforts at prosecuting the Malabu heist by writing a letter to Buhari, advising him to withdraw any action against suspects in the fraud,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nA memo dated 27th September 2017 to Buhari by Malami read, \u201cThere is nothing to show that the parties as constituted were at all times working together and having \u2018meeting of the mind\u2019 to wit to forge CAC documents and use some for the purpose of divesting the shares of the complainants and thereafter enter into a settlement agreement with FGN (Federal Government of Nigeria) and other parties to take delivery of the proceeds of sale OPL 245.\n\n\u201cThere is also nothing in the proof of evidence to support the charge of money laundering and it is therefore impossible for the prosecution to prove the elements which include illicit funds, transfer for such through various channels to re-introduce same again into the regular financial system as legitimate funds in financial institutions, etc. See Also News ANALYSIS: Revelations On Forged Electronic Mail Allegations Against Civic Society, HEDA By Embattled Ex-Attorney General, Adoke\n\n\u201cWithout the express proof of these elements, the count may not be sustained on the premise of the attached proof of evidence.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), then led by Ibrahim Magu countered Malami in a memo to the President and he was overruled.\n\n\u201cThis was at a time trial was already sustained in Milan and United Kingdom against principal actors in the controversial deal. What was most surprising was the appearance of an internal memo between the AGF and the President in court through Adoke\u2019s lawyer. That was sufficient to have led to the sacking of Malami but Buhari was too weak,\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cOn the allegations of forgery by Adoke, the Inspector General ordinarily had allowed professional investigation by the Interpol and cybercrime unit, see the letters by the units into the matter until Malami saw an opportunity to deal with Suraju and HEDA, in addition to sabotaging the Malabu cases.\n\n\u201cBoth Suraju and HEDA have consistently campaigned against the corruption of Malami and his abuses of office. HEDA even called for Malami\u2019s removal from office. Malami intervened with the Police IGP for Adoke and investigations by the Interpol and DIG FCID were aborted for the notorious IGP monitoring unit to conclude the hatchet job.\n\n\u201cHe personally requested for a hurriedly concocted report to be submitted to his office, while Adoke interacted with some media executives to keep the stages in the media.\u201d\n\nAnother source in the Ministry of Justice expressed surprise at the speed they were directed to prepare and file the charges against Suraju.\n\n\u201cWe could not even see any evidence to sustain charges in the submitted file but the AGF wanted it prepared and filed soonest. That file has received the fastest treatment in the history of our ministry under Malami.\n\n\u201cWith these charges, it is certain the actions of Nigerian Government against JP Morgan in London, where the email under investigation, is threatened by Malami\u2019s action. The Italian court which indicted Adoke of receiving bribes in the deal must also be monitoring developments,\u201d the source said.",

What was most surprising was the appearance of an internal memo between the AGF and the President in court through Adoke\u2019s lawyer. That was sufficient to have led to the sacking of Malami but Buhari was too weak,\u201d another source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cOn the allegations of forgery by Adoke, the Inspector General ordinarily had allowed professional investigation by the Interpol and cybercrime unit, see the letters by the units into the matter until Malami saw an opportunity to deal with Suraju and HEDA, in addition to sabotaging the Malabu cases.\n\n\u201cBoth Suraju and HEDA have consistently campaigned against the corruption of Malami and his abuses of office. HEDA even called for Malami\u2019s removal from office. Malami intervened with the Police IGP for Adoke and investigations by the Interpol and DIG FCID were aborted for the notorious IGP monitoring unit to conclude the hatchet job.\n\n\u201cHe personally requested for a hurriedly concocted report to be submitted to his office, while Adoke interacted with some media executives to keep the stages in the media.\u201d\n\nAnother source in the Ministry of Justice expressed surprise at the speed they were directed to prepare and file the charges against Suraju.\n\n\u201cWe could not even see any evidence to sustain charges in the submitted file but the AGF wanted it prepared and filed soonest.

          "title": "Aggregators are enabling independent voices in Kenya\u2019s controlled news circuit",
          "text": "Kenya is all about the news. No, literally, \u201cHabari\u201d, a common greeting in Swahili, means \u201cAny news?\u201d in English.\n\nEveryone has their favourite publication. And every publication has a different story.\n\nData-driven digital media is taking the place of print in Kenya. As the world becomes busier and more digital, the consumption of media has changed. Emerging to take the place of rifling through the morning newspaper are scrollable, swipeable news aggregators that have the potential to change Kenya\u2019s media landscape.\n\nWho owns the headlines? The origins of Kenyan media\n\nIn a country of 52 million people, only a few formal media houses run print news. At an average cost of $0.54 per paper, reading the news can become expensive.\n\nNation Media Group publishes Daily Nation. With a daily circulation of 200,000, it stands as Kenya\u2019s most popular news publication.\n\nThe Standard Group comes in second, with three spin-offs: The Standard, The Standard on Saturday, and The Standard on Sunday. At its inception, more than 100 years ago, it was a colonial newspaper focused on British news. In 1970, African editors took over the running of the paper and shifted its focus to local reporting.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe news circuit\n\nIn an increasingly digital society, news aggregators are offering a new avenue for readers to access diversified content and human stories.\n\nNews aggregators use AI to collate news from different sources, placing them in one, central, scrollable feed. The rise of the news aggregator has, without a doubt, changed the global news industry.\n\nIn 2005, the Agence France-Presse (AFP), sued Google and sought an order barring Google from placing their content on Google News, claiming that the reproduction of the site\u2019s pictures and articles was copyright infringement. AFP and Google settled the suit and the two parties entered a licensed content deal after two years of litigation.\n\nOpera News is another digital news aggregator focused on capturing newsreaders in Africa. It sits under the Opera technology umbrella. If the name sounds familiar it\u2019s because Opera is also the creator of Opay, who raised $400 million from Softbank Vision Fund 2 in late August. The aggregator models itself after a popular app in China, Jinri Toutiao (in English, \u201cToday\u2019s Headlines\u201d). Opera News hit 10 million users in Africa in 2018 and expanded into Kenya in 2020.\n\nMuch like other aggregators, like Google News and Flipboard, Opera News\u2019 AI crawls the internet for content. But unlike other news aggregation giants, Opera News focuses on the curation of original, local, news-pulling stories from local media and fostering a band of content creators that are paid based on a set of parameters that include article clicks.\n\nPositive feedback loops\n\nAggregating digital news in an environment that tends towards the latest and greatest political stories calls for a shift in focus. In the world of news aggregation, moving the needle is as easy as a tweak in the algorithm.\n\n\u201cSome of the parameters that we had before [were] pretty much based on\u2026a lot of people are clicking this [and] our AI picks this up. So what happens is that people who are not doing that cannot get traffic\u2026\u201d said Anthory Ilari, Team Lead of Opera News East Africa.\n\nIlari found that this directly demotivated Opera News\u2019 content creators from reporting stories on broader topics in Kenya.\n\nTo deal with this, Ilari\u2019s team adjusted the algorithm to give original, non-political pieces a boost in the ranking system and feed.\n\nAlbert Bittok, a trained journalist that contributed to Opera News in his spare time, said that, from his experience, articles that received the most views and highest payout were focused on human interest and other topics like politics, sports, and agriculture.\n\nAfter a quick scroll through the headlines page on the Opera News app, TechCabal found that 35% of the headlines were non-political, focused on Kenyan celebrity gossip. On the For You page, on the other hand, 70% of the recommended posts were political in nature.\n\nAgitating aggregation\n\nBut news aggregators are not the be-all and end-all for news diversification in Kenya. Aggregators, like most technology, have their pitfalls. According to Dr. Dinesh Balliah, Acting Director of the Wits Centre for Journalism at Wits University, aggregators point to the growing need for \u201cconvenience in the global economy\u201d, but much like print media, reliance on a single aggregator can be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cNews consumers are not reading intertextually and are therefore getting a single narrative if they are reliant on a single aggregator,\u201d she wrote to TechCabal over email. \u201cAggregators, like social media platforms, must assist the news media to sustain itself,\u201d she added.\n\nNews aggregation requires constant tweaking, learning, and development in a world where millions of clicks come within a few hours. In 2020, Kenya\u2019s internet penetration rate was 85%, with 76% of the internet being accessed by cell phones. As Kenya\u2019s 2022 elections draw near, content moderation will become harder than ever and the nation\u2019s news aggregators will have to rise to the challenge.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "China\u2019s growing influence is transforming African tech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Orlander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOrlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Orlander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Orlander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEver wondered how brands like Netflix, Bumble, Pinterest, Duolingo, Airbnb made it to the billion-dollar club? In three words \u2014 product-led growth (PLG).\n\nBut, what does product-led growth actually mean? On the surface, it may seem simple \u2014 building a great product with the right product-market fit. But that\u2019s not all! There\u2019s a lot more to PLG than meets the eye.\n\nA couple of years back, the path users took to \ufb01nding information on a product involved getting in touch with a customer care executive, waiting on the line to connect, and only hoping to get the relevant answers to all their queries.\n\nHowever, the narrative today is quite di\ufb00erent. In today\u2019s day and product-led age, the product plays the protagonist.\n\nThere\u2019s been a titanic shift in the way users engage with products. Users don\u2019t want to spend too much time learning about the product or seeking access to it. To stay ahead of the curve and keep up with the user\u2019s expectations, it\u2019s vital for brands to \ufb01re up their product in a way that lets customers fully experience and discover the product\u2019s value in a short period.\n\nThis playbook is your pocket guide to understanding product-led growth in depth and uncovering key strategies to embracing and implementing a product-led strategy.\n\nA user-centric module\n\nIt\u2019s about creating happy customers who are your biggest fans. PLG focuses on understanding what users want from a product, building that into your product roadmap, devising new features users demand, and updating existing ones to constantly improve upon the product. The pocket ace of a PLG approach is that it actually lets users experience the product \ufb01rst and pay for it later.\n\nAn emphasis on activation and retention as opposed to only acquisition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser acquisition is no longer the end game. PLG takes on a retention-first approach. Adopting a product-led strategy means building products in a way that lets users uncover features, discover the product\u2019s value quickly, making the entire app journey seamless. Going down the PLG route means putting constant e\ufb00ort into improving the product experience that gets users quickly activated on the product and become power users.\n\nA mindset\u2026\n\nA successful PLG strategy requires buy-in from all teams across the organisation. It\u2019s not something that you plan overnight and implement the following morning.\n\n\u2018Product-led is a mindset that needs to trickle down right from the product to the marketing teams. The topmost priority of every team should be delivering value to the users by solving their pain points. Product-led companies (the successful ones) are those where all teams look through the lenses of product-led growth and hit their business outcomes/goals by letting the product take the front seat.\n\nCommon myths about product-led growth\n\nIt\u2019s a B2B/SaaS thing\n\nYou will be surprised to know that up until recently, the concept of product-led growth was not commonly known/practiced, with the exception of a few brands, including Slack, Airtable, Salesforce, Calendly, Zapier, and their counterparts. Product-led growth has been a timeless strategy. B2C mobile apps have been implementing solutions to improve in-app user experiences without realising that these strategies tie back to product-led growth.\n\nProduct teams own product-led growth\n\nThe success of a PLG strategy is a lot about the product itself and a little less about the product teams. The answer to the question \u201cwho really owns product-led growth\u201d is \u201ceveryone\u201d\u201d.PLG may start with the product team having to build a superior product, however, it\u2019s about how the other teams are leveraging the product to accomplish business outcomes/goals and creating a great product experience for the users.\n\nA great product doesn\u2019t need a PLG strategy\n\nSimply having a great product is not synonymous with being product-led. Building a self-serving product \u2014 intuitive, o\ufb00ering users the desired value, guiding users through their journey without being intrusive \u2014 are all building blocks of a product-led strategy. The product sets the groundwork for PLG. However, there\u2019s more to the story of product-led growth. The tools/techniques employed to adopt and implement PLG, KPIs tracked to map the success of PLG, and imbibing a PLG mindset across every function of the organisation are equally important factors in truly driving product growth.\n\nLearn more about PLG\n\nOn October 14th, in partnership with Techpoint Africa, Netcore will be hosting an hour-long physical founders\u2019 meet and greet in Lagos to share more insights on a product-led growth guide, while taking founders through their ecosystem of products.

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe International Day of the Girl Child\n\nPayday\u2019s $1m pre-seed\n\nMy love for bread\n\nSquid Game and startup founders\n\nHappy International Day of the Girl Child\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, tech ecosystems are male-dominated; this makes it unsurprising that most startup founders are men.\n\nAccording to Techpoint Africa\u2019s West African Startup Decade Report 2020, only 10% of startups with a female co-founder have raised $1 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite these statistics, some African women have defied the odds and are gradually turning the tables in the tech scene.\n\nTo celebrate this year\u2019s International Day for the Girl Child, our reporter, Bolu Abiodun, showcases four incredible African women leaving a mark on Africa\u2019s tech history.\n\nListening in on the interviews and watching him prepare his story has been an exciting journey, and I can\u2019t wait to read it.\n\nPlease don\u2019t take my word for it though, watch out for his story later today.\n\nPayday raises $1 million pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavour Ori, CEO, Payday. Source: benjamindada\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Cross-border payments platform, Payday has announced the close of its $1 million pre-seed.\n\nWith over 20 investors participating in the round, some include MAGIC Fund; Emergence Capital; Volition Capital; LoftyInc Capital; Edmund Olotu, Founder of Bloc; Prosper Otemuyiwa, Co-founder of Eden; and Abdul Hassan, Co-founder of Mono.\n\nLaunched in June 2021 by TalentMatch, a talent recruiting company, the platform facilitates cross-border payments from Africa, enables payments between foreign employers and clients, issues virtual cards, and eases payment of tuition and other fees in the US, Canada, and the UK.\n\nLaunched initially as a product under the TalentMatch umbrella, Payday has since evolved into a fintech company currently registered in the US, Canada, and Rwanda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter its launch in June, Payday says it had over 5,000 users and processed over $1.4 million transactions within the first three weeks, with most of its users coming through referrals and \u201cword of mouth\u201d.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, a member of Payday\u2019s advisory board, \u201cPayday\u2019s solution is extremely timely, and it backs up Africa\u2019s agenda of a single market. Making it seamless and easy to pay people in their local currency and through multiple checkout options is a strong boost for AfCFTA.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s bread scarcity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@sonderquest?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Sonder Quest</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/africa-market?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nFirst fun fact: I love bread\n\nSecond fun fact: I recently found out that me and Emmanuel \u2014 Techpoint\u2019s Senior Reporter \u2014 share an uncommon love for bread. If you like bread \u2014 or any other flour-based products \u2014 like the two of us, then you might want to read this.\n\nIn April 2021, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced plans to place wheat and sugar on the list of foods banned from accessing foreign exchange to conserve national dollar reserves and encourage local production.\n\nAnd in June, Bloomberg reported that Nigerian wheat buyers had to turn to the parallel market to get dollars.\n\nLast week, on Monday, October 4, 2021, rumours surfaced that the CBN was closer to implementing these plans, as the apex bank is looking to cut back Nigeria\u2019s annual spend of $2 billion on wheat imports.\n\nSo, what does that mean in a country where as of August 2021, food inflation rates stood at 20.03%?\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics reveal that the average bread prices in Nigeria increased by 20.71% for unsliced bread and 17.25% for sliced bread year on year. As Nigerians \u2014 read I and Emmanuel \u2014 mourn this rise in cost, Intelligence by Techpoint considered the average bread prices over the past 24 months.\n\nYou can see this here.\n\nSquid Game lessons for startup founders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last few weeks, it seems the Internet broke after Netflix\u2019s original movie, Squid Game premiered on September 17, 2021. Written and directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, the film has received a lot of attention since it was released.\n\nSo, full disclaimer: I haven\u2019t seen it yet. But I found a thread on Twitter by Joshua Wong, co-founder, Tokyo Coding Club, about lessons for startup founders and thought I should share. Also, there might be spoilers.\n\nFirst mover advantage? From Episode 1: Red Light, Green Light, Wong draws his first lesson. First mover advantage means that you get to the finish line faster without much competition, but this also means that competitors will learn from your mistakes and play better.\n\nIt\u2019s all in the strategy: One of the six games contestants played was the honeycomb cookie game, where players had to carefully draw out a shape from the cookie without breaking it.\n\nAnd just like participants\u2019 strategy determined if they were successful or not, Wong says this applies to startups as well. He, however, cautions that it might not always work while advising patience in execution.\n\nYou can check out the other four lessons here\n\nWhile trying to make sense of the movie, I found some interesting titbits. Want to make your honeycomb \u2014 dalgona (or ppopgi in Korean) \u2014 cookie?

Source: Supplied\n\nA peculiar situation. It\u2019s interesting how a career path as a recording artist can be full of uncertainty. You start with a passion for your craft, but to stay afloat, you need to find known agents and big record labels and hope to land that dream record deal.\n\nYour biggest woe is either unheard songs or a flash in the pan success. Luck aside, how can a budding artist navigate the crowded world of music business and get exposure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what Nabsolute Media, a media communications and marketing agency based in Nigeria, is looking to do for independent artists with its recently launched platform, SpinHeard.\n\nVictor Okpala, a former music journalist and the founder of Nabsolute Media, understands the massive cost of getting one\u2019s music in front of the right crowd, especially with big name agencies.\n\nWith SpinHeard, independent artists can connect directly with listeners, learn the art of the music business with the starter kit provided when they sign up and get free social media publicity at a subsidised rate. But what\u2019s the economics of this? How does it work?\n\nOur senior reporter, Oluwanifemi, wrote a detailed feature on the SpinHeard launch. Read more here.\n\nUber is now present in five Nigerian cities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? US-based technology company, Uber, known primarily for its ride-hailing service, has announced an expansion into Ibadan and Port Harcourt. With this move, the company is now present in five Nigerian cities, including Lagos, Benin City, and Abuja.\n\nAs much as these expansions mean more transportation options and employment opportunities for prospective drivers, I wonder if we would see a repeat of several events.\n\nRecall that in April, Uber and Bolt drivers in Lagos went on a warning strike to protest the high commission fees they had to pay, which led to Uber increasing the prices for riders in Lagos.\n\nTwo-edged competition? On the one hand, competition between autonomous vehicles offering ride-hailing services and Uber is expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, because traditional cabs are much cheaper in these cities, they might retain their hold regardless of Uber\u2019s presence. And with Bolt available in 24 Nigerian cities, including Ibadan and Port Harcourt, it won\u2019t be surprising if there is stiff competition between these parties.\n\nUber\u2019s giveaway: To mark this latest foray, the platform is giving a 50% discount off eight trips with the codes MOVEIBCITY and MOVEPHCITY for riders in Ibadan and Port Harcourt, respectively.\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed round will be used to bolster cross-border payments infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Klasha\u2019s Founder\n\nFirst, the news: Klasha, a US-based, Africa-focused cross-border payments startup, has announced raising $2.4m in seed investment.\n\nLed by American VC firm Greycroft, the round saw participation from 2.12 Angels, AVG Basecamp Fund, Berrywood Capital, Seedcamp, Plug and Play, Practical VC, MiLA Capital, First Fund, and Expert Dojo. Some Angel Investors also partook, including former TechCrunch\u2018s Head of Product, Santosh Ankola.\n\nWhat does Klasha do? Jessica Anuna founded the company in 2018 as a platform for Africans to shop for fashion items on online stores globally.\n\nAt present, however, it allows Africans to make online and offline purchases in their local currencies using cards, bank accounts, and mobile money providers like M-Pesa, while the merchants receive payment in their currencies in two business days.\n\nThe startup also partners with third-party logistics companies to help merchants in Europe and the US ship to Africa in five to nine working days.\n\nNotable eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce and OpenCart have integrated Klasha\u2019s plugins, with the startup also having an official partnership with BigCommerce.\n\nWith this seed financing, the startup wants to build plugin libraries that will be integrated into platforms like Zara, ASOS, and H&M to enable payments across Africa. Also, plans to foray beyond Nigeria into three African countries are underway.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Attention Diet. Read.\n\nCrazy New Ideas.

          "title": "Buhari\u2019s insatiable appetite for debt",
          "text": "There is ample data showing that no government in the history of Nigeria has been so intoxicated on debt accumulation like the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Nigeria\u2019s debt stock has tripled under the current administration to N35 trillion as at June 2021.\n\nData from the DMO show that Nigeria\u2019s foreign debts rose from $18.904 billion in 1985 to $28.718 billion in 1993 when General Ibrahim Babangida ruled the country. It expanded to $35.944 billion at the end of 2005. One year later, Nigeria\u2019s debt stock fell to $3.544 billion after the country paid off a large chunk of its debt and received substantial reprieve in a debt management scheme championed by former President Olusegun Obasanajo and his then Finance Minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.\n\nNigeria\u2019s government says debt is the only credible route to catalyse development.\n\nThe country is already one of the most heavily indebted countries in Africa. The World Bank recently ranked Nigeria fifth on the list of 10 countries to which it has the highest debt exposure.\n\nThe country\u2019s debt stock, says Uche Igwe, a Senior Political Economy Analyst and Visiting Fellow at the LSE Firoz Lalji Centre for Africa, \u201chas recently become a cause for worry among citizens, especially considering declining revenue as a result of the fluctuating price of oil. According to the figures from the Debt Management Office (DMO), Nigeria\u2019s debt profile had risen to 31.009 trillion naira (USD 85.897 billion) as of June 2020. The apprehension of many observers is whether the projects financed by these loans may not have any meaningful impact on the economy, like the construction of the railway to Maradi in nearby Niger Republic at a whopping cost of US1.96 billion\u201d.\n\nEarly this month, Nigeria\u2019s President requested Senate approval for a plan to borrow more than 4 billion USD from international lenders for infrastructure projects, adding to a series of borrowings that have characterised the fiscal policy of the government.\n\n\u201cThe projects listed in the external borrowing plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency, EXIM Bank and IFAD in the total sum of $4,054,476,863 and \u20ac710 million and grant components of $125 million,\u201d Buhari informed the senate.\n\nThe nation\u2019s external debt stock could hit over $36 billion if the National Assembly approves the $4.054 billion new borrowings requested by Nigeria\u2019s government.\n\nNigeria\u2019s mounting debt profile is a major concern despite the country having about $900 billion worth of dead capital in properties and agricultural lands as noted in a 2019 PwC Nigeria report.\n\nA source of worry is the continuous deterioration in the country\u2019s macroeconomic performance. Nigeria\u2019s economic growth fell from 11.9% in 2015 to 0.51% in Q1 2021, and then rose to 5.01% in Q2 2021.\n\nThe rate of inflation rose from 9% to 17.38% during the same period, while the unemployment rate jumped from 9% in 2015 to 33% in 2021. The naira has depreciated by over 200% between 2015 and 2021.\n\n\u201cCriminal!\u201d, was how former President Olusegun Obasanjo who in 2006 paid off Nigeria\u2019s external debts described Mr. Buhari\u2019s insatiable appetite for external loans, noting that, while borrowing was not a problem in itself, \u201cwhat could be a problem would be what one is borrowing for and the plan or capacity to pay back.\n\n\u201cBut if you are borrowing and accumulating debts for the next generation and the next generation after them, it is criminal. What are you borrowing for?\n\n\u201cIf we are borrowing for recurrent expenditure, it is the height of folly. If we are borrowing for development that can pay for itself, that is understandable. Then the payment, how long will it take to pay itself?\u201d\n\nThe former president recalled that in 1999 when he came to power, the country was spending $3.5 billion to service debts that kept on increasing.\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe economy has failed to grow fast enough to accommodate its bulging population since 2015, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of uncertainty, largely due to policy inconsistencies, about where people should invest. This cuts across various economic sectors.Since the current government came into power in 2015, there has been a lot of policy change with the \u201ccommand and control\u201d posture adopted in managing the economy,\u201dsays Ndubisi Nwokoma, a Professor of Economics at the University of Lagos. In a report for \u201cThe Conversation\u201d, Mr. Nwokoma added, \u201cthese policy somersaults have caused capital flight. The political uncertainty played a role in the downward trend of markets. In the equities market, huge foreign portfolio investments were lost to the economy. There has also been a downturn in portfolio investments, fixed capital investment, foreign direct investments and capital importation\u2026The result has been job losses and the dwindling capacity to create jobs\u201d.\n\nThe last six years have been characterised by rising rates of unemployment and inflation, falling GDP and its attendant dwindling per capita income, poor investment in infrastructure, poorer standard of living, financial uncertainties and a general state of economic hopelessness.\n\nThe outcomes have been debilitating for Nigeria\u2019s economy and people.\n\nIn 2020, the Nigerian economy shrank by 1.8%, its deepest decline since 1983, driven by capital outflows, intensified risk aversion, low oil prices, and shrinking foreign remittances. Though the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01% (year-on-year) in real terms in the second quarter of 2021, it followed a slew of negative and low growths over a five year period\n\nUnemployment in the country has ballooned to one of the highest in the world. Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, show that the unemployment rate in Nigeria rose from 27.1 percent to 33.3 percent from December to March 2021.\n\nWith a third of Nigerians out of jobs and unable to contribute meaningfully to the economic process, poverty has grown exponentially.\n\nIn 2018, the country overtook India to become the poverty capital of the world. It is estimated that over half of Nigeria\u2019s population live in poverty. Buhari says he wants to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by 2030\n\nThe most widely experienced shocks in the country continue to be increases in the prices of both major food items consumed (affecting 90% of households) and farming/business inputs (affecting 64% of households), says the World Bank\n\n\u201cNigeria, said Shubham Chaudhuri, the World Bank Country Director for Nigeria in a June 2021 report of the bank, \u201cfaces interlinked challenges in relation to inflation, limited job opportunities, and insecurity\u201d.\n\nMeeting with members of his Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) in September 2020, Buhari posited, \u201cwe have so many challenges with infrastructure. We just have to take loans to do roads, rail and power, so that investors will find us attractive and come here to put their money.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria\u2019s total public debt profile, including domestic debt, stood at $63,806.45. By June 2021, this had increased to $86,571.80 according to DMO statistics.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s debt to hit N38.68trn in 2021 \u2013 Finance minister\n\nCurrently, the country\u2019s outstanding debts amount to about a quarter of its economic output. The International Monetary Fund recently warned that without major revenue reforms, the debts could rise to almost 36 percent of GDP by 2024, with interest payments taking as much as 75 percent of government revenue.\n\nThe problem, says Emmanuel Onwubiko, the President of Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), is that the \u201cMuhammadu Buhari-led administration has done badly in the area of building up of national wealth and prosperity but has concentrated on borrowings from all sorts of places to be used in servicing the huge salaries of the multiple officials and politicians parading about as members of the Federal Government\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNigeria maintained a healthy record as a Country that was somehow prosperous and not encumbered by foreign loans up until the emergence of the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration in 2015\u201d.\n\nHowever, Nigeria\u2019s government asserts that the country does not have a debt problem. Finance, Budget and National Planning Minister Zainab Ahmed said in 2019 \u201cI hear people say Nigeria has a debt problem. We don\u2019t have a debt problem. What we have is a revenue challenge and the whole of this government is currently working on how to enhance our revenues, to ensure that we meet our obligation to service the government as well as to service debt.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s total debt stock (foreign & domestic), as released by the Debt Management Office (DMO) as at June 2021 stood at N35.465 trillion as of June 30.\n\nAs of March 31, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s total public debt stock was N33.107 trillion, or 87.239 billion USD.\n\nBetween the end of the first quarter and the end of the second quarter, the debt stock increased by N2.358 trillion.\n\nThe external debt, according to a breakdown of the national debt under review, was N13.711 trillion, or 38.66%, Domestic debt, on the other hand, was N21.754 trillion, accounting for 61.34% of the entire stock.\n\nMultilateral institutions (World Bank Group and African Development Bank Group) own the majority of the debt, accounting for 54.88%, while Commercial debt (Eurobonds and Diaspora bonds) came in second with 31.88%, followed by bilateral debt (China, France, Japan, India, and Germany) with 12.70%. Promissory Notes account for 0.54% of the total.\n\nAnother Debt Trap, perhaps?\n\nIt was in 2006 that Nigeria exited the infamous debt trap represented by the Paris Club of creditors when the country through dexterous economic management and negotiations paid off a substantial chunk of its debt and had a large part written off.\n\nUnder Buhari, the country runs the risk of entering another debt trap if it keeps borrowing to fill the needs of recurring expenditure.\n\nNigeria\u2019s ability to meet its debt obligations in the future is a serious cause for concern. Debt repayments, say Professor Stephen Onyiewu, the Andrew Wells Robertson Professor of Economics at Allegheny College, Pennsylvania, \u201care often made from revenue generation. At less than 5%, Nigeria has one of the lowest revenue-GDP ratios in Africa. The average for sub-Saharan African countries is almost 20%, and 30% for oil exporters\u201d.\n\nHe noted that about 65% of government revenue and over 90% of foreign exchange earnings in Nigeria comes from the oil sector. Uncertainties in the global oil market and sluggish revenue growth, as well as the negative impacts of COVID-19 on the economy, imply that the country would face challenges generating enough revenue to service its debt.\n\n\u201cBy October last year,\u201d he further noted, \u201conly 64% of the revenue expected from oil had been generated. Meanwhile, government expenditures have been growing faster than expected, meaning that the deficits will be covered by borrowings. More borrowings means that an increasing proportion of revenues generated will be devoted to debt service\u201d.\n\nAnother source of worry about Nigeria, he believes, \u201cmay be related to the continuous deterioration in the country\u2019s macroeconomic performance during the past five years. Creditors are often concerned about debtor countries whose economies are not well managed, and perceive them as risky borrowers. Nigeria\u2019s economic growth fell from 11.9% in 2015 to 2.2% in 2019, and then turned to negative 1.8% in 2020 because of COVID-19\u201d.\n\nPat Utomi, Professor of Social and Political Economy at the Pan-Atlantic University warned in a recent interview with Channels TV, that Nigeria was going through a very trying period.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for statesmen to emerge\u201d, He said. The Nigerian economy is not growing in any way or shape that can accommodate its needs, population growth, etc. It means that in terms of absolute numbers of people living in poverty, this is one of the most terrible places to live in on earth.\n\n\u201cIn terms of statistic\u2019s being said, yes, in an absolute sense, the fact of borrowing $4 billion is not necessarily something that will kill Nigeria, even though if you look at how much of our revenues go into servicing debt, you have to worry.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is a converse point here. This country needs to grow like crazy, and it cannot grow unless you invest. The real issue is the targeting of borrowed funds.\n\n\u201cAm I convinced that the targeting is enough to drive the kind of growth that will facilitate the economy to grow in a sustainable manner? I have not been given enough information to believe that it is the case.\u201d\n\nMr. Utomi further noted that one of the reasons Nigeria is where it is today, \u201cis that oil price dropped during the heat of last year, compounded by supply chain challenges brought about by the lockdown, which led to revenue shortfall of a significant nature because we have failed to do something we said we are doing, which is to diversify the base of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cDo I see the plans that these borrowings will facilitate the diversification of the economy? My straight answer is No, I do not see the plan.\n\n\u201cWe need to develop a clear nation strategy, which looks at how growth can take place in a sustainable manner in this economy, then we can borrow, twice or three times as much as we are borrowing, and I won\u2019t be afraid,\u201d\n\nKingsley Moghalu, a former Deputy Governor of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank, in a reaction to Mr. Buhari\u2019s latest request for sovereign and private lenders\u2019 loan, warned that, \u201cthe rate at which Nigeria\u2019s public debt has increased in the last six years is unprecedented, alarming, and unsustainable. From $10.31 billion at the end of June 2015, the total external debt increased to $32.85 billion at the end of March 2021, which represents a 218 per cent increase.\n\n\u201cThe total outstanding public debt stock increased by 173 per cent in the same period, from N12.11 trillion to N33.10 trillion. On the average, over N3.6 trillion is being added to the public debt annually,\u201d the former U.N official said.\n\n\u201cThis massive borrowing\u201d, he added, \u201cand the infrastructure investment that has been used to justify it, have grossly under-performed. Instead of delivering economic growth, the economy has been in recession twice, and when out of it, growth has been underwhelming at 2 per cent at best.\n\n\u201cAnd rather than the debt-funded infrastructure projects creating an ample number of jobs for the citizens, the national unemployment rate has increased to 33.1 percent while youth unemployment has reached 42.5 per cent\u201d.\n\nIn March this year, the federal government took a 1.5 billion USD loan from the Africa Import-Export Bank to fund the rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt refinery, a move many lampooned as a waste of time and resources since borrowing money at a time of dire economic constraints like this to fix the refineries would only dig the nation deeper into the debt trap.\n\nFor former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, it is \u201can unwise use of scarce funds.\u201d\n\nWhat have we done with the loans borrowed so far?\n\nIn December 2019, the International Monetary Fund warned that frontier economies such as Nigeria had pushed global debt to $188 trillion. According to the IMF, the average debt ratio declined in advanced economies but with no significant reduction in debt. \u201cIn emerging market economies and low-income developing countries, the average debt ratios rose further. Notably, China\u2019s total debt ratio reached 258 per cent of GDP at end-2018 the same as the United States and nearing the average for advanced economies, which was 265 per cent\u201d.\n\nMuhammad Enagi, Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign and Local Debts, in March 2020, aptly noted that, \u201cthe big question in the minds of average Nigerians aware of this fact is, what did we do with the money? In other words, where did the money go? What do we have to show as a people for these huge debts?\u201d\n\nHe explained that borrowing has always served as veritable financial platforms for many countries of the world in running their economies but judiciously utilising such loans for intended projects and servicing the debts appropriately have also been problems for developing countries like Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, realities on the ground in the country in terms of required infrastructures and debts accumulations between 2006 and now appear unappealing. The very reason, he explained, that many Nigerians are worried whenever they hear that their government is seeking one loan or the other.\n\nThe Nigerian government says it is building roads and rails with the loans. The APC last year claimed that over 900 roads across the country were being built or rehabilitated by the government.\n\nTransport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi in May this year admitted that rail lines are not viable means to pay back loans taken from China and other foreign countries for their construction.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at economic viability, I am not aware of anywhere in the world\u2026Please help furnish me with the information where rail lines have been used to pay back such loans.\n\n\u201cNowhere in the world. If you leave the rail as it is, it is not economically viable in terms of cash. What makes its economic viability is the fact that it provides services for those who are involved in other economic activities,\u201d Mr Amaechi said.\n\nWho pays back the debts?\n\nIke Brannon, a Senior Fellow with the Jack Kemp Foundation, in a 2019 analysis for Forbes, posited that \u201cNigeria\u2019s biggest economic problem, though and the issue that requires real political acceptance from Buhari\u2019s government is the country\u2019s growing public debt.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015 President Buhari\u2019s government has added considerably to the nation\u2019s debt, which now exceeds $85 billion. In essence, the nation\u2019s debt is about where it was in 2005-06, just before Nigeria benefited from massive debt relief as part of a program coordinated by the Paris Club, IMF, World Bank and the African Development Bank. To have squandered the debt reduction in just 14 years and have no tangible economic progress to show for it is beyond disappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria will not owe anybody in the Paris Club one kobo,\u201d former President Olusegun Obasanjo had said in a statement after Nigeria paid a final instalment of $4.5 billion to the Paris Club of creditors in a deal that allowed the country to pay off about $30 billion in accumulated debt for about $12 billion, an overall discount of about 60 per cent. The country committed to using foreign reserves, salted away as oil prices soared, to cancel its debt, which had been racked up during decades of military rule.\n\nSadly, it is clear now that future governments and generations of Nigerians will have to work hard to pay off debts largely accumulated under one man",

          "text": "There is ample data showing that no government in the history of Nigeria has been so intoxicated on debt accumulation like the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Nigeria\u2019s debt stock has tripled under the current administration to N35 trillion as at June 2021.\n\nData from the DMO show that Nigeria\u2019s foreign debts rose from $18.904 billion in 1985 to $28.718 billion in 1993 when General Ibrahim Babangida ruled the country. It expanded to $35.944 billion at the end of 2005. One year later, Nigeria\u2019s debt stock fell to $3.544 billion after the country paid off a large chunk of its debt and received substantial reprieve in a debt management scheme championed by former President Olusegun Obasanajo and his then Finance Minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.\n\nNigeria\u2019s government says debt is the only credible route to catalyse development.\n\nThe country is already one of the most heavily indebted countries in Africa. The World Bank recently ranked Nigeria fifth on the list of 10 countries to which it has the highest debt exposure.\n\nThe country\u2019s debt stock, says Uche Igwe, a Senior Political Economy Analyst and Visiting Fellow at the LSE Firoz Lalji Centre for Africa, \u201chas recently become a cause for worry among citizens, especially considering declining revenue as a result of the fluctuating price of oil. According to the figures from the Debt Management Office (DMO), Nigeria\u2019s debt profile had risen to 31.009 trillion naira (USD 85.897 billion) as of June 2020. The apprehension of many observers is whether the projects financed by these loans may not have any meaningful impact on the economy, like the construction of the railway to Maradi in nearby Niger Republic at a whopping cost of US1.96 billion\u201d.\n\nEarly this month, Nigeria\u2019s President requested Senate approval for a plan to borrow more than 4 billion USD from international lenders for infrastructure projects, adding to a series of borrowings that have characterised the fiscal policy of the government.\n\n\u201cThe projects listed in the external borrowing plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency, EXIM Bank and IFAD in the total sum of $4,054,476,863 and \u20ac710 million and grant components of $125 million,\u201d Buhari informed the senate.\n\nThe nation\u2019s external debt stock could hit over $36 billion if the National Assembly approves the $4.054 billion new borrowings requested by Nigeria\u2019s government.\n\nNigeria\u2019s mounting debt profile is a major concern despite the country having about $900 billion worth of dead capital in properties and agricultural lands as noted in a 2019 PwC Nigeria report.\n\nA source of worry is the continuous deterioration in the country\u2019s macroeconomic performance. Nigeria\u2019s economic growth fell from 11.9% in 2015 to 0.51% in Q1 2021, and then rose to 5.01% in Q2 2021.\n\nThe rate of inflation rose from 9% to 17.38% during the same period, while the unemployment rate jumped from 9% in 2015 to 33% in 2021. The naira has depreciated by over 200% between 2015 and 2021.\n\n\u201cCriminal!\u201d, was how former President Olusegun Obasanjo who in 2006 paid off Nigeria\u2019s external debts described Mr. Buhari\u2019s insatiable appetite for external loans, noting that, while borrowing was not a problem in itself, \u201cwhat could be a problem would be what one is borrowing for and the plan or capacity to pay back.\n\n\u201cBut if you are borrowing and accumulating debts for the next generation and the next generation after them, it is criminal. What are you borrowing for?\n\n\u201cIf we are borrowing for recurrent expenditure, it is the height of folly. If we are borrowing for development that can pay for itself, that is understandable. Then the payment, how long will it take to pay itself?\u201d\n\nThe former president recalled that in 1999 when he came to power, the country was spending $3.5 billion to service debts that kept on increasing.\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe economy has failed to grow fast enough to accommodate its bulging population since 2015, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of uncertainty, largely due to policy inconsistencies, about where people should invest. This cuts across various economic sectors.Since the current government came into power in 2015, there has been a lot of policy change with the \u201ccommand and control\u201d posture adopted in managing the economy,\u201dsays Ndubisi Nwokoma, a Professor of Economics at the University of Lagos. In a report for \u201cThe Conversation\u201d, Mr. Nwokoma added, \u201cthese policy somersaults have caused capital flight. The political uncertainty played a role in the downward trend of markets. In the equities market, huge foreign portfolio investments were lost to the economy. There has also been a downturn in portfolio investments, fixed capital investment, foreign direct investments and capital importation\u2026The result has been job losses and the dwindling capacity to create jobs\u201d.\n\nThe last six years have been characterised by rising rates of unemployment and inflation, falling GDP and its attendant dwindling per capita income, poor investment in infrastructure, poorer standard of living, financial uncertainties and a general state of economic hopelessness.\n\nThe outcomes have been debilitating for Nigeria\u2019s economy and people.\n\nIn 2020, the Nigerian economy shrank by 1.8%, its deepest decline since 1983, driven by capital outflows, intensified risk aversion, low oil prices, and shrinking foreign remittances. Though the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01% (year-on-year) in real terms in the second quarter of 2021, it followed a slew of negative and low growths over a five year period\n\nUnemployment in the country has ballooned to one of the highest in the world. Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, show that the unemployment rate in Nigeria rose from 27.1 percent to 33.3 percent from December to March 2021.\n\nWith a third of Nigerians out of jobs and unable to contribute meaningfully to the economic process, poverty has grown exponentially.\n\nIn 2018, the country overtook India to become the poverty capital of the world. It is estimated that over half of Nigeria\u2019s population live in poverty. Buhari says he wants to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by 2030\n\nThe most widely experienced shocks in the country continue to be increases in the prices of both major food items consumed (affecting 90% of households) and farming/business inputs (affecting 64% of households), says the World Bank\n\n\u201cNigeria, said Shubham Chaudhuri, the World Bank Country Director for Nigeria in a June 2021 report of the bank, \u201cfaces interlinked challenges in relation to inflation, limited job opportunities, and insecurity\u201d.\n\nMeeting with members of his Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) in September 2020, Buhari posited, \u201cwe have so many challenges with infrastructure. We just have to take loans to do roads, rail and power, so that investors will find us attractive and come here to put their money.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Nigeria\u2019s total public debt profile, including domestic debt, stood at $63,806.45. By June 2021, this had increased to $86,571.80 according to DMO statistics.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s debt to hit N38.68trn in 2021 \u2013 Finance minister\n\nCurrently, the country\u2019s outstanding debts amount to about a quarter of its economic output.

Instead of delivering economic growth, the economy has been in recession twice, and when out of it, growth has been underwhelming at 2 per cent at best.\n\n\u201cAnd rather than the debt-funded infrastructure projects creating an ample number of jobs for the citizens, the national unemployment rate has increased to 33.1 percent while youth unemployment has reached 42.5 per cent\u201d.\n\nIn March this year, the federal government took a 1.5 billion USD loan from the Africa Import-Export Bank to fund the rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt refinery, a move many lampooned as a waste of time and resources since borrowing money at a time of dire economic constraints like this to fix the refineries would only dig the nation deeper into the debt trap.\n\nFor former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, it is \u201can unwise use of scarce funds.\u201d\n\nWhat have we done with the loans borrowed so far?\n\nIn December 2019, the International Monetary Fund warned that frontier economies such as Nigeria had pushed global debt to $188 trillion. According to the IMF, the average debt ratio declined in advanced economies but with no significant reduction in debt. \u201cIn emerging market economies and low-income developing countries, the average debt ratios rose further. Notably, China\u2019s total debt ratio reached 258 per cent of GDP at end-2018 the same as the United States and nearing the average for advanced economies, which was 265 per cent\u201d.\n\nMuhammad Enagi, Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign and Local Debts, in March 2020, aptly noted that, \u201cthe big question in the minds of average Nigerians aware of this fact is, what did we do with the money? In other words, where did the money go? What do we have to show as a people for these huge debts?\u201d\n\nHe explained that borrowing has always served as veritable financial platforms for many countries of the world in running their economies but judiciously utilising such loans for intended projects and servicing the debts appropriately have also been problems for developing countries like Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, realities on the ground in the country in terms of required infrastructures and debts accumulations between 2006 and now appear unappealing. The very reason, he explained, that many Nigerians are worried whenever they hear that their government is seeking one loan or the other.\n\nThe Nigerian government says it is building roads and rails with the loans. The APC last year claimed that over 900 roads across the country were being built or rehabilitated by the government.\n\nTransport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi in May this year admitted that rail lines are not viable means to pay back loans taken from China and other foreign countries for their construction.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at economic viability, I am not aware of anywhere in the world\u2026Please help furnish me with the information where rail lines have been used to pay back such loans.\n\n\u201cNowhere in the world. If you leave the rail as it is, it is not economically viable in terms of cash. What makes its economic viability is the fact that it provides services for those who are involved in other economic activities,\u201d Mr Amaechi said.\n\nWho pays back the debts?\n\nIke Brannon, a Senior Fellow with the Jack Kemp Foundation, in a 2019 analysis for Forbes, posited that \u201cNigeria\u2019s biggest economic problem, though and the issue that requires real political acceptance from Buhari\u2019s government is the country\u2019s growing public debt.\n\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015 President Buhari\u2019s government has added considerably to the nation\u2019s debt, which now exceeds $85 billion. In essence, the nation\u2019s debt is about where it was in 2005-06, just before Nigeria benefited from massive debt relief as part of a program coordinated by the Paris Club, IMF, World Bank and the African Development Bank. To have squandered the debt reduction in just 14 years and have no tangible economic progress to show for it is beyond disappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria will not owe anybody in the Paris Club one kobo,\u201d former President Olusegun Obasanjo had said in a statement after Nigeria paid a final instalment of $4.5 billion to the Paris Club of creditors in a deal that allowed the country to pay off about $30 billion in accumulated debt for about $12 billion, an overall discount of about 60 per cent. The country committed to using foreign reserves, salted away as oil prices soared, to cancel its debt, which had been racked up during decades of military rule.\n\nSadly, it is clear now that future governments and generations of Nigerians will have to work hard to pay off debts largely accumulated under one man",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s debt stock has tripled under the current administration to N35 trillion as at June 2021.\nThe World Bank recently ranked Nigeria fifth on the list of 10 countries to which it has the highest debt exposure.\nAccording to the figures from the Debt Management Office (DMO), Nigeria\u2019s debt profile had risen to 31.009 trillion naira (USD 85.897 billion) as of June 2020.\nNigeria\u2019s economic growth fell from 11.9% in 2015 to 0.51% in Q1 2021, and then rose to 5.01% in Q2 2021.\n\u201cSince assuming office in 2015 President Buhari\u2019s government has added considerably to the nation\u2019s debt, which now exceeds $85 billion.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s 2022 Budget: Where is the Money Going?\n\nNigeria\u2019s minister of finance, budget and national planning, Zainab Ahmed, made a presentation Friday on how the 2022 budget will be allocated.\n\nHere are the highlights from the presentation:\n\nThe Federal Government\u2019s aggregate expenditure for next year, the total money to be spent on salaries, project-tied loans and government owned enterprise is projected to cost N16.39 trillion.\n\nRecurrent (non-debt) spending on items such as repairs and maintenance, operational costs, administrative costs is estimated at N6.83trillion and makes up 41.7% of the total expenditure.\n\nAggregate Capital Expenditure of N5.35trillion is 32.7% of total expenditure. This is made up of spending on Government Owned Enterprises, Capital and Project-tied loans expenditures and Capital component Statutory Transfers.\n\nAt N3.16tn, the repayment of loans or debt servicing gulps 22% of the total expenditure and 35.6% of total revenues.\n\nThe provision to retire maturing bonds to local contractors/suppliers of 292.7 billion is 1.79% of total expenditures. This is to payoff backlog of contractual arrears dating back over a decade.\n\nThe overall budget deficit is N6.26 trillion. This represents 38% of the total budget and 3.39% of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria risks N10.82trn deficit in 2022 on unrealistic revenue target\n\nThe deficit will be financed mainly by borrowings from domestic sources (N2.51 trillion), foreign sources (N2.51 trillion), and Multi-lateral/Bi-lateral loan drawdowns (N1.16 trillion).\n\nThe Defence & Security Sector (at N2.41 trillion) takes 15% of Budget. This amount provides for the Military, Police, Intelligence and Para-Military.\n\nInfrastructure which include the provisions for Works, Housing, Power, Transport, Water Resources, and Aviation sectors account for 8.9% of the budget (at N1.451 trillion).\n\nSocial Development & Poverty Reduction Programmes takes 5.3% of the budget (at N863 billion). This is the amount provisioned to cater for Social Investments and Poverty reduction programmes.\n\nThe Health Sector will be allocated 5% of total FGN Budget (at N820.2 billion). From this 5%, N711.28bn is the amount provisioned for Federal Ministry of Health and its agencies. N54.87bn for immunization funds, including Counterpart Funding for Donor Supported Programmes, and Global Funds. N54.05 billion will be transferred to Basic Healthcare Provision Fund\n\nThe education sector will receive N1.29 trillion (7.9% of FGN Budget) N875.93.85 billion is provisioned for Federal Ministry of Education and its agencies. N108.10 billion was earmarked for Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) and N306.00bn will be given to the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) for infrastructure projects in Tertiary Institutions.\n\nFrom the Minister\u2019s presentation, increase in national expenditure was stimulated by the need to provide for additional and unavoidable critical expenses as well as the need to present an all-inclusive FGN Budget.\n\nAlso, the IMF posits that low income developing countries\u2019 GDP Growth is projected to accelerate by 3.9% in 2021, and 4.9% in 2022.\n\nThese projections indicate global economy will recover from COVID 19 induced contraction in 2021. Growth is projected to be moderate beyond 2022, thus giving a ray of hope for increase in internally generated revenues.\n\nBorrowings are essential for Capital Expenditure and Human Development, as specified in Section 41(1)a of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. The Federal Government resorts to borrowing to finance fiscal gaps with believing that the debt level is still within sustainable limits.\n\nThe purpose for the forum was to harness citizen\u2019s participation and feedback to improve the budget for 2022.",

Over the years, the innovation cluster has attracted multiple local and international partnerships to launch thousands of young people in Edo State into careers in technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome international organizations that are already in partnership with Edo State Skills Development Agency in this regard include Amazon, Microsoft and ButterflyWorks,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki said with the progress made in driving technology and innovation through Edo Innovates, it has become vital to set up a board to help place the hub strategically in the heart of the government\u2019s promise to the Edo youths.\n\nHe noted that the key purpose of the Edo Innovates Board of Directors is to serve as the overarching layer in the governance structure of Edo Innovates, providing strategic policy guidance, strengthening the governance structure to re-assure existing and new stakeholders and support the government\u2019s objectives of a thriving hub.\n\nHe said some of the government\u2019s objectives for the board is to \u201cEstablish a PPP model for the hub; encourage and support private sector participation in the delivery of skills and other activities of Edo Innovates; oversee the ongoing activities and perform an institutional review of Edo Innovates; attract more world-class partners to increase investment in building talent in the state and scale up existing initiatives to other locations within the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cIn order to achieve this, the Board will be overseeing the implementation of the World Bank EdoBEST DLIs, which are focused on strengthening the good work going on at Edo Innovates.\n\n\u201cOne of our priorities for the EdoBEST project is the establishment of two additional hubs and it is important that they remain under an umbrella body that can provide transparent governance, especially with the issuance of grant funding.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to the establishment of private sector partnerships to leverage the resources and expertise of global and regional tech companies, foundations, and innovation networks to attract new skills development and entrepreneurship programmes to Edo State.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, this team will advise me on more ways to position the state to deliver digital skills and entrepreneurship training programs that are aligned with private sector needs.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt was the first few days of December, 2015 and the weather was still too chilly with the early signs of Harmattan.\n\nI got an SMS from a number saying I had been admitted to study Film at the National Film Institute, Jos.\n\nIt was such an exhilarating experience. Finally, I was going to make something of my passion for storytelling. Over the next few weeks, I accepted the admission, paid my school fees and commenced registration.\n\nIn the course of my study, a number of my school\u2019s staff often advised us \u2013 especially those of us who were offered admission by the school \u2013 to go and print out our original JAMB admission letter, also known as \u201cregularization\u201d if we want to go for the mandatory one year National Youth Service. But, when you\u2019re a freshman studying a four year course, graduation seems to be so far away.\n\nAnd so many of us didn\u2019t do it at the time. This has come to bite us literally and figuratively.\n\nToday, I was supposed to have been mobilized for the mandatory one year National Youth Service Corp, NYSC, but that hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nMost of my classmates whom I graduated with have all gone and are serving right now as I speak: some in Batch B Stream 1 and others in Batch B Stream 2.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t I gone is the question I and those close to me, are asking.\n\nOn the surface, it\u2019s because I\u2019m yet to have my original JAMB admission letter, but, deep down, there\u2019s more to this than meets the eye.\n\nIs the regularisation real or hoax? If you go to any JAMB office nationwide, they will tell you that they have stopped regularization. But the same JAMB collects the sum of five thousand (N5,000) naira from students for this service.\n\nI first got to know about this through an article on The Nation Newspaper, The University of Jos vs. JAMB, where a JAMB spokesperson referred students with issues of regularization to go back to their school and resolve the issue.\n\nIn his words, \u201cJAMB stopped doing Regularization since 2017\u201d.\n\nI got admission to study film at the National Film Institute, Jos in 2015.\n\nNow, this admission was given by the Institute and I was supposed to go and \u201cregularize\u201d the admission with JAMB.\n\nBeing a newbie, I went several times to JAMB office and several cyber cafe\u2019s around but, I didn\u2019t understand what I was supposed to do.\n\nSeverally, I tried to check my admission status but it wouldn\u2019t go through. It was until I graduated that I understood what I was supposed to do and by this time it came with a warning that unless I did it, I wouldn\u2019t be going for service.\n\nI started doing the Regularization by March 2020 but, before I could pay, Nigeria went on lockdown and with the lockdown, JAMB payment portal was closed.\n\nIt was not until late October 2020 that it was opened and I succeeded in regularizing on November 2nd, 2020.\n\nFrom November 2nd, 2020 up till now, I still haven\u2019t received my original JAMB admission letter.\n\nWhen I asked what was the issue, my school, The National Film Institute, said that it was because JAMB has refused to send the PIN with which the University of Jos (which we are affiliated to) will use in printing it.\n\nBut what is the struggle for printing admission letter really all about? Before 2016, Universities nationwide offer provisional admission to Students\u2019.\n\nIn 2016, JAMB began offering admission to Students and with this every avenue some Universities used to make money like offering admission to some students in exchange for huge sums of money became a thing of the past.\n\nMost University authorities didn\u2019t like this and in 2021, they convinced JAMB to focus on just conducting the exams and leave the admission to them.\n\nThe University of Jos is one of the beneficiaries of this. With access granted to the University of Jos to print the admission letter, I thought my days of sorrow were over.\n\nI have called Paulina Yache, the Institute\u2019s contact person in charge of Regularization severally but, she too ran out of excuses and referred me to a Mr. Bitrus Gofup, in charge of regularization at the University of Jos.\n\nMr. Bitrus Gofup has been a torn in my flesh and in the flesh of other Students with the same issue. On the surface, Mr. Bitrus Gofup, a middle-aged junior staff at the Exams Office of the University appears as a genial and considerate father-figure who is out there to help students but deep down he is as corrupt as they come.\n\nI called him severally and he continued to assure me that my original JAMB admission letter has been sent to JAMB and that very soon it will be out, only for me to go to his office on Thursday October 6th, 2022 to discover that my name was not on the list of students that will be mobilized for service during the Batch C registration. In fact, there was no evidence to suggest that he has worked on my file, nor minuted on it.\n\nThis was after receiving assurances from him that he has sent our names to JAMB and that we should be patient that we will soon have our original JAMB admission letters.\n\nIf he\u2019s lying in order to get us very desperate to bribe him, it wouldn\u2019t be far from the truth. One of our classmates and friend who has the same regularisation problem told me that her friend gave Mr Bitrus Gofup the sum of N10,000 to fast track the process for him. Another classmate of mine, said she gave him the sum of N5000, but up till now both of these students are yet to have their original JAMB admission letters, or gone for service.\n\nWe are tired of all this. I have spoken to several Professors on this matter. I have also spoken to the Rector of my school. I have written to the Acting Vice Chancellor of the University of Jos, Professor Ejikeme, but, have gotten no reply.\n\nRight now, we are at a loss how to move forward. We just want to have this sorted out so that we know if we should go get a job or just run abroad.\n\n________________\n\nOgochukwu Umeadi, writer-designer wrote from Jos.\n\n...",

          "title": "Pandora Papers: Ex-governors, ex-minister, others kept N117 billion assets in two tax haven banks",
          "text": "In Nigeria, about four in 10 persons may be poor, with the figure reaching about nine in ten in some states, as they earn less than N377 daily, according to a 2019 estimate by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), but not these Nigerians.\n\nNot many of them would be seen on the Forbes\u2019 wealthiest list, but these 21 Nigerians are worth a treasure.\n\nAccording to filings of their businesses with their offshore financial managers, Trident Trust Company (BVI) Limited, as of October 2016, they had a combined treasure worth about $100 million and \u00a377.3 million in assets, cash, bonds, equities, mutual funds and property holdings controlled by the Standard Chartered Bank in Guernsey, Jersey and the U.K.\n\nAnother two owed assets worth $511,860 and 50,000 pounds in Standard Bank, Jersey.\n\nAt the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s exchange rates of N410 trading for a dollar and N558 to a British pound, this is equivalent to about N84 billion.\n\nAt the black market, the assets are worth N117 billion, with an American dollar trading for N575 and the British pound, N775.\n\nThe said Nigerians are among the more than 35 current and former world leaders, more than 330 public officials, and some 130 billionaires from over 91 countries and territories, whose massive fortune was a part of assets and deals kept in offshore tax-havens.\n\nThese Nigerians, listed below, include two former military governors, a former minister, an erstwhile presidential adviser and some of Nigeria\u2019s leading business people.\n\nThe expos\u00e9, sourced from a multi-terabyte volume of leaks retrieved from 14 offshore services firms from around the world, has already highlighted a global cast of influential politicians, businesspersons, fugitives, convicts, celebrities, football stars, judges, tax officials, spy chiefs and many others as having assets offshore.\n\nIt is a part of PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 two-year collaborative efforts with the global International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)-led Pandora Papers project, said to be the biggest cross-border investigation into how a litany of world powerful people kept vast amounts in assets in opaque offshore jurisdictions.\n\nThe companies help their clients set up shell companies and design non-transparent structures to conceal their financial dealings, through trusts.\n\nWhy Nigerians may opt for trusts for assets\n\nUnder Nigerian laws, it is not illegal to own offshore companies or trusts as they can be used for legitimate purposes. However, some experts believe the arrangement are mostly used to hide assets, avoid or evade taxes or carry out criminal acts.\n\nA trust is a fiduciary arrangement that allows a third party, known as a trustee, to hold assets on behalf of a beneficiary or beneficiaries.\n\nThe arrangement is what wealthy Nigerians often opt for due to what some describe as lack of confidence in their country\u2019s economy, currency fluctuation, limited foreign exchange capacity, and unstable government policies. Some say the the country\u2019s tax regime is too stringent and discourages them from leaving their assets here.\n\nExperts have urged the Nigerian government to expand the tax net and not the tax rate in order to plough fertile land for more local investments to thrive and discourage the huge desire for foreign currency.\n\nAmid Nigeria\u2019s naira slump to around N575 for a dollar this week, the currency\u2019s weakness and instability against the dollar is also another reason for some of the country\u2019s wealthiest persons to save their money in dollars in what they considered secured jurisdictions, experts say.\n\nEconomic implications\n\nWhen monies made in Nigeria are not ploughed back into the economy, the naira loses value and it rubs off on the overall economic well-being of the country, Femi Owolabi, a financial analyst with Stanbic IBTC, said.\n\n\u201c[Taking investments abroad] reduces the investor confidence in Nigeria which has a negative impact on the nation\u2019s stock market and the GDP,\u201d Muhydeen Tiamiyu, an analyst with Fortress Capital, also noted.\n\nAssets and Illicit financial flows\n\nHowever, sometimes these monies could also be a conduit for unscrupulous public officials and known criminals to fret away funds through offshore companies sometimes under the guise of a service provider for local agencies or companies, according to the World Bank.\n\nTax havens and offshore companies also boost illicit financial flow to other jurisdictions away from the country in which the wealth is made. Between 2006 and 2015, Nigeria accounted for $8.3 billion in illicit financial flows, ranking among the top 30 nations, according to the Global Financial Integrity (GFI) report published in 2019.\n\nThese losses are what a member of the United Nations High-Level Panel on IFF (FACTI Panel), Irene Ovonji-Odida, said are responsible for fiscal deficits, regressive taxation, criminality, low public trust, and weak rule of law, among others.\n\nThe United States of America-based research and advocacy group had said IFFs bled Nigeria for as much as $157.5 billion in revenue between 2003 and 2012.\n\nThe World Bank described the lost funds as \u201cmoney illegally earned, transferred, or used that crosses borders.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, no evidence of any financial infractions on the part of these Nigerians. Yet, their huge wealth highlights the inequality of wealth distribution among Nigerians.\n\nThe combined wealth of Nigeria\u2019s five richest men \u2013 $29.9 billion \u2013 could end extreme poverty at a national level, yet 5 million face hunger, according to Oxfam.\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has vowed actions to determine and punish possible tax offences following the Pandora Papers investigation.\n\nIn a statement sent to PREMIUM TIMES, a spokesperson for the FIRS, Johannes Wojuola, said the service will go after people reported in the leaks and suspected to have broken the law.\n\n\u201cIf there are any persons who are suspected to have a taxable asset by Nigerian laws among the revealed pool, the applicable processes with regards to investigation, charges, enforcement procedures \u2026 as well as prosecution for tax offenses, would be enforced,\u201d Mr Wojuola said.\n\nThe Affluent Nineteen and their assets\n\nThese wealthy people ranged from former military and civilian leaders, businesspersons and members of their families.\n\nIn each of the accounts they own, there is usually a nominee director who is a resident of tax havens and paid to sit on boards of companies to represent the interests of, and operate as a shadow of the real owners of offshore firms.\n\nWho are they and what are their assets?\n\n1. Hakeem Adebayo Folawiyo and Lisa Folawiyo\n\nHakeem Adebayo Folawiyo and Lisa Folawiyo belong to the third generation of the Folawiyo dynasty, a wealthy family whose earlier patriarchs were popular for their wealth in the southwest of Nigeria, especially Lagos.\n\nRecords show Mr Folawiyo is one of the two directors and a shareholder of Kinexus Data Service Limited, a Lagos-based company registered in 2016.

The trust was, as at October 2016, worth $300 million and \u00a32.2 million (about N1.7 billion) in cash, bonds, equities and mutual funds and property holdings and managed by Standard Chartered Trust (Jersey).\n\nThe co-own BVI company, Allendale Properties, worth $1.5 million and \u00a32.5 million (about N2.8 billion), kept with Standard Chartered Bank Jersey.\n\nIn total, the duo has an asset worth N4.5 billion in the bank.\n\n2.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s external reserves have risen to $42 billion, a 25-month high on the back inflow of the recent Eurobond issued by the federal government.\n\nAlthough, the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) latest update on its website showed that as of October 7, 2021, the Eurobond had grown by $3.587 billion or 10 per cent, from $34.597 billion as of September 7, 2021 to $38.184 billion as of October 7, central bank sources put the present value at $42 billion, ThisDay reported.\n\nThe last time the country\u2019s external reserves were around their present value was on September 26, 2019, when it was $42.05 billion.\n\nThe sharp rise in the foreign reserves was as a result of the $4 billion Eurobond the federal government issued last month. The amount was raised after an intensive two days of virtual meetings with investors across the globe. The Debt Management Office (DMO) had explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.\n\nDMO said, \u201cThis exceptional performance has been described as, \u2018one of the biggest financial trades to come out of Africa in 2021\u2019 and \u2018an excellent outcome.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the DMO, bids for the Eurobonds were received from investors in Europe and America, as well as Asia. There was also good participation by local investors.\n\nAccording to the statement, the size of the Order Book and the quality of investors demonstrate confidence in Nigeria.\n\nAnalysts also revealed that forex rationing by the central bank has also supported the external reserves accretion.\n\nMeanwhile, the value of transactions through the various payment channels in the country rose by 6.08 per cent, to N26.5 trillion in September, up from N25 trillion in August.\n\nManaging Director, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Bismarck Rewane, disclosed this in a report on his monthly executive breakfast session presented at the Lagos Business School at the weekend.\n\nThe payment transactions covered in the report included cheques, point of sale terminals, Nigerian Interbank Settlement System Instant Payment (NIP), and Nigeria Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT).\n\nIt pointed out that even though Nigeria\u2019s external reserves have risen, the country\u2019s debt level has also been climbing. Nigeria\u2019s total external debt has now risen above $37 billion. This was up by 270 per cent from 2015 level of $10 billion, the report stated.\n\nAccording to the report, domestic oil production declined consistently for four months. Precisely, it fell by 8.63 per cent to 1.27mbpd in August. This was attributed to underinvestment in the oil sector and high attrition rate.\n\nThe rig count has jumped 57.4 per cent since the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was enacted.\n\n\u201cRoyal Dutch Shell has put its land and swamp assets on the block; most international oil companies are shifting to green energy; and higher oil prices, 31.3 per cent in six months is making upstream loans qualify for restructuring,\u201d it stated.\n\nIt noted that the economy was recovering, but the momentum was slower than expected.\n\n\u201cOil prices now at a seven-year high ($82.87pb) but economy not firing on all cylinders,\u201d it added.\n\nThe World Bank recently raised Nigeria\u2019s 2021 growth forecast to 2.4 per cent, from 1.8 per cent previously. This was supported by accelerated growth in the service sectors. ThisDay",

Like I said earlier, the outcome will be very favourable. Apart from the fact that today we are serving the government, tomorrow, we might be on the other side.\n\n\u201cWhatever decision we are taking, we are not taking it based on the fact that we want to please those in power right now; we have to do something that will favour the next generation of leaders of this country because we know we can\u2019t stay too long considering the issue of tenure or even age.\n\n\u201cSo we need to take this into consideration so that posterity will not judge us wrongly. My confidence is that it\u2019s going to be a win-win situation,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nAnother source familiar with the workings of the conference committee also confirmed that the panel would meet this week after lawmakers reconvene on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe panel was supposed to meet last weekend but the meeting was postponed. They will meet this week to harmonise contentious areas. After Tuesday\u2019s plenary, their meeting date would be confirmed.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari told Nigerians on Monday in Abuja that the 11.9-kilometer Second Niger Bridge, the 120-kilometer Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, and other critical projects funded by the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) will be completed within his administration\u2019s second term\n\nThe President gave the assurance at the opening of a two-day Mid-Term Ministerial Performance Review Retreat organized to assess progress made towards the achievement of the nine key priorities of his administration.\n\nHis spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, made this known in a statement on Monday.\n\nBuhari used the occasion of the retreat, the third edition since the second term of his administration, to highlight some of the Federal Government\u2019s notable achievements in the last two years.\n\nHe listed accomplishments in the areas of infrastructure, transportation, economy, electricity supply, the petroleum industry, among others.\n\n\u2018\u2018On transportation, we are growing the stock and quality of our road, rail, air and water transport infrastructure.\n\n\u2018\u2018The PIDF projects are also advancing remarkably. These include the 11.9km Second Niger Bridge, 120 km Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, 375 km Abuja \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Zaria \u2013 Kano Expressway, and the East-West Road. Most of these projects are expected to be completed within this 2nd term of our Administration,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight that over the past two years, ministers have rendered reports to the Federal Executive Council on their activities related to the achievement of their ministerial mandates.\n\n\u2018\u2018Some of the notable achievements include the establishment of InfraCo Plc in 2020, as a world-class infrastructure development vehicle, wholly focused on Nigeria, with combined debt and equity take-off capital of N15 trillion, to be managed by an independent infrastructure fund manager.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund was also established in 2020 with more than USD 1Billion in funding.\n\n\u2018\u2018In addition, we have launched the Nigeria Innovation Fund by the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA). This is aimed at addressing investment opportunities in the domestic technology sector: data networking, data centers, software, Agri-tech, Bio-tech, and more,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nFurthermore, President Buhari noted that his administration had made tremendous progress on railway projects in the country, noting that upgrading of the railway network is being extended with the recent completion of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan line.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail line has finally been completed and commissioned after 30 years of its conception.\n\n\u2018\u2018Work is expected to commence very soon on the Port-Harcourt Maiduguri line and Calabar \u2013 Lagos Coastal Line to connect the Southern and Eastern States of our Country. Progress is also being made on the upgrading of our Airports, with the state-of-the-art facilities in line with world-class safety standards,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the economy, the President said the nation witnessed three consecutive quarters of growth, after negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2018The GDP grew from 0.8% in 2017 to 2.2% in 2019, but declined in the first quarter of 2020, as a result of the downward trend in global economic activities triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018As of Second Quarter 2021, GDP growth rate was at 5.01%, the highest since the inception of this administration.\u201d\n\nOn security, President Buhari announced that the Ministry of Defence has been instructed to create a modest military-industrial complex for the local production of weapons to meet some of the requirements of the country\u2019s armed forces.\n\nThe President explained that the establishment of the industrial complex would address Nigeria\u2019s over-dependence on other countries for military equipment and logistics.\n\nHe said the project is being implemented under the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON), a military department responsible for arms manufacture.\n\nOn other efforts to strengthen national security, the President said it was gratifying to note that Nigeria has received six A-29 Super Tucano.\n\nHe said the propeller-driven aircraft are being used for training, surveillance, and attack by the military.\n\n\u2018\u2018As part of the efforts towards strengthening our national security, we have increased investments in arms, weapons and other necessary equipment; expanded the National Command and Control Centre to nineteen states of the Federation; and established a Nigerian Police Trust Fund, which will significantly improve funding for the Nigeria Police Force.\n\n\u2018\u2018We have also approved the sum of N13.3 billion for the take-off of the Community Policing initiative across the country, as part of measures adopted to consolidate efforts aimed at enhancing security nationwide,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the Power Sector, President Buhari noted that the implementation of a \u2018Willing Buyer-Willing Seller\u2019 policy has opened up opportunities for increased delivery of electricity to underserved homes and industries.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the execution of critical projects through the Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Programme, will result in achieving the national goal of improved power supply by 2025.\n\nOn the Petroleum Industry Act signed into law on 16th August 2021, the President reiterated his directive to the Implementation Committee to complete all processes for the successful operationalization of the Act within 12 months.\n\nIn efforts to empower the youth and other vulnerable groups by enhancing investments in the Social Intervention Programmes, the President said he has approved the expansion of the National Social Register (NSP) by 1 million additional households.\n\nThe NSP is the official database for the implementation of the Conditional Cash Transfer programme.\n\n\u2018\u2018We have established the N75 billion Nigerian Youth Investment Fund created to boost the Nigerian economy through leverage and access to finance for youths.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Fund should serve as a catalyst to unleash the potential of the youth and to enable them to build businesses that will stimulate economic growth and create jobs. These accomplishments are a testament to the fact that all hands are on deck in establishing a solid foundation for even greater successes in future,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "title": "Dokpesi on PDP 2023: For equity, North must have PDP presidential ticket",
          "text": "A member Board of Trustees (BoT) Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr Raymond Dokpesi has said for equity, fairness and justice, the party must zone its presidential ticket for the 2023 general elections to the North.\n\nHe also believed the \u2018violation\u2019 of the federal character principle by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government is responsible for the present state of the nation.\n\nTherefore, Dokpesi believed \u201cthe person\u201d that would right the alleged wrongs is from the North.\n\nAt its recent National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Abuja, the PDP adopted the report of the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwunayi-led zoning committee which amidst some protests, recommended the zoning of the party\u2019s national chairmanship seat to the North.\n\nAlthough the report was silent on the presidential ticket, stakeholders believed it simply implied the party\u2019s presidential ticket is coming from the south.\n\nAnd at the NEC meeting, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar and the PDP presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, had told stakeholders that while the party has the right to determine its rules, Nigerians also have the right to elect whom their leader is.\n\nThe former VP\u2019s statement, some analysts believe, is a subtle protest by northern stakeholders within the party who feel short-changed by the decision.\n\nNotwithstanding the protest, the party at the end of the NEC meeting, said it stood by the Ugwuanyi committee report.\n\nDokpesi faults party\n\nBut faulting the party\u2019s position, Dr. Dokpesi argued that with the south having 14 of the 16-year PDP rule, it would be unjust for the south to still take another short at the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nDokpesi, founder Ray Power and Daar Communications, stated this weekend at a media parley with some select journalists in Abuja as part of activities marking his 70th birthday anniversary coming up October 25.\n\nGoing memory lane, he said: \u201cIn 1998, when the People\u2019s Democratic Party was being established, after the G-34 had confronted the military, elder statesmen who believed in one Nigeria and who went through the trauma of military rule. The constitution of the PDP states very clearly that there shall be rotation and zoning of offices, both for the party and political office. And I have remained very consistent in my argument since 1998.\n\n\u201cAt the G-34 meeting, Alhaji Lawan Keita had moved that Alex Ekwueme should become the president. But Ekwueme said it is a group, not a political party, that when it transforms into a political party, you can canvass whether I can be president or not.\n\n\u201cWhen the party came into being, it was agreed by all, including all the northerners that because of the injustice done to the South West, they should be allowed to produce the president because agreement has been reached on zoning and rotation.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that in 1995 draft constitution, it was envisaged that the 6 geo-political zones will have a turn of 5 years so that in 30 years, we will end the issue of zoning and would have been one united country. From there, we can start exploiting four-year rotation.\n\nContinuing, the PDP BoT member said: \u201cWhen Obasanjo came in, there was an expanded party caucus where it was canvassed that the PDP programmes could not be fully implemented within 3 years. Again, all the founding fathers, including Ekwueme, Ogbemudia and other big wigs of the party were present at the meeting. And again, it was the northern delegates who said they had no objection, they will exercise patience. We will allow Obasanjo to have another 4 years, but there should be a proviso that if you do 8 years, we will do 8 years. Let it be understood, that is the foundation and everybody said \u201cyeah\u201d.\n\n\u201cBy that agreement, power was supposed to have rotated back to the north. But I was a member of the S/South Assembly; I led the delegation to say the S/South has not had any opportunity, that the S/South should be given. I travelled round, I did not fight, I did not shout, I did not quarrel, I did not carry gun, all I did was to engage the Nigerian public. By the time we got to the Convention, Obasanjo said \u2018look Peter Odili, you have done very well, if we go into the conventions, you are going to win but we have an understanding with the north, please let the north be the president.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat is how Yar\u2019Adua came in. Yar\u2019Adua, unfortunately did not live long to see the 8 years. He did only two years, in fact, two and half years. I agitated at that time to continue with the principle already established, let us have the north complete the remaining term of four years, so that we can be done with the northern presidency, so that we can come back to the South.\n\n\u201cSome people in the S/South said no, it\u2019s not possible. You cannot be so close to power and relinquish it. Crisis set in, so Jonathan (Goodluck, former president) did another 4 years. We came to 2015, the PDP had done 16 years in power, if you like, 14 years of the South, two years of the north. That is the situation up till today.\u201d\n\nFurther arguments\n\n\u201cNow you say, you believe in justice, fairness and equity. The north has done 2 years, the South has done 14 years, is that balance? The APC came into being in 2014, they don\u2019t have a history. Now, in 2015, when we fielded in PDP, Jonathan, the north had started clamouring, agitating, saying it is their turn. You have spent 14 years, so allow us to complete our 4 years and we said no, we were very smart, and that is what plunged the country into this crisis. That is why we are in problem.\n\n\u201cSo, I am PDP, I am guided by the constitution of the PDP, which in its preamble said, for unity, for stability, for the growth of the country, we must rotate such that every part of the country will not be neglected. The APC, on its own, came in and also said, we are adopting zoning and rotation. And in their own situation, they chose to pick a northern candidate knowing full well that the agitation of the north. They fielded a northern candidate against us. I believe everyone here knows my position and what my comments were at that time.\n\n\u201cIf in my own party I want to win an election, I cannot win an election when there is injustice, when there is unfairness. We are not guided by certain rules. In the PDP, all I am agitating for is that let us be fair and just. Let us put ourselves in the shoes of ourselves. Let us as one family, as the party started l, still remain one and in doing so, let us choose a candidate from the north. Some people have come to meet me to say, how can we allow them to do another 8 years again? I say, sorry, in 2019, we fielded a northern candidate recommended by Ike Ekweremadu report. But again, the PDP was outmanoeuvred.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t agree that Atiku lost that election but INEC has said so, and as a citizen of Nigeria I must live by the rules. But I cannot as a PDP person go and adopt APC conditions and situations. So, for me very clearly, I want an undiluted, a properly organized party.\n\n\u201cIt is the APC policy of lack of adherence to the federal character principles that has brought us to this level of suspicion in the country. And the person that can bring back that principle of fairness, justice is from the north. We Southerners had the opportunity to be in power and we threw it away, so we can now monopolise everything and that is what gave birth to APC. If we were fair, we were just, we were rational, we won\u2019t have been in this problem.\u201d",

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) , on Thursday, denied the trending report that the air bombardment of the air component of Operations Hadin Kai on terrorist location killed 20 fishermen in Borno State.\n\nIt noted that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who made this denial in a statement also explained that the military bombed the location after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to media reports making rounds in social media alleging that; the \u201cAir Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday 26 September 2021, killed 20 Fishermen in air strikes at Kwatan Daban Masara general area in the fringes of the Lake Tchad. It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "Pastor Tunde Bakare has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to do away with the 1999 constitution, saying it is a great inhibitor of the nation\u2019s progress.\n\nThe Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church (CGCC), made the call on Sunday during a state of the nation address which he titled: \u2018The black box of Nigeria\u2019s politics\u2019.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d Mr. Gorbachev eventually did, and Germany is better off for it today.\n\n\u201cIn the same spirit, I say to President Muhammadu Buhari: Mr President, stop passing the buck to the National Assembly. Tear down this inhibiting concoction of a constitution; tear it down so we can build a truly great nation\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tinubu, Osinbajo Can Clearly Defeat PDP Candidate \u2013 Bwala\n\nAccording to the founding pastor of the CGCC, \u201cThis is one enduring legacy\u201d that the Buhari-led administration can still secure before their time in power draws to a close.\n\nBakare further argued that if President Buhari does thrash the 1999 constitution, then, present and unborn generations of Nigerians will remember him for it and write his name in gold when the history of the period is written.\n\nOn the other hand, he stated that if the president fails to heed the call, then, \u201chistory will record that you failed to rise to the occasion and squandered a great opportunity\u201d.\n\nThrowing more light on the need to get rid of the 1999 constitution, Pastor Bakare asserted that the constitution was erroneous to say the unity of the nation was not negotiable.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Constitution was imposed upon the nation by the military and has completely removed the ancient landmark set by our founding fathers in the 1960 Independence Constitution and the subsequent 1963 Republican Constitution respectively.\n\n\u201cFor every contractual agreement, the parties are required to sign a document validating the terms and conditions in the reckoning of the law. In the case of Nigeria, our founding fathers, in effect, signed a contract in 1960 detailing the terms and conditions of our union or unity following a series of negotiations.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, the majority of the champions, promoters and supporters of the \u2018our unity is non-negotiable\u2019 slogan pay lip service to a version of unity that serves their selfish interests. What they are insisting on, in reality, is that \u2018our disunity is non-negotiable,\u2019 and that we must be forced to live together irrespective of the inherent dysfunctionality of the terms and conditions,\u201d Bakare submitted.\n\nHe also was of the opinion that a change of guard in the country has become pertinent, adding that the country needs fresh hands and insights into how to fix the problems of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEveryone looks tired around the President and we need a change of guards to bring competent people to handle critical issues. I\u2019m not advocating coup d\u2019etat, God forbid; that will set us back by many years again. Military coup landed us in the trouble we are,\u201d the cleric enunciated.\n\nHe went on to announce the launch of \u201cNigeria for Nigerians (N4N) Movement\u201d.\n\nIn his viewpoint, the movement became imperative because it is time for Nigerians to take the reins and direct their nation\u2019s destiny.\n\nWading into the zoning discuss, Bakare said it does not matter what region the next president comes from, adding that all that is required is that the individual be qualified and competent to handle Nigeria\u2019s affairs.",

          "text": "Firefighters in Lebanon Monday battled to contain a fire at key fuel storage facilities, AFP correspondents and the National News Agency said, sparking alarm as the country grapples with dire hydrocarbon shortages.\n\nThe fire broke out at around 8.00am (0500 GMT) in a tank containing petrol belonging to the army at the Zahrani facilities some 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Beirut, the National News Agency and local media said.\n\nThere was no immediate report of casualties.\n\nA judicial source said an expert had been tasked with investigating the cause of the fire, but had been unable to approach the tank as the blaze still raged.\n\nAn AFP photographer saw flames lick up above the storage tank on fire, and huge plumes of dark smoke billowing into the sky.\n\nFiremen worked to cool down the nearby tanks to prevent the fire from spreading.\n\nThe army cordoned off the area, cutting off roads leading to the facilities as well as the main highway linking Beirut to the country\u2019s south, the photographer said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Loud bang\u2019 \u2013\n\nA worker in a plantation near the facilities told AFP he had heard a loud bang before the fire broke out.\n\nThe Zahrani facilities also include the power plant of the same name, and provide 15 percent of the country\u2019s fuel oil.\n\nThe Mediterranean nation is battling one of the planet\u2019s worst economic crises since the 1850s, and has in recent months struggled to import enough fuel oil for its power plants.\n\nREAD ALSO: Thousands Evacuated As Floods Hit Northern China\n\nIn recent months, Lebanese have only received one or two hours of state electricity a day.\n\nThe fire comes after the electricity grid went completely offline on Saturday.\n\nThat outage came after two key power plants, including the one in Zahrani, ran out of fuel.\n\nBy Sunday limited supply was back after the army provided gas oil.\n\nMost Lebanese saw no major change to their daily lives during the blackout, as those who can afford it have already subscribed to private generators to keep the lights on during the almost round-the-clock power cuts.\n\nPetrol has also been in short supply, forcing motorists to queue for hours outside gas stations to fill up their tank.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has advised President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto cut the N26 billion presidency budget for the construction of the presidential wing at the State House Medical Centre, local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, \u2018sitting allowance\u2019, and \u2018welfare package\u2019, and to use some of the savings to address the growing level of deficit, as well as improve public healthcare facilities across the country.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urged him \u201cto send to the National Assembly a fresh supplementary appropriation bill, which reflects the reduced proposed spending on the construction of the State House Medical Centre, local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, and \u2018welfare package\u2019, for its approval.\u201d\n\nIn the letter dated 9 October 2021 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cMany Nigerians will find it quite odd, unfair and unjust that the government is spending so much money on many of these items in the middle of a public borrowing crisis. The proposed spending could be better allocated to improve access of Nigerians to basic public goods and services.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cThe government would continue to borrow to fund the country\u2019s budget until there is a substantial cut to the cost of governance. The government should stop spending so much money on these items. Persistent borrowing is neither sustainable nor fair to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nIt added: \u201cYour government has a responsibility to ensure the interest of the well-being and prosperity of Nigeria and its citizens. The growing budget deficit and debt problems threaten Nigerians\u2019 access to essential public goods and services, and will hurt future generations if not urgently addressed.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cSERAP also urges you to publish details of spending on construction and repairs of the presidential wing at the medical center and office furniture and fittings since May 29, 2015.\n\n\u201cThe proposed spending figures highlight the lack of political will to cut the cost of governance, starting from the presidency. This spending is unsustainable, and would take away critical funding to provide access to quality healthcare and education.\n\n\u201cThis would leave the poorest and most vulnerable people without access to these essential public goods and services, and burden the next generation.\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, for the Office of the President, you recently proposed in the 2022 appropriation bill to spend N24,835,805,231 for the construction of the presidential wing at the state house medical center, local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments.\u201d\n\nThe agency noted that \u201cThe construction of the presidential wing will cost N21,974,763,310. N2,309,066,788 is proposed to be spent on general travel and transport while N301,138,860 will be spent on foodstuff and catering materials supplies. N250,836,273 is proposed to be spent on refreshments, meals, honorarium, sitting allowance, publicity and advertisements.\n\n\u201cFor the Office of the Vice-President, N1,136,717,757 is proposed for local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, purchase of office furniture and fittings, and other expenses. The details are: N778,261,411 is proposed to be spent on general travel and transport.\n\n\u201cN168,210,826 is proposed for office stationeries/computer, consumables, printing of documents, uniforms and other clothing, food stuff and catering materials supplies. N2,350,626 is proposed for cooking gas and fuel costs.\n\n\u201cN99,795,229 is proposed to be spent on refreshments, meals, honorarium, sitting allowance, publicity and advertisements. N31,909,380 is proposed for computer software acquisition while N30,817,085 is proposed for the purchase of motor vehicles. N25,373,200 is proposed for the purchase of office furniture and fittings.\n\n\u201cWe would therefore be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 14 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our requests.\u201d\n\nThe organisation said it \u201cis concerned that the huge spending is neither necessary nor in the public interest, especially in the face of the country\u2019s dire economic position, the scant allocations to education and health, and the growing level of borrowing by your government to fund the 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cSpending limited public funds on the construction of the presidential wing at the State House Medical Centre, local and foreign travels, meals and refreshments, honorarium and sitting allowance, and welfare packages at a time the government is borrowing to fund the budget would undermine your government\u2019s constitutional and fiduciary duties to ensure a responsible budget spending.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s fiscal situation must be changed \u2013 and changed quickly \u2013 through some combination of cuts in the areas highlighted above. Cutting waste and apparently unnecessary spending would go a long way in addressing the budget deficit and debt problems.\n\n\u201cThe recommended measures would also ensure that your government is spending the country\u2019s maximum available resources to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights to basic needs of the poor and marginalized groups.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has failed to make the latest list of the world\u2019s highest income-grossing oil companies, both nationally-run and privately-owned. The list was compiled from the organisations\u2019 2020 audited financial statements.\n\nBut NNPC on Sunday said although the repair of roads was not within its direct purview, it was willing to fix some roads across the country to ease the movement of petroleum products. The offer by the national oil company came following a threat of industrial action by the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) over increasing number of bad roads in the country.\n\nHowever, the Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) of NUPENG yesterday suspended the planned strike, which was earlier scheduled to commence today.\n\nThe latest list of the world\u2019s highest income-grossing oil companies showed that although a number of the 10 highest-earning oil and gas companies in 2021 lost billions in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and trade war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, big deals and discoveries were still made, further aided by recovering oil prices from the last quarter of last year.\n\nThe list showed that Sinopec, also known as China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, earned $323 billion in revenues in 2020, according to a compilation by offshore-technology.com, one of the leading entities covering the global offshore oil and gas industry.\n\nBut Sinopec\u2019s revenue fell by 28.8 per cent last year, while at the same time, net income fell by 43 per cent, leaving it with a value of approximately $70 billion.\n\nDespite topping the list, the company\u2019s refining and exploration/production units jointly made losses of approximately $22 billion in 2020, but earnings of $21 billion from its marketing and distribution sector helped offset the losses.\n\nIn line with China\u2019s upcoming five-year plan, the company has moved toward developing hydrogen production and has installed hydrogen refuelling stations in at least four provinces.\n\nChina also came second on the list with PetroChina, the publicly listed arm of the state-owned company, China National Petroleum Corp, exceeding its post-pandemic expectations.\n\nDuring the year, the company increased oil output by 4.8 per cent and gas output by 9.9 per cent compared to 2019 and pushed the cost of production down by 8.3 per cent, to $11.1 per barrel.\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue fell by 23.2 per cent in 2020, but it increased its full-year dividend by more than 20 per cent and achieved new record levels of gross profit, lifted by economic recovery and rising oil prices.\n\nThe two Chinese companies were followed by Saudi Aramco with $230 billion revenue for the year under review. In April 2020, the company achieved it\u2019s highest-ever single-day crude oil production rate, at 12.1 million barrels per day. Nigeria pumps less than 2 million bpd.\n\nThe company\u2019s capital expenditure fell by $6 billion in 2020, mainly because it spent some money in acquiring a majority stake of chemicals company Sabic in June and invested in a joint-venture materials company with oilfield service company Baker Hughes and agreed to build a chemicals plant in eastern Saudi Arabia with TotalEnergies.\n\nThe company attained pre-tax earnings of $101 billion and a net income of $49 billion in 2020, both around 60 per cent of the previous year\u2019s total.\n\nThe fourth position was occupied by Royal Dutch Shell, which earned about $181bn in 2020, according to the data. Shell emerged the highest-earning oil company not owned by a government.\n\nBut the company still lost $21 billion across the 2020 financial year most of which came as a result of revenue almost halving, falling to $180 billion.\n\nOn the list also was British giant BP, which grossed $180 billion in 2020. The company\u2019s financial mirrored those of Shell, with revenue falling to $180 billion, while its upstream segment recorded a net loss of $21 billion across the 2020/21 financial year.\n\nExxonMobil came sixth, with revenue worth of $179 billion in the 2020 financial year, although the company lost $22.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a $14.3bn profit one year before.\n\nThe company\u2019s upstream division went from earning $14 billion in 2019, to losing $20 billion in 2020. Revenue fell by approximately $77 billion, though most analysts expect this to reverse again across 2021.\n\nOccupying the seventh position, according to the data, was TotalEnergies, formerly known as Total, with total revenue of $120 billion in 2020. Its income from sales fell by $60 billion, compared to the year before, while overall net income went from $11.4 billion in 2019 to a loss of $7.3 billion in 2020.\n\nIt was trailed by Chevron with $94 billion impacted by its big moment in 2020 when it acquired US shale oil and gas producer Noble Energy. Losses peaked in the second quarter of 2020, when the company saw a net loss of $8.3 billion. Across the whole year, the company made a net loss of $5.5 billion, though net production remained mainly the same.\n\nRussia\u2019s Gazprom held on to the ninth position with total revenue of $85 billion although sales fell from $29 billion in 2019 to $22 billion in 2020, partly because of production restrictions following Russia\u2019s deal with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). As a result, net profits fell from $10 billion to a loss of $9.7 billion.\n\nAccording to the data, America\u2019s Marathon oil made $70 billion gross revenue in 2020, almost halving its capital spending to deal with the pandemic, with further cuts in 2021. Marathon\u2019s sale of Speedway, its chain of vehicle filling stations, included a 15-year supply deal with buyer 7-Eleven worth about $21 billion cash transaction.\n\nIncluding income from Speedway, Marathon\u2019s adjusted raw earnings fell to $4.4 billion in 2020, down from $11.1 billion the year before. Most of the fall came from the company\u2019s refining and marketing segment, where raw earnings went from $2.8 billion to a loss of $5.1 billion across the year.\n\nFor the first time ever, the NNPC this year publicly announced a profit of N287 billion, about $700 million (when converted at the current official exchange rate of about N410 to $1). The national oil company recently told Nigerians that it already has a projection of over N300 billion profit for this year which would be announced at the end of 2021.\n\nThe profit was mostly from the reversal of amounts impaired (when a company declares an asset valuable after it previously declared it a liability) for years. It also pushed the corporation\u2019s total revenue to about N3.7 trillion or roughly $9 billion when converted.\n\nNNPC is in the process of being fully commercialised with the recent passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), although it had always been bugged down by excessive political control.\n\nMeanwhile, NNPC yesterday said although the repair of roads was not within its direct purview, it was willing to fix selected roads across the country to ease the movement of petroleum products. The offer by the national oil company came after the threat of industrial action by the PTD of NUPENG.\n\nThe South-west Zonal Chairman of NUPENG, Tayo Aboyeji, at the weekend, said the union had lost many members and properties due to bad roads, saying several calls on the government concerning the situation have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nDescribing the roads as, \u201cdeplorable and shameful,\u201d he maintained that when trucks loaded petrol in Lagos, the drivers spent between five to six days to get to Abuja because of the bad state of the roads.\n\nAboyeji said, \u201cAll calls by the executive of petroleum unions have fallen on the deaf ears of the government as the highways continue to deteriorate nationwide. The list of the highways is endless and the tanker drivers have been going through harrowing situations while rendering selfless national service.\n\n\u201cThe increased rate of fire incidents involving petroleum tankers with accompanying massive destruction of lives and property of our members and the general public is enough.\u201d\n\nAside the demand for road rehabilitation, the union further stated that government had failed to enforce the installation of safety gadgets on tankers, which would protect the inflammatory contents of their trucks from spilling over when accidents happen.\n\nIt further stated that some tank farm owners still used tankers exceeding 45,000 litres carrying capacity, despite reaching an agreement with the government on the matter.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, signed by the NNPC\u2019s Group General Manager, Public Affairs Division, Mr. Garba Muhammad, the corporation stated, \u201cEven though it is not the responsibility of the NNPC to build or rehabilitate roads, any disruption in the distribution of petroleum products to different parts of Nigeria will adversely affect the business of the NNPC and endanger energy security, which the country has enjoyed for a long time now.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of this, the NNPC wishes to assure the petroleum tanker drivers that in addition to the on-going efforts by other agencies of government, the NNPC has initiated a process that will provide a quick and effective solution to the roads network challenges as expressed by the PTD.\n\n\u201cHaving recognised that the major reason slowing down the rehabilitation of the road networks in the country is the paucity of funds, the NNPC has expressed interest to invest in the reconstruction of select federal roads under the Federal Government\u2019s Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Task Credit Scheme.\u201d\n\nThe corporation noted that the thrust of its intervention was to make considerable funds available for the reconstruction of roads through it future tax liability.\n\nMeanwhile, NUPENG on Sunday night said the planned strike by PTD, which would have kicked off midnight on Sunday, had been suspended.\n\nA statement signed by NUPENG\u2019s National President, William Akporeha, and General Secretary, Afolabi Olawale, announcing the suspension of the intended withdrawal of services, said the decision followed an understanding reached with the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) at a meeting held in Ibadan.\n\nThe union stated that there would be a follow-up meeting scheduled to hold on Tuesday, October 12, in Abuja, stressing that the suspension of the planned action is predicated on its belief that the agreement reached with the government yesterday as well as resolutions reached during the planned meeting will be fulfilled to the letter.\n\nNUPENG stated, \u201cWe wish to clearly make it known to all well-meaning Nigerians that have variously appealed to us on these issues that our plan was not intended to inflict further pains on Nigerians but to ensure observance of minimum safety on our highways for the good of lives and properties.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the impacts our actions usually have on the people, businesses and the nation at large but we cannot continue to watch as things continue to degenerate in our industry.\u201d\n\nIn the light of the above, the union stated that it would not hesitate to re- commence the action without any notice if the understanding reached in the two meetings were not fully implemented within the timeframe agreed.\n\n\u201cWith this, our petroleum tanker drivers are hereby directed to continue providing services for the efficient and effective distribution of petroleum products to homes and workplaces across the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",
          "summary": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has failed to make the latest list of the world\u2019s highest income-grossing oil companies, both nationally-run and privately-owned.\nChina also came second on the list with PetroChina, the publicly listed arm of the state-owned company, China National Petroleum Corp, exceeding its post-pandemic expectations.\nThe two Chinese companies were followed by Saudi Aramco with $230 billion revenue for the year under review.\nRevenue fell by approximately $77 billion, though most analysts expect this to reverse again across 2021.\nThe offer by the national oil company came after the threat of industrial action by the PTD of NUPENG.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s external reserves have risen to its highest level in 25 months to $42 billion presently due to the inflow of the recent Eurobond issued by the federal government, THISDAY findings have revealed.\n\nAlthough, the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) latest update on its website showed that as of October 7, 2021, the Eurobond had grown by $3.587 billion or 10 per cent, from $34.597 billion as of September 7, 2021 to $38.184 billion as of October 7, central bank sources put the present value at $42 billion.\n\nThe last time the country\u2019s external reserves were around their present value was on September 26, 2019, when it was $42.05 billion.\n\nThe sharp rise in the foreign reserves was as a result of the $4 billion Eurobond the federal government issued last month. The amount was raised after an intensive two days of virtual meetings with investors across the globe. The Debt Management Office (DMO) had explained that the Order Book peaked at $12.2 billion, which enabled the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) to raise $1 billion more than the $3 billion it initially announced.\n\nDMO said, \u201cThis exceptional performance has been described as, \u2018one of the biggest financial trades to come out of Africa in 2021\u2019 and \u2018an excellent outcome.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the DMO, bids for the Eurobonds were received from investors in Europe and America, as well as Asia. There was also good participation by local investors.\n\nAccording to the statement, the size of the Order Book and the quality of investors demonstrate confidence in Nigeria.\n\nAnalysts also revealed that forex rationing by the central bank has also supported the external reserves accretion.\n\nMeanwhile, the value of transactions through the various payment channels in the country rose by 6.08 per cent, to N26.5 trillion in September, up from N25 trillion in August.\n\nManaging Director, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Bismarck Rewane, disclosed this in a report on his monthly executive breakfast session presented at the Lagos Business School at the weekend.\n\nThe payment transactions covered in the report included cheques, point of sale terminals, Nigerian Interbank Settlement System Instant Payment (NIP), and Nigeria Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT).\n\nIt pointed out that even though Nigeria\u2019s external reserves have risen, the country\u2019s debt level has also been climbing. Nigeria\u2019s total external debt has now risen above $37 billion. This was up by 270 per cent from 2015 level of $10 billion, the report stated.\n\nAccording to the report, domestic oil production declined consistently for four months. Precisely, it fell by 8.63 per cent to 1.27mbpd in August. This was attributed to underinvestment in the oil sector and high attrition rate.\n\nThe rig count has jumped 57.4 per cent since the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was enacted.\n\n\u201cRoyal Dutch Shell has put its land and swamp assets on the block; most international oil companies are shifting to green energy; and higher oil prices, 31.3 per cent in six months is making upstream loans qualify for restructuring,\u201d it stated.\n\nIt noted that the economy was recovering, but the momentum was slower than expected.\n\n\u201cOil prices now at a seven-year high ($82.87pb) but economy not firing on all cylinders,\u201d it added.\n\nThe World Bank recently raised Nigeria\u2019s 2021 growth forecast to 2.4 per cent, from 1.8 per cent previously. This was supported by accelerated growth in the service sectors.\n\nObinna Chima",

Tinubu made the remarks on Sunday at the Lagos House, Marina, in his \u201cThank you speech\u201d during a reception to welcome him back home, organised by Governor Bababjide Samwo-Olu of Lagos State, on behalf of the state government. \u201cI am standing before you hale and hearty,\u201d the former governor declared at the event tagged, \u201cWelcome Back Home Asiwaju.\u201d\n\nTinubu, who returned to the country on Friday night after a successful surgery on his right knee, spent over three months in London. His arrival to the country came barely 24 hours after a campaign group, South West Agenda (SWAGA 2023), was launched in Lagos by Governor Sanwo-Olu to champion Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nThe reception featured prayers for Tinubu, who expressed gratitude to God for bringing him back to Nigeria safely. He also thanked all the political leaders and groups that had wished him well.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am a little emotional, but I am happy to be back home. God is the giver of life and He alone can take it. I\u2019m grateful to Him for giving me the privilege to be alive. I\u2019m Hale and hearty, I can\u2019t but praise and thank Him.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Sanwo-Olu, his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; and Senator Adeola Olamilekan, said in their speeches that they were working to ensure Tinubu\u2019s mandate in 2023.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cOn behalf of the teeming Lagosians that cannot come to this premises to welcome you back home. Today, being the 10th of October, God has brought you back home.\u201d\n\nThe governor thanked those who had prayed for the safe return of Tinubu, saying, \u201cThe best is yet to come.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila, too, prayed, saying, \u201cFrom today, the best days of your past will be the worst days of your future.\u201d\n\nHe added that the northern caucus of the House of Representatives\u2019 visit to Tinubu in London was a strong statement, and that the southern caucus had planned to make similar visit before Tinubu\u2019s arrival on Friday.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cWhere you are going, is destined. We are ready in the National Assembly. There are men and there are men. The history of Nigeria cannot be written politically without you occupying three quarters of the pages.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, said, \u201cIt is a great honour to be here and be part of this gathering, particularly, to welcome our leader and mentor. We told them you are hale and hearty. We thank you for your guidance, we pray, we will continue to enjoy your mentorship.\u201d\n\nHamzat said, \u201cIt is only God that is constant; He cannot sick. Any human being can be subjected to anything but we thank God that our father has come back.\u201d\n\nRepresenting Lagos Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Stephen Adegbite, quoting Psalm 91 from the Holy Bible, prayed copiously for Tinubu\u2019s good health and his 2023 ambition, saying, \u201cWe are praying for you.
