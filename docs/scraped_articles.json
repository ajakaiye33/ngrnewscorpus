          "text": "The Ebonyi State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party has debunked the claims that its newly elected Chairman, Mr Tochukwu Okorie, was foisted on party faithful through an undemocratic process.\n\nIn a petition to the PDP Congress Appeal Committee, which was sighted by our correspondent, on Sunday, one of the contestants for the Chairmanship position, in the just-concluded Congress held penultimate Saturday, in Abakaliki, Mr Silas Onu, alleged that Mr Okorie failed to meet the minimum requirements for nomination and therefore did not qualify to contest in the election.\n\nHe equally accused the party\u2019s National Working Committee of gifting Mr Okorie a nomination form, which according to him, was contrary to the guidelines that stipulate that an aspirant must purchase a form for N750,000.00.\n\nOnu further claimed that Okorie failed to meet the party\u2019s deadline for the purchase and submission of forms, alleging that the party had a preset template for his emergence as the party\u2019s Chairman, in Ebonyi State.\n\nBut while reacting to Onu\u2019s petition to the Congress Appeal Committee, Okorie said there was no iota of truth in his opponent\u2019s claims, urging the Committee and the general public to disregard them as frivolous and baseless.\n\nPresenting copies of receipts of his nomination form, which were submitted at the Party\u2019s Headquarters in Abuja as proof before journalists, on Sunday, in Abakaliki, Okorie said, \u201cNot only did I duly purchase my form within the allowed timeframe but also met the submission deadline contrary to Onu\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cThese are copies of the documents as attached below and they show I bought my nomination form for N750,000.00 as prescribed by the party\u2019s guidelines on September 6, 2021, ahead of the revised deadline of September 9, 2021. The submission date as seen from the duly acknowledged copy of the form was October 4, 2021, being the first business day following the National holiday of Friday, October 1, 2021, which should have been the deadline.\n\n\u201cOther documents to prove my claims and attached herewith include a financial waiver granted to candidates in Ebonyi State by the National Working Committee of PDP allowing them to obtain forms without paying. I ought not to have paid for the form since the party had granted a financial waiver and that I may go for a refund on account of the same. These are also documents showing the party\u2019s approved deadlines.\n\nHe continued, \u201cMy opponent, Mr Silas Onu, though having made blunders by making wild claims in the media, has been a hardworking party man and I call on him (Onu) to retrace his steps. He should come back home and join hands with the newly elected Executive Committee of PDP in the state to rebuild the party. I reiterate again and for me, there is no victor and there is no vanquished.\n\n\u201cRecall that seven aspirants had initially indicated their interest to vie for the position of the Chairman of the PDP Ebonyi State chapter. Five, out of that number however willingly withdrew from the contest, paving the way for a contest between me and Mr Silas Onu. The State Congress Committee Chairman, Senator Ben-Collins Ndu, in his powers as the Returning Officer, declared me as the winner. Out of the 1,510 accredited delegates, I polled 1,240 votes to defeat my only opponent, Mr Silas Onu, who polled 262 votes. Eight votes were declared invalid.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, a Chieftain of the PDP in Ebonyi State and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim affirmed Okorie\u2019s position, saying the party was currently repositioned to retake the state, come 2023.",

          "title": "Ohanaeze Ndigbo attacks Malami over allegations against Nnamdi Kanu",
          "text": ".. questions his competence as AGF\n\nBy Anayo Okoli.\n\nENUGU-IGBO apex social cultural body, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has descended heavily on the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami for blaming the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu for all the killings and destructions that happened during the #Endsars youth protest last year as well as past and present killings going on in the South East.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation had addressed a press conference last Friday in Abuja, where he levelled extensive allegations against Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the IPOB.\n\nREAD ALSO:NNAMDI KANU: IPOB threatens one-week lockdown in S/East\n\nMalami alleged that Kanu \u201chas been working against the Nigerian nation based on his actions and speech\u201d and that heinstigated others to attack public properties, security agents, civilians and any other perceived enemy using Radio Biafra as a major means of communication\u201d.\n\nReacting to Malami\u2019s outburst, Ohanaeze Ndigbo expressed disappointment that the Attorney General descended to the level of total ignorance and shopping for offences just to nail Kanu.\n\nOhanaeze urged him to try to be above aboard as the nation\u2019s chief law officer.\n\n\u201cOne will think that a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, and the Attorney General of the Federation the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, should be above board\u201d, Chief Alex Chidozie Ogbonnia, the National publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo said.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore advised that Malami should not be so cheap for the uninitiated to discover his shenanigans. In other words, the above remarks by the AGF is very inelegant, imprudent, malicious, treacherous and fallacious.\n\n\u201cMalami should know that the Internet World has left him behind. All his game-plans are crude and anachronistic. The Malami sinister motives of heaping all criminalities in Nigeria on IPOB or the Igbo including the crimes where arrests have been made and the known culprits already arraigned is most unethical, unprofessional and unbefitting of his Office.\n\n\u201cSome other crimes that Malami ascribes to IPOB are still under investigation and arrests so far made are not linked to IPOB. The Malami perversions are very strange to Law and indeed a new dimension in Nigerian justice delivery system.\n\n\u201cMalami card is to paint the South East of Nigeria as a terrorist zone, to prepare a ground for the use of the newly acquired American Super Tucano Fighter Jets in the zone.\n\n\u201cMalami should be reminded that the very condition for the sale and release of the jets to Nigeria by the USA is that they will be used strictly to fight the Boko Haram terrorists in the North East and incessant Banditry in the North West.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, Malami is playing god by believing that the 2023 is the end of the world and is plotting hard against the Igbo interest.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Malami has crossed the red line.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo calls on the Nigeria Barr Association, NBA, to re-examine Mr. Abubakar Malami in a bid to establish his suitability and competence for the elevated Office he occupies.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo still believes that all these grandstanding and hyperboles by the federal government about the Igbo or IPOB are machinations in self-denial.\n\n\u201cThe solution to the crises in Nigeria lies in justice and dialogue. If the federal government can encourage dialogue with the notorious Bandits, Boko Haram and Fulani Herdsmen, it is therefore expected that what is good for the goose is mutatis mutandis, good for the gander\u201d, Ohanaeze said.\n\nSpeaking further, the Igbo apex body said: \u201cThat the IPOB vandalized and looted the Palace of the Oba of Lagos and burnt over one hundred and fifty (150) buses at the Lagos Bus Terminal were mere ethnic cards simply intended to play up the Yoruba against the Igbo.\n\n\u201cIt is important for Malami to know that the bond between the Yoruba and the Igbo is strong, inseparable and beyond his narrow machinations.\n\n\u201cMalami should know that the Yoruba do not spill the Igbo blood and vice versa. The likes of Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi, who chose the supreme prize instead of betraying an Igbo in the person of General Johnson Thomas Umunnakwe Aguiyi Ironsi, have replicated across board in millions.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, Malami does not know the historic role played by the current Oba of Lagos, as a Police Officer, for the return from exile of Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the Ikemba Nnewi in 1982. Malami should know that the Igbo- Yoruba relation has given rise to several high profile intermarriages with bubbling grown up children and grand-children. More of the above sources of unity and inter-ethnic solidarity were accentuated when the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Ambassador Professor George Obiozor paid a courtesy visit to the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in his Lagos Office\u201d.\n\nMaking some clarifications, Ohanaeze noted that \u201cThe Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB is mostly populated by the Igbo. The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide and the Leader of IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu are united against the orchestrated marginalization of the Igbo in one Nigeria. For instance, the South East of Nigeria has the least number of states compared to other six geopolitical zones in the country; the least number of local government areas, the least number of seats in the Senate, the least number of seats in the House of Representatives, the least in the federal budget allocations, least in the distribution of constituency projects, zero representation in the headship of the security architecture of Nigeria, zero minister in grade A category of the ministries, unemployment to Igbo Youths; and indeed obvious conspiracy against the South East in every sector of the Nigeria polity.\n\n\u201cThe major roads passing through the South East, namely, the Enugu Onitsha road, Enugu Port Harcourt road, Oturkpo-Enugu road, etc are death traps. In addition, the Fulani herdsmen roam about with AK 47 rifles, ravage the farms of the Igbo rural dwellers, debauch their women, abduct their men, maim and kill, and no arrest is made by the relevant authorities.\n\n\u201cThe point of divergence between the Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the IPOB is that while the former believes that the Igbo ingenuity will find full expression in a restructured Nigeria, the latter appears to be tired of the age-long marginalization of the Igbo in a country they have sacrificed so much to build.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the IPOB are our children and we owe them undiluted love, duty and responsibility\u201d.",

          "text": "By Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nThe prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, ICC, has commenced moves seeking authorisation from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the court to investigate cases of abduction of schoolchildren in several parts of Northern Nigeria, closure of schools, and the persistent failure of Nigerian authorities at both the federal and state levels to end the abduction.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor\u2019s decision followed a petition sent to the court by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP.\n\nThe organisation, had in the petition dated 4 September 2021 urged the ICC prosecutor, Mr Karim A. A. Khan, QC, to \u201cpush for those suspected to be responsible and complicit in the commission of these serious crimes, to be invited and tried by the ICC.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:Goronyo attack: Zulum, Yahaya visit Sokoto as NEGF\u2019s Reps; donate N20m\n\nSERAP disclosed this in a statement on Sunday by Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nIn the petition, SERAP argued that, \u201cThe severe and lifelong harms that result from depriving children the right to education satisfy the gravity of harm threshold under the Rome Statute.\u201d\n\nResponding, the ICC prosecutor in a letter with reference number OTP-CR-363/21, and dated 22 October 2021 confirmed to SERAP that \u201cthe criteria for opening an investigation into a string of abductions and closure of schools in some parts of Nigeria have been met.\u201d\n\nThe letter signed on the prosecutor\u2019s behalf by Mark P. Dillon, Head of the Information and Evidence Unit, read in part: \u201cOn behalf of the Prosecutor, I thank you for your communication received on 13/09/2021, as well as any subsequent related information.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary examination of the petition is considered complete. Under Article 53 of the Rome Statute, the next step in the judicial process is for the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to prepare and submit a request to the Pre-Trial Chamber for authorisation to open an investigation on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOnce submitted, the request will be made publicly available on the Court\u2019s website: www.icccpi.int.\n\n\u201cYour communication will be forwarded to the relevant team to be analysed, together with other related communications and other available information, in the context of any future investigations. We thank you for your interest in the ICC.\u201d\n\nOluwadare said: \u201cBy this decision, the ICC prosecutor has taken a significant step toward ensuring that those suspected to be responsible for grave crimes against Nigerian schoolchildren are exposed, and held to account.\n\n\u201cThe victims of these crimes deserve justice. Impartial justice and reparation will deal a decisive blow to impunity of perpetrators, and improve access of Nigerian children to education. SERAP will work closely with the ICC to achieve these important objectives.\n\nSERAP\u2019s petition to the ICC prosecutor, read in part: \u201cSenior government officials know well or ought to know that their failure to prevent these crimes will violate the children\u2019s human rights and dignity.\n\n\u201cThe absence of any tangible and relevant investigation or prosecution in Nigeria suggests that the authorities are unwilling or unable to carry out genuine investigation or prosecution of those suspected to be responsible for and complicit in the abduction of students.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of persistent abductions of students, closure of schools, and the failure to provide safe and enabling learning environments despite federal and state authorities yearly budgeting some N241.2 billion of public funds as \u201csecurity votes\u201d, are similar to those of the offences in article 7(1).\n\n\u201cMore than 10,000 schools have been reportedly closed in at least seven northern states over the fear of attack and abduction of pupils and members of staff. The states are Sokoto, Zamfara, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Niger and Yobe.\n\n\u201cAmong the string of abductions in Zamfara was the abduction of over 200 schoolgirls in the town of Jangebe in February. The latest abduction comes after widespread reports of abduction of students and closure of schools in many states of Nigeria, including in north-central Niger State where some 91 schoolchildren were abducted.\n\n\u201cAn estimated 1.3 million Nigerian children have been affected by frequent raids on schools by suspected terrorists. Some 13 million Nigerian children are out of school nationwide. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), more than 1,000 students have been abducted from schools in northern Nigeria since December 2020.\n\n\u201cFamilies and parents have reportedly resulted to paying the terrorists thousands of dollars as ransom to secure the release of their children. An estimated $18.34 million was reportedly paid in ransoms between June 2011 and the end of March 2020.\n\n\u201cNigerian authorities have also failed and/or neglected to satisfactorily address the abduction of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in 2014, which prompted the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. According to reports, more than 100 of those girls are still missing.\u201d\n\nThe ICC prosecutor decided to seek an investigation after undertaking a preliminary examination of the cases of abduction of children in the country.\n\nA three-member panel of ICC pre-trial judges will consider whether to grant the prosecutor\u2019s request, once it is submitted, to let the ICC step in as a court of last resort.\n\nJudges will rely on the materials submitted by the prosecution to determine whether there is a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to proceed. Victims and their families may also make their views known to the pre-trial chamber.\n\nIf the investigation identifies suspected perpetrators of the crimes alleged in SERAP\u2019s petition, prosecutors can ask judges to issue international arrest warrants, which can remain under seal to help authorities apprehend those charged.\n\nAs an international court of last resort, the ICC is mandated to bring to justice people suspected to be responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.",

The soldier was attached to Operation Burst. A pick-up van, belonging to Operation Burst, which is a joint security network of Oyo State, was sighted at Abolongo riddled with bullets just as bloodstain was seen in the vehicle.\n\nBut the inmate that lost his life during the commotion reportedly tried scaled the fence of the centre, but could not make it as he landed on the ground on the other side of the fence.\n\nThe security personnel attached to the facility reportedly engaged the gunmen in a fierce duel with a view to repelling them for about 20 minutes, but the gunmen were said to have overpowered them and gained entry into the yard after using dynamite to blow open the wall.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThe attackers, as gathered, used grenades and other explosives to gain access into the awaiting trial section of the facility before setting free many of the awaiting trial inmates. But the other sections of the facilities were said to have been left untouched.\n\nSunday Sun reliably gathered that a total of 837 inmates were freed by the gunmen that came in large numbers on motorcycles. But as at the time of filing this report, the authorities of the NCS disclosed that a total of 262 escapees had been recaptured, while 575 of them are still at large.\n\nBut some of the escaped inmates reportedly returned to the centre by themselves. One of them was said to have come back with bread and beans, saying: \u201cI know that with what happened, there will not be good for us for some days. This is why I went out to get food so that I will not starve.\u201d\n\nWhen this reporter visited the attacked facility on Saturday, it was observed that observatory towers, residence of the head of custodial centre, and the iron door at the entrance of the main building of the centre were severely damaged with bullets and explosives.\n\nBut journalists were not allowed to enter the main custodial centre, where the inmates are being kept in different cells to assess the extent of damage done by the gunmen.\n\nThe Controller of Corrections, NCS, Oyo State Command, Mr Noel Ailewon, who initially spoke through the command\u2019s spokesperson, Olanrewaju Anjorin, said that journalists were not allowed entry into the facility because the place was being treated as a crime scene.\n\nHe added that the Oyo Custodial Centre was established in 2007 with a capacity of 160 inmates, but at the time of the attack, the facility had a total population of 907 inmates, out of which awaiting trial persons were 837, representing 92 per cent, while 64 are convicts.\n\nTwo among the high profile inmates, remanded at Abolongo Custodial Centre, are the alleged territorial warlord and kidnapping kingpin of Ibarapa area of the state, Iskilu Wakili, and the suspected serial killer that terrorised many communities in Akinyele Local Government Area of the state between May and August 2020, Sunday Sodipe.\n\nBut the authorities of the NCS in the state said that they would not mention names of the inmates, adding that high profile inmates \u201care still in the cells.\u201d\n\nAddressing journalists thereafter, Ailewon explained that the gunmen that attacked the facility stormed the place around 10:00p.m on Friday October 22, 2021, came in large numbers and attacked the centre with sophisticated weapons.\n\nAilewon stated that he was informed about the incident around 10:05p.m., by the head of the custodial centre, adding that there were varying degrees of injury, but could only confirm the death of the inmate that attempted to escape.\n\nHe added that following the Controller General of Corrections, Haliru Nababa\u2019s directives, he has commenced the process of search and recapture, after visiting the scene of the incident.\n\nHe assure that no effort would be spared to recapture the fleeing inmates, even as he solicited credible intelligence to aid security agencies in tracking down the escapees.\n\nShortly after the interview with Ailewon, recaptured inmates were brought into the facility in one mini-black maria and a big black maria as well.\n\nThe Director General of Operation Burst, Col. James Oladipo (rtd), said that the injured soldier was not dead as at 1:30p.m yesterday, saying, however, that the soldier was critically injured and he was not sure if he could survive the injury.\n\nAn impeccable source, who did not want his name in print, however, confirmed the soldier\u2019s death at 4:00p.m to Sunday Sun.\n\nBut a group of soldiers that sat under a tree at the premises of the facility told journalists that one of them was killed by the gunmen.\n\nThe Commandant of Amotekun Corps in Oyo State, Col. Olayinka Olayanju (rtd) told journalists on phone that one Amotekun Corps member died during the gun duel, while another sustained critical injury.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has said that he has been briefed on the attack, disclosing that he is monitoring the situation.\n\nA statement issued by his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure, stated that Aregbesola has assured members of the public to go about their normal businesses as the situation is under control, adding that the minister has also asked members of the public to report any suspicious movement or any sign of the escaped inmates and the gunmen in and around the vicinity to the nearest security post around them.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "As the Nigerian Guild of Editors convoked in Abuja to discuss the nation\u2019s insecurity challenges at its 17th All Nigerian Editors\u2019 Conference, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola has described inclusive governance and collaboration with security partners as models for addressing security issues in the nation.\n\nOyetola, who spoke at the executive session of the All Nigerian Editors\u2019 Conference, on Friday, described his recommendations as the model Osun has deployed in the last three years of his administration that has accounted for its enviable peace profile as one of the most peaceful states in the country.\n\nHe harped on innovative governance style at the federal, state and local levels, saying security is crucial to governance because security makes governance, business, development, trade, commerce, and every ingredient associated with governance possible and predictable.\n\nOyetola, who was represented by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Prince Abdullah Adeyanju Binuyo, bemoaned the issue of insecurity in the nation, saying that it has assumed a dizzying height and justifiably invites the attention of all critical stakeholders.\n\nWhile highlighting Osun\u2019s multimodal approach to combating insecurity over the last three years, Oyetola said: \u201cOur first approach was to acknowledge and not pretend about the magnitude of the crises at hand. Again, knowing that all security is local, just as all politics is local, we convoked a Security Summit that brought together all the security agencies, traditional rulers, and the various critical stakeholders whose roles directly or indirectly impact on the security situation.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\n\u201cAt this conference, we ensured that all stakeholders expressed their ideas in an open, unpretentious, and non-threatening manner. The ideas harvested from this meeting and, indeed, the emotional buy-in and resolve generated from this meeting, formed the inclusive and integrative approach that has constantly underlined our administration\u2019s security architecture.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, our administration introduced a civic engagement framework focused on bridging the gap between the leadership of the state and our teeming citizens. This framework is essentially a town hall model, where key functionaries of government sit with representatives of the people at strategic locations within the nine federal constituencies of the state to dialogue and receive feedback on the activities of government.\n\n\u201cLet me hasten to add that this model intently follows the already-established inclusive governance framework of our administration. Hinged on the conviction that dialogue and informed policy decisions are crucial for sustainable economic development and security, on my assumption of office, I traversed the length and breadth of the state in a \u2018Thank You Tour\u2019, working with our royal fathers to aggregate the needs of our people. This was also followed up with a thorough Needs Assessment exercise supported by the Department for International Development. All these initiatives have guided our service delivery and judicious allocation of resources so far in a way that justice, fairness and equity are served and enthroned.\n\n\u201cAs the closest to the people at the grassroots, traditional rulers are critical components of government. They also have the responsibility for ensuring security, governance and economic development in their abodes. Again this is hinged on our belief that all politics and security are local. The criminals come from families, homes, villages and towns. To effectively secure our state, therefore, our government prioritizes engagement with our traditional rulers as critical stakeholders in promoting active communal peace-building, intelligence gathering, good neighbourliness and responsible following.\n\n\u201cI must also mention that one of the critical outcomes of the security summit was the need to put together a Crop Farmers and Herders Committee. The committee works round the clock at ensuring firm surveillance on the activities of herders and ensures that conflicts are swiftly nipped in the bud before they become full-blown crises. Again, it is important to note that Osun is bordered by at least five states and as such is bound to be impacted by the butterfly or boomerang effect of what is happening nationally.\n\n\u201cAlthough security is on the exclusive list, we have worked and continue to work hard at developing a cordial relationship with the leadership of security agencies. This we have done through constant interface with the leadership of the Police Force, Department of Secret Service, the Military and the Civil Defence. The benefit of this is that we have enjoyed immense understanding, support and buy-in of the leadership of these agencies. This is one partnership we do not take for granted. One way we have appropriated this important partnership is by ensuring constant interface with the leadership of these agencies and providing relevant support to them where necessary. We have equally leveraged on this partnership to constitute a Joint Taskforce that patrols our communities.\n\n\u201cAs part of deepening the quest for the security of our people, we have adopted a more integrative and inclusive approach that takes into consideration the structural peculiarities of our communities. In response to this, what we have done as a government is to integrate our local hunters into our security architecture. The clear advantage of this is that we have developed enhanced local capacity for intelligence gathering to support the operations of our formal security agencies. We continue to insist that, rather than compete for relevance with conventional security agencies and other local security outfits, their activities should be complementary.\n\n\u201cWith respect to mining activities in our state, when our government assumed office, the various mining sites were in very bad shape and had loose regulation. This was further worsened by the influx of illegal miners from outside our state. Knowing how strategic this is for our diversification agenda, we had to regulate the sector to ensure that due process prevails in the sector. We are mindful of the need to secure the mining assets in order to encourage investors of the safety of their investments. The recent inauguration of the Joint Task Force (JTF) and the Amotekun Corps has drastically reduced criminal activities on the mine fields in the State. The peaceful and secured mines field in the State will not only boost investors\u2019 confidence but will also encourage both local and foreign investors to partner with the state government in the development of its mineral assets.\n\n\u201cThe effects of insecurity in our states on the Southwest necessitated the need for more improved security of lives and property of our people and rescue the economy of the region from imminent collapse. Governors of the Southwest, therefore, collaborated in establishing a regional security network, popularly known as Amotekun, to supplement the work of state security agencies in policing the region\u2019s forests and roadways. It is the region\u2019s solution to tackling the problems of kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and other crimes besetting it. This security arrangement, otherwise known as community policing, has become necessary because our conventional security agencies are overstretched and sorely underfunded.\n\n\u201cEven though our State has the lowest youth unemployment rate in the country at 11.65 percent, we have continued to work at ways of engaging our youths. This is because we understand that unemployment is a major catalyst for insecurity. Our response to this in the codification of our State\u2019s first Youth Policy Document, comprising of themes of engagement across 4Es \u2013 Youth Empowerment, Youth Education, Youth Entrepreneurship and Youth Engagement segments. So far, about 18,000 Osun youths have been empowered through various schemes, including loan disbursement to enable them to start new businesses and boost existing ones.\n\n\u201cWe are also heavily integrating them in politics and governance as part of efforts to achieve the sustainable development. This has ensured that our youths are adequately carried along in the delivery of our administration\u2019s development agenda.\n\n\u201cEqually inclusive of the broad agenda to combat insecurity is a deliberate effort to support the vulnerable members of our society. With our signature food bank project called Ounje Ileri (IleriOluwa foods), the government reaches out to 30,000 households monthly with at least 5kg of food items. The idea behind this is to ensure that no Osun citizen is left out of the reach of government support.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we continue to invest aggressively in infrastructural development in a manner that supports the prosperity of our people, revitalize the Osun economy and puts it on a firm footing, using agriculture, tourism and mining, in the first instance, as drivers for rapid socio-economic development. One of the notable programmes of our administration is our revitalization programme of the health sector involving the rehabilitation and construction of 332 Primary Healthcare Centres\u201d, Oyetola said.\n\nAlso part of the executive session were Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State who was represented by his Special Adviser on Inter-governmental Relations, Hajiya Hannatu Dalhat.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Parallel congresses: More trouble for APC",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nWith the conclusion of the ward, local government and state congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the stage is now set for the conduct of the long-awaited National Convention of the party to elect its National Working Committee (NWC) members, which by extension will resolve the lingering controversy surrounding the zoning arrangements for the 2023 presidential ticket of the ruling party.\n\nThe ruling party which prides itself as a model with the claim as the only political party to have successfully conducted membership registration and revalidation exercise, as well as congresses, however, has to contend with the realities on ground that seem to suggest that the party may be hunted by the rancorous and acrimonious congresses capable of threatening its build up to the 2023 polls.\n\nTruly speaking, with almost all the states replete with one form of crisis or parallel leadership to the point of producing two or three chairmen, the fallouts of the congresses could be a time bomb that may consume the party. Although ward and LG congresses have been a celebration of resentment and animosity, the recently concluded state congresses may have heightened the fragile peace among stakeholders in the party.\n\nFrom Lagos, Akwa-Ibom, Kano, Bauchi, Kwara, Rivers, Niger, Osun, Delta, Adamawa, Taraba, Cross River states to almost all the Southeast states, the unending bickering and acrimony have persisted since the conduct of the exercise due to the emergence of parallel leaderships.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nThe tension is still apparently palpable in almost all the states to the point that some party chieftains and leaders are defiling all the threats and warnings from the party\u2019s national leadership to institute legal actions against the party.\n\nIn Ogun State, for instance, the faction loyal to Governor Dapo Abiodun did not only threaten to expel former governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, but disturbing reports also have it that the fracas has degenerated to an intolerable level.\n\nThe situation is more discouraging in Osun State where the immediate past governor, Rauf Aregbesola, may have dragged the ruling party and estranged godson to court perhaps out of frustration.\n\nFrom the Southeast, Southwest, South-south, Northwest to North-central, among other zones, the magnitude of the crises situations portray danger to the future and fortunes of the ruling party.\n\nIt was that bad that APC could rightly be described as a house of commotion and a party presently divided against itself. And despite the endless threats from the national leadership to sanction aggrieved litigants, the crisis has continued to deteriorate unabated.\n\nWorried and determined to arrest the development, the national leadership, in its wisdom, had recently constituted the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Reconciliation Committee, but the escalating disquiet and feelers from almost all the states indicate that the committee may even be dead on arrival just like others before it.\n\nWith the volume of divisions within the party from the grassroots to even the national level, bookmakers have argued that the Senator Adamu-led committee may achieve little or nothing in restoring peace ahead of the party\u2019s planned National Convention.\n\nFor some, if the reconciliation committee performs wonders in resolving the warring factions, a more humongous crisis capable of rocking the party\u2019s foundation will come from the internal wrangling among the members of the legacy parties that merged to form the APC, over who should produce the next party\u2019s national chairman. Already, the gladiators are at each other\u2019s throats over such primordial sentiment before the recently-concluded state congresses across the country.\n\nAgain, other looming crises capable of imploding the ruling party include the confusion surrounding the zoning formula between the North and South, the battle among the power blocs to control the party\u2019s structures, the much-touted undocumented agreement between Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and President Muhammadu Buhari, the unconfirmed interest that may pitch Vice President Yemi Osinbajo against Tinubu, his godfather, and the deserved endless agitations by the Southeast geopolitical zone to produce the next president in 2023.\n\nThe ruling party may not have openly made a clear pronouncement concerning the zoning arrangements it plans to adopt for both the party\u2019s national leadership and elective positions, but there are, however, strong indications that the inability of the legacy parties to arrive at a consensus might pose greater threat to the party\u2019s fragile peace.\n\nConsidering the fact that greater number of the aspirants clamouring for the chairmanship position are majorly from the North, which indicates that it may have been tactically zoned there, the lingering issue of which of the legacy parties should produce the next chairman is tearing the party apart.\n\nThe debate is laced around the fact that since other legacy parties like the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) have all produced the party\u2019s national chairman previously, it is now the turn of the Congress for Progressives Change (CPC) to produce the next party chairman.\n\nA chieftain of the party who spoke to Sunday Sun on condition of anonymity said: \u201cThe issue of which zone produces the next national chairman of our great party may have been resolved with the majority of the aspirants indicating interest in the position, coming from the North. Our biggest challenge, however, is the interests and disagreements between members of the legacy parties over who deserves to produce the next national chairman.\n\n\u201cSome of their postures include the claim from the CPC members that since ACN produced the first interim chairman in the person of Chief Segun Osoba and again Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, the ANPP produced Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, it is, therefore, their turn to take a shot at the position,\u201d the source argued.\n\nBut what becomes of the members of the new Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP) in the power sharing equation, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that nPDP members are actually interested in the party\u2019s chairmanship position. In the contrary, they seem to be more interested in the presidential ticket.\u201d\n\nThe internal wrangling and cold war among the legacy party members seem to be child\u2019s play to the expected clash of interest by various presidential aspirants ahead of the 2023 polls. Unlike the PDP, where political watchers could easily identify those nursing the ambition, such interest has continued to exist in the realm of speculations in the APC.\n\nSupporters to certain APC chieftains had alluded or openly disclosed the presidential interests of their political icons like Asiwaju Tinubu, Prof Osinbajo, the governor of Ekiti state, Kayode Fayemi, his Kaduna counterpart, Nasir el-Rufai, Kogi\u2019s Yahaya Bello, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi and the numerous party chieftains of Igbo extraction, among others.\n\nEndorsements and counter-endorsements have come from certain socio-cultural pressure groups, but the political indicators have not clearly projected certain persons above the others.\n\nAgain, the political climate and calculations may have already become unfavourable to some of them especially after losing out of the power play after the recently concluded congresses.\n\nFor example, the Asiwaju support groups may have flagged off campaign to formally confirm his interest in the race, they have equally flew the kite of a gentleman agreement between him and President Buhari, but certain storms and forces that may constitute a cog in the wheel of his actualisation of such ambition may have already started gathering momentum.\n\nSuch factors, according to political watchers, include the intense fight for the soul of the party which has balkanised the Lagos chapter of the party, resulting in the emergence of parallel state party chairmen and the expected battle from the Osinbajo political camp.\n\n\u201cMany things may count against Asiwaju,\u201d an APC chieftain told Sunday Sun in confidence, explaining that: \u201cthe incidences in Lagos and Edo governorship election were clearly a miscalculation for Asiwaju.\n\n\u201cWhen the appeals to him to endorse Ambode\u2019s second term failed and when he mistakenly involved himself again in the Edo governorship crisis and almost succeeded, his actions sent negative signals to the northern oligarchy that if he could be that powerful without presidential powers, he may be a dictatorial president if he finally becomes president in 2023.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding, so the effects of the purported dismissal of any existing agreement between Mr President and Asiwaju to take the 2023 presidential ticket as claimed by the Minister of Transportation as one person who should be in the know of such plan due to his crucial role as the Campaign DG in the election of President Buhari in 2015, or the schemes in Lagos to relegate him to inconsequential political relevance, Asiwaju still remains a force to reckon with in APC ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nFor some Nigerians, Prof Osinbajo stood a vantage position to be the biggest beneficiary should the attempts to crumble the Asiwaju political dynasty materialised. Yes, his interest has been secretly projected by his teeming supporters, but he is another person secretly eyeing the exalted presidential seat in Aso Rock.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that there is the likelihood that the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led national leadership may likely recognise the Ambode faction in Lagos and once that is done, the Asiwaju political dynasty has crumbled. If this circumstance plays out, Osinbajo will certainly be the biggest beneficiary,\u201d an APC chief told Sunday Sun.\n\nBut, it is not obviously going to be a two-horse race between Asiwaju and Osinbajo, if they finally declare their interests, with the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) comfortably in charge of the party structure presently.\n\nWith the yam and knife in their custody, it may have rekindled the speculation of the apparent interests from many of them.\n\nThose speculated to be nursing such presidential ambition, according to various reports, include Fayemi, El-rufai, governors of Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu; Kebbi, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; Kano, Umar Ganduje; Borno, Prof Babagana Zulum, and Yahaya Bello, among others.\n\nIf the various interests projected to be interested in the ticket are still in the realm of speculation and uncertainty, the deafening agitations for president of Igbo extraction in 2023 have refused to ebb despite the hostilities that tried to eclipse and crush it.\n\nFrom the Ohanaeze Ndigbo and other Igbo socio-political and cultural organisations, the demands for an Igbo presidency in 2023 have reached a crescendo despite the escalating insecurity in the zone.\n\nIn all of these, however, the future of APC is apparently shrouded in uncertainty. The reason may not be farfetched because APC is a confirmed party of body language. Regardless of the torrent and magnitude of the charging storm, decision and resolutions will only depend on the interpretation of the body language of President Buhari and/or the presidency by extension.\n\n\u201cAspirants for the 2023 presidential election don\u2019t need to hit the gem to train and build muscle for the battle ahead on how to pick the ticket. It will not also be determined by the volume or decibel of noise the aspirants make.\n\n\u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t need to front yourself too much because whoever the power that be projected, will formally present himself. I can tell you that interested persons are not declaring because they are waiting for the endorsement from the decision makers,\u201d a privileged APC chieftain told Sunday Sun.\n\nHead or tail, the ability of the ruling party to deploy every internal resolution mechanism to solve the lingering crisis rocking the party will certainly be the tonic or determine the dynamics of how the political undercurrent and intrigue of the 2023 presidential election will play out.\n\nTo underscore this assertion, an APC chieftain and the Director General Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu, had while cautioning his party wondered why anybody could dissipate much energy on the party\u2019s national chairmanship position and the presidential ticket when the party is collapsing under the weight of the crisis in almost all the states, heightened by the rancorous congresses.\n\n\u201cI think we should solve the escalating crisis on ground before thinking about the national chairmanship position or even who gets the presidential ticket. If the party is claiming that there is no crisis trailing the congresses, we should ask those making such claims how many leaderships the congresses produced in their states.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, we have to specially ask my good friend, the National Secretary, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, James Akpanudoedehe, who is dismissing the crisis, how many parallel leaderships that emerged from the congresses in his home state, Akwa-Ibom.\n\n\u201cIf he is saying that there is no issue in the congress conducted in his state, we have to ask him whether it will be in the interest of our party to ignore the Godswill Akpabio and Ita Enang faction. As I said earlier, national chairmanship position is a secondary issue for now.\n\n\u201cWhat should concern us now is how to harmonize the parallel leadership that emerged from the congresses and resolve the crisis rocking many of the state chapters due to the fallout of the misunderstanding from the congresses. This resolution is what is going to help our party replicate our previous electoral victories,\u201d he suggested.\n\nThe VON DG was not alone in the prediction of doom for the ruling party.\n\nThe former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Attahiru Jega, had equally warned that lack of internal democracy among other dynamics would result in the implosion of both the APC and PDP\n\n\u201cPeople have captured and controlled political parties for self-serving objectives, so no energy is devoted to organising primaries. Governors deploy state resources to control political parties in their states to decide which candidate will emerge. It is all driven by self-serving objectives and it is political rascality.\n\n\u201cAfter 22 years of democracy, we have still not freed ourselves from this overbearing control of people who just use parties as special purpose vehicles for winning elections by hook or crook. That is why many of us are beginning to think that these so-called dominant parties are really a huge disappointment, a disgrace to the democratisation process of our country, and if we are hoping for change within these political parties, I regret to say it will be very long in coming. This is why many of us are pushing for a new purpose vehicle for democratic elections and to ensure that we move in the right direction,\u201d he argued.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Yes, I use sex toys \u2013Kemi Stone, actress/filmmaker",
          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nKemi Stone is an actress, filmmaker and entrepreneur. Aside her first love: acting, the soft-spoken lady also deals in aphrodisiacs and sex toys.\n\nIn this interview, Kemi talks about her career, lifestyle, among others. Please enjoy it.\n\nTell us how you got into acting and your first day in front of the camera?\n\nI have always had a passion for acting. I went to PEFTI Film School in Lagos. I started going to model casting; a friend I met during the casting invited me for acting auditions. I went for several auditions and got tired at some point. But on this fateful day, I accompanied a big sister that supplied stationeries to Opa Williams. I was sitting innocently at the reception in my koroba hairstyle and he asked how old I was. I told him and he then asked, \u2018can you act?\u2019 I said I love to act and he called his secretary to give me a script, which I read. He was wowed, so I got a major role in the soap opera, Living Next To You. I acted alongside Sukanmi Omobolanle, Kiki Omeli etc. However, what amazed me was the amount I was paid. I was paid N250,000. I can\u2019t forget because it\u2019s still the highest paid job in my acting journey. The ones I struggled for their auditions didn\u2019t even pay me that much.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nWhat were you doing before this?\n\nI was just a little girl full of dreams and goals. I was studying for a diploma in law at LASU, Ojo Campus. At the same time I was at LASU, I was also running a course at PEFTI Film Institute and equally doing modelling jobs, as well as beaded jewelries.\n\nHow many films have you featured in?\n\nTo be honest, I have lost count. But I have produced four movies including Ojo Kan, Ijogbon, Kemi Olode and Kadara Eda, which is new and not yet out.\n\nWhat is the movie, Kadara Eda all about? And when is it going public?\n\nIt\u2019s all about the destiny of mankind, which is in the hands of the Most High. Circumstances and situations that arise in our day-to-day living is a trigger to our paths in life. The movie is going to be released before December.\n\nYou are also a rapper, what is the inspiration behind that?\n\nI can\u2019t even sing to save my life. I don\u2019t know where the rapper thing is coming from; I love to sing, but I don\u2019t have the voice.\n\nMany actresses talk about sexual harassment in Nollywood, have you ever encountered such?\n\nI have never experienced sexual harassment in my acting journey.\n\nOkay, what is your experience as a producer?\n\nIt has been awesome, and I am always happy when I produce my own movie. I give myself opportunity to get a better role as an actor, then being able to raise funds, getting the appropriate director and cast for the movie, working on post production and also getting money invested back.\n\nWho or what do you consider as the greatest influence in your life?\n\nThe word of God guides me in the right path. Toyin Lawani has also been a good influence. I can relate with her, I love her so much. Her energy, talent, consistency is a big influence on me.\n\nWhat advice do you have for young people who want to go into the movies?\n\nFirst, have in mind that it is not going to be easy, but it will be worth fighting for. Always follow your dreams and never give up. A lot of people will look down on you, nobody will believe in you; in fact, some people might tell you that you can\u2019t make it. But always believe in yourself and pray to God.\n\nDo you have any regret?\n\nI\u2019m not happy about how Instagram almost ruined my career. Immediately I got signed by the biggest skincare brand, House of Phreeda, I went on set of my new movie, Kadara Eda and I posted some location pictures. Colleagues and fans started congratulating me; and it was exactly that time that Instagram took down my account of 50,000 followers, which I have been building since 2016. I felt very sick because it\u2019s the biggest platform I had for the world to see my craft. I tried several times to open a new account, but Instagram kept taking down my handle.\n\nWhat could have happened?\n\nInstagram disabled my account and my platform. I think one of my wicked colleagues must have squealed about me to Instagram. Most of them don\u2019t want to see me grow in the industry. Like someone said, maybe there were so many reports about me, that was why Instagram pulled down my account. But God pass them all. Anyway, I am not giving up; I have opened another account in my real name, Rukayat Oluwakemi Olusanya.\n\nWhat\u2019s the next thing for you now?\n\nIt\u2019s my new movie, Kadara Eda, which will be out in November. Also, I am focusing on my store. I just moved to a bigger outlet on Ogunlana Drive, Surulere, Lagos. It has been hectic setting up the place because of the situation of Nigerian business. Thank God, I am not only into fashion business, I sell aphrodisiacs as well as sex toys, and that has been very profitable.\n\nHow has it been selling sex toys?\n\nIt is not easy as a sex toy vendor. People look at you as a devil, forgetting that sex is a basic human need. The annoying part of it is that people send me different kinds of pictures of manhood. Oh my God, this is sad! But that is the price I have to pay for selling sex toys. However, I don\u2019t let all that distract me.\n\nDo you also use sex toys?\n\nDo I use it? Oh yes, I do. I use it. It is not harmful.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

Excerpt:\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nLooking at Nigeria at 61 and the journey so far, what is your take on it?\n\nEven if I say that I am satisfied it will look like a kind of hypocrisy, because not even within Nigeria, even the international world know that Nigeria is getting sicker, if there is any word like that, things are just getting worse by the day, we are sinking. If we look at the journey from independence down the lane it is always like; yesterday is better than today, so it is like our expectation will always get below the previous one, it is like getting backward, you look at the prices of commodities, you look at our security system, you look at our economy. We are now in a situation where, economically Nigeria cannot even be defined, so it is no longer I or an individual assessment now, what we are passing through now is beyond an individual, Nigeria needs a kind of emergency fixing because if we continue the way we are today, I don\u2019t think Nigeria will survive the disaster that is ahead. It\u2019s a matter of time and that time will not be long. Any country that is not security conscious the way we are going because security-wise we are not fit, economically we are not strong, we are not fit, we are not taking the economic lane, the process that we should take\u2026it is always one blunder after another. Nigeria is always deteriorating as if there is no solution.\n\nWhere exactly do you anchor the failure?\n\nWell, to a large extent it is the failure of leadership, but who are producing the leaders? It\u2019s not that Nigeria does not have an option or do not have a kind of fall back \u2026is it that we cannot try something different because there are options out there? If we are sincere, if we have a sincerity of purpose and we start doing things not as business as usual, but doing things differently, stop being selfish, start being patriotic, something for the nation, getting committed genuinely for the building of the nation. But the truth is that Nigerians have lost faith in their leaders, but again you ask yourself do you blame only the leaders. That is where the followership also needs to wake up. We are all at fault, the leaders, the masses and in making Nigeria better it\u2019s not about one man doing it. No one man can do it and the earlier we realised this, the better. We all have to come together and change our old mindset, see how we can change the status quo because if we have not seen Nigeria as a kind of everybody\u2019s project I don\u2019t think there will be any good result. Look, if somebody is voted into an office and he comes back to the constituency and the people boo him at the entrance of the village or even throw stones at him (but not to kill him), it will send a signal that he did not do anything and you see them sitting up to do the job. But if when they come back, you rush to their houses, even when they did not perform, you welcome them, celebrate them, sing their praises and all that and they give you let\u2019s say N1, 000 and you take, we lose at the end of the day. It is sad we celebrate them based on what they have in their pocket and the peanut they offer to the people in the name of money. We don\u2019t respect people if they have not assumed office, we don\u2019t respect people if they don\u2019t have money in their pocket or bank account. So, it\u2019s very unfortunate, Nigeria should be a project of everybody.\n\nAre you in support of power shift to the South?\n\nAs a nationalist, as a patriotic Nigerian, I believe in leadership based on merit, leadership based on capacity and we should allow leaders to emerge based on what they can offer, but most of these people that are having Nigeria at heart how many of them have the capacity to come to power in this country? We all know that nobody can assume power in Nigeria without the approval of at least four stages. Number one, you need to have the support of the masses, you have to be popular, you have to be visible, people need to know you, the reason people are jumping to the big political parties. Number two, you need to have money. And the money that we are talking about is not just that of child\u2019s play, when it comes to winning election not only in Nigeria, but in Africa, we are talking of huge amount of billions and that is more than one man project. That is why we need the support of other Nigerians. Number three, you need an international body, international contact and recognition because there are some places or projects you need to push to be approved at that category and the final one is that you need to be fit for the position, that is where merit and others come in. But the way things are going in Nigeria who can pass this entire category apart from most of them that have been there already? That is why most new entrants are finding it difficult, particularly when mixed with our level of crude politics. But why I will not want to kick against rotation is because of our geographical setting. If it is going to be based on majority votes there are some sections or parts of the country that are stronger than others by population. That is why some people are crying for marginalisation and agitating, so if we do not go through this zoning of a thing, I don\u2019t think some tribe or perhaps ethnic groups will come to power. So, sometimes no matter how you want to do somethings right in Nigeria you also need to weigh other options because we need to be fair to each other. I prefer if we have leaders based on merit, but the way things are going in this country this zoning has been there and it\u2019s like what has been keeping the country going. There has never been a time Nigerians have lost confidence in leadership than this time we have seen President Buhari not giving us what we thought he is going to give us. His leadership is disappointing. The PDP government was business as usual, we know it was not a common man investment, so they have the right to do whatsoever they wanted to do, but this time around we voted for Buhari thinking that he is going to be the solution or provide the solution, but we are disappointed. Even myself I have never thought of standing in the frontline of leadership struggle, I have never been afraid of leadership like what I am seeing from President Buhari, he doesn\u2019t have all that we expected from him to change things. Things are even getting worse. I have never been afraid of being in government, or being in leadership until I saw somebody like President Buhari who everybody had fear for as well as respect for not performing.\n\nWhat is your take on the debate concerning extending amnesty to bandits?\n\nWhosoever is talking about amnesty to bandits is probably one that does not know the havoc they have caused and are still causing. These people are so crude to the extent of killing, raping, if you have been listening to the testimonies of those people who have been kidnapped, their horrific experience, you will not talk about amnesty. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something to talk about. How can you think of extending amnesty to those animals because they have lost every sense of human being with what they are doing, killing people with no reason, kidnapping people, brutalizing them is a means of living for them. They are saying they have repented and I ask, repented in which sense? Was it not last week we read about not less than 150 people being rescued by the army? How can you talk about amnesty when they are even recruiting and recruiting more with thousands of them in the bushes? I saw a report of them now operating with helicopters and the people are getting stronger by the day, so what is amnesty? Look if I will be in the forefront I will go out and tell Nigerians that they should come out, let\u2019s start guiding ourselves, every village should have something like their own army, let\u2019s start protecting ourselves because the government is no longer capable of protecting the citizens of this country security-wise.\n\nWhat will you say concerning what is going on in Anambra State and the threat of the government to declare a state of emergency in the state?\n\nWhat is happening in Anambra now is similar to what is happening in the Northern Nigeria because if you look at the current happenings it seems that there are some infiltrations. It is like some bad elements are putting some bad eggs into strategic places to make certain things happen based on their personal gains. For me what is happening in Anambra is not about IPOB, it\u2019s not about the marginalisation and the likes, no, I think what is happening in Anambra is pre-planned, and we don\u2019t wake up on time to start asking questions. It\u2019s not Anambra alone, this infiltration is being instigated by our own citizens and this is very unfortunate and Whosoever that is empowering them, to be planting people and killing their own brothers, I wonder what is going to happen if we destroy the only country that we have in this world. People are now afraid of Nigeria and Nigeria is one of the best places to live, but see how we are turning it. Nigeria is one of the best countries to survive because there are a lot of opportunities in this country. But sadly, we are allowing people to destroy the only land we can call our own, the most beautiful place in the world. It is bad we are allowing people to infiltrate and destabilize us. I wish Nigerians will just wake up from their slumber and address this issue critically.\n\nWhat is your view on open grazing?\n\nI don\u2019t want to say much about it because of the negative effect, the new phase the Fulani are now bringing into it. I am proudly Fulani, but I am not happy with what is happening in almost every part of the country. It started small, but I don\u2019t know what is setting or blowing the fire, I don\u2019t know what really happened to my people that this has continued to happen. If you look at this grazing of a thing, I could remember my grandfather, all used to send their cattle to the South during the dry season in the North and that has been the way of living in Nigeria for hundreds of years and we had no problem, it was peaceful relationship with the herders. The other day in the social media somebody was questioning the citizenship of the Fulanis in Nigeria. Nobody, Yoruba, Jukun, Igbo, Tiv, etc, we all settled at one point or the other. Every country in the world is a settlement; we all came from somewhere to settle where we are. But this grazing of a thing is something that has been here for hundreds of years as I said before. Have we ever seen anything like what we are witnessing now? Like I said on what is happening in Anambra and other parts of the country, there is infiltration. Nigeria has become so incapable that you need to visit our borders, you cannot pass through Niger Republic without a serious check, all this smuggling going on at our border is it how the border of other countries are porous? Go to Niger they have a very tight security, but Nigeria is very insecure, if you look at our borders it is something of disgrace, we are so vulnerable of any attack. You see, we have a lot of issues that cannot be discussed in the media. For me, it is not agreeing or agreeing to open grazing, but it is for the government to have clear information of what is happening. This thing is not about open grazing or not, no, it is beyond it and that is what the government must find out. Okay, what is happening in Anambra is it also caused by herdsmen? It is just that sometime we carry one topic and be discussing it and be deviating from the reality of things. Let the government dig deep and fix things right, that is the issue.\n\nDo you support the restructuring of Nigeria?\n\nVery well, I am in support. If Nigeria is restructured today all these petty problems, the marginalisation, name it, that the people are agitating for will fade away because everybody will be busy minding their businesses. A proper constitutional restructuring is what we need in this country, if we do restructuring properly there will be this sense of belonging and people will be earning their living and the differences we are talking of and enlarging will not be in place.\n\nGiven your position on what is happening in the country what are your worst fears?\n\nIt is the fact that Nigerians have lost hope in the country. Nigerians don\u2019t love themselves anymore, so much emphasis on our differences. I could remember when we were in primary school, the love we shared, that togetherness, we did not remember if we had differences, we learned the language of other Nigerians and we were happy speaking them, but today there is so much divisiveness, so much talk about how we can no longer live together in the country and you began to wonder, what exactly is going on? Nothing is impossible in the Nigeria of today and you can say Nigeria is a time bomb, anything can happen. There is nobody coming out sincerely to bring Nigerians together and I hope and pray that the youths will wake up from all these lies and speak the truth to themselves and come together to save this country because the youth are the majority population, more than 65 per cent. We should come together and do something different. We should start thinking of a better future for this country and things can be fixed by the grace of God.\n\nThere is this gale of decamping among politicians and let\u2019s know whether it\u2019s in your plan also to shift base?\n\nThere are some factors that make some politicians to decamp because we have different kinds of politicians in the country. Some are because of greed; some are in politics because of passion. Some have good intensions, but when they weigh their party and the feasibility of realizing their dream to deliver what they have for the people they shift base if the opportunity is quite slim. But for me, some people are telling me, why don\u2019t I jump over to a bigger party like the PDP or APC because they feel my party, YPP is a small party. But I believe in what we are doing, I so much believe in my party, the progress we are making from 2019 till now. We set a history in Plateau, we won a seat in Lagos, the way we are going in my party I know it\u2019s not a day\u2019s job to arrive there, but I have a lot of hope, we need consistency and resilience and we will get there. There will not be any need for decamping for me.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "text": "Yes, I have graduated with an LLB Second-Class Upper from Baze University. Tough journey. Imagine moving from the Federal Executive Council to the classroom with under-20s. I wore black trousers and a white shirt daily. I made an effort to enter the class before the lecturers, submitted assignments as and due dates.\n\nIt was humbling, but it brought order to my life. After eight years of high-octane service, from the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to the Ministry of Aviation, Baze University was therapeutic.\n\nSchool was not without distraction. I left to run for Governor, came back. I left to manage the Atiku (Abubakar) campaign election centre, came back.\n\nSchool was not without its setbacks. On the campaign trail for the 2019 elections, I struggled with school work but thought I could wing it. Alas, I failed Evidence 1 taught by my friend, Prof. Ojukwu. He refused to give me makeup midterm tests that I missed. Whenever I approached him, he would cheerfully \u2018gist\u2019 and analyse the elections with me.\n\nAfter each discussion, I went away confident he would reconsider. He did not. I went into the examination with 0/30. It was humbling, as I had not experienced examination failure before then. I nearly withdrew.\n\nI persevered. I re-registered Evidence 1 and attended Prof Ojukwu's lectures, participated in all class assignments and followed his teaching style. I passed very well. Setbacks and failures are part of life. Face them squarely.\n\nAt Baze, I got no preferential treatment, and the school enforced rules. I highly recommend the university to aspiring students.\n\nMy wife can't wait to form a law partnership with me, Chidoka and Chidoka, where she would be the senior partner. Chidinma daalu (thank you), for all the support and tutorials, I hope your seniority ends at the bar and not near our bedroom.\n\nTo my children, thank you for all the support and be reminded that I will not accept a degree less than a second-class upper. If I can do it at old age, you have no excuse.\n\nToday, I attended the convocation with pride. Hopeful about the future, proud that I applied Uche in learning and Uchu in Perseverance and commitment to earn a law degree.\n\nChidoka is a former Chief Executive of the Federal Road Safety Corps and Minister of Aviation.",

          "text": "The Federal Polytechnic in Bauchi has sacked two lecturers of the institution accused of sexually harassing female students.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYahaya Gumau, the institution\u2019s rector, broke the news after the 98th meeting of the polytechnic\u2019s governing council on Saturday.\n\nGumau said the sacked lecturers include Musa Baba Abubakar of the general studies department and Adebusoye Michael Sunday of the nutrition and dietetics department.\n\nGumau, who spoke with journalists after the governing council\u2019s meeting, also dismissed claims that the institution was trying to cover up the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI welcome you to witness the final verdict of all that have been making waves in the media concerning the issue of our staff who was reported to have been allegedly involved in rape, Abubakar Musa Baba,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut what surprises me the most is that it is only his own name that is being mentioned. The other lecturer\u2019s name was silent in the media, I don\u2019t know the reason or the rationale behind it.\n\n\u201cThis issue of Musa Baba, came up on August 3, 2021. The extant rule of the Polytechnic is that, if an issue of this magnitude happens, the complainant has to write. And immediately when she wrote, the Registrar, that very evening, was in my house with her HOD.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rector said the dismissal had followed the report of a committee constituted to look into the matter.\n\n\u201cI directed that the staff be queried which was the next line of action as per the extant rules of our institution as provided by the federal government. But when his reply was not satisfactory, we established a committee to investigate that matter thoroughly to its logical conclusion,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAfter the committee submitted its report, the next authority that should have looked into the issue is the Sub-Committee of the Council. And the Council normally meet quarterly. This issue happened after the last council and it was the next meeting that would decide on the case,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe Senior Staff Appointment, Promotion and Disciplinary Committee met and invited the suspect. We cross-examined him and made our recommendations to the Council.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Council today, has finally, approved the dismissal of Abubakar Musa Baba from the service of the Polytechnic, Bauchi. Also, Adebusoye Michael Sunday is dismissed from the services of the Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi with effect from Saturday on a similar case. That is the decision of the Council on these issues.\u201d\n\nThe rector said that the dismissal letters of the erring lecturers would be submitted to the police and the Department of State Service (DSS).\n\nGumau added that the two security agencies, which assisted the institution during the investigation, would continue with the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

          "title": "Baxi acquisition deal sees MFS Africa expand footprint into Nigeria",
          "text": "In a deal subject to approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria, MFS Africa has signed an agreement to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies with a 90,000-strong agent network across the country, for an undisclosed amount.\n\nAs the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa, MFS Africa connects banks, telcos, and money transfer operators across over 35 countries via a single integration point. Paga, MTN mobile money, Ecobank, and Safaricom are among the operators integrated on the hub, with an estimated 320 million mobile money customers interacting across various digital wallets without transaction fees associated with switching platforms.\n\nCapricorn, under its SME-focused brand, Baxi, operates an ecosystem of digital payment services. Its solution is built to help Nigerians with everyday payment needs; including utility bill payments, airtime purchases, pay-TV and data subscriptions, withdrawals, and money transfers. The company delivers these services through its retail network of agents and merchants in some of the remotest locations across Nigeria, and via its BaxiBox POS, BaxiPay, Baxi MPoS Device, and BaxiRIMS products.\n\nThe 100% cash acquisition, MFS Africa\u2019s third in five years, sees the pan-African payments giant expand into Africa\u2019s largest economy, where its presence to date has been limited given the country\u2019s small number of mobile wallets. Capricorn will be called MFS Africa but its core product, Baxi, retains its name.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBoth parties declined to disclose the value of the deal but on a call with TechCabal, Capricorn Founder and CEO, Degbola Abudu, said the deal is the second-largest of its kind in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, behind the $200 million Stripe paid for Paystack last year.\n\nMFS Africa was founded in 2009 by Dare Okoudjou, a Beninese national, while Nigeria-born Abudu started Capricorn in 2014, with Folu Majekodunmi. The acquisition creates a larger, more versatile company that fuses interoperability between money operators and a super-agent network reaching the mass market.\n\nA pan-African march\n\nMFS Africa\u2019s big vision is to have a presence in all 54 African countries, serving 500 million people and millions of small businesses, according to Okoudjou.\n\n\u201cIf you have a phone or POS, it should be enough to transact with the rest of Africa and the world,\u201d he tells TechCabal. \u201cWe\u2019re building the foremost, currency-agnostic, real-time hub for payments on the continent, to enable people transfer money the way they can call each other.\u201d\n\nOften, MFS Africa\u2019s continental expansion plan has involved partnering with money operators and making minority investments in other fintech companies across Africa, as in the case of Julaya, Maviance, and Numida.\n\nHowever, Okoudjou explains that the company opts for full acquisition when both parties consider that more effective for achieving their shared long-term ambitions.\n\nDare Okoudjou, MFS Africa founder and CEO (left) and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Baxi.\n\nWhy an acquisition?\n\nSimilar to Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech startup MFS Africa bought in June 2020 also for an undisclosed amount, acquisition talks with Capricorn evolved from a minority investment to a full buyout.\n\n\u201cThe more we spoke with Dee, the more we realised what we could achieve with a full acquisition instead of being only investors in which case there could be misaligned incentives.\u201d\n\nOkoudjou further explains that the need to \u201cbolster our presence in Nigeria\u201d given its unique market features\u2014the prevalence of offline payment touchpoints over mobile-first transactions\u2014drove MFS Africa\u2019s interest in Capricorn.\n\n\u201cIn other markets, one or two partnerships with mobile money operators could see us reach 60% of digital payment users in the country,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, mobile money isn\u2019t that widely adopted in Nigeria. Instead, agent networks such as Capricorn\u2019s have grown rapidly.\u201d\n\nWhile MFS Africa can service SMEs online through Beyonic, for instance, Baxi enables the company to reach offline merchants in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nFor Abudu, the future of the mobile payments landscape in Africa is a game of few, where consolidation is the way forward, and attempting to scale alone would require more capital expenditure and a longer time to execute.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to partner with a company that brings a real pan-African presence and we see synergies across our operations. They offer a wide range of value-added products and services like cross-border payments while we have access to SMEs in Nigeria, one of the biggest markets in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cWe believe that we\u2019ve barely scratched the market\u2019s potential. The deal brings many things that allow us to grow very quickly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the acquisition\u2019s close, MFS Africa will build Baxi into a key node on its digital payment network, allowing customers to make cross-border payments to and from Nigeria, similar to what it\u2019s done with mobile money operators across Africa. MFS Africa will also expand Baxi\u2019s proposition for offline SMEs to select markets within its footprint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to build a large business with relatively small capital but now we want to be able to compete, not just in Nigeria but also across Africa,\u201d Abudu says. \u201cThe deal with MFS Africa gives us leverage to take Baxi and the model that\u2019s been so successful in Nigeria to other African countries.\u201d\n\nMFS Africa plans to engage with Nigeria\u2019s central bank and other regulators to seek any other additional licenses needed to operate its full-service offerings\u2014such as remittance, micro-lending, insurance\u2014while also exploring commercial partnerships in the country.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects.

          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I spoke with Charles Isidi \u2014 a growth marketing expert and digital media and marketing communications professional \u2014 over the phone, both of us stuttering to varying degrees as we discussed stuttering, words from a 2001 R&B song came back to me.\n\nWithout bogging you down with details, the chorus goes, \u201cI can tell you\u2019re lying, because when you\u2019re replying, stutter, stutters, stutter, stutters.\u201d\n\nLovers of R&B know that in the rest of the song, Joseph Lewis Thomas, known mononymously as Joe, suspected his partner was cheating on him. Yes, he smelt cologne. Yes, she didn\u2019t pick up when he called. But, his strongest point was that she stuttered when answering his questions about her whereabouts.\n\nAnd therein lies a major misconception: people stutter when they are lying. Twenty-one years later, the chorus of that song still forms the basis of many people\u2019s interactions with stutterers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs someone with a slight stutter, I\u2019d be irked if people conclude I\u2019m fibbing because I can\u2019t get my words out coherently or quickly enough (for them). And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone.\n\nSadly, being branded a liar because of a stutter is just one of the issues we stutterers face.\n\nStuttering in a tech-enabled world\n\nOne can be forgiven for thinking that there is a tech solution somewhere that does away with stuttering. Stuttering has no known cure, and the best technology can currently do is what therapy does \u2014 treat or manage the condition like other speech defects.\n\nPeople can get the most out of treatment if they address stuttering early enough \u2014 preferably as children. Treatment at any age seeks to improve speech fluency while simultaneously building the stutterer\u2019s confidence, thus helping them participate in school, work, and social settings.\n\nExpectedly, tech interventions exist, with many applications \u2014 Balbus Speech, Smarty Ears, and Stamurai (I like this name), to mention a few \u2014 for smartphones and tablets to help people with stuttering.\n\nStamurai, for instance, is a mobile app available on Google Play Store and the App Store. With the app, people learn and practice speech therapy exercises for stuttering. The best result they can get, however, is improved speech control.\n\nIn a world where social media is the go-to for content, many creators generate content from people\u2019s challenges for their jokes. Mildly put, this is insensitive and hurtful, and Charles strongly believes that people should be kinder to not only stutterers but everyone dealing with a disability.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie\n\nAccording to The Stuttering Foundation, stuttering affects 1% of the world\u2019s population; depending on what global population you accept, that\u2019s 78 or 79 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer a paper on the International Stuttering Association website titled, Increasing Stuttering Awareness in Africa, 11% of children in Africa \u2014 nearly 6.5 million \u2014 of pre-school age (between 2 and 5 years of age) stutter. About 20% or 1.3 million of these children are at the risk of developing chronic stuttering in adult life, and approximately one million school-age children and over ten million adults stutter in Africa.\n\nScience trumps mythology\n\nAcross Africa, traditional beliefs about stuttering abound, varying from one location to the next.\n\nIn South Africa, for instance, stuttering is believed to result from leaving a baby out in the rain, failing to inform ancestors of imminent childbirth, emotional trauma, and tickling a baby too much, among others.\n\nThe remedies for stuttering in these circles border on the hilarious, from standing in front of a mirror and speaking to oneself, to eating a fruit pecked by a bird, and maintaining correct posture, to mention a few.\n\nThankfully, science has provided clarity \u2014 for those ready to accept it \u2014 about the causes of stuttering.\n\nAccording to DoSomething.org, stuttering (or stammering, if you will) is a speech disorder that breaks up a speaker\u2019s flow of speech. A biological and neurological condition, it is caused by one or more of four possible triggers, the first being genetics, and the others, child development, the make-up of the brain, and family dynamics.\n\nFor some reason, stuttering is more common in boys than girls. Consequently, it tends to persist into adulthood more often in boys.\n\nOngoing research shows that people who stutter appear to process speech and language differently than those who don\u2019t. And while children with speech problems or developmental delays are more likely to stutter, strokes and traumatic brain injuries can also contribute to stuttering in adults.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to proceed without stating that proponents of traditional African ideologies about stuttering are right about emotional trauma having an impact; however, they\u2019d probably struggle to explain how. But science has shown that families with fast-paced lifestyles, high expectations, and emotional trauma often have stutterers.\n\nBeyond words; into the mind\n\nOther physical senses somewhat compensate for the loss of any sense, and so the blind, for instance, have keener senses of smell and hearing.\n\nPeople who struggle to speak often fill the vocal expression gap with writing, artwork, and other predominantly non-vocal forms of communication. Mostly, however, writing does it.\n\nFun fact: Isaac Newton stuttered throughout his life.\n\nFor Charles, who has stuttered for as long as he can remember, writing as early as seven has been a valuable alternative to sharing his experiences and documenting his thoughts.\n\nSpeaking about misconceptions he\u2019s had to deal with, he said, \u201cGrowing up in a country like Nigeria where people don\u2019t approach stuttering from a scientific point of view, you either get pity from people, or they assume you have anger issues.\u201d\n\nChioma, a recent mass communications graduate, shares Charles\u2019 thoughts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learnt over time that I\u2019m okay; there\u2019s nothing incredibly wrong with me.\u201d\n\nPutting it succinctly, Charles said, \u201cstutterers are simply audibly different from other people, and that shouldn\u2019t be an indictment on capability or anything else for that matter,\u201d and with the right support systems in place from people, workspaces, and other social touchpoints, they can control their stutters, but even more, feel safe to be someone who stutters.\n\n\u201cHaving understanding parents helped me a lot; they shielded me from people who had the worst to say about me. The support of my extended relatives was also a good thing,\u201d he continued.\n\nAnother misconception people have is that stutterers bottle things up and are impatient. So they are often encouraged to speak up.\n\nHolders of the belief that stutterers don\u2019t know what they want to say often complete their sentences for them, suggesting words and phrases that they think express the thoughts in the speakers\u2019 minds. Interestingly, they are not always right, and Charles couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, my parents never completed my sentences; they were always patient enough for me to get my words out. But in my experience as an adult, people try to finish my sentences or, as they think they\u2019re doing, help me out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to do this because you\u2019re more or less saying \u2018I\u2019m helping you because you\u2019re incapable of doing this on your own,\u2019 and that\u2019s not true. All that\u2019s required of listeners is a bit of patience.\u201d\n\nResearch by Leila Cherif and other members of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hedi Chaker Hospital and University of Sfax, Tunisia, shows that \u201cstuttering children (SC) are perceived negatively by peers and are rejected by peers more often than children who do not stutter. SC are often exposed to negative social experiences with both their peers and families such [as] teasing and bullying. These problems interfere negatively with self-esteem (SE) development and anxiety levels.\u201d\n\nConsequently, stutterers\u2019 personalities are shaped by their experiences and interactions with people wherever they go.\n\n\u201cStuttering has shaped my personality; I\u2019m reserved, and I don\u2019t say anything around strangers unless it\u2019s necessary because I don\u2019t like being asked to repeat myself. It\u2019s hard to express my feelings, so, rather than talk, I write down my thoughts,\u201d Chioma submitted.\n\nBeing sensitive to the issues people face is a no-brainer, yes? Unfortunately, it isn\u2019t in some circles.\n\nA very Nigerian challenge is comedians joking about people\u2019s speech difficulties, such that rather than being given room for expression, they become the butt of jokes.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the comedians; the audiences who find these jokes funny are the people with whom stutterers have to interact daily during their commutes, at work, at home, everywhere.\n\nRegardless of what they say, no one likes to be laughed at. So I was not surprised at how emphatically Chioma responded when asked if she would be open to trying out something to help with her stuttering.\n\n\u201cABSOLUTELY, I would like to speak without it looking like I have hot yam in my mouth.\u201d\n\nCharles, however, had different thoughts.\n\n\u201cA philosophy in support circles is do not do anything for anyone that they are capable of doing for themselves, it\u2019s a form of theft of people\u2019s responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAt this point in my life, having a speech defect is an important structure around which my life is built. I won\u2019t exactly say that taking that away is wrong. Stuttering or any disability adds to a person\u2019s humanity in a sense, and I don\u2019t know what kind of world we would have if we cannot feel the way others feel.\n\n\u201cTo take away a disability from someone who has likely lived this way all their lives is to level the playing field for them knowing that they didn\u2019t start the race at the same time. And I think that\u2019s unfair.\n\n\u201cInstead of taking it away with tech or medical intervention, I\u2019d rather create a world where people are kinder to those who function differently from how people typically act.\u201d\n\nInternational Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD), or International Stammering Awareness Day, is a day set aside to raise awareness of the issues faced by millions of people who stutter or stammer. It is celebrated annually on October 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecious Mogoli Website I love love and a little peace and quiet.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Some schools have the direct entry option but with the same level of uncertainty\u2014the ones who can leave the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis cycle thrives because of low spending power, lack of options, and the tendency to acknowledge skill or relevance based on a university degree. This lack of degree options and the scarcity of developers is what TalentQL is looking to solve with AltSchool.\n\nFounded by Adewale Yusuf, Opeyemi Awoyemi, and Akintunde Sultan, TalentQL launched in November 2020 as a talent pipeline to connect developers with jobs.

On Thursday, October 21, 2021, Brass, a Nigerian digital bank, announced $1.7 million in funding to aid their growth across Africa. The raise saw participation from US-based early-stage investors, Hustle Funds, Acuity Ventures, Ventures Platform, and Uncovered Fund.\n\nProminent ecosystem individuals like Flutterwave\u2019s Co-founder, Olugbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, and Paystack\u2019s Co-founder, Ezra Olubi, also participated in this round.\n\nWhat does Brass do? Sola Akindolu, ex-Head of Products at Nigerian fintech, Kudi, and Emmanuel Okeke, ex-Engineering Manager at Paystack, launched Brass in July 2020 to provide SMEs with banking services and help business owners have control over their money operations.\n\nCurrently, the platform provides SMEs with various services, including payroll and expense management, credit and payment services, and API support.\n\nBrass has reportedly served thousands of businesses from schools to restaurants and malls, with a customer portfolio that includes platforms like Mono and Eden.\n\nThey claim to have disbursed $2 million in credit via their crediting platform, Brass Capital, which is still in the Beta phase.\n\nWhere are the funds going? With this raise, the startup is looking to scale and improve upon its products. Already, they have completed incorporation in Kenya and are looking to do the same in South Africa. By 2022, they want to launch in both countries fully.\n\nThe big picture is to develop innovative products that offer all-inclusive banking solutions in Africa.\n\nNeobanks spree? With the number of Business to Customers (B2C), and Business to Business (B2B) neobanks like PayHippo, Prospa, and Sparkle already offering similar services, one wonders what makes Brass different.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, the BBC Insider Series hosted a few players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector during a panel discussion to discuss strides made by the sector to aid innovation and financial inclusion in Africa.\n\nModerated by BBC presenter, Zeinab Badawi, the panel had Olugbenga Agboola, founder and CEO of Flutterwave, Usoro Usoro, CEO, Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services, MTN\u2019s fintech subsidiary, Bola Asiru, Principal/Divisional Lead, sub-Saharan Africa for Mastercard Advisors, and Yasmin Masithela, Managing Executive, Transactional Banking, Absa Corporate and Investment Banking.\n\nThe virtual event focused on fintech\u2019s allure to investors, the benefits Africans derive from fintech start-ups, partnerships between banks and fintech startups, and the role of regulators in the industry.\n\nDiscussing fintech\u2019s attractiveness to investors, the panelists were unanimous in their agreement that the scale of opportunity available to players in the fintech industry was a big factor in why investors are taken in by fintech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Mastercard Foundation, as of 2017, about 43% of people living in sub-Saharan Africa were financially included. This presents a huge opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs willing to look beyond the myriad of challenges that they are sure to face to build solutions.\n\nHowever, for Usoro, beyond the scale, the unserved segment of the market represents a huge opportunity as well. \u201cWhen we look at the market segment, you look at a lot of people that are unserved and when you look at the served segment, they\u2019re still lots of people that have not adopted the services. So it\u2019s both scale and the fact that a lot of people are still unserved that makes the market very attractive.\u201d\n\nWith the speed of innovation and execution exhibited by fintech, arguments have been made regarding fintech\u2019s potential to replace traditional banks. However, Agboola disagreed with that view, arguing that he sees a situation where fintech complement the works that banks do and vice versa, advocating for partnerships between banks and fintech.\n\nEven with the gains recorded, there is still a long way to go for fintech to plug the gaps in financial inclusion in Africa. For this Usoro argued that fintech in addition to providing a huge opportunity for investors also do good in the communities where they operate. \u201cIt\u2019s commercially attractive to investors but it also does some social good.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the kind of services that we offer to customers, whether it\u2019s those micro-loans that enable SMEs to access inventory on daily basis, a lot of these services actually transform the lives of our customers.\u201d He added that with innovations in USSD technology and the adoption of agent banking networks, fintech are able to make it easier for most users to access financial services.\n\nDeepening financial inclusion is high on the agenda of Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank and Y\u2019ello Digital Financial Services has been playing its part in helping the apex realize this goal. With its wide network of over 150,000 MoMo agents, the organization offers financial services to customers.\n\nCustomers can pay bills, deposit and withdraw cash, as well as purchase data and airtime from agents. Through partnerships with over 40 banks and financial institutions in the country, customers can access funds in their accounts without using an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) in a secure manner.\n\nWith 54 countries in Africa, providing financial services to users comes with lots of regulatory hurdles in each country. However, startups need to build services for users regardless. Usoro stated that being able to build solutions that allow for these differences could fix these challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the technology and fintech level, the ability for us to build an interoperable switch to allow multi-currencies, multi-wallets, to speak to each other seamlessly may be one of the things we need to do to fix that hurdle.\u201d\n\nSome may argue that there are too many players in Africa\u2019s fintech sector but with the scale of the problem, there might be a need for more players to throw their hats in the ring to solve some of the problems.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Is Nigeria winning war on terror?",
          "text": "Last week, a colleague whose daughter was posted to Jigawa State, North West geo-political zone of the country, for the mandatory one year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), was apprehensive.\n\nHe wondered how the young lady would make it to Jigawa under the climate of insecurity in Nigeria. He decided to fly her to Kano, and then got the assistance of a friend of his who works with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Kano to arrange for her movement to Jigawa.\n\nAccording to him, when they got to the airport in Lagos, Friday morning, they met a number of other prospective corps members going to the same state.\n\nToday, parents are spending their scarce resources to ensure the safety of their children, unlike many years ago when it used to be fun to travel by road.\n\nIt is unimaginable the trauma many families without resources to fly their children are going through nowadays.\n\nLast Monday, October 18, 2021, two prospective members of the NYSC from Benue State, were reportedly kidnapped by bandits in Zamfara on their way to Kebbi State.\n\nOn a daily basis, Nigerians witness gruesome killings of their fellow citizens; unknown gunmen are on rampage, bandits have taken over some states and Boko Haram has intensified its onslaught, conquering more territories and challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\nThis persisting ugly state of affairs across the country is forcing many to ask, \u201cIs Nigeria winning the terror war?\u201d\n\nIt is worrisome that Nigeria, the supposedly African giant that led others and fought successful ECOMOG wars, has spent over \u20a66 trillion on security without making much headway in the last decade.\n\nWith a $2.07 billion gross military spending in 2015, estimated $1.72 billion defence budget in 2016, about $1.62 billion in 2017, $2.04 billion in 2018, an estimate of $1.8 billion in 2019 and an estimate of $1.2 billion in 2020, the country cannot point to what it has achieved with the allocations as insecurity has taken a deadlier level.\n\nDespite the huge expenditure on defence without result, the Nigerian Air Force took an allocation of N31.97 billion, the largest share of the Ministry of Defence\u2019s total Capital Expenditure Ceiling of N120.04 billion for 2021, the Nigerian Army followed with N27.87 billion, while the Navy got N12.04 billion.\n\nConsidering the scores that are reportedly killed every day, more hostage takings by bandits, open killings by gunmen, more towns taken by Boko Haram and even attack of the army in their barracks, Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, lamented that Nigeria is losing the terror war and has refused to seek for collaborations with foreign partners that have successfully dealt with insecurity in their countries.\n\nRead Also: Insecurity costs Nigeria $40.6bn worth of investments in 1 year\n\n\u201cWhat more evidence do we need to know that Nigeria is losing the war against terrorism when what appear on international news networks about Nigeria are killings and violence? Some of my partners here keep asking what the government is doing and why the relations of those killed are keeping quiet,\u201d he said.\n\nHe observed that it appears there is compromise somewhere and the government and the military cannot execute the war.\n\n\u201cI was in Nigeria when Olusegun Obasanjo, former president, sent soldiers to Odi, Bayelsa State, in Niger Delta and they razed a whole village and nothing happened. If government is serious and engages the military properly, Nigeria will win the war against terrorism,\u201d Onikoyi said.\n\nTalking from experience, Ifewodor Ogala, a retired Navy officer, cleared the air on the fight against terrorism, saying it is not huge budgetary expenditure or heavy weapons that fight wars, but soldiers with the right frame of mind.\n\n\u201cIf you spend our entire national budget on acquiring the best fighter jets, you need to make the boys happy to fly the jets or some unhappy pilots will crash it or even surrender it to the enemies. We have seen that happen in recent times,\u201d Ogala said.\n\nThe retired Niger Delta-born naval officer further explained that the war on terrorism can be with fewer weapons if government plays its part and allows soldiers to play theirs.\n\n\u201cCounter orders have ruined some of the achievements made in the fight against terrorism. We need to be on the same ship, under one captain and move to the same direction in order to win the terror war,\u201d he advised.\n\nWhile also regretting that Nigeria is losing the terror war, Chijioke .J. Umelahi, a former Abia State lawmaker, blame the persisting insecurity on corruption and lack of accountability from those appointed to execute defence budget, especially the military, which seems unquestionable and untouchable.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that having severally allocated huge funds to defence without results, the government should query the Ministry of Defence and the military or even stop the allocations. We as citizens, who die daily in the hands of these terrorists, should wake up, summon our governors, representatives in the National Assembly and demand action. We can protest if possible because the political elites are safe, their families and investments are safe too. We are the one suffering and the ones that need to make the noise,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nThe aggrieved former lawmaker and legal practitioner noted that the anti-graft agency is not beaming its searchlight on defence and military spending, and will not also look for the corrupt politicians who helped to influence the approval of the huge allocations for defence, which seemed to be shared, going by the ineffectiveness of the fight despite the huge budget.\n\n\u201cHow do we know that the huge defence budgets do not end in private pockets, who monitors the military, can\u2019t the public call for probe of the funds because government cannot keep spending tax payers\u2019 money or foreign loans on security that is, obviously, not going to improve with the look of things,\u201d he lamented.\n\nHowever, with the facts and worries expressed by the observers, it is clear that the country is losing the war on terrorism.\n\nBut they think that the Nigerian government knows what to do to curtail insecurity and until it wakes up to its responsibility, shows political will, amid corresponding actions, the country will keep losing the fight at the risk of its sovereignty and existence.\n\n\u201cIt is saddening to recount how our so-called government of this day has continued to sugar coat banditry, and not spill out the situation report how it is meant to be. By this time, these groups should have been declared terrorists and threats to our Nation, but the reverse is the case as we continually see them enjoying that freedom of continued threats to endanger the lives of the masses.\n\n\u201cBy all parameters available, it is glaring that the government is losing the war against insecurity. We live in fear of the unknown every minute. Our travelling routes are no longer safe to ply as the day goes by. The most annoying part is how these bandits are addressed by our security operatives and the Government,\u201d Kayode Kehinde, a Lagos-based political analyst, said.\n\nSome stakeholders have equally carpeted state governors for not doing enough to tackle the situation in their respective states, despite huge budgetary allocation for security vote.\n\nAlthough, the governors have always argued that it is not as huge as being perceived, they have refused to disclose the correct amount to Nigerians, which has only sustained the suspicion.\n\nAmid the blame, the governors have maintained that the security arrangement in the country as enshrined in the Constitution had practically rendered them handicapped and incapable of solving the security challenges in their domain despite being the chief security officers of their states.\n\nExperts say that the country requires a multi-stakeholder approach to deal with the situation; they are of the opinion that not only has the continued spate of insecurity threatened the very fabric of national integration in the country and created the ecology of fear, disquiet and anxiety, it has also meted a deadly blow to industrial development and economy growth.\n\n\u201cIn as much as some of these governors have shown lack of capacity to solve the problems affecting our people, we can also say that there are some hindrances.\n\n\u201cThat is why some of us are calling for restructuring of the country; right now the police commissioners are not answerable to them. I mean, the governors can give them orders and they get a call from Abuja not to obey them. I think this is a step backward in the security fight,\u201d Femi Akinwunmi, public affairs analyst, said.\n\nKehinde further stated that the worsening insecurity and government\u2019s helplessness was an indication that Nigeria was a failed state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cA failed state is not difficult to define \u2013 it is one that is unable to provide security to its people, and this is what we are currently experiencing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe train system which was receiving some worth appraisal has now become the target of bandits, meaning no safer means of moving within Nigeria if not by air. And what happens when you cannot afford to fly or your destination has to be ply by road?\n\n\u201cThe way out right now from this turbulence is for the government to take up its responsibilities taking out tribalism or any form of ethnic bias. Let us call a spade a spade.\n\n\u201cDeclare bandits and kidnappers as terrorists tighten all security processes and call for a state of emergency on all prone routes to terrorist/banditry/kidnappers attacks.\u201d\n\nChekwas Okorie, a founding member of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), said the security situation in the North-East had degenerated into war, adding that the government should consider and give priority to community and state policing urgently.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe security situation now comes in two different categories, what we have in North East is outright war. They should treat it as such. There should be more deployment of troops. There is a war situation in the North; you can see the attack of trains in Kaduna State last week. Ordinarily, you would have expected that the ground troop should be moved in and clear the terrorists out.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we consider state and community policing as a matter of national emergence. People don\u2019t have confidence in the police, most state actors have taken the police, and the ordinary man pays for their service when they need them.\n\n\u201cThe government should act; the security vote is enough to keep our environment safe, especially with the kind of money they collect.\u201d\n\nLast Thursday, Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, called on the Federal Government to declare bandits as terrorists to allow the Nigerian military deal with them according to international law.\n\nThe governor said that between July and September, bandits killed over 343 persons in the state, while 830 others were kidnapped.\n\n\u201cWe have written letters to the Federal Government since 2017, asking for this declaration because it is the declaration that will allow the Nigerian military to attack and kill these bandits without any major consequences in international law.\n\n\u201cSo, we support the resolution by the National Assembly and we are going to follow up with a letter of support, for the Federal Government to declare these bandits and insurgents as terrorists, so that they will be fair game for our military.\n\n\u201cThis is the view of the Kaduna State Government,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai\u2019s outcry came three days after President Muhammadu Buhari had said that insecurity in the country was trending downwards, emphasising that narrative of rising insecurity is inaccurate.\n\nAccording to the President, \u201cWhile there is work to do, the men and women in uniform who are helping the nation to achieve this goal, desire our collective appreciation and encouragement to do even more.\n\n\u201cThe whole country and its mass communications systems have a duty in this regard.\u201d\n\nWhile Buhari said in his message to Moslem at Id El Maulud that insecurity in the country was receding, report emerged that a woman in Nimbo, Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area of Enugu State, was butchered by AK-47 wielding herdsmen in her farm.\n\nThe report said the woman was in the farm together with her daughter when the herdsmen swooped on them. While the daughter escaped unhurt, the woman was short at as she tried to run.\n\nThe assailant reportedly used their machete and chopped off her two hands. They did not stop at that, they smashed her head with a hard object.\n\nTo those in that community, and particularly to the daughter that witnessed the horror, they would not buy into any narrative that insecurity is receding.\n\nReports also have it that bandits attacked GUO Luxury Bus in Edo and kidnapped many passengers.\n\nThe Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal a few days ago, lamented the upscaling insecurity in his state. The media was awash recently that bandits attacked some villages in the state, killing over 30 people in a single swoop.\n\nWednesday, the Nigerian Railways Corporation (NRC) said explosion occurred on its passenger train on Abuja-Kaduna line. Passengers escaped by a whisker.\n\nA Lagos-based businessman, who spoke with BusinessDay SUNDAY, lamented what he described as an \u201cugly development.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cYou know, some of us are now patronising the train services, on that axis, since the roads became death traps on account of bandits\u2019 activities. That these terrorists are now targeting the train is a dangerous development. I hope all the security architecture would be activated to ensure this is nipped in the bud.\u201d",

          "text": "There is a wave of excitement around three Nigerian startups that have hit a $1 billion valuation this year. They have become unicorns.\n\nIn business, a unicorn is a privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion. The term was first popularised in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, choosing the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures.\n\nThese $1 billion companies, typically referred to as Unicorns include Flutterwave, Opay and Andela in fintech.\n\nThese tech startups have attracted massive funding from investors including angel, seed, as well as, early-stage and later-stage venture capitalists across the globe in the recent past.\n\nOpay\n\nOPay is a company that enables users to accomplish more with their money by providing smart financial services. It is a one-stop mobile-based platform for payment, transportation, food and grocery delivery, and other important services in everyday life.\n\nFounded by Yahui Zhou in June 2018, the startup has raised $570 million in funding over 3 rounds, with SoftBank Vision Fund as its lead investor and three others. In total, OPay is funded by 14 investors.\n\nRead also: Meet five investors behind 2021 biggest funding in Nigerian startups\n\nA $50 million series A round of funding was completed in July 2019 with investments from IDG Capital, Sequoia Capital China, and Source Code Capital as lead investors.\n\nIn November 2019, the company raised $120 million in the Series B round, from the series A investors including Redpoint Ventures China and Bertelsmann Asia Investments.\n\nOPay attained the Unicorn status in August 2021 with a $400 million investment in a Series C round, from seven Chinese-based venture investors which include SoftBank Vision Fund as the lead, Softbank Ventures Asia, 3W Capital, Source Code Capital, Redpoint Ventures China, Longzhu Capital and Sequoia Capital China.\n\nFollowing this achievement, OPay has become the first Africa-focused company with a $2 billion valuation. The word OPay is a combination of the prefixes of two entities Opera and Paycom.\n\nAndela\n\nAndela, a Nigerian startup that connects African software engineering talent to global companies, has become the country\u2019s newest startup to attain unicorn status, in September after raising $200 million from investors.\n\nThe company was founded by Jeremy Johnson, Christina Sass, Ian Carnevale, Nadayar Enegesi, Brice Nkengsa, and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji in May 2014, has raised a total of $381 million in funding over 10 rounds and is funded by five lead and 40 participating investors.\n\nIn September 2014, 16 investors participated in the $3 million raised in the seed and angel rounds. This led to its first funding in series A round in to close $14 million led by Spark Capital, and $24 million in series B round led by Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Omidyar Network, Learn Capital, GSV Ventures in June 2015 and 2016 respectively.\n\nThe company completed a $40 million funding in series C round in October 2017 led by CRE Venture Capital. Generation Investment Management led the $100 million funding in a Series D round that was raised in January 2019 by 12 other investors who participated.\n\nFive out of these investors led the startup to be a Unicorn in September after a series E round funding. They include Spark Capital, SoftBank Vision Fund, Generation Investment Management, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Whale Rock Capital Management.\n\nFlutterwave\n\nFlutterwave provides technology, infrastructure, and services to enable global merchants, payment service providers, and helps banks and businesses build secure and seamless payment solutions for their customers by smoothening the exchange of funds.\n\nThe company has raised a total of $234.7million in funding over 13 rounds, with a total number of seven lead investors and 43 others so far.\n\nFounded by Olugbenga GB Agboola and Iyinoluwa Aboyeji in 2016, the company completed its four seed funding rounds in August 2016 from investors which include Y Combinator, 4DX Ventures, HOF Capital, Green Visor Capital, among others.\n\nIn April 2017, it raised $250,000 funding in series A round from one investor- LoftyInc Capital Management and proceeded to close $10 million in its final series A round in October 2018 from six investors.\n\nFollowing an announcement in January 2020, a Series B round of $35 million in funding was raised in August of the same year. This was led by two investors which include Headline and Greycroft, with participation from 10 others.\n\nIn March 2021, Flutterwave raised a $170 million Series C funding round. The investors who led this funding are Avenir Growth Capital, Tiger Global Management.\n\nAt the time, this was the largest amount ever secured by an African tech startup and gave it a valuation of over $1 billion, making the company a Unicorn.",

He likened it to the arrest three decades ago of the notorious Colombian drug kingpin, Pablo Escobar.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest blow against drug trafficking in our country this century,\u201d he said. \u201cThis hit is only comparable to the fall of Pablo Escobar in the 1990s.\u201d\n\nOne police officer died during the operation, the president said.\n\nMr Duque, quoted by AFP news agency, described the operation as \u201cthe biggest penetration of the jungle ever seen in the military history of our country.\u201d\n\nHe added that Mr Otoniel\u2019s arrest \u201cmarks the end of the Gulf Clan,\u201d but Al Jazeera analysts worry the move could result in more violence at a time of worsening clashes between armed groups.\n\nHow was he caught?\n\nThe drug lord was captured in his rural hideout in Antioquia province in north-western Colombia, close to the border with Panama.\n\nBBC reports the operation involved 500 soldiers supported by 22 helicopters.\n\nMr Otoniel, 50, had used a network of rural safe houses to move around and evade the authorities, and did not use a phone; instead, relying on couriers for communication, the BBC said.\n\n\u201cBut his location at the time of his capture was pinpointed two weeks ago,\u201d it added by quoting El Tiempo newspaper.\n\nColombia police chief Jorge Vargas said his movements were traced by more than 50 signal intelligence experts using satellite imagery. \u201cThe U.S. and UK agencies were involved in the search.\u201d\n\nThere have been several huge operations involving thousands of officers to capture the 50-year-old in recent years, but until now none has been successful.\n\nThe notorious drug kingpin became the head of the Gulf Clan, previously known as the Usuga Clan, after its previous leader \u2013 his brother \u2013 was killed by police in a raid on a New Year\u2019s Eve party in 2012.\n\nSince then, Colombia\u2019s security forces labelled the gang as the country\u2019s most powerful criminal organisation, while authorities in the U.S. describe it as \u201cheavily armed [and] extremely violent.\u201d\n\nThe gang, BBC said, operates in many provinces and has extensive international connections. It is engaged in drug and people smuggling, illegal gold mining and extortion.\n\n\u201cIt is believed to have about 1,800 armed members, who are mainly recruited from far-right paramilitary groups. Members have been arrested in Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Peru and Spain.\n\n\u201cThe gang controls many of the routes used to smuggle drugs from Colombia to the US, and as far away as Russia.\u201d\n\nThe Colombian government, however, believes it has decimated its numbers in recent years, forcing many leading members to hide in remote regions in the jungle.\n\nMr Otoniel now faces a number of charges, including sending shipments of cocaine to the U.S., killing police officers and recruiting children.",

Undoubtedly, it has been a long journey but our loving God in His infinite mercy and grace took me by the hand and led me thus far in my academic pursuit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMy transition from the hallowed Senate Chamber to sitting in the same classroom with young effervescent youths that happen to fall within the same age bracket with my daughter was a very challenging and startling journey.\n\n\u201cWhen I decided to study Law, I was prepared to learn, explore and challenge myself to leave my comfort zone and live a new reality. Today, I am proud to say that I made the right decision as these past years as a student have seen me learn more within and beyond the confines of the classroom.\n\n\u201cEvery little encounter and experience gained so far in this great citadel of learning has been enriching and will remain within my memories for life. My sojourn in Baze University ultimately reinforces the belief that we are never too old to learn; never too powerful to learn and never too full of learning.\n\n\u201cMy learning experience has truly been a fascinating and unforgettable one and I have so many people to thank for that. At this juncture, I would like to congratulate my fellow graduands including Chief Osita Chidoka, Dr. Adaora Umeoji, Senator Dino Melaye and others for successfully obtaining their degrees. Thank you all for sharing in this amazing journey with me, I sincerely wish you all the very best in your future endeavours.\n\n\u201cI want to wholeheartedly thank my lovely wife and kids for their unwavering love, belief and support; thank you for believing in me even when I had doubts. To my friends, well wishers and supporters, I thank you all for your encouragement.\n\n\u201cYesterday might have been my last day as a Law undergraduate; however, I believe that a greater phase of learning has only started from this point.

Undoubtedly, it has been a long journey but our loving God in His infinite mercy and grace took me by the hand and led me thus far in my academic pursuit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMy transition from the hallowed Senate Chamber to sitting in the same classroom with young effervescent youths that happen to fall within the same age bracket with my daughter was a very challenging and startling journey.\n\n\u201cWhen I decided to study Law, I was prepared to learn, explore and challenge myself to leave my comfort zone and live a new reality. Today, I am proud to say that I made the right decision as these past years as a student have seen me learn more within and beyond the confines of the classroom.\n\n\u201cEvery little encounter and experience gained so far in this great citadel of learning has been enriching and will remain within my memories for life. My sojourn in Baze University ultimately reinforces the belief that we are never too old to learn; never too powerful to learn and never too full of learning.\n\n\u201cMy learning experience has truly been a fascinating and unforgettable one and I have so many people to thank for that. At this juncture, I would like to congratulate my fellow graduands including Chief Osita Chidoka, Dr. Adaora Umeoji, Senator Dino Melaye and others for successfully obtaining their degrees. Thank you all for sharing in this amazing journey with me, I sincerely wish you all the very best in your future endeavours.\n\n\u201cI want to wholeheartedly thank my lovely wife and kids for their unwavering love, belief and support; thank you for believing in me even when I had doubts. To my friends, well wishers and supporters, I thank you all for your encouragement.\n\n\u201cYesterday might have been my last day as a Law undergraduate; however, I believe that a greater phase of learning has only started from this point. May God continually bless and crown our endeavours with wisdom, success and divine insight.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has reportedly paid the sum of N13.5billion as wharfage charges for a floating dock, which it bought for N50 billion three years ago.\n\nWharfage is the fee charged to cover the cost of using a wharf. It includes the cost of nocking unto the dock electricity and maintenance service since a ship cannot be locked up and abandoned like a car.\n\nDaily Trust on Sunday said it gathered from a senior management source at the agency that NIMASA paid around $30,000 daily as wharfage charges and other expenses which amounts to $32.9million in three years.\n\nThe newspaper said the floating dock has remained idle since it arrived in the country on June 11, 2018 at the Nigerian Navy Dockyard, Lagos.\n\nA former executive director of operations at NIMASA Rotimi Fashakin had explained that insecurity in the Niger Delta region made it difficult for the agency to berth the dock at Okerenkoko as originally conceptualised.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, the floating dock was supposed to go to Okerenkoko in Delta State, but with the conditions that exist now, it is almost impossible. A dock is supposed to serve the shipping community as a commercial facility, but which company or vessel would be bold enough to travel to Delta State?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other thing was getting a place to berth it. If you know the complexity of a floating dock, the draft you need to keep and operate it is 12 meters. The contractor was spending over $30,000 keeping the dock afloat for many months, and we had to pay many months demurrage on that. Eventually, we reached a situation where we had an agreement with Naval Holdings Limited, a sub-sect of the Nigerian Navy, to keep the dock,\u201d he added.\n\nNIMASA had acquired the modular floating dockyard to save the Federal Government over $100m annually and about $1 billion in 10 years from the huge cost of dry-docking outside Nigeria. But that has not materialised.\n\nReacting to this, chairman, board of trustees, Nigerian Ship Owners Association (NISA) Isaac Jolapamo said those behind the purchase of the modular floating dock should be prosecuted.\n\n\u201cIf the NIMASA had procured the floating dock the way it was scheduled from the beginning, there won\u2019t be this confusion. This is the outright misappropriation of public funds. You cannot develop the shipping sector on a political platform. There is no wisdom in the decision to own a dock. The government is losing money.

No. OTP-CR-363/21, Khan told SERAP that the criteria for a probe into a string of abductions have been met.\n\nThe letter signed on the prosecutor\u2019s behalf by Mark P. Dillon, Head of Information and Evidence Unit, noted that the preliminary examination of the petition is considered complete.\n\nIt said under Article 53 of the Rome Statute, the next step in the judicial process \u201cis to prepare and submit a request to the Pre-Trial Chamber for authorisation to open an investigation on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOnce submitted, the request will be made publicly available on the Court\u2019s website: www.icccpi.int.\n\n\u201cYour communication will be forwarded to the relevant team to be analysed, together with other related communications and other available information, in the context of any future investigations.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, SERAP hailed the ICC prosecutor for taking a significant step toward ensuring that persons responsible for the atrocities against schoolchildren are exposed.\n\nThe body said impartial justice and reparation will deal a decisive blow to impunity of perpetrators, and improve access of Nigerian children to education.\n\n\u201cThe victims of these crimes deserve justice. SERAP will work closely with the ICC to achieve these important objectives\u201d, deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare assured.\n\nLast week, 27 students and 3 teachers abducted from the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri in Kebbi, regained freedom.\n\nThe former hostages were in captivity for four months; others are still being held as negotiations for their release continue.\n\nGovernor Atiku Bagudu told the victims to consider their kidnap as a trial from God.\n\n\u201cEven Prophets of Allah, who are the best and most faithful people, had been tested and tried.\n\n\u201cOne thing is certain: if you are tested and tried and you become patient, the sky is your limit and only Allah knows your reward\u201d, Bagudu said.",

          "text": "The November 6 governorship election in Anambra State now faces challenges as the Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB), has threatened a week-long stay-at-home order if their leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was not released unconditionally. According to IPOB\u2019s Spokesman, Emma Powerful, the body called for unconditional release of Kanu on November 4, otherwise they would order a stay-at-home strike in the South-East from November 5, ahead of the Anambra election scheduled for the next day.\n\nIn a press statement signed by Powerful, the group said, \u201cfollowing the adjournment of the case of our great leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, to November 10, 2021, by the Federal High Court Abuja, we, the great movement and family of the IPOB, wish to inform Biafrans, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom that IPOB will lock down Biafra land from November 5 to 10, except Sunday, November 7, a day our people worship the Almighty God, Chukwu Okike Abiama, if the Nigerian government fails to release our leader unconditionally before November 4, 2021. \u201cOur leader, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu must be released unconditionally on or before November 4, 2021 because he has not committed any offence known to any law.\n\nFailure to release our leader, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu on or before November 4, 2021, our one-week sit-at-home strike begins on November 5, 2021 till November 10,\u201d the statement said. The group said that although it quite understood the pains and adverse effects of this option on the South- East people, it was compelled to take it to achieve a better purpose in the collective interest of Biafrans.\n\n\u201cWe have taken time to analyse what transpired on October 21 when our Leader was arraigned in court and discovered that the Federal Government is not sincere and only wants to humiliate him and keep him perpetually in DSS custody to rot there.\n\n\u201cWe all saw how lawyers, journalists, Igbo delegates and respected traditional rulers and other people who came from all around the world to witness his court case were restricted and denied access into the court premises by security agents who kept them outside under the scorching heat of the sun. What a humiliation and wickedness? \u201cWe cannot accept that anymore. We can never allow our leader, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, to be tried secretly and we can never also allow him to be tried under Sharia law under any guise.\n\nNigeria must follow international laws in handling our leader. \u201cMazi Nnamdi Kanu is in the DSS dungeon today because of his passion for Biafra independence, and we must sacrifice all we can to ensure that he regains his freedom. He has sacrificed so much for us all. So, we must be prepared to sacrifice little for him,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt further warned that unless the Federal Government released him unconditionally before November 4, the group shall sacrifice one week for him as a warning protest to convey to \u201cour oppressors that Nnamdi Kanu represents over 70 million Biafrans. He is innocent of all the charges preferred against him. As long as he is in detention, our individual businesses do not matter so much because he is suffering for us all and we can\u2019t abandon him.\u201d The group expressed, \u201cseriously regret over the inconveniences this may cause their people but described the action as \u201ca necessary sacrifice\u201d it needs to make until they have their full independence, warning that nobody resident in Biafra land is expected to flout this directive as doing so amounts to challenging the will of the people on the Biafra project.\n\n\u201cThis one week sit-athome strike is also to let our oppressors understand that we are not going to tolerate any plan to torment or abandon our leader in DSS custody through frivolous court adjournments. Any plans to subject him to trauma in detention through long adjournments while real terrorists and mass murderers are having fun across the country cannot fly.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu must be freed because he committed no crime. Asking for referendum so that Biafrans will decide whether or not they want to continue as part of Nigeria is no crime! He should not suffer for seeking justice for his people.\n\n\u201cWe have been enslaved and caged enough by the Fulani controlled Federal Government of Nigeria and its allies. If we shut down Biafra land just for one week to secure our permanent freedom, it is worth the sacrifice. Everybody should brace up for this sacrifice. This is the time all Biafrans must remain united. Let\u2019s not give the oppressors and their agents any room to create division in our mist,\u201d the statement said.",

          "text": "The proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has threatened to shutdown the entire South East part of the country as from November 4 should federal government fails to release its leader Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe threat by IPOB if it goes through will disrupt governorship election in Anambra state scheduled for November 6, 2021.\n\nThe ultimatum was given in a statement by Media and Publicity Secretary for IPOB, Emma Powerful, following the adjournment of Kanu\u2019s court case to November 10 by the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nThe move, according to him, is to achieve a better purpose in the collective interest of Biafrans.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cFollowing the adjournment of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s court case to 10th of November 2021, by the Federal High Court Abuja, we the great movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), wish to inform Biafrans, friends of Biafra and lovers of freedom that IPOB will lock down Biafra land from 5th of November to 10th of November except Sunday, November 7th, a day our people worship the Almighty God, Chukwu Okike Abiama, if the Nigeria Government fails to release our leader unconditionally before 4th of November 2021.\n\n\u201cOur leader, onyendu Mazi Nnamdi MUST be released UNCONDITIONALLY on or before November 4, 2021 because he has not committed any offense known to any law.\n\n\u201cFailure to release our leader onyendu Mazi Nnamdi KANU on or before November 4, 2021, our one week Sit-At-Home begins on November 5, 2021 till November 10.\n\n\u201cAlthough we quite understand the pains and adverse effects of this option on our people, we are compelled to take it to achieve a better purpose in the collective interest of Biafrans. We have taken time to analyse what transpired on October 21 when our Leader was arraigned in court and discovered that the federal government is not sincere and only wants to humiliate him and keep him perpetually in DSS custody to rot there.\n\n\u201cWe all saw how lawyers, journalists, Igbo delegates and respected traditional rulers and other people who came from all around the world to witness his court case were restricted and denied access into the court premises by security agents who kept them outside under the scorching heat of the sun. What a humiliation and wickedness!\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept that anymore. We can never allow our leader onyendu Mazi Nnamdi KANU to be tried SECRETLY and we can never also allow him to be tried under SHARIA law under any guise. NIGERIA must follow International laws in handling our leader.\n\n\u201cMazi Nnamdi KANU is in DSS dungeon today because of his passion for Biafra independence, and we must sacrifice all we can to ensure that he regains his freedom. He has sacrificed so much for us all, so we must be prepared to sacrifice little for him.\n\n\u201cUnless the federal government releases him unconditionally before November 4, we shall sacrifice one week for him as a warning protest to convey to our oppressors that Nnamdi Kanu represents over 70 million Biafrans. He is innocent of all the charges preferred against him. As long as he is in detention our individual businesses do not matter so much because he is suffering for us all and we can\u2019t abandon him.\n\n\u201cWe seriously regret the inconveniences this may cause our people but it\u2019s a necessary sacrifice we need to make until we have our full independence. Nobody resident in Biafra land is expected to flout this directive as doing so amounts to challenging the will of the people on the Biafra project.\n\n\u201cThis one week sit-at-home is also to let our oppressors understand that we are not going to tolerate any plan to torment or abandon our leader in DSS custody through frivolous court adjournments. Any plans to subject him to trauma in detention through long adjournments while real terrorists and mass murderers are having fun across the country cannot fly. Nnamdi Kanu must be freed because he committed no crime. Asking for referendum so that Biafrans will decide whether or not they want to continue as part of Nigeria is no crime. He should not suffer for seeking justice for his people.\n\n\u201cWe have been enslaved and caged enough by the Fulani controlled federal government of Nigeria and its allies. If we shut down Biafra land just for one week to secure our permanent freedom, it is worth the sacrifice. Everybody should brace up for this sacrifice.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had ordered security agencies to quash any move that would be triggered to disrupt governorship election in Anambra state.",

Abas Tajudeen, the Director-General of the agency, Dr. Omale Joseph explained that not less than 15 percent of every 1,000 women die due to blood loss during childbirth and urged Nigerians to imbibe the practice of donating blood.\n\n\u201cAs you donate blood, you\u2019re saving a life, and not only that, research has shown that people who donate blood regularly live more healthy\u201d, he submitted.\n\nAccording to the DG, the Commission was putting the mechanism in place to check sharp practices by hospitals in the use of blood for patients, adding that through its One Million Safe Blood Initiative, it was expected that safe blood will be accessible for Nigerians in the six geopolitical zones of the country at any point in time.\n\nSpeaking further, he said the Commission which had the three core mandates of \u201cregulation, coordination and ensuring the provision of safe blood to the people\u201d, gave the assurance that plans were already in top gear to ensure that wastage of stored blood is halted through the use of expired blood for the production of usable components, noting that safe blood had a viable lifespan of between 30 and 35 days.\n\nFielding question on how Nigerians could be encouraged to have their blood groups handy to help in cases of emergency, the DG disclosed that for a start, the Commission was already collaborating with the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) , to ensure that drivers\u2019 licenses are issued with the holder\u2019s blood IDs.\n\nEarlier Hon. Tajudeen had described President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s assent to the Bill as \u201ca very important milestone achieved in the health sector\u201d, as according to him, blood transfusion before now had been largely unregulated, with a lot of sharp practices involved.\n\nThe lawmaker said available statistics have shown that over 40 percent of voluntarily donated blood was unsafe for use, with the majority of donors doing so for monetary gains, adding that in some cases, recipients ended up being infected with diseases, but that with the Commission in place, a lot of such issues will be addressed.\n\nIt would be recalled the Commission\u2019s establishment Bill, which was introduced by Hon. Abas Tajudeen in the House of Representatives was passed in March 2021, got Senate\u2019s concurrence in June, and was subsequently signed into law by President Buhari.",

          "title": "ICC Prosecutor Seeks Investigation Into Abduction Of Nigerian Schoolchildren",
          "text": "The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is set to seek authorisation from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the court to open an investigation into cases of abduction of schoolchildren in several parts of Northern Nigeria.\n\nAlso to be investigated are the closure of schools, and the \u201cpersistent failure of Nigerian authorities\u201d at both the federal and state levels to end the abduction.\n\nThis is according to a statement on Sunday by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP).\n\nAccording to the agency\u2019s Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the ICC prosecutor\u2019s decision followed a petition sent to the court by SERAP.\n\nSERAP had in the petition dated 4 September 2021 urged the ICC prosecutor, Mr Karim A. A. Khan, QC, to \u201cpush for those suspected to be responsible and complicit in the commission of these serious crimes, to be invited and tried by the ICC.\u201d\n\nIn the petition, SERAP argued that, \u201cThe severe and lifelong harms that result from depriving children the right to education satisfy the gravity of harm threshold under the Rome Statute.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Low Passenger Turnout As Train Services Resume On Kaduna-Abuja Route\n\nResponding, the ICC prosecutor in a letter with reference number OTP-CR-363/21, and dated 22 October 2021 confirmed to SERAP that \u201cthe criteria for opening an investigation into a string of abductions and closure of schools in some parts of Nigeria have been met.\u201d\n\nThe letter signed on the prosecutor\u2019s behalf by Mark P. Dillon, Head of the Information and Evidence Unit, read in part: \u201cOn behalf of the Prosecutor, I thank you for your communication received on 13/09/2021, as well as any subsequent related information.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe preliminary examination of the petition is considered complete. Under Article 53 of the Rome Statute, the next step in the judicial process is for the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to prepare and submit a request to the Pre-Trial Chamber for authorisation to open an investigation on Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce submitted, the request will be made publicly available on the Court\u2019s website: www.icccpi.int.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour communication will be forwarded to the relevant team to be analysed, together with other related communications and other available information, in the context of any future investigations. We thank you for your interest in the ICC.\u201d\n\nSERAP deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare said: \u201cBy this decision, the ICC prosecutor has taken a significant step toward ensuring that those suspected to be responsible for grave crimes against Nigerian schoolchildren are exposed, and held to account.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victims of these crimes deserve justice. Impartial justice and reparation will deal a decisive blow to impunity of perpetrators, and improve access of Nigerian children to education. SERAP will work closely with the ICC to achieve these important objectives.\u201d\n\nSERAP\u2019s petition to the ICC prosecutor, read in part: \u201cSenior government officials know well or ought to know that their failure to prevent these crimes will violate the children\u2019s human rights and dignity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe absence of any tangible and relevant investigation or prosecution in Nigeria suggests that the authorities are unwilling or unable to carry out genuine investigation or prosecution of those suspected to be responsible for and complicit in the abduction of students.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequences of persistent abductions of students, closure of schools, and the failure to provide safe and enabling learning environments despite federal and state authorities yearly budgeting some N241.2 billion of public funds as \u201csecurity votes\u201d, are similar to those of the offences in article 7(1).\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than 10,000 schools have been reportedly closed in at least seven northern states over the fear of attack and abduction of pupils and members of staff. The states are Sokoto, Zamfara, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Niger and Yobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong the string of abductions in Zamfara was the abduction of over 200 schoolgirls in the town of Jangebe in February. The latest abduction comes after widespread reports of abduction of students and closure of schools in many states of Nigeria, including in north-central Niger State where some 91 schoolchildren were abducted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn estimated 1.3 million Nigerian children have been affected by frequent raids on schools by suspected terrorists. Some 13 million Nigerian children are out of school nationwide. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), more than 1,000 students have been abducted from schools in northern Nigeria since December 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cFamilies and parents have reportedly resulted to paying the terrorists thousands of dollars as ransom to secure the release of their children. An estimated $18.34 million was reportedly paid in ransoms between June 2011 and the end of March 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian authorities have also failed and/or neglected to satisfactorily address the abduction of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in 2014, which prompted the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. According to reports, more than 100 of those girls are still missing.\u201d\n\nNigeria is a state party to the Rome Statute and deposited its instrument of ratification on 27 September 2001, thus giving the court jurisdiction over crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed on its territory or by its nationals.\n\nThe ICC prosecutor decided to seek an investigation after undertaking a preliminary examination of the cases of abduction of children in the country.\n\nA three-member panel of ICC pre-trial judges will consider whether to grant the prosecutor\u2019s request, once it is submitted, to let the ICC step in as a court of last resort.\n\nJudges will rely on the materials submitted by the prosecution to determine whether there is a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to proceed. Victims and their families may also make their views known to the pre-trial chamber.\n\nIf the investigation identifies suspected perpetrators of the crimes alleged in SERAP\u2019s petition, prosecutors can ask judges to issue international arrest warrants, which can remain under seal to help authorities apprehend those charged.\n\nAs an international court of last resort, the ICC is mandated to bring to justice people suspected to be responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.",

          "text": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan moved to expel the ambassadors of 10 Western countries who appealed for the release of a jailed civil society leader.\n\nSeven of the ambassadors represent Turkey\u2019s NATO allies and the expulsions, if carried out, would open the deepest rift with the West in Erdogan\u2019s 19 years in power.\n\n\u201cI have ordered our foreign minister to declare these 10 ambassadors as persona non grata as soon as possible,\u201d Erdogan said on Saturday, referring to a term used in diplomacy that signifies the first step before expulsion. He did not set a firm date.\n\nPhilanthropist Osman Kavala has been in prison since late 2017, charged with financing nationwide protests in 2013 and with involvement in a 2016 failed coup. He denies the charges.\n\n\u201cThey must know and understand Turkey,\u201d Erdogan added, accusing the envoys of \u201cindecency\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey must leave here the day they no longer know Turkey,\u201d Erdogan said.\n\nThe envoys had issued a highly unusual joint statement on Monday saying the continued detention of Parisian-born activist Osman Kavala \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over Turkey.\n\nThe US, Germany, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden called for a \u201cjust and speedy resolution to [Kavala\u2019s] case\u201d.\n\nKavala has become a symbol of the sweeping crackdown Erdogan unleashed after surviving the coup attempt.\n\nSpeaking to the AFP news agency from his jail cell last week, Kavala said he felt like a tool in Erdogan\u2019s attempts to blame a foreign plot for domestic opposition to his nearly two-decade rule.\n\nKavala said on Friday he would no longer attend his trial as a fair hearing was impossible after recent comments by Erdogan.\n\nThe Council of Europe, the continent\u2019s top human rights watchdog, issued a final warning to Turkey to comply with a 2019 European Court of Human Rights order to release Kavala pending trial.\n\nIf Turkey fails to do so by its next meeting from November 30 \u2013 December 2, the Strasbourg-based council could vote to launch its first disciplinary proceedings against Ankara.\n\nEuropean Parliament President David Sassoli tweeted: \u201cThe expulsion of 10 ambassadors is a sign of the authoritarian drift of the Turkish government. We will not be intimidated.

Other sections of the facilities were left untouched.\u201d\n\nHe assured members of the public to go about their normal businesses as the situation is under control.\n\nThe minister also urged them to report any suspicious movement or any sign of the escaped inmates and the gunmen to the nearest security post around them.\n\nProviding details of the attack yesterday, the Nigeria Correctional Service, Oyo State Command, said 837 awaiting trial inmates escaped from the correctional centre when suspected gunmen attacked the facility.\n\nIn its statement, the command said all the 837 awaiting trial inmates were freed by the attackers, pointing out that the cell housing the convicts and the inmates were not vandalised.\n\nHe said 262 escaped inmates \u201chave been recaptured, while 575 were still at large. The invaders arrived the centre heavily armed with sophisticated weapons and after a fierce encounter with the officers on guard, they gained entrance into the yard, using dynamite to blast the wall.\n\n\u201cAll the awaiting trial detainees were forced out of custody, the cells housing the convicts and the female inmates were not vandalised. Meanwhile, a total of 262 of the escapees have been recaptured leaving 575 still at large.\n\n\u201cFollowing the directives of the Controller-General of Corrections, Haliru Nababa, the State Controller, Noel Ailewon, has commenced the process of search and recapture after visiting the scene of the incident,\u201d Anjorin said.\n\nHe said the state controller had promised the public that no effort \u201cwill be spared to recapture the fleeing inmates.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari will on Monday formally launch the Nigerian Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), known as the eNaira at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe unveiling of the much-anticipated electronic money had been delayed partly to allow for the country\u2019s 61st independence celebration, according to the CBN.\n\nA statement from CBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications, Nwanisobi, noted that the launch of the eNaira is a culmination of several years of research work by the central bank in advancing the boundaries of the payments system to make financial transactions easier and seamless for every strata of the society.\n\nThe apex bank had designed the digital currency, following a series of engagements with relevant stakeholders including the banking community, fintech operators, merchants, and indeed, a cross-section of Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the bank, the eNaira marks a major step forward in the evolution of money as well as the CBN\u2019s commitment to ensuring that the digital currency, like the physical Naira, is accessible by everyone.\n\nNwanisobi, stated that given that the eNaira is a journey, the unveiling marks the first step in that journey, which will continue with a series of further modifications, capabilities, and enhancements to the platforms.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN will continue to work with relevant partners to ensure a seamless process that will benefit every user, particularly those in the rural areas and the unbanked population.\n\n\u201cSince the eNaira is a new product, and amongst the first CBDCs in the world, we have put a structure to promptly address any issue that might arise from the pilot implementation of the eNaira.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, following Monday\u2019s formal launch by the president, the bank will further engage various stakeholders as we enter a new age consistent with global financial advancement.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the theme of the eNaira is: \u201cSame Naira, more possibilities\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the CBDC is expected to improve monetary policy effectiveness and enhance the government\u2019s capacity to deploy targeted social interventions, and boost remittances through formal channels.\n\nThe bank explained that eNaira wallet is required to access, use and hold eNaira.\n\nThe CBN also tasked the deposit money banks (DMBs) to facilitate prompt placement of restrictions on eNaira wallets in the event of a valid report of loss, theft of device or compromise, a hack of a user eNaira wallet.\n\nAccording to the Regulatory Guidelines on the eNaira, obtained by THISDAY, the apex bank, further directed banks to ensure that customers can report via USSD channels, internet banking platforms, customer care phone lines, and in-branch customer care where there is any compromise in the eNaira transactions.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had said that in unveiling the digital money, the bank does not downplay potential risks, adding however that the apex financial regulatory body had put in place appropriate mitigation mechanisms for safer operation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are not going to pretend that there are no risks in opening your system up. We will look at the various products, determine the risks, determine the best way to mitigate the risks before opening it up.\n\n\u201cBut it is a journey that we are determined and decided that we will start on October 2021.\u201d\n\nThe planned unveiling of the much-awaited Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), known as the eNaira, originally slated for October 1, 2021, was put on hold due to other key activities lined up to commemorate the country\u2019s 61st independence anniversary.\n\nHowever, the CBN, in the framework for the operation of the eNaira further set the transaction and balance limits for individual and merchant eNaira wallets.\n\nIn the Tier 0 category or phone number without verified National Identity Number (NIN), the daily transaction is limited to N20,000 with a balance or eWallet limit set at N120,000.\n\nFor the Tier 1 category with verified National Identity Number (NIN), the daily transaction limit is set at N50,000 with an N300,000 balance.\n\nHowever, those in the Tier 2 category will be able to do transactions up to N200,000 daily with an eWallet balance of N500,000, while Tier 3 will have daily transactions of N1 million with balances of N5 million.\n\nHowever, merchants, or duly accredited individuals and non-individual (corporates) authorised to conduct business in Nigeria will have no limits on eNaira transactions.\n\nThe CBN also stated that under the digital currency framework, Financial Institutions (FIs) shall render returns to the bank in line with the provisions of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 2020 and as may be specified from time to time.\n\nThe guidelines, among other things, said FIs shall put in place appropriate measures to ensure sound risk management practices to address potential threats to their operations.\n\nThese include an enterprise risk management framework; Appropriate governance structures; Documented and approved policies; and Secured information technology infrastructure.\n\nIt said, \u201cFinancial Institutions shall be required to implement additional risk management measures as may be prescribed by CBN guidelines from time to time.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines stipulated the role and responsibilities of the different stakeholders particularly concerning ensuring the prevention or minimisation of loss following a loss, theft of a user\u2019s device or compromise, hack of user eNaira wallet.\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",
