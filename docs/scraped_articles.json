          "title": "Finance bill: TIN doesn\u2019t compel everyone to pay tax, experts tell FG",
          "text": "Experts have said making every account holder possess a Tax Identification Number does not mean everyone is required to pay tax, as there is an exemption to anyone earning below N30,000.\n\nThey added that there would be a reduction in tax avoidance, as the government would have a tax footprint of everyone.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Senate Majority Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, had on Wednesday stated that the 2022 Finance Bill which had been sent to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), would make it mandatory for commercial banks to demand Tax Identification Number from any individual seeking to open an account with them.\n\nFiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PwC, Taiwo Oyedele, said although there seemed to be no such provision in the new 2021 Finance Bill mandating TIN for account holders, it might affect financial inclusion if the narrative around it was not well-managed.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is nothing in the new finance bill that is before the National Assembly about TIN. I know the naming of bills can be confusing. The bill called the 2021 Finance Bill is the bill that takes effect in 2022. So, the finance bill that we are using now in 2021 was done in 2020. That was the one that has TIN, not the 2021 Finance Bill.\n\n\u201cHowever, before the bill, VAT has been asking for TIN from companies. The additional provision was for individuals. For individuals, I don\u2019t know if that is fully implemented but the reality is you can\u2019t have a bank account without BVN, and if you have BVN, you are just one click away from the TIN. So, I don\u2019t think anyone can hide from the tax man by not having TIN.\n\n\u201cIf the perception is not managed well, it can discourage people from opening bank accounts, and this can affect financial inclusion. In fact, it can even affect the new e-Naira adoption. People may just assume that all of this is about collecting taxes. So, the government has a responsibility to ensure the right narrative.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed the need for a proper tax system, which would hinder tax avoidance and illicit financial flows.\n\n\u201cA proper tax system is actually good for everyone. It does not mean that you have to pay tax. Part of what we are trying to get the government to do is to increase the exemption threshold.\n\n\u201cThey moved it to N30,000 last year, which is progress. Hopefully, we will get to a point of moving it to maybe N100,000. But even if you are exempted, you still need to be within the system so we have your data. So, that is one impact I am hoping to see.\u201d\n\nA tax expert at KPMG, Victor Onyenkpa, also emphasised the essence of TIN, stating that it would provide a tax signature for everyone, which would help to effectively manage the tax process in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt will give every account operator a tax footprint because if you have a TIN and it is linked to your bank account, it means you have to register with a tax authority. Once you are registered with a tax authority, it is easy to track you from the point of view of whether you are liable to tax and whether you are paying the appropriate tax that you should pay.\n\n\u201cObviously, there will be people like students, who will not be paying taxes, but we will also know their status as students.\u201d\n\nHowever, a former President, Association of the National Accountants of Nigeria, Dr Sam Nzekwe, said the law was aimed at making those earning income to pay taxes.\n\nHe observed that many businesses were making huge revenue but not paying taxes.\n\nThe law, he noted, would boost government revenue as more people would be drawn into the tax net.\n\nHe however stressed the need to ensure judicious use of the taxes because people were not seeing what the taxes were being used for.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Owa of Idanre kingdom, Oba Fredrick Aroloye, has urged the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi, to intervene in the spate of insecurity in the region, using traditional means.\n\nIdanre traditional ruler, who decried the state of insecurity in the region, stressed that there was the need to tackle the menace unconventionally.\n\nHe gave the charge during the celebration of his 45th coronation anniversary in Idanre, in the Idanre Local Government Area of Ondo State.\n\nThe Ooni of Ife and people from all walks of life graced the occasion, including the Deji of Akure, Aladelusi Aladetoyinbo; Osemawe of Ondo, Oba Victor Kiladejo; Olubaka of Oka-Akoko, Oba Adebori Adeleye; and Aroloye of Atosin, Oba Gilbert Ogunlowo.\n\nAroloye said, \u201cIt\u2019s documented that the Ooni of Ife is the Arole of Oduduwa. I have many documents to prove that.\n\n\u201d You ( Ooni) have many vital roles to play now at this point in time. There is insecurity in Yorubaland. We need to tackle this unconventional way. Before the coming of the colonial masters, our fathers had their own way of tackling insecurity. We still have these things with and in us. We haven\u2019t thrown everything away.\u201d\n\nAccording to Idanre monarch, Oba Ogunwusi would be the third Ooni that had visited Idanre because of the relationship between the two towns. He noted that Idanre was initially known as Ife Oke before the name was changed to Idanre, which was derived from the magical prowess of the people.\n\nResponding, the Oba Ogunwusi agreed with Oba Aroloye and promised to address the issue.\n\nHe promised to return to the town soon to climb the popular Idanre Hill which harbours several tourist centres.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s high debt: Invitation to recolonisation and slavery (2)",
          "text": "By Aare Afe Babalola\n\nPREVIOUSLY, I extensively considered the unfortunate repeat in the history of slavery \u2013 from the days of slavery by Europeans who forcefully carted away Africans abroad, to the recent spate of self-imposed slavery by Africans in Europe and the Americas.\n\nAs noted, many Africans consider that by selling themselves out abroad, they will break free from the rat race of poverty into financial freedom. Unfortunately, it is not always so. I rounded off the first edition by considering the recent news of the Ugandan government which obtained a loan from China and is on the brink of forfeiting its only international airport.\n\nDebt slavery\n\nBesides the most common forms of slavery being military slavery and domestic slavery, one subtle and perhaps the most lethal of them all is debt slavery. The peril of debt slavery is not due to the danger it personally poses to the obligor, but its huge effect on those who were not party to the said debt.\n\nOften, the security for the said debt is usually something of shared interest and not necessarily the personal property of the debt obligor and sometimes, even the terms of the debt repayment may not be fully understandable by the obligor.\n\nDebt slavery as a modern-day form of slavery is the most common method of enslavement with an estimated 8.1 million people bonded to labour having pledged their assets or services as security for the repayment of a debt or some other obligation.\n\nThe services required to repay the debt may be undefined, and the services\u2019 duration may be undefined, thus allowing the person supposedly owed the debt to demand services indefinitely. Debt bondage can be passed on from generation to generation.\n\nIndividuals and institutions who are caught in the web of debt slavery rarely set out with such intent in mind but, oftentimes, realise the entrapment too late in the game.At the initial stage of pleasantries, the euphoria of receiving humongous sums of money, as well as its inherent potential to resolve certain pressing infrastructural and fiscal woes usually obscures any looming danger of non-payment.\n\nTherefore, they hurriedly execute documents either without a full grasp of its implications, or against the misconceived belief that the indebtedness will be fully defrayed and would therefore not result in any negative implications, no matter what documents may be signed.\n\nAs we have seen in the case of Uganda, such is not always the situation. Regrettably realising the implication of the agreement which the country executed with the Chinese, albeit too late, the Ugandan Finance Minister reportedly informed the country\u2019s parliament as follows: \u201cI apologise that we shouldn\u2019t have accepted some of the clauses\u201d.\n\nThe Managing Director of the Ugandan Civil Aviation Authority equally noted that: \u201cSome 13 clauses were deemed unfriendly and as good as mortgaging the airport and eroding the country\u2019s sovereignty. The most troubling for the aviation bosses was a clause that gave Exim Bank the sole authority to approve withdrawal of funds from the UCAA accounts\u201d.\n\nThe Ugandan situation is certainly a clear eye-opener to other African countries, particularly Nigeria, that is neck-deep in foreign indebtedness, including to China.\n\nNigeria must learn from the following countries: Sri Lanka which forfeited its Hambantota Port to China over a $6bn debt; Malaysia that is being forced to rescind some of its largest national projects due to a $22bn indebtedness to China; the tiny, tourism-dependent country of Maldives which owes $3.1bn to China, and a host of other countries including Pakistan, Kenya, Sudan, and Ethiopia.\n\nSelf-imposed slavery\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, which is the agency set up to aid, protect and monitor refugees estimated that the number of people who died or went missing when crossing the Mediterranean in 2018 is 2,275. In 2016, the unfortunate statistics was 3,740, while in 2015, it was 3,771. A commentator once remarked:\n\n\u201cThe next time you eat a fish from the Mediterranean, just remember that it may well have eaten a corpse. As the Italian author Aldo Busi told the press just the other day: \u2018I don\u2019t buy fish from the Mediterranean any more for fear of eating Libyans, Somalis, Syrians and Iraqis. I\u2019m not a cannibal and so now I stick with farmed fish, or else Atlantic cod\u201d.\n\nNotwithstanding, many remain undeterred of the very apparent risks in seeking greener pastures abroad through the often-unfortunate means of sea crossing. They are determined to reach Europe at all costs, even their lives.\n\nBack in April 2021, it was reported that more than 100 migrants and refugees were feared dead after drowning in a rubber boat which capsized off the coast of Libya while trying to cross to Europe. Aljazeera reported the alarming statistics that since 2014, more than 20,000 migrants have died at sea while trying to reach Europe from Africa.\n\nThis then begs the question: despite the number of those who lose their lives in the unfortunate attempt to cross the African shores into the \u201cpromised land\u201d, will self-imposed slavery in Europe and the Americas continue to be the remedy of the average Nigerian to the nation\u2019s economic downfall? Why do Nigerians and other Africans risk death to reach the shores of Europe in pursuit of a dream which often turns into a nightmare?\n\nBack to debt slavery, MSN Africa reported that as of December 31, 2019, Nigeria owed $3.18bn to the Exim Bank of China, $76.13m to France\u2019s Agence Francaise Development, $361.75m to Japan International Cooperation Agency, $32.14m to the Exim Bank of India, and $202.27m to Germany\u2019s Kreditanstalt Fur Wiederaufbua.\n\nA total of $106.33m was paid as debt service for bilateral loans in Q1 2021, with China and India receiving $102.2m and $4.13m.The total debt owed to the five countries increased further to $4.25bn as of June 30, 2021, with China having $3.48bn; Japan, $74.77m; France, $482.15m; India, $34.59m; and Germany, $174.39m.\n\nThe Nigerian Minister of Finance reportedly noted in October that the Federal Government was uncomfortable with the fact that it exceeded the borrowing threshold in the Fiscal Responsibility Act. She further reportedly noted as follows:\n\n\u201cBut we have made sure that we have planned over the next few years that the borrowing is scaled down, and also that we are able to borrow at levels that we can actually repay the debt service obligation\u201d.\n\nIt is not only enough for the Federal Government to be uncomfortable about the country\u2019s debt quagmire, but to take proactive measures in ensuring that the nation is totally debt-free within a stipulated timeframe. The statement of the Finance Minister that the country is aiming \u201cto borrow at levels that we can actually repay the debt service obligation\u201d is unfortunately reflective of the fact that the nation is not ready to be debt free.\n\nConclusion\n\nNo doubt, it is high time that African leaders began to make intentional efforts to adopt sound economic policies which will make a dangerous foray by Africans into self-imposed slavery less appealing.\n\nIf Africans, and especially Nigerians, are assured of good living conditions or even if they are assured that their governments are trying their best to bring about better standards of living, braving the Sahara, and crossing the Mediterranean in a dingy would definitely become less of an option.\n\nIn the coming years, the disastrous interplay between self-imposed slavery and debt profile must, as a matter of necessity, be quelled if there is to be any hope for Nigeria from being recolonised or being enslaved again.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Decline of values and political culture in Nigeria",
          "text": "The history of Nigeria\u2019s politics since the coming into being of the Fourth Republic, like its earlier democratic experiments has shown intractable but avoidable defects and deficits in the practice of participatory democracy. To interrogate this ugly phenomenon, this essay will focus primarily on the role played by undemocratic attitudes, unwholesome values, objectionable beliefs, and sentiment, in short, the declining values and political culture, \u2018ala Nigeriana\u2019.\n\nThe impetus for this discourse is borne out by the incessant, reoccurring incidences of fraudulent, dishonest, and sometimes violent elections in Nigeria which has culminated in engendering undemocratic attitudes, values, and behavioural patterns that the politicians carry into the political terrain.\n\nValues are a set of shared beliefs, convictions, and attitudinal dispositions and supportive idiosyncrasies, towards the socio-political system in the society. Yet there is sometimes a significant disconnect between what Nigerians are willing to uphold in principle and how they behave in practice.\n\nThere are certain requisite political norms, orientation and attitudes that create and sustain the environment for credible and democratic political evolution. This unfortunately is lacking in the Nigerian political space.\n\nOn the contrary, what we have, is a situation where electoral competitors engage the electoral process and system with anti-democratic values and attitudes that frustrate the enthronement and attainment of political development in Nigeria.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nFrom the colonial period, Nigeria has conducted about 21 general elections to date: Apart from the inconclusive June 12 elections of 1993, they were all congenitally marred by electoral corruption.\n\nThere is a consensus that the integrity of elections has been on the decline since 1959 with the 2007 general elections widely assessed by both local and international observers as the worst in the country\u2019s history.\n\nElectoral crisis in Nigeria has been attributed to several factors which includes weak electoral laws and institutions, lack of independence and bias of the electoral umpire, long years of military involvement in politics and several other factors.\n\nAny meaningful explanation of the phenomenon of \u2018declining political culture\u2019 must therefore begin with a conceptualization of the generic term, \u2018political culture\u2019. This refers to the dominant pattern of orientations or popular attitudes to the political system, its processes, and institutions, among the members of that nation. In other words, political culture consists of people\u2019s shared, learned beliefs about their political system and their role within that system.\n\nPolitical culture influences the way people see their political world and what they expect from it.\n\nPolitical culture has normative and subjective qualities. It is about the ideals that influence citizens\u2019 perceptions about how governance ought to be carried out. It is this subjective realm which underlines and gives meaning to political activities as well as the level of the citizens\u2019 involvement in the politics of the state.\n\nThere are three types of political culture: Parochial, Subject and Participant.\n\nIn parochial political cultures, there is poor political socialization, and the citizens are apathetic towards government, its structures, functions, and its functionaries; leading to poor political participation on the part of the people.\n\nParticipant political culture on the other hand, is geared towards active involvement of the citizens in government. Unfortunately, what we have here since the departure of the military has been a politics of de-participation. Connoting a nonchalant attitude to the political process: A disposition borne out of despondency and frustration.\n\nIt is the major cause of low-voter turnout, exemplified by the recent Anambra gubernatorial election with less than 25% of the electorate voting. It was an election without the electorate.\n\nThe 2019 presidential election recorded the lowest turnout of voters in the history of recorded elections in Africa, with a 34% turnout. States such as Abia, Enugu and Ebonyi witnessed the lowest turnout, with less than 30 per cent of their registered voters marking the ballot. This is in stark contrast to 1999 when 70 per cent of all registered voters turned out to usher in Nigeria\u2019s new democracy. In 2015, the lowest turnout recorded was about 42 per cent, owing to issues such as voter apathy and the heavy activity of Boko Haram in the Northeast. The average, so far, has remained consistent at 34.7%.\n\nIndependent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairman in a report this year said voter turnout across Nigeria hovered around 30 to 35 percent of registered voters in the last two electoral cycles. He cited the case of a recorded 8.3 per cent voter turnout in an urban constituency of over 1.2 million located in the nation\u2019s most densely populated city.\n\nThe INEC Chairman, Yakubu said that some CSOs had submitted reports to the commission concerned about the declining voter turnout in elections in Nigeria.\n\nNo doubt, military dictatorship engendered a subject political culture because of the restricted channel for political participation. The input of the people does not count to a great extent in terms of determining who gets what, when and how. This is unhygienic for the growth of democratic governance.\n\nIn similar vein, the polity that is dominated by subject political culture are passive as they see themselves as subjects of government rather than participants.\n\nNigerian political turf is dominated by parochial and subject political cultures. The citizens do not voluntarily and effectively participate in the political system and its processes because they are highly cynical and distrustful of their political leaders. They are also not loyal and proud of the political system because the system is not fair and responsive to their interest.\n\nMoreover, it is hard to argue that elections have promoted positive change in the country. Nearly every elected government has underperformed. Successive governments have failed to reduce poverty, build infrastructure, and maintain law & order. Instead, Nigeria seems to be regressing.\n\nApart from the citizens, the leaders are not patriotic or nationalistic and altruistic in outlook. They are always ready and willing to sacrifice the democratic tenet of the rule of law to grab and sustain political power.\n\nIn their struggle for power, the citizens are seen as pawns to be used, abused, and dumped. This explains why elections in Nigeria are characterised by electoral corruption, violence and the abuse and usurpation of the inalienable rights of the citizens to decide who will govern them.\n\nThe products of undemocratic elections are distinctively exclusive, dictatorial, lawless, corrupt, predatory, and unresponsive to the needs and yearnings of the populace; the ultimate outcome is governance that falls short of the expectations and needs of the people.\n\nGovernance in Nigeria seems to be a zero-sum game producing leaders as winners and electorate as absolute losers. This pseudo-reality has shaped voter behaviour during election cycles, eroding the moral zeal to vote. With a long history of disappointment, individuals who choose not to participate in political activities can be forgiven for treating elections without reverence.\n\nIt can be argued that those who vote do so out of moral suasion, selfish agendas, or a distant hope that their vote would somehow make a difference.\n\nLike in other post-colonial states, the political class is associated with the culture of using political power for primitive accumulation of wealth. It is an acknowledged fact that the wealthiest people in Nigeria are generally people who have acquired wealth through mismanagement and unlawful use of state power and resources.\n\nHowever, there is a historical context and explanation of the undemocratic culture and politics associated with Nigeria\u2019s political class. It is traceable to the origin of the Nigerian state. The Nigerian state is a creation of colonial capitalism, which was charged with the singular aim of exploiting the country\u2019s people and resources. To enable the state, achieve its major objective, it became totalitarian, brutish, pervasive, and predatory. The colonial state\u2019s politics was also divisive as well as it alienated the people.\n\nThe post-colonial Nigerian state, rather than change the exploitative nature of the state, bestowed on it by colonialism, assumed the character of its predecessor and continued with its policies and politics of dis-empowerment and exploitation.\n\nAs a result of its distorted growth under colonialism, the Nigeria ruling class is economically unproductive and weak. Lacking an economic base, the Nigerian ruling class has used political power, particularly the control of state power, to amass wealth to consolidate its material base to the extent that political power is now the established way to wealth. Thus, the capture of the state power inevitably becomes a matter of life and death. This is the primary reason why the struggle among political elites is so intense, anarchic, and violent.\n\nThey compromised participatory and inclusive democracy as well as replaced the rule of law with the whims and caprices of men.",

          "title": "On money rituals, logic and life",
          "text": "Just some few days ago\u2014Thursday, December 2, 2021\u2014and in her Punch column and article titled \u201cThe logic of what Nigerians call \u2018money rituals\u2019,\u201d Abimbola Adelakun in her usual incisive manner attempts to pierce through the conceptual and existential fog that suffuse the idea of money rituals that has captured the imagination of Nigerians. Any violent death becomes all the more sensational because, in the people\u2019s imagination, it could only have been due to the senselessness of those who violate the sacredness of human life in search of the charm or portion that will make them stupendously rich. And in the Nigerian post-independence context of extreme poverty and unrelenting underdevelopment and infrastructural deficit, such killings and the hype that surrounds them become all the more pronounced. Nigeria has become the poverty capital of the world. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and its global economic implications, so many Nigerians\u2014about 11 million from the last statistical update\u2014have now been further pushed below the poverty line.\n\nThe \u201clogic\u201d in Adelakun\u2019s article refers to the rationality of trying to piece together the relationship between the ascendancy of the money ritual phenomenon and the depth of existential crisis in the lives of Nigerians that makes the appeal to money ritual meaningful for them. Abimbola connects the logic of the belief to the possibility of becoming rich through ritual killing to the parlous state of governance in Nigeria. For her, \u201cthere is nothing like money rituals. By that, I mean there is nowhere in the history of humankind where anybody has made cash appear through magic means.\u201d What is the case, however, is that the sensational nature of the violent ritual killing generates what she calls \u201can economy of belief\u201d that instigates a trade in human parts. Thus, the more violent ritual killing is hyped, the more people belief that others participate in it because it is efficacious, and the more those who benefits in the trading in human parts oil the demand and supply chain.\n\nThis logic seems unassailable. In other words, Nigeria\u2019s precarious situation creates all manner of terrible beliefs and practices that are, to say the least, incredulous. I am too much of a political scientist, and not too taken by my Christianity, not to notice, for instance, the role that Pentecostalism has played in accentuating Nigerians\u2019 belief in the spiritual, and the spin that this provides for all endeavors in life. In deep poverty, the miraculous seems like the way out of the terrible grip of ill-fortune and bad luck\u2014or an economic situation that has remained unfavorable for many years without relenting. And this is made all the more poignant by the power of the media and its unrelenting projections of possibilities, either through prophesies, miracles, prosperity theology, betting, lottery and the possibility of being instant billionaires. Thus, if government has not been able to undermine the infrastructural deficit that undergird the bad governance that has trapped Nigerians in impoverishment, then heavens help those who help themselves. The tragedy of this slogan is that in helping oneself, one is forced to lay waste the lives of others in the belief in the capacity of magic to conjure money out of the body parts of those brutally murdered.\n\nWhile saying \u201cthere is nothing like money rituals\u201d assumes logic, and the logic of economic calculation, it is to assume too much about the capacity of logic to explain the whole of life and its many mysterious and dark crevices. These dark crevices are then wrapped differently in cultural knowledge and practices that people turn to for a coping mechanism that makes life meaningful in the midst of the vicissitudes of human existence. Professor Toyin Falola\u2019s response would be for anyone not to disregard the strength and tenacity of what he calls cultural cognition. Cultural worldviews make people amenable to different beliefs and practices that do not need logic or reason to flourish. In simple terms: what people believe is what people believe. And what people chose to believe cannot be undermined by the disruptive strength of abstract and cold logic, like the one deployed by Abimbola Adelakun. That article, read by millions of people will not stop ritual killings, or the belief in it. What would rather happen is that those who read it would likely shake their heads in consternation: how could anyone say there is no money rituals? And a possible answer from them would likely be: well, only someone who is well-to-do and lives in oyinbo land.\n\nCan logic encapsulate the whole of life? That is by itself a logical impossibility. And this is why the line of discourse Adelakun has started is not something she is equipped to carry sufficiently by far, by the logic of her logical explanation. And this is because that logic obviates the possibilities of those realms that different faiths and religions gesture at, the realms that occultic practices take for granted, and the realms that even philosophy dares not disregard. One foundation for the intellectual and perceptive fame of Karl Marx is the argument that religion is the opium of the people. Religions and their liturgical practices, for him, perpetuate the oppressive dynamics of capitalism. However, religions all across the world also give tremendous hope and courage to billions of people across the world. And that hope is hinged on the eschatological possibility\u2014a realm that no one can ever logically affirm or disaffirm. Many have been able to live and bear the utmost Sisyphean burden with that singular hope in the hereafter.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo say \u201cthere is nothing like money rituals\u201d is to say there is nothing like mysticism and occultism. Indeed, to stretch the logic of that denial, it is to say there is nothing like \u201cGod.\u201d And the idea of God is central to many occultic and mystical explanation about life and the deeper underbelly of life and reality. Many believe that there is a mystical side to the nature of God. There are Christians who believe in what philosophers call the transubstantiation of substances\u2014the transformation, for instance, of the water and the wine into the body and the blood of Jesus Christ once they are consumed in the Holy Communion. What about the mystical explanation of the Trinity that sustains the existence of the belief of many Christians? How about the account in the gospel of St. Matthew chapter 17: 24-27 and the mystery of Christ conjuring a four-drachma coin from the mouth of a fish at the lake of Galilee so he could pay his tax? Indeed, the very evolution of Christianity itself and its theologies of the existence of God is founded on mystical events and incidences. We come to the knowledge of God through a mystical experience of knowing him. Here, science and reason fall far short of what is possible.\n\nMany others, like Lobsang Rampa, believe in mystical transformations. Cyril Henry Hoskins\u2014popularly known as Lobsang Rampa, was the world\u2019s most famous mediator of Tibetan mysticism. But his mediation began with his belief that his body was taken over by the Tibetan mystic, Rampa. Thus, what others saw as an identity confusion, and a possible psychotic disorder, he saw as a mystical event. And on the basis of that belief, Lobsang Rampa produced series of insights and lessons about spiritual consciousness, and the relationship of the self with others, that makes Tibetan mysticism a form of non-violent religion that could heal the world of its violent anxieties. Lobsang Rampa\u2019s elucidation of the idea of the \u201cthird eye\u201d points at the possibility of an insightful perception that transcends normal sight\u2014the gateway to deeper enlightenment.\n\nOutside of the arrogance of scientific explanation, the universe is suffused in mysteries. Philosophy, with its inherent skeptical orientation, is open-minded sufficiently to allow for alternatives to logical and scientific explanation\u2014like a mystical or intuitive knowledge of the universe. Philosophical open-mindedness demands that science, logic and reason must be aware of their limitations in the understanding of the mysteries of life. Within the Nigerian context of bad governance, the irrational often trumps the rational. And the irrational possesses its own logic that is not just explainable by the rational.\n\nViolent ritual killing is bad business. It totally violates the sacredness of human lives and the sacred order of the human society. There is no society that can make any progress in terms of decency as a marker of cultural enlightenment if the killing of others is a means to wealth-making (rather than an entrepreneurial and innovative spirit). And the logic behind Abimbola Adelakun article is to undermine such a tragic phenomenon by appealing to reason, by pointing out how illogical such a belief is. This is admirable, as it goes. The point however is that both logic and the law (to the extent that the latter is also founded on logic) are powerless to serve as the basis of dissuading those who would not be dissuaded from their culturally cognized perception of the world and their place in it. Of course, the law has the power to nip in the bud any attempt at senseless killing in the name of making money. Maybe that is all that is needed to stop ritual killing in its track. And this is because people will keep believing what they want to believe.",

You said you never used Kayamata and that my man left me two years ago. You don\u2019t see him post things accusing me of cheating. You don\u2019t see me saying nasty things about him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re 74. You\u2019re supposed to be giving us an example to follow. Don\u2019t talk about your spouse in this manner.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Jaruma accused him of marrying the actress solely for fame.\n\n\u201cYou like being in the news. You married Regina Daniels, despite being a senator and a billionaire prince, because you wanted fame.\n\n\u201cYou talked about me again, after doing that three weeks ago, because you wanted the buzz.\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nPan-Yoruba socio-cultural and political organisation, Afenifere, has said it was not desperate to have a Yoruba man as Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023.\n\nThe group said it would rather favour a president that emerges from any part of the South.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe group\u2019s position was in contrast with that of Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), which said it supported a president of Yoruba extraction.\n\nThe two leading Yoruba groups made their positions known during separate interviews on Friday with Saturday Sun, following consultations being made by some APC governors, which was exclusively reported by this newspaper last Saturday.\n\nSpecial Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN), which is South West Affairs; Mr. Adekunle Olayinka; Special Adviser to Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State on Social Investment Programmes (SIP); Victor Kolade; and Senior Special Assistant to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Adesina Popoola, and Chief Oladipo Oladosu, a frontline politician in Osun State, among others, had met in Ibadan recently under the aegis of Next Level Consolidation Forum, to ensure that South West is rock solid to produce the president for Nigeria in 2023.\n\nThey insisted that presidential power must come to the South West in 2023, and the acceptable person that the Yoruba would present for the office would be decided as time progresses.\n\nBut in an interview with Saturday Sun, National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr. Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cFirst of all, the presidency in 2023 must shift to the Southern part of the country. We insist on that. For whether it should be South East, South South or South West, we want the best person, who will do the job, correct all the anomalies that the country is going through, and ensure that Nigeria move forward to where other countries are in the 21st Century and beyond.\n\n\u201cThat is the kind of candidate that we are looking forward to. To be specific, when we get close to that time, we will decide. As far as we are concerned in Afenifere, whoever that emerges as president in 2023, will have problem in running the country if Nigeria is not restructured. There must be serious tinkering with the present structure in such a way that it will be pro-people, rather than how it is now.\n\n\u201cThere must be restructuring before 2023. The question of where the president will come from is secondary. But the president must come from the Southern part of this country. What we are running on the country today is more or less a unitary government, which concentrates too much power at the centre. So, we are calling for decentralization and genuine commitment to the rule of law and federalism. We are insisting that these must take place before the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nSecretary-General, YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, told Saturday Sun that he would be \u201cvery delighted if Nigerians decide to elect our kinsman as president in 2023 for a number of reasons.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the landscape of Nigeria, without being immodest, Yoruba people appear to be the most liberal and most accommodating in Nigeria. Traditionally, Yoruba culture is that at all times, we must do what is right and you must insist on fairness and equity for all.\u201d\n\nOlajide stated further that the APC governors that have been making consultations should let the council know what they are doing. He added that the Yoruba that are interested in contesting for president in 2023 should come out clearly and declare their intention. This, he said, would allow the council to lend its weight to it.\n\n\u201cOf course, we will support it if we are all of the opinion and believe that the person has a national clout to emerge as president and to be embraced by all parts of this country. But we want to know who are the Yoruba people that are showing interests.\n\nOlajide also commented on the preference of the council between restructuring and the election. \u201cPersonally, and I know that is going to be the opinion of the council. We prefer restructuring or having a brand new constitution, because whoever emerges as president will have idiosyncrasies. But the constitution is the grundnorm on which he has to work.\n\n\u201cThe preference of every Nigerian, in my humble opinion, should now be true federalism, at least limit human frailties of whoever emerges as president. But election is a matter of the constitution. We will have the election in 2023 by God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Vincent Kalu, Lagos\n\nThe recent call by two prominent Igbo leaders \u2013 Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, former Secretary of the Government of the Federation, and Chukwuemeka Ezeife, elder statesman, and former governor of Anambra State on the North to cede the post of the President to a Nigerian of Igbo extraction, has divided some Igbo socio-political groups. While some of them are irked by what they see as the subservient nature of the appeal, others think that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it, as far as politics is concerned.\n\nMovement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), yesterday, said it was abominable for the Igbo to kneel to people in order to mount the saddle of power.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nLeader of MASSOB, Comrade Uchenna Madu stated this while reacting to what he considers as the \u201cinsensitive and insulting remarks\u201d allegedly made by Senator Anyim and Chief Ezeife, on the quest for an Igbo man to become the next President of Nigeria. He noted that the Igbo are not slaves to power.\n\nMadu decried what he sees as the appealing or kowtowing tendencies of the two Igbo statesmen that portray Ndigbo as being ready to kneel down in begging for the position of Nigerian president. According to the MASSOB leader, a beggar only begs for something that does not belong to him, stressing that a beggar is always inferior to the giver.\n\nHe insisted: \u201cNdigbo are not beggars. It is an abomination that Igbo elders will kneel down for another. Even though the lives of Ndigbo are at risk, we can never beg; rather, we devise our own means of fighting back because Igbos must survive. Ndigbo are not cowards or weaklings.\u201d\n\nHe advised Igbo elders to stop making disgraceful and disrespectful utterances in their quest for the President of Nigeria. \u201cOccupying the seat of the President of Nigeria is not the greatest need of Ndigbo now,\u201d he said. \u201cNdigbo want Biafra, not Igbo presidency.\u201d\n\nHe urged Igbo elders and leaders to seriously embark on convincing thousands of Igbo entrepreneurs, estate developers, international businessmen, captains of industry, great researchers, world-class engineers, religious leaders to start rapid development and investment in Igbo land. He added that being a president of Nigeria for four or eight years is not the ultimate desire of Ndigbo.\n\nSupporting the MASSOB leader\u2019s stance, the National President of Indigenous Igbo Youth Congress (IIYC), Chief Mayor Echefu, said that Igbo do not kneel for anybody or group, but only to Almighty God.\n\nSaid he: \u201cDr. Ezeife is a respected Igbo leader; we hold him in high esteem. We have always followed and agreed with him in the pursuit of Igbo cause and agenda, but on this issue of kneeling to beg for presidency, we are not with him. It is not our culture to kneel for any mortal; when others were bowing and kneeling for the Whiteman, we didn\u2019t do that, so why should we do that today?\u201d\n\n\n\nLike Madu, he insisted that \u201cwe are not asking for the presidency; all we are asking and clamouring for is our freedom for us to go and develop at our own pace.\n\n\u201cThe North that has produced the president for 41 out of 60 years since independence, where are they? All the negative indices of underdevelopment are prevalent in that region. What have they done with their long-hold on power? Can their leaders visit their villages? That is hypocritical on their own part.\u201d\n\nHe also took a swipe at the President of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima, who in his reply to Ezeife noted that it was already too late for the Igbo to beg for presidency. He accused Shettima of seeking relevance and added that he should be ashamed of his region.\n\nBut the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) disagreed with MASSOB and IIYC on the issue. Chairman of ADF Media and Publicity Bureau, Abia Onyike noted that it was left for each Igbo presidential aspirant to decide which approach to adopt in pursuing his aspiration. Onyike argued that there is nothing wrong with begging in power negotiation.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the presidential aspirant as an individual. It is up to such a fellow to play the political game in such a way as to obtain victory. Whether you call it lobbying or prostrating or genuflecting or consultations, it is all politics. It is bad politics to claim that the presidential seat is your right when you know that it is the kingmakers who will decide it. In politics, little things matter. Let those who can do it carry on.

Dauda Bature, has been killed by his abductors after 30 days in captivity.\n\nThe sad incident occurred Thursday as dare devil bandits invaded parts of Sabon Tasha GRA, Oil Village and Anguwan Bulus areas of Kaduna metropolis, abducting eight residents including a policeman and his family.\n\nBature was abducted on his farm on November 8, 2021.\n\nHis abductors were said to have demanded N5 million as ransom.\n\nIt was gathered that after negotiations, his wife went to deliver an undisclosed amount of money to the criminals in the bush.\n\nIt was further learnt that after collecting the money, she too was kidnapped by her husband\u2019s captors.\n\nThe bandits released her on December 6, 2021, to go and raise money money for her husband\u2019s release.\n\nThe Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Joseph Hayab, confirmed the killing of the clergy man.\n\n\u201cIt was yesterday (Friday) that the information came when our pastors were at a conference and the leaders of the church went to officially tell the wife that her husband is no more, so that they don\u2019t continue negotiations with the bandits,\u201d Hayab said.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Sabon Tasha, Oil Village and Anguwan Bulus areas of Kaduna metropolis had a sleepless night as bandits invaded the areas Thursday and the early hours of Saturday, abducting eight people.\n\nThe hoodlums were said to have invaded Sabon Tasha GRA and Anguwan Bulus simultaneously in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nThe residents said the bandits who came at about 1am were repelled by soldiers who responded to distressed calls.\n\nThe hoodlums were said to have burnt a house located at Tanko Kokwain Street after they forced their way to the house only to discover that there was nobody around.\n\nHayab said: \u201cThe bandits broke into a house at Tanko Kokwain Street, but when they discovered that there was no one in the house, they set it ablaze.\n\n\u201cThey came in large number and were shooting indiscriminately, some of them were wearing military uniforms.\n\n\u201cThe entire community was gripped by fear, everybody was helpless, because we cannot stand their weapons.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the arrival of soldiers led to the rescue of a pregnant woman and her son who were abducted by the bandits.\n\nIn the attack on Oil Village located near the GRA, a mother and her four children were said to have been abducted.\n\nThe bandits had in an earlier attack on Anguwan Bulus, also located near the Sabo GRA, abducted a policeman, his wife and son.\n\nIt was learnt that the policeman, said to be serving in Abuja, came to visit his family when the bandits struck.\n\nConfirming the GRA attack in a statement, Mohammad Jalige, the spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, said the bandits invaded GRA and Oil Village at about 1am on Saturday.\n\nHe added that in Sabo GRA, the bandits set a house ablaze, while a mother and her four children were abducted in Oil Village.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Kaduna Police Command through Divisional Police Officer Sabon Tasha Division Kaduna acted on a distress call received from a good Samaritan to the fact that some suspected bandits numbering about 30 with some in military gears and bearing dangerous weapons, were making ferocious effort to break into a residential area at Sabo GRA in Chikun LGA of the state in an attempt to commit heinous crime.\n\n\u201con receiving the distress call, operatives were immediately mobilized with the support of other security agents to the scene with a view to thwart the bandit\u2019s intention.\n\n\u201cThe criminals, on sensing the presence of security agents, started shooting indiscriminately.\n\n\u201cThe criminals, being frustrated by the police and other security agents, set the resident on fire and fled for their lives.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it was discovered that the bandits operated simultaneously with one at oil village in the same Sabo location where they kidnapped a woman and her four children to an unknown destination.\u201d\n\nHe said further that investigation into the two incidences had since commenced while effort were being made to rescue of the victims.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says eastern axis of state in the grip of fleeing bandits\n\nCalls for deployment of forces along borders with Zamfara\n\nPresident vows to flush out perpetrators\n\nBy Onuminya Innocent In Sokoto\n\nSokoto state Governor\u2019 Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has said parts of the state are in appalling grip of bandits and kidnappers marauding and scaring the populace in recent times. He blamed\n\nthe situation on the influx of bandits and criminals displaced by the defective maneuvers of security personnel deployed, under Operation Hadarin Daji, to end their nefarious activities in neighboring Zamfara state.\n\nThese, according to Gov. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto state, has left the state \u201cvery vulnerable\u201d to the deadly and inhuman activities of these criminal elements.\n\nTambuwal stated these on Friday when he received a high powered Federal Government delegation led by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj. Gen. Muhammad Babagana Munguno (rtd), pointing out that the consequences of Operation Hadarin Daji has resulted, before now and in the last four days, \u201cin broad daylight\u201d attacks and kidnappings \u201cin some parts of Isa , Sabon Birni, Tangaza, Illela \u201cand several other local government areas of the state.\u201d\n\nMonguno\u2019s team include: the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, the Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), Maj. Gen. Samuel Adebayo, the Directors-General of the Department of State Services and the National Intelligence Agency, Yusuf Maitama Bichi and Amb. Ahmed Rufa\u2019i Abubakar respectively.\n\nGov. Tambuwal told the security and intelligence chiefs that: \u201cOperation Hadarin Daji,\u201d the precursor of the escalation of tension and crisis in Sokoto state\u201d was carried out without any blocking force around the neighboring states, particularly Sokoto state.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, the timing of the operation, whereby, unfortunately, our security agents do not have enough equipment to move and curtail and contain those that would pander towards Sokoto state didn\u2019t help the timing as well. So, the timing and the way the operation was carried out left Sokoto very vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt does appear as if those bandits pursued from Zamfara state have relocated to Sokoto state. This is a very serious call for concern,\u201d he said, appealing to President Muhammadu Buhari \u201cto deploy more resources to Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cThere is need for more boots on the ground. I am familiar with the situation at the center, but I believe that something can be done, and, that should be done urgently and expeditiously because our situation is getting out of hand,\u201d he added.\n\nPerhaps also in his capacity as the Deputy Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Tambuwal reiterated his counterparts\u2019 commitment and support to the President in the fight against insecurity and other evils and made a specific mention of the support his administration had been giving to the apex government in his state.\n\n\u201cHere in Sokoto state, you can verify this from the heads of security agencies, there is nothing they have asked of us that we have not done. Absolutely nothing. Since the commencement of this administration, we have given security personnel in Sokoto state not less than 500 vehicles. We are also doing whatever it takes in terms of funding from our own end despite the lean resources that we have as a state,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Gen. Monguno, who thanked Gov. Tambuwal for cutting short an official trip to receive the Federal Government delegation at a very short notice, said they were in Sokoto \u201con a specific mission and instruction of President Buhari, \u201cto condole with you and the very good people of Sokoto state as well as His Eminence, the Sultan of Sokoto, who apparently is in Abuja, over the unfortunate incidents that have been occurring over the last couple of weeks.\u201d\n\nHe explained that their visit \u201caffirms the seriousness with which Mr President views the occurrence of the last couple of weeks, stressing that: \u201cIt has been unfortunate series of developments in which very innocent lives have been lost.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo life lost \u2026 is less important. Every life of every citizen is important; and, it gives great concern to Mr President that needless losses of lives are occurring.\n\n\u201cMr President wants me to convey his profound condolence over the loss of all the citizens who have departed. He wants us to also express his deep sympathy as well as his determination that the perpetrators of this very gruesome, wicked activities are apprehended and brought to book.\n\n\u201cThe very fact that the very top security echelon in the country is here is an indication that Mr President wants us to address this issue so that some form of comfort is given to the people of Sokoto state by a definite closure through a definite process in concluding what has happened to these unfortunate and innocent citizens.\n\n\u201cMr President is deeply troubled that fellow citizens had to go through this trauma. He has charged to make sure that all the relevant agencies do not rest until we are able to flush out the perpetrators of not just these last two incidents that occurred, but also previous incidents,\u201d he said.\n\nMonguno\u2019s delegation afterwards had about an hour closed door session with their host, his Deputy, Hon. Manir Muhammad Dan\u2019Iya, the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon. Aminu Muhammad Achida, Chairmen of Isa and Sabon Birni local government area, heads of security agencies in the state, some traditional rulers and other top government officials of the state government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We have strengthened our key anti-corruption agencies in collaboration with international partners and have undertaken several anti-corruption measures and initiatives.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria continues to face security challenges which pose a threat to democracy, and therefore called on global partners to support Nigeria\u2019s efforts in tackling insurgency and terrorism.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked President Biden, government and people of the United States for hosting the summit.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, democracy has remained the most popular and universally recognised way of governance thus far. It is one governance system that guarantees freedom of speech, rule of law, respect for human rights and inclusiveness in governance. It also promotes social justice, economic and social development and national and global peace.\n\n\u201cHowever, in spite of these laudable qualities, more is required from us as members of democratic societies, particularly in ensuring that democratic institutions and processes are strengthened, particularly during this period of a global pandemic which has threatened social cohesion in most democracies.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, must remain resolute and enhance cooperation, so that together, we build back better democratic institutions and sustainable democratic values,\u201d the President said.\n\nHe also noted that the summit was taking place at a time when democratic institutions around the world were facing several challenges.\n\n\u201cThis event will help promote a positive agenda for democratic renewal by focusing on some of the major challenges faced by democracies today. It is hoped that through our collective action, we can safeguard democratic values and principles,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had made it impossible to convene the meeting face to face, had taken a heavy toll on economies, health and democratic processes around the world.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, we have witnessed the resilience of democratic institutions in many countries that have held free, fair and transparent democratic elections under very challenging conditions.\u201d\n\nWhile pledging Nigeria\u2019s support for democratic governance in West Africa, Buhari, however, expressed concern about the threat of undemocratic take-over of government in the sub region.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria will continue to actively support the democratisation processes in our region West Africa and the African continent at large. But regrettably, our democratic gains of the past decades are under threats of unconstitutional takeover of power.\n\n\u201cThis unwholesome trend, sometimes in reaction to unilateral amendments of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nFormer president Olusegun Obasanjo and the former vice-president of Uganda, Specioza Wandira-Kazibwe, have condemned the travel ban on African countries over concerns relating to the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nA number of countries in Europe banned travel from countries in Africa following the discovery of the variant by South African scientists.\n\nObasanjo is a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, while Wandira-Kazibwe, the immediate past chair of the African Union Panel of the Wise, was the first female in Africa to become vice-president of a sovereign nation.\n\nSpeaking on the development regarding Omicron, the duo, in a joint article published yesterday in The Africa Report, expressed concern over the actions taken to shut out certain countries.\n\n\u201cWhat message was being sent? That each country by unilaterally bolting its gates will be able to hold back the tide of a pandemic, alone? That contributing to our global understanding of the evolution of a world plague, by sharing the fruits of years of genomic capabilities development, should lead to a country being ostracised?\u201d they asked.\n\nThey also wondered how countries gather annually in New York to address injustice \u201cand yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare related patents.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, rather than issue travel bans, what the world needs \u201cin these Omicron times is smart multilateralism.\n\n\u201cEven after we had learnt that shutting the doors made no sense at this point, the emotive comfort of locking out the other proved too tempting to resist,\u201d they said.\n\nThe two leaders continued: \u201cYet, to run effective contact tracing in a time of rapid global physical connectivity, information and goodwill is required from countries far and near to plot the trajectory of a virus moving at the speed of flight. Detecting a variant in a person who happens to be from or at point A on the globe says nothing about all the other places the variant may have touched before eventually slipping into the cells of the unfortunate carrier.\n\n\u201cA very different form of global hyper-cooperation is required to match the pace of such a fast spreading virus. We in Africa have learnt the hard way that we are in an age where the old models of multilateralism have run their full course.\n\n\u201cMarked by slow bureaucracy and symbolisms of comity rather than pragmatic trust and modern instruments, this old multilateralism has frozen attempts to reform global trade to serve the people rather than corporations.\n\n\u201cIt has hobbled efforts to turn the energy transition into a moment to balance the obscene imbalances in population and consumption. And it has led to a world where annually we assemble in New York to address injustice and yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare-related patents.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 threatened to disrupt Africa\u2019s biggest multilateral endeavour in half a century \u2013 the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) \u2013 \u2018radical agility\u2019 became our only path forward.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s embrace of smart multilateralism is manifest in being the first continent to agree on a common digital platform for bio-surveillance and biosecurity. Absolutely convinced that the each-for-herself idea embodied in border closures has serious limits, we set out to work with the private and civil society sectors to create both institutional and technological innovations to keep the borders open but the virus out.\n\n\u201cThrough a combination of skillful compromises and modern technologies, we pressed on and ensured that the timeline for start of trading would be maintained. It was as clear as noonday to those of us championing African multilateralism that retreating behind the walls of nationalist survival would be continental suicide. It would also be generational suicide because COVID and AfCFTA are both once in a lifetime opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is smart multilateralism at work. It is the only way forward for a continent like ours that has long been marginalised in the global scheme of things. But the more we look at the state of globalisation in the world today, the more convinced we are that it is the whole world that needs smart multilateralism and not just Africa.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "This little story says a lot about Nigeria. I was driving along Opebi Road, Lagos, when the traffic lights turned red at Salvation junction. The vehicles ahead of me kept moving nonetheless. I thought the lights were faulty but still decided to stop and watch. Then the drivers behind me started hooting as if I had committed a heinous crime. The guy directly behind me was screaming what I strongly suspected were obscenities. Then a commercial motorcyclist levelled up with me and started lecturing me on why I should ignore the lights, insinuating that I was wasting everybody\u2019s time. He was still making his presentation when the lights turned green. They were working fine, after all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was my offence? I understand that it was early, around 7am, and people were maybe hurrying to the office or wherever. What they didn\u2019t know was that I was in a hurry too. I wouldn\u2019t leave my house at 6.30am and head for a joint to eat catfish pepper soup. I was going for a workshop and needed to be there on time. But traffic lights are not Christmas lights and are, therefore, not decorations. In Nigeria, we engage all kinds of excuses to avoid doing the right thing and then turn around to say our country is not working. The same people who ignore traffic lights in Nigeria would obey them in Rwanda \u2014 only to return and start lamenting that Rwanda is a better country.\n\nYesterday, when Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), presented his memoir, \u2018The Arc of The Possible\u2019, in Abuja, the Salvation traffic lights incident kept coming to mind. I have read Waziri\u2019s book from page to page a number of times. Each time, I see the resolve of a public officer to go against the grain and do what is right. He should ordinarily be celebrated. But each time, I see how the system and its operators can frustrate and demonise you and even try to make you feel exceptionally stupid. Still, I remain optimistic about what is possible in Nigeria. Our country is redeemable. We have the ingredients.\n\nIn yesterday\u2019s conversation moderated by Mr Samson Itodo, the panellists \u2014 Amb Yusuf Tuggar, Ms Yewande Sadiku and Dr Joe Abah \u2014 agreed that despite the challenges, there are Nigerians in the public space who desire to effect positive change. Mr Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, chairman of the event, had set the tone with his opening remarks, echoed by Alhaji Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, the chief host. World Bank country director, Mr Shubham Chaudhuri, Ms Sharon Ikeazor and Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi gave goodwill messages. After Dr Okey Ikechukwu\u2019s book review, Kaduna state deputy governor, Mrs Hadiza Balarabe, did the presentation. The event anchored by Mr Kingsley Osadolor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the \u2018The Arc of The Possible\u2019, I see, on every page, the same Waziri I have known as a friend and mentor since we met in December 1989 as undergraduates at the University of Lagos: principled and resolute. His attempts at instilling prudency at NEITI \u2014 spending public funds shrewdly as if he were spending his personal resources \u2014 and his uncompromising attitude to work ethics are exactly what we need to transform our public service and, invariably, the country. Nigeria will never make progress if the engine room of government \u2014 the civil service \u2014 continues to run as it currently does. If we can reform the civil service at local, state and federal levels, Nigeria will be transformed.\n\nIn the memoir, I saw at least five things that should count as Waziri\u2019s achievements (he consistently commends his NEITI colleagues for making them happen). One, apart from clearing backlogs of the annual audit reports, NEITI did the unthinkable by releasing the 2020 report nine months ahead of the deadline set by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the global body. You wouldn\u2019t appreciate it. In the past, we were always two years late. Nigeria had become an embarrassment to itself. This is to say nothing about the absurdities of the late releases \u2014 such as making the media report issues that might have already been addressed along the line.\n\nTwo, Waziri helped reduce the cost of producing audits by almost half. For a government that promised to be the epitome of prudence, Waziri should have been its poster boy under normal circumstances. Nigeria has been suffering severe revenue crisis since 2014. But rather than government expenditure, especially overheads, coming down to reflect the times, they have been rising every year and we continue to stockpile debts and deficits. I imagine that if the MDAs watched their costs the way NEITI did under Waziri\u2019s stewardship, things would be much different today. But, well, government money is nobody\u2019s money and we keep wasting it like drunkards. Who cares?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree, I read, in anger and pains, how Waziri struggled to leverage on personal goodwill to get donor support of over $1.5m for NEITI\u2019s operations. You would think NEITI, as the extractive industry auditor, would be priority for a government that wants to fight corruption in a country where the operations of the sector are globally graded as shady. Not only was NEITI unable to pay its rent for some years, it was always short of cash, partly because the agency would not do what many other MDAs do to get fat allocations passed as budgets and then oil the system to get the votes released on time. NEITI was practically kicked out by its landlord and had to rent a much smaller space.\n\nFour, the beneficial ownership register was delivered on Waziri\u2019s watch. Typically, the real owners of the extractive companies are hardly made public. The register now reveals the real owners. It has been a major international requirement to combat opaqueness in the sector. When NEITI unveiled the register in January 2020, Nigeria became the only country with any form of open register of beneficial owners in the whole of Africa, Asia and the Americas. Also, Nigeria became the first country in the world with a beneficial ownership register specifically for the extractive sector. This will someday become a powerful weapon in combating the sector\u2019s legendary lack of transparency.\n\nFive \u2014 and this was my favourite as a researcher \u2014 NEITI introduced policy work to its portfolio, regularly producing analytical publications. In particular, I gained remarkable knowledge and insight into the Nigerian natural resources sector by reading the NEITI Policy Brief, the NEITI Quarterly Review, and the NEITI Occasional Paper Series. NEITI went beyond telling us \u201crevenue is missing\u201d or \u201crevenue is unremitted\u201d. It started providing educative insight into the workings of the extractive sector, even making policy proposals that would later play a critical role in sectoral reforms, notably the amendment of the law on deep offshore law and inland basin production sharing contract.\n\nRemarkably, Waziri is man enough to own up to what he says were his failings in office, admitting he could have been \u201cless impatient with people, and less judgemental, less irascible\u201d. He says he could have paced his actions differently \u201cespecially those that required changes in other people or came with a measure of discomfort\u201d. He writes: \u201cI could also have invested more time and energy into reading the room, paying more attention to the changing power configuration in the operating environment, and in creating more time for political management which is deemed the primary responsibility of a public official\u201d. It was more about style not substance, he writes, but both matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe admits that focusing intently on goals and outcomes, being driven by righteous anger, and living by example are good and necessary, \u201cbut they may not always be enough especially when dealing with deeply rooted norms in settled and complex environments\u201d. I hardly find this level of introspection in Nigerian memoirs and autobiographies. The regular lines are \u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets\u201d. Former public officers often paint a blameless picture of themselves, even when we have facts to the contrary. But whatever Waziri did not do well enough in office, I can say this even at gunpoint: he never soiled his hands. Rather, he gave up personal comfort to serve his fatherland.\n\nAnd herein lies what makes me hopeful for Nigeria: there are thousands of Waziri Adios out there waiting to be tapped \u2014 competent people who have prepared themselves for public service, who have the vision and the values. They want to transform the society. But herein lies what makes me despair at the same time: these people hardly get the opportunity to deliver, either because the system cannot withstand or accommodate their ideals or they do not have \u201cany man\u201d to lift them up in the first place. The saddest part, though, is that decent people have also joined government and lost their way on sighting the ogbono soup on the tables of power. Behold, many have gone rogue!\n\nBack to the traffic lights story. Many people do the wrong thing and seek to justify them by saying everyone else is doing it. The drivers in front of you are running a red light, so why not do same? That is one of the things hampering good governance in Nigeria. People get elected or appointed into public office and start doing unlawful and unethical things because that is what others are doing or did. Also, many public officers are pressured to do the wrong thing because of the circumstances around them: the need to meet a commitment, to be comfortable, to make hay while the sun shines. This compares well with the other road users putting pressure on me to run a red light.\n\nMoreover, Nigeria has gone so bad that what is wrong is now treated as right and what is right is seen as wrong. How can you insult me for obeying traffic lights? Within the 30-second wait, I started feeling like an idiot. Now, imagine somebody going into public office and helping government to save money \u2014 as well as not having his hand in the till. People will question his sanity. At a point, he too will begin to question his own sanity. Waziri was flying economy class before the federal government made it mandatory for agency heads \u201cto cut costs\u201d. At the end of his tenure, he chose not to buy his official vehicle (often sold as scrap). He even returned the official laptop. Is he normal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could feel Waziri\u2019s frustrations when he was in office but he never gave up. He believes Nigeria can be changed. I believe so too. But we do not have similar attitudes to public service. His own approach is to try to change things from the inside by being part of government. My own approach is to influence change from the outside without ever being part of government. We need both approaches, but Nigeria needs more Waziris who will roll up their sleeves, get into the kitchen and work their heads off to prepare the recipe that will change Nigeria. There are thousands of Waziris out there. Imagine how great Nigeria can become with the right people at the helms. It is possible!\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nBADAGRY EIGHT\n\nA week ago, while we were all talking about the heart-breaking death of 12-year-old Sylvester Oromoni, a student of the elitist Dowen College, Lagos, something not less tragic happened at Jah-Michael village along Badagry expressway: eight children were found dead in an abandoned car. They were aged between four and 12. Their apparently poor parents said they were asked to pay N100,000 for each body to undergo autopsy, so they decided to bury their wards like that and lick their wounds. Knowing what killed them will not bring them back to life but they can at least come to closure. Lagos state government must step in. The poor are human beings too. Justice.\n\nKILLING FIELDS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, bandits set a bus ablaze in Sokoto state, burning dozens of passengers to death. Poor and lowly Nigerians reduced to ashes because their country could not protect them! On Wednesday, nine worshippers (some said 16) were killed when gunmen invaded their mosque at Mazukaka village in Niger state. Poor and lowly Nigerians mauled in a hail of bullets because Nigeria failed to protect them! These savage acts did not trend in the media because, as we know, they did not fit into the template and do not confirm to the conspiracy theories. However, these are fellow human beings. We must all rise and fight for a safer and more secure country. We are all at risk. Fact.\n\nAPARTHEID OR APATHY?\n\nThere has been a number of complaints about \u201cvaccine apartheid\u201d \u2014 the notion that rich countries are cornering the COVID vaccines while poor countries are lagging behind. The way to go, it is said, is vaccine equity. Rich countries are expected to help the poor ones. It makes sense because COVID infection in any country is a threat to every other country. But the biggest problem in poor countries, if I\u2019m not mistaken, is the vaccine hesitancy. Because of the outstanding success of the anti-vax movement, propelled largely by religious leaders, people are refusing to be vaccinated. Less than 3% of Nigerians are jabbed, so should we really be complaining about vaccine apartheid? Apathy.\n\nNORTHERN BOOM\n\nAre you a northerner? Do you want to make millions ahead of the 2023 presidential poll? I have a business idea for you: form a group. You can even be the only member. Then join the multi-billion naira endorsement industry. With so many southerners eyeing Aso Rock and needing to show that they have support in the north, you can start issuing press statements and organising press conferences to endorse one candidate or the other. This business is moving very fast already. \u201cArewa Union backs Gorimapa for 2023\u201d. \u201cNorthern Youths Endorse Ikeregbe\u201d. And there are loads of naira and dollars on offer. Do not say I have not done something for you this year. Sycophancy.",

I hardly find this level of introspection in Nigerian memoirs and autobiographies. The regular lines are \u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets\u201d. Former public officers often paint a blameless picture of themselves, even when we have facts to the contrary. But whatever Waziri did not do well enough in office, I can say this even at gunpoint: he never soiled his hands. Rather, he gave up personal comfort to serve his fatherland.\n\nAnd herein lies what makes me hopeful for Nigeria: there are thousands of Waziri Adios out there waiting to be tapped \u2014 competent people who have prepared themselves for public service, who have the vision and the values. They want to transform the society. But herein lies what makes me despair at the same time: these people hardly get the opportunity to deliver, either because the system cannot withstand or accommodate their ideals or they do not have \u201cany man\u201d to lift them up in the first place. The saddest part, though, is that decent people have also joined government and lost their way on sighting the ogbono soup on the tables of power. Behold, many have gone rogue!\n\nBack to the traffic lights story. Many people do the wrong thing and seek to justify them by saying everyone else is doing it. The drivers in front of you are running a red light, so why not do same? That is one of the things hampering good governance in Nigeria. People get elected or appointed into public office and start doing unlawful and unethical things because that is what others are doing or did. Also, many public officers are pressured to do the wrong thing because of the circumstances around them: the need to meet a commitment, to be comfortable, to make hay while the sun shines. This compares well with the other road users putting pressure on me to run a red light.\n\nMoreover, Nigeria has gone so bad that what is wrong is now treated as right and what is right is seen as wrong. How can you insult me for obeying traffic lights? Within the 30-second wait, I started feeling like an idiot. Now, imagine somebody going into public office and helping government to save money \u2014 as well as not having his hand in the till. People will question his sanity. At a point, he too will begin to question his own sanity. Waziri was flying economy class before the federal government made it mandatory for agency heads \u201cto cut costs\u201d. At the end of his tenure, he chose not to buy his official vehicle (often sold as scrap). He even returned the official laptop. Is he normal?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI could feel Waziri\u2019s frustrations when he was in office but he never gave up. He believes Nigeria can be changed. I believe so too. But we do not have similar attitudes to public service. His own approach is to try to change things from the inside by being part of government. My own approach is to influence change from the outside without ever being part of government. We need both approaches, but Nigeria needs more Waziris who will roll up their sleeves, get into the kitchen and work their heads off to prepare the recipe that will change Nigeria. There are thousands of Waziris out there. Imagine how great Nigeria can become with the right people at the helms. It is possible!\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nBADAGRY EIGHT\n\nA week ago, while we were all talking about the heart-breaking death of 12-year-old Sylvester Oromoni, a student of the elitist Dowen College, Lagos, something not less tragic happened at Jah-Michael village along Badagry expressway: eight children were found dead in an abandoned car. They were aged between four and 12. Their apparently poor parents said they were asked to pay N100,000 for each body to undergo autopsy, so they decided to bury their wards like that and lick their wounds. Knowing what killed them will not bring them back to life but they can at least come to closure. Lagos state government must step in. The poor are human beings too. Justice.\n\nKILLING FIELDS\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, bandits set a bus ablaze in Sokoto state, burning dozens of passengers to death. Poor and lowly Nigerians reduced to ashes because their country could not protect them! On Wednesday, nine worshippers (some said 16) were killed when gunmen invaded their mosque at Mazukaka village in Niger state. Poor and lowly Nigerians mauled in a hail of bullets because Nigeria failed to protect them! These savage acts did not trend in the media because, as we know, they did not fit into the template and do not confirm to the conspiracy theories. However, these are fellow human beings. We must all rise and fight for a safer and more secure country. We are all at risk. Fact.\n\nAPARTHEID OR APATHY?\n\nThere has been a number of complaints about \u201cvaccine apartheid\u201d \u2014 the notion that rich countries are cornering the COVID vaccines while poor countries are lagging behind. The way to go, it is said, is vaccine equity. Rich countries are expected to help the poor ones. It makes sense because COVID infection in any country is a threat to every other country. But the biggest problem in poor countries, if I\u2019m not mistaken, is the vaccine hesitancy. Because of the outstanding success of the anti-vax movement, propelled largely by religious leaders, people are refusing to be vaccinated. Less than 3% of Nigerians are jabbed, so should we really be complaining about vaccine apartheid? Apathy.\n\nNORTHERN BOOM\n\nAre you a northerner? Do you want to make millions ahead of the 2023 presidential poll? I have a business idea for you: form a group. You can even be the only member. Then join the multi-billion naira endorsement industry. With so many southerners eyeing Aso Rock and needing to show that they have support in the north, you can start issuing press statements and organising press conferences to endorse one candidate or the other. This business is moving very fast already. \u201cArewa Union backs Gorimapa for 2023\u201d. \u201cNorthern Youths Endorse Ikeregbe\u201d. And there are loads of naira and dollars on offer. Do not say I have not done something for you this year. Sycophancy.",

          "text": "Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), on Saturday, unveiled his new book, \u2018The Arc of the Possible\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe event, which was held at the Shehu Musa Yar\u2019 Adua Centre in Abuja, had in attendance Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna \u2014 who was represented by Hadiza Balarabe, his deputy; Yusuf Tuggar, Nigerian ambassador to Germany; Sharon Ikeazor, minister of state for environment; and Oshubham Chaudhuri, World Bank country director for Nigeria.\n\nEl-Rufai described the author as a \u201cshining light\u201d that every public servant should imitate.\n\nKashim Ibrahim-Imam, Muttawali Borno and chief host of the public presentation, said Adio has proven himself to be a worthy public servant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking virtually, Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, former group managing director of Access Bank and founder of Africa Initiative for Governance (AIG), who chaired the book launch, described Adio as \u201can excellent public servant\u201d.\n\n\u201cWaziri, very succinctly, draws attention to the fact that if you have great leaders in public service and those great leaders have the ability to honour those who would work with them, they will break ceilings, we will have great institutions, and Waziri proved during his time at NEITI,\u201d he said.\n\nPresenting a chapter-by-chapter review of the book, Okey Ikechukwu, the book reviewer, said the publication must be studied by all who want to succeed in \u201cNigeria\u2019s terrain\u201d because it contains a valued narrative.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne lesson from this book is the lessons for Nigerians who are called technocrats. This book impacts a lot and should be a manual for all well-meaning Nigerians, social critics, public affairs analysts,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt offers a clear lesson on the need for those who are watching public affairs, sometimes presumptuously, to know that they do not know enough and may not perform well enough when in office.\n\n\u201cThe book shows the reader that it is not luck or holy ghost fire that leads to success for one who wins or who swings against the current, but it is the resilience, determination, and commitment to the right set of values.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe \u2018The Arc of the Possible\u2019 is a testimony or testimonial of someone who has come, engaged, and navigated the dangerous waters, and he is saying to everybody: \u2018it is possible, it can be done, this is how I did it\u2019.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Tuggar said he is \u201cvery impressed\u201d with Adio\u2019s impact during his time at NEITI.\n\n\u201cHad Waziri not changed the approach of NEITI on the impact of policy, maybe the production amendment act may not have been passed,\u201d the ambassador said.\n\nAlso speaking, Chaudhuri commended Adio, noting that the author displayed global best practices when he was in public service.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe single most important ingredient in which nation makes progress, the basic aspiration of making lives better for all citizens, is the quality and the number of individuals who dedicate themselves to the nation and the public service,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event also featured an intergenerational conversation on \u2018The Promise and Perils of Public Service in Nigeria\u2019.\n\nThe panelists included Yewande Sadiku, former executive secretary of the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC); and Joe Abah, country director of DAI and former director-general of the Bureau of Public Service Reforms.\n\nThe conversation was moderated by Samson Itodo, executive director, Yiaga Africa, and convener of the #NotTooYoungToRun movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his remarks, Adio said the book tells the story of his stewardship, challenges, and \u201csometimes the regrets\u201d in NEITI.\n\n\u201cWe do not need people with extraordinary abilities or resolve to move the needle on governance in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nView more photos from the presentation here.",

          "title": "This may be African languages\u2019 best bet against extinction",
          "text": "The novelist Rita Mae Brown once said, \u201cLanguage is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\u201d If this is true, what then does an extinct language mean for its people? It means they have no culture, ancestral value, or true identity. As hyperbolic as this may sound, many languages have already gone extinct and more are predicted to join in the coming years.\n\nMore than 573 languages are extinct. The National Geographic Society says a language dies every two weeks, ceasing to be actively spoken. In Africa alone, at least 52 known languages have experienced either linguicide\u2014the death of a language due to natural or political reasons\u2014or glottophagy, which happens when a smaller language is absorbed in or replaced by a major language.\n\nIn another disturbing report, UNESCO data indicates that if no efforts are made to conserve them, half of the languages currently spoken today will be extinct by the end of the 21st century. How can this be avoided, especially for African languages? Some young Africans living and schooling in America are taking the lead in answering this question through their startup called Mandla, an app that helps people learn African languages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMandla, a Zulu and Xhosa word that means power, is an innovative e-learning language app created for those who seek to strengthen their connection with their African roots. The app combines education with gamification to create an enjoyable and effective experience. With the help of predictive AI, Mandla is able to personalise language lessons for all of its users.\n\nHow it started\n\nDuring the winter break of last year, Wenitte Apiou, a then freshman student of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shared the idea to build Mandla in a text to Boluwaji Odufuwa, another freshman studying Computer Science at Harvard University.\n\nApiou was born in Burkina Faso but moved to America when he was five. Odufuwa, on the other hand, was born in Nigeria but also moved to America in his early childhood. Because of their shared struggle with speaking and understanding their native language, Apiou\u2019s idea organically resonated with Odufuwa, and the duo launched into action.\n\nGrowing up, Apiou\u2019s family only spoke French\u2014Burkina Faso\u2019s official language\u2014and some English in the household. His parents are from two different ethnic groups: his mother speaks M\u00f2or\u00e9, the most spoken indigenous language in Burkina Faso; and his father speaks Kasem, a minority language spoken only by about 100,000 people in southern Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Mandla app\n\n\u201cThe only language I\u2019m fluent in besides English is French, which makes it difficult to communicate with some of my older family members who never went to school and were not able to learn French fluently,\u201d Apiou told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s harder being in the United States as well. The only people that can help would have been my parents, and they did not speak those languages in the house.\u201d\n\nApiou was stuck in-between two foreign languages: French in the house and English everywhere outside the house. This is the reality of many young Africans, especially those who have parents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nEven though the idea had stuck with him since high school, Apiou couldn\u2019t do much because of school work and time barrier. He had some coding skills and had built two apps in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to start building the app and then drop it. So the winter break and the COVID-19 lockdown availed them the time to solve the problem for themselves and millions of young people in America and across the world.\n\nA diverse team building a diverse product\n\nAs the duo built, they realised they needed more diverse hands. After all, Africa has 54 countries and over 3,000 tribes. Building a diverse solution should involve a diverse team, they thought. So they sought more hands.\n\nEmeka Ezike, a sophomore Computer Science student at Harvard University, who also originally came from Nigeria, joined as the CTO. Kwesi Afrifa, born and raised in Ghana and an International student studying Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined to lead the web platform effort. Delanyo Mensah, a sophomore student of Human and Organisational Development at Vanderbilt University, originally from Ghana, joined to lead Mandla\u2019s growth and marketing team.\n\n\u201cWe brought a number of smart young Africans to join in the effort\u2014a few engineers and Delanyo, who\u2019s passionately pushing our growth, especially on TikTok where a bunch of our audience are,\u201d said Apiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\nToday, Mandla has grown into a 10-man core team. The startup also accepts volunteers that can help create learning content around the languages currently on its platform and upcoming ones.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nMandla currently has more than 15 languages including Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba and Igbo; Ghana\u2019s Twi; Ethiopian\u2019s Amharic; and East Africa\u2019s Swahili on its platform. According to Apiou, the plan is to continue adding more languages until they\u2019ve covered a large extent of African cultures.\n\nAs young founders, the natural thing is to find a way to scale on social media, and that\u2019s what the team has done; they are creating captivating content on social media, especially TikTok, which now houses over a billion users.\n\nThe app is currently growing organically and, according to Apiou, has 5,000 registered users, pegged at about 50 signups per day and about three to 400 daily active users.\n\nThe team thinks it\u2019s time to scale their technology and build a more powerful marketing strategy, from organic to paid. But the problem is funding. Apiou said they\u2019ve reached out to hundreds of investors to no avail.\n\nBut why no funding yet?\n\nApiou stated a number of reasons for this. One is \u201cbeing a black college student. In the United States, there aren\u2019t very many people looking to fund someone who has an unproven track record,\u201d he said, agreeing to his lack of experience as a major barrier. \u201cSecond is the domain, edtech. While there is a lot of VC interest in it, it\u2019s relatively new because many people don\u2019t see a path to profitability, or huge billion-dollar success for edtech companies,\u201d Apiou said.\n\nThis statement may not be completely correct, however, as there are a couple of unicorn edtech companies, like Udemy and Coursera, and even Duolingo, which is one of the startup\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe third Apiou raised is about niche: their product focuses on Africa and African languages and culture. He narrated their experience when they went to college pitch competitions. \u201cWe have not won a single pitch competition, despite the fact that\u2014and I mean no disrespect to the other teams\u2014our product has a more natural need and significant traction than some of the teams that beat us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, they have gotten some support from Angel Onuoha, a graduate of Harvard University, ex-Googler, and a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s somewhat popular for his bullish tweets on African tech.\n\nThe team believes that with more funding, they could build more tech stacks, hire more talent, and go full-frontal on their marketing efforts and then compete on a larger scale.\n\nUnlike other language learning apps that are including African languages just to check a diversity-and-inclusion box, Mandla\u2019s mission is deeper than educational or entertainment purposes; it\u2019s really about cultural preservation.\n\n\u201cAnd what better way to preserve a culture than to preserve its language?\u201d Apiou asked with the signatory laughter he had kept throughout the call.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "CinetPay, an Ivory Coast-based startup that enables merchants in francophone Africa to accept and make electronic payments online or via mobile Point of Sale (PoS) devices, on Wednesday said it has raised $2.4 million seed funding.\n\n4DX Ventures, a pan-African venture capital fund and Nigeria-based unicorn startup, Flutterwave are co-investors in the round.\n\nOn CinetPay\u2019s mobile and web-based platform, businesses can sign up to process payments from over 130 different payment operators\u2014including MTN mobile money, M-Pesa, Orange Money, Visa, Mastercard, etc\u2014via a single interface.\n\nCinetPay thus simplifies the process of accepting payments, eliminating the need for merchants to integrate with different systems for managing sales and revenues. Its solution, which can be integrated into merchant websites, is used by a wide array of businesses, from e-commerce platforms to digital public services, insurance companies, and schools.\n\nFounded by Idriss Monthe and Daniel Dindji in 2016, CinetPay claims to have processed over 30 million transactions for 350 active merchants in nine countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Guinea.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe seed investment is expected to boost CinetPay\u2019s sales and marketing efforts in the countries it operates across West and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched firsthand as thousands of merchants waste crucial time, even up to 6 months, getting their payment systems in order,\u201d CinetPay CEO and co-founder, Monthe, said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the resources to market and sell our solution across the region.\u201d\n\nFor Flutterwave, backing CinetPay\u2014a startup it\u2019s partnered with since 2019\u2014marks the unicorn\u2019s first direct investment in the francophone Africa region. According to Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave\u2019s founder and CEO, both startups have a \u201cshared vision to simplify payments on the continent.\u201d\n\nAll over Africa, the mobile money market is booming with West Africa being one of the fastest-growing regions in the continent. In Ivory Coast, CinetPay\u2019s first market, up to 75% of the population owns a mobile money account whereas less than 25% have a bank account.\n\nSimilarly, up to 80% of the population in the French-speaking African region have a mobile money account and less than 20% bank accounts.\n\nCinetPay\u2019s gateway aggregates all payment options available in the region, enabling merchants, through digital accounts, to accept online payments and reduce the reliance on cash.\n\nWalter Baddoo, co-founder and General Partner at 4DX Ventures reveals that the VC firm has been \u201ctracking the francophone Africa market\u201d for some time now and is impressed by CinetPay\u2019s ambitious goal to digitise payments across the region. The company is an investor in Flutterwave as well.\n\n\u201cFor a first institutional investment, we couldn\u2019t have asked for two better partners in 4DX Ventures and Flutterwave,\u201d Monthe said. \u201cWe\u2019ve selected highly strategic partners as investors and are excited about the immediate next steps we take together in terms of simplifying and improving digital payments in francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider with a presence in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is set to be acquired for $320 million by American multinational Equinix Inc., the US company said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe all-cash transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFounded by Funke Opeke in 2010, MainOne is a key provider of enterprise connectivity solutions, with an estimated 800+ business-to-business customers. These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong before tech startups democratised investing in the stock market, anyone looking to invest in the stock market needed a significant amount of money. But that changed with the entrance of startups like Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka.\n\nFor the first time, Nigerians could buy stocks with as little as $10 (\u20a65,000). Although most stocks available are of foreign companies, that innovation provided Nigerians with a way to invest small sums of money.\n\nSimilarly, Airbnb upended the hospitality industry when it made it possible for individuals to rent out their homes. In the process, it allowed people to get a slice of the pie that is the hospitality industry.\n\nHelping Africans to own commercial real estate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some ways, owning a property is the Nigerian dream. However, the absence of suitable mortgage or financing options means one would require a considerable upfront investment to live their dream. With only 2% of Nigerians reportedly having up to \u20a6500,000 ($870) in bank deposits, owning a property is out of reach for most people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFractional investment startup, Enterprise Hotel, hopes to change this by offering Africans the opportunity to invest in commercial real estate with as little as \u20a630,000 ($52).\n\nLike the model used by investment tech startups, individuals can now own properties with minimal investments. The startup offers three product classes, the first being the room sale. Under this arrangement, individuals can outrightly purchase a room.\n\nThe block sale is the second level, and for this, Enterprise Hotel divides a room into ten blocks, allowing people to purchase each block. So, if the price for a room has been set at \u20a630 million, for instance, a block would cost \u20a63 million.\n\nThe unit sale is the last unit, and with this, Enterprise Hotel divides the room into a thousand parts. Consequently, it becomes easy for more people to purchase real estate regardless of their income levels.\n\nHow Enterprise Hotel makes money\n\nEnterprise Hotel makes money in two ways. The first is via the sale of the rooms and the second is through a management fee paid by the investors. With the management fee, Enterprise Hotel covers management costs, including recruitment on behalf of the investors.\n\nSo why real estate? Uche Ajaere is the co-founder and CEO of Enterprise Hotel. You may recognise the surname, and that\u2019s because he\u2019s a director of GIG Group.\n\nWhile the GIG Group is popularly known for the transport company, GIGM, it also has investments in other industries, including real estate. For over eight years, Uche has been involved in the operations of the real estate division. Simultaneously, he has kept an eye on developments in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nHis time working in real estate showed him that only a handful of people could afford to buy or own real estate. In Lekki, Lagos State, a four-bedroom duplex costs about \u20a6100 million ($173,913). This is out of the reach of most Nigerians who earn less than \u20a6150,000 ($300) annually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, he decided on a startup that gives people a chance to own real estate regardless of how much they have.\n\nChallenges and competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s startup space has been in fintech, with a handful of other industries represented. The real estate sector has seen very little innovation, with startups like Spleet and Muster attempting to solve the issue of rent for Nigerians.\n\nOne reason for this is that technology does not entirely solve the problems in real estate. At best, it only aids processes. Unlike other sectors, the barrier to entry in real estate is high. In addition, it could take as much as 15 years for investors to see a return on their investments. Consequently, it is not surprising that there is less investment going into real estate compared to other industries.\n\n\u201cPeople within the technology space will always think, \u2018how affordable is it to get this product? And how fast am I going to make my profit?\u2019\n\n\u201cWith the promise of higher returns in other industries, why would anyone want to invest in real estate,\u201d Uche asks.\n\nThis high entry barrier is what Enterprise Hotel is working to eliminate. If, for example, a room in an Enterprise Hotel is going for \u20a630 million ($52,173), when it is split into 1,000 units, that amounts to about \u20a630,000 ($60), which is a lot more affordable for most Nigerians.\n\nIn addition to affordability, Enterprise Hotel says it offers investors an opportunity to get a return on their investment within two to four years. That\u2019s impressive because it takes about 15 to 20 years for most real estate acquisitions to return the initial capital outlay.\n\nEnterprise Hotel provides its investors with several ways to earn. The primary route is through hotel bookings. However, that is not all, as investors can make money from every activity that takes place in the rooms they own as well as other services offered in the hotel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, for example, if a guest eats, drinks, or pays for dry cleaning services in the room, the investors also earn a cut of the earnings.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. One of the reasons many Nigerians buy land is that it often increases in value. Uche reveals that investments done through Enterprise Hotel would be evaluated with the value reflected on the app. Investors can also sell their properties, although Enterprise Hotel would require that they be given the right of first refusal on any property.\n\nAlready, Enterprise Hotel has properties in Lagos, Abuja, Benin, and Port Harcourt, with plans to add more across Nigeria. Uche reveals that the goal is to have an Enterprise Hotel in every major city in the world.\n\nFor Enterprise Hotel, building in a sector with little or no examples to follow could be tough. While there are startups currently offering fractional investment services in Nigeria, the majority are in the financial services space. Yet, a lot can be learnt from their success.\n\nAlthough Enterprise Hotel\u2019s model could see them offer real estate investment for as little as \u20a630,000 ($60), that is still a significant investment for most Nigerians. While the ability to invest small amounts is attractive, the reality is that the returns earned on such investments would be small, and this could discourage potential users. Therefore, it may be that the key to Enterprise Hotel\u2019s success lies in serving a market with higher disposable income.\n\nAttracting investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a startup like Enterprise Hotel requires enormous investments. So far, Enterprise Hotel has run without institutional investment. Uche discloses that while they are open to receiving investments, at the moment, the focus is on building significant traction before approaching investors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just selling an app like other startups. We want to make sure that in the next few months when we\u2019re talking to investors, we\u2019ll be talking based on value. We want to show them the first set of hotels that we have built and investors who\u2019ve bought into them and are already making money. Then we can start talking to investors.\u201d\n\nAside from helping more people gain access to real estate investments, Enterprise Hotel indirectly solves another problem. Uche reveals that users can use it as collateral when applying for loans since they own the properties outrightly.\n\nIn Nigeria, where Enterprise Hotel operates, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals outside their preferred high net worth group. And in cases where they are willing to do so, they require collateral. Enterprise Hotel offers users a way out. They can now invest in real estate while using the assets as collateral.\n\nBuilding a business of any sort is challenging. For Enterprise Hotel, operating in the real estate industry with its high financial requirements poses a significant hurdle. However, the success of startups like Bamboo and Risevest suggest that Enterprise Hotel might be onto something.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For me, his name comes to mind whenever I hear or say the words fintech or finance.\n\nFor real? Oh yeah, Olowe has a wealth of experience in finance. He was an early advisor to Wallets Africa, used to be on the TeamApt board, and has spent over a decade in traditional finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Olowe did not study anything finance-related. His first and Master\u2019s degrees were in engineering.\n\nBut despite having an academic background devoid of finance, Olowe thrived in the space. From building an intranet platform at Standard Trust Bank to his data analytics system at Access Bank, he quickly became a force.\n\nHowever, the open banking system is arguably one of his most significant achievements. The system helps fintechs integrate with banks seamlessly, reducing a process that should have taken months to a day.\n\nBut what exactly is open banking, and how did one man get the Central Bank of Nigeria and every commercial bank in the country to \u201clike the idea.\u201d\n\nWell, Olowe took the first step and was surprised by the outcome.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole had a chat with the finance expert, and he dished about his career, life, and the open banking system.\n\nRead: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nAnd the nominees are\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the biggest tech event in West Africa \u2014 Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, we\u2019ve got news for you.\n\nNominees for Techpoint Awards (Nigerian edition) are out!

          "title": "Road to super app? GIGM adds e-wallet, bill payment features",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based mobility giant, GIGM, has launched a payment service for its users. This is the first of many services that the company intends to offer as it moves towards being a one-stop-shop for the needs of its customers.\n\nIn September 2019, the company revealed a slight name change, replacing \u2018Motors\u2019 with \u2018Mobility\u2019 as it looked to expand its offerings. Two years after that, it says it is redefining mobility to mean access rather than just movement.\n\nOver a chat with Techpoint Africa, Okhae Enahoro, the company\u2019s new CEO, said, \u201cWhen you look at the word mobility, it means the ability to move freely. Movement in itself may not necessarily mean physically transporting yourself from one place to another.\n\n\u201cIt just basically means advancement. It can mean growth. So when you look at these definitions, you realise that we\u2019re trying to enable lifestyles, so we want to bring services to people that allow them to do things easily.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, this service will only be available in Nigeria \u2014 GIGM\u2019s headquarters \u2014 and will allow users to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and Internet data. However, there are plans to launch in other African countries over the next few years.\n\nThe beginnings of a super app?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGozem riders (\u201cChampions\u201d). Source: Supplied\n\nThe super app model has gained popularity in emerging economies following the successes of WeChat and Alipay in China. Several startups have sprung up, especially in Asia, to replicate the model.\n\nIn Africa, Opay, Gozem, Safeboda, and Gokada have positioned themselves as super apps with varying degrees of success, and this latest feature could see GIGM becoming the newest entrant in this space.\n\nTypically, super apps start by offering a core service through which they get a foothold and can provide an array of services to the customer.\n\nThis service could be food delivery, transportation, or payments. For GIGM, this could be building on its tech-enabled transportation platform to offer payment services to its users.\n\nHowever, because its services are mainly for long-distance travel, the company would have to include more services than it currently offers to gain more customers.\n\nA look at its mobile app would provide some insight into how this could work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the GIGM app\n\nOne of the options on the app is called Danfo, named after the famous yellow buses in Lagos State. Tapping on it would redirect you to the app store to download the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanfo is the company\u2019s bus-hailing platform that allows users to book intra-city rides. Although the service is not yet live, it provides insights into the company plans and could see it come up against Shuttlers and Treepz.\n\nLite from GIGM is another offering that will enable the company to onboard new users. Nigeria\u2019s fragmented transportation services mean that users cannot travel comfortably over short distances.\n\nWith Lite, the company plans to provide users with the ability to make short journeys outside a city that would ordinarily not be undertaken by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Bolt.\n\nEven with these offerings, ride-hailing could be the fastest way to attract many users and see it come up against Uber and Bolt.\n\nWith the large war chest available to these two startups in the form of venture capital, it would be a considerable challenge for the company. However, if there is any local player capable of pulling this off, it is GIGM.\n\nIn recent years, the company has focused on developing its technology offerings, deploying data across the business. Its understanding of the local business terrain gained over 20 years of operation gives it an advantage that other local companies lack.\n\nFor super apps to thrive, they must have a robust and frequent core use case, a good payment system, and relevant services close to the core use case.\n\nWith its position as a leading transportation service provider and the addition of a payment option, the company looks to be on the right path. However, the new services it offers could play a role in its success or failure.\n\nNigeria\u2019s low smartphone and Internet penetration also mean that more people would be using the Internet or smartphones for the first time every year. Providing these groups with relevant services could hold the key to success.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "More pain for Nigerian states as FAAC shrinks by N68bn in November",
          "text": "More pain for Nigerian states as FAAC shrinks by N68bn in November\n\nThe ability of Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their various obligations is under more risk as gross monthly distribution by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) to the three tiers of government dropped by N68billion in November.\n\nFAAC allocation to the three tiers of government and public agencies amounted to N671.9bn ($1.62bn) in November (from October revenue), a decrease of 9.2 percent from the previous payout.\n\nData by Coronation Merchant Bank shows that the 9.2 percent decline in November FAAC was due to the decrease in the revenue from companies\u2019 income tax (CIT), petroleum profit tax (PPT), value-added tax (VAT), oil and gas royalties. Only excise duty recorded an increase over the previous month.\n\nThis means various state governments already impacted by low internal revenue may find it difficult to pay government workers or meet electorate promises without enough remittance from NNPC which form a large chunk of revenues shared at the FAAC meetings in Abuja.\n\nBreak down of the report by Coronation revealed that the FGN received a total of N284.3billion, state governments received N209.8billion, including N21.5billion representing the 13 percent derivation for the few oil-producing states and LGCs received N156.3billion.\n\nThe continuous decline in Nigeria\u2019s FAAC allocation to the three tiers of government is also due to the subsidy payment, according to market analysts.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has been deducting from its remittance to FAAC, a threat to the ability of many Nigerian states and other tiers of government to meet their financial obligations.\n\n\u201cSince June \u201921, the corporation has deducted a total of N939bn from its FAAC remittance. It disclosed that it would deduct its October \u201821 value shortfall of N199bn from its November \u201821 proceeds,\u201d Chinwe Egwim, Chief Economist, Coronation, said.\n\nThe continuous payment of subsidy on petroleum products is likely to reduce the amount the government allocates to states and local governments as well as increase public debt, according to the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG).\n\nThe private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group said if the federal government continues to pay the subsidy on refined petroleum products; it could push Nigeria into a debt extension by the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cIncessant payment of subsidy on refined petroleum products would narrow FAAC allocations and widen the country\u2019s budget deficit. If this continues, the action could push Nigeria into a Debt Overhang\u201d by the end of 2021,\u201d the Lagos-based non-profit organization said.\n\nWhile Nigeria continues to channel huge resources to funding petrol subsidies, the country largely depends on borrowing to finance its capital and recurrent expenditure annually.\n\nNigeria\u2019s widening budget deficit has pushed the country\u2019s debt profile to jump 81 percent in four years to N35.465 trillion as of June 2021 from N19.636 trillion in 2017.\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Debt Management Office (DMO) says Nigeria\u2019s total public debt amounted to N35.47 trillion (about 86.5 million dollars).\n\nWhile crude oil prices rose by nearly 45 percent from January\u2019s price of $54.77 per barrel to $84.02 in November, Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy costs have risen 10 times faster at 488 percent, wiping out the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nThe Federal Government spent an estimated N149.28 billion subsidizing petrol in August, an increase of 488 percent compared with the N25.37 billion spent in January.\n\n\u201cThe federal government reluctant to regulate the downstream sector or even try to reduce the price of petrol has reflected market reality that has continued to be on the deficit on government revenue because the amount they need to subsidize PMS has continued to rise,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, Associate Investment Research in United Capital, said.\n\nAccording to Abdulazeez Kuranga, economist, Cordros Securities, the issue of subsidy payment was not in the budget when it was presented by the minister of finance, which means NNPC will continue to deduct the subsidy, and it will affect what NNPC will be remitting to FAAC, which in turn will limit what will be remitted to the government.\n\nWhile Nigeria has, for years, depended on borrowing to fund its revenue shortage, the World Bank says implementation of tax reforms, rationalization of generous concessions, expenditure can help the cash-strapped country raise as much as N10 trillion.\n\n\u201cIn the next three years, such measures can raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to about 7 percent and bring in as much as N10 trillion,\u201d the Washington-based lender said.",

          "text": "IHS, the largest tower company in Africa, may lose an eight-year-old N380 billion contract after MTN Nigeria required the deal to be denominated in the local currency, the naira.\n\nIHS controls many MTN Group tower assets in different parts of Africa including Nigeria. In 2014, IHS acquired 4,154 towers from MTN Nigeria and a further 4,696 towers in 2015. The transaction value of the deal was $52 billion.\n\nThe contract, which followed the acquisition of over 9,000 towers belonging to MTN in 2014, was denominated in dollars, but the recent depreciation of the naira and the acute dollar shortage in Nigeria are compelling MTN to force a change in the way the contract with IHS is priced. The tower service contract is arguably MTN\u2019s largest single-cost item.\n\nRead also: IHS buys MTN\u2019s towers, becomes largest asset owner in SA\n\nWhen the contract was first agreed almost 10 years ago, N160.37 fetched one US dollar on the official market but today MTN would require nearly three times as much in the local currency to buy one dollar where it is available. In the same way, the dollar value of MTN\u2019s annual revenues has fallen by the margin of naira\u2019s devaluation since 2014.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that MTN has told IHS in unclear terms that it could consider terminating the contract if an agreement on the dispute cannot be reached quickly.\n\nIHS recently went public on the New York Stock Exchange, which saw its valuation hit over $5 billion. The 9,000 towers from MTN Nigeria are more than 50 percent of IHS\u2019 tower assets in Nigeria at 16,522 towers. As of June 30, 2021, IHS operated 30,207 towers across five countries in Africa, three countries in Latin America, and one country in the Middle East.\n\nBusinessDay reached out to IHS for comments but a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the deal.\n\nOlusola Teniola, former president, Association of Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ATCON), says while it is within the rights of parties in an agreement to seek to renegotiate a contract, there are also clauses to respect. In the case of MTN Nigeria and IHS, the contract is long-term and it is one that is often renewed after a duration of 10 years. Teniola says he is confident both parties would resolve the challenge.\n\nMTN holds 85,176,719 ordinary shares of IHS Towers, representing about 20 percent of the tower company, as a result of the IPO.",

          "title": "Airline row: Air Peace accuses UAE of spreading falsehood in letter to Nigerian govt",
          "text": "West Africa\u2019s leading airline, Air Peace has described the claim by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) that it operates from another airport other than Sharjah International Airport as falsehood calculated to damage on its brand.\n\nThe airline which said this in a letter it issued to the Ministry of Aviation and addressed to Senator Hadi Sirika, the minister on Saturday, said it takes very serious exception to that letter.\n\nAir Peace said it believes that the Minister and the Chairman of the Board of UAE\u2019s General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) may have been misinformed of the true position of the issues in discourse as no one in such an exalted position and office would deliberately push out such untrue statement.\n\nAir Peace said that contrary to what the GCAA claims in its letter, it never ceased operating from Sharjah International Airport since it started in July 2019. It said it only stopped when every other airline was forced to stop normal scheduled flight operations as a result of the Covid-19 lockdowns that permitted only evacuation flights.\n\n\u201cWe did several evacuation flights out of Sharjah. So, we never left Sharjah Airport nor did we at any time \u201cshifted\u201d and operated out of DXB (Dubai Airport). The letter deliberately painted us as unserious while at the same time, suggesting that we look for other airports in the country to operate from,\u201d Air Peace said.\n\n\u201cAfter the restriction of scheduled flight operations between UAE and Nigeria was lifted towards the last week in November 2021, we approached the Sharjah Airport and GCAA with a request to allow us to operate a charter into the UAE on December 01, 2021.\n\n\u201cTo our surprise and, despite the lifting of the ban on flight operations between both countries, they refused. They said they would not allow charter but scheduled flight operations.\n\n\u201cHowever, we then, in obedience to their demand, announced resumption of scheduled operations beginning from that date and we opened our sales to the public.\u201d\n\nAccording to Air Peace, three days to departure, the GCAA was yet to approve flights and came back 48hours to deny them of slots to operate flights. They were later told that Air Peace would only be accepted if only it brought a small aircraft.\n\n\u201cOn our request to continue with the scheduled operations after this present flight, we were turned down using lack of slot as excuse. Meanwhile, Emirates had started operating three flights daily into Nigeria while Air Peace was totally turned down!\u201d\n\nAir Peace said the one slot was only given to them after the NCAA had made threats to withdraw Emirates Airlines ministerial approval.\n\n\u201cThen, at your threat of going to stop them if Air Peace was not allowed a meagre three flights weekly, THEY QUICKLY DID THE UNTHINKABLE. THEY GAVE US ONE FLIGHT ONLY PER WEEK! They also added that it must be operated only on Thursdays at a time that they chose themselves,\u201d the airline said.\n\nWhile reiterating that at no time did it stop operating in Sharjah and moved to Dubai airport, Air Peace has demanded a retraction an unreserved apology from the GCAA.\n\n\u201cTo this end therefore and, for the fact that this falsehood contained in the said letter has painted us in bad light and gone viral, even though the UAE Minister of Economy may have been misinformed by his aides, we, still, and humbly demand a retraction of the offending accusation of \u201cstopping, shifting and returning\u201d and an unreserved apology tendered to Air Peace,\u201d it added.\n\nRecall that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Minister of Economy, Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri, had in a letter to Sirika dated December 10, defended its decision to reduce flight schedule of Air Peace from three to one, saying it is unreasonable for the country to retain the airline\u2019s slots at the Sharjah International Airport.\n\nAl Marri, who doubles as the chairman of the General Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE, had in the letter described as unjust, the decision of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority to withdraw its approval for Emirates Airline winter schedule, cutting down the carrier\u2019s daily passenger flights from 21 to just once a week.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cThe General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) presents its compliments to the Federal Ministry of Aviation (FMA) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and has the honour to refer to the letter Ref. No. NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/329 dated 9th December 2021, whereby the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) notified the Country Manager, Emirates Airline (EK) in Nigeria regarding the withdrawal of the ministerial approval granted to that airline with respect to their Winter Schedule. The NCAA further advised EK that this withdrawal becomes effective on Sunday 12th December 2021 at 2300Z and hence, EK \u201cis granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA has the honour to highlight that such a decision by the NCAA is totally unjustified especially, as it has come to our attention that their action is being taken against the background of Air Peace not securing all 3 slots at Sharjah Airport which they desire. (Air Peace initially operated at Sharjah Airport, shifted to Dubai Airport and then returned to Sharjah airport. It would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport.) In this regard, we wish to kindly advise you. that Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140% slot capacity, but with goodwill and tremendous effort on their Side, this Airport was able to accommodate Air Peace with 1 of the 3 slots that this airline requested.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA wishes to stress that the action being taken by the NCAA is obviously not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two Nations.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) Minister of Economy, Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri, has justified the decision of his country to reduce flight schedule of Nigeria\u2019s leading airline, Air Peace from three to one, saying it is unreasonable for the country to retain Air Peace slots at the Sharjah International Airport.\n\nAl Marri, who doubles as the chairman of the General Civil Aviation Authority in the UAE, in a letter penned on December 10, 2021, and addressed to the Nigerian Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, described as unjust, the decision of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority to withdraw its approval for Emirates Airline winter schedule, cutting down the carrier\u2019s daily passenger flights from 21 to just once a week.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cThe General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) presents its compliments to the Federal Ministry of Aviation (FMA) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and has the honour to refer to the letter Ref. No. NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/329 dated 9th December 2021, whereby the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) notified the Country Manager, Emirates Airline (EK) in Nigeria regarding the withdrawal of the ministerial approval granted to that airline with respect to their Winter Schedule. The NCAA further advised EK that this withdrawal becomes effective on Sunday 12th December 2021 at 2300Z and hence, EK \u201cis granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA has the honour to highlight that such a decision by the NCAA is totally unjustified especially, as it has come to our attention that their action is being taken against the background of Air Peace not securing all 3 slots at Sharjah Airport which they desire. (Air Peace initially operated at Sharjah Airport, shifted to Dubai Airport and then returned to Sharjah airport. It would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport.) In this regard, we wish to kindly advise you. that Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140% slot capacity, but with goodwill and tremendous effort on their Side, this Airport was able to accommodate Air Peace with 1 of the 3 slots that this airline requested.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA wishes to stress that the action being taken by the NCAA is obviously not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two Nations. As we are both aware, the relations between our two brotherly countries are vintage in nature, one hallmark being the recent visit of the President of Nigeria to the UAE, which certainly mirrored the status of these positive relations.\n\n\u201cFinally, we suggest that Air Peace should consider flying their two other flights to any UAE airport at which there are available slots. As expected, the GCAA will support Air Peace in this activity, where required.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, your kind support is anticipated so that the NCAA reviews their decision and restores the approval of the Emirates Airline Winter Schedule, as filed. In this regard, we wish to reiterate that this is a purely operational matter between Air Peace and Sharjah Airport and in any case it should have absolutely no implications for Emirates Airline.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Government had on Thursday, in a letter through the NCAA Director-General, Musa Nuhu, whittled the daily flights of Emirates Airlines to just one per week.\n\nNigeria had about a week ago lifted the ban on Emirates Airline\u2019s flights to Nigeria after suspending the carrier from operating into Nigeria for several months earlier, due to concerns over UAE carrier\u2019s requirements in the management of COVID-19.\n\nNuhu had stated that following the lifting of the ban, the UAE-based airline applied to the Federal Ministry of Aviation for approval of its winter flight schedule, consisting of 21 weekly passenger flight frequencies to Nigeria, noting that Nigeria approved the schedule in the spirit and intent of the Bilateral Air Services Agreement between both countries.\n\nHe, however, expressed dissatisfaction that Air Peace Airlines, the only Nigerian airline that operates passenger flights to Sharjah International Airport in UAE, requested three weekly passenger flight frequencies but was granted only one weekly passenger flight frequency.\n\nThe action of UAE authorities prompted the decision to also whittle down Emirates flight into the country to one per week, a move that was hailed by industry stakeholders.\n\nNuhu explained to aviation correspondents in Lagos on Friday that the government decided to respond to the way UAE treated Air Peace, saying that it is the responsibility of government to protect Nigerian businesses.\n\nBut in reaction to Nigeria government\u2019s decision, Emirates Airlines announced that it is suspending operations to the country till further notice.\n\nEmirates on its website yesterday announced that it would suspend its flights to Nigeria from December 13, 2021 until the two countries reach an amicable resolution on the matter.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWith the recently imposed directive limiting Emirates to operate one flight per week to Nigeria via Abuja, Emirates will be suspending its flights between Nigeria and Dubai from 13 December 2021, until the UAE and Nigerian authorities work on a solution to the ongoing issue.\n\n\u201cThe last flights to operate on 12 December 2021are EK 783/784 to/from Lagos and EK 785/786 to/from Abuja.\n\n\u201cCustomers holding tickets with the final destinations Lagos and Abuja will not be accepted at the point of origin,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe airline also said that affected customers do not need to call Emirates immediately for rebooking, adding that customers can simply hold on to their Emirates ticket and when flights resume, get in touch with their travel agent or booking office to make new travel plans and expressed regrets what this may have caused its customers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEmirates is committed to its operations in Nigeria, and we stand ready to reinstate services once restrictions are lifted by the Nigerian authorities, ensuring travellers have more choice and access to trade and tourism opportunities in Dubai, and beyond to our network of over 120 destinations,\u201d the airline added.\n\nCurrently, over 25 foreign airlines operate flights into Nigeria; some daily, from multiple destinations.

          "text": "The last may not have been heard about the gruesome assassination of a former Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Chief Bola Ige, who was killed by gunmen at his Ibadan home on December 23, 2001, as fresh narrative by his ally and former interim national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, has alleged that the Federal Government led by former President Olusegun Obasanjo was complicit in the murder.\n\nChief Akande, a former governor of Osun State, in his autobiography \u2013 My Participations \u2013 which was launched in Lagos on Thursday, revealed that some elements within the then Obasanjo-led government met and resolved to kill Ige for selfish political gains.\n\nHe recalled in the book that the late Chief Ige\u2019s ordeals started when Chief Obasanjo came on official visit to Oyo State when Lam Adesina was the governor of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cObasanjo came on an official visit to Oyo State and I was there to give solidarity to my colleague, Governor Lam Adesina. He also gave me solidarity when the President visited Osun State. As the presidential entourage was being ferried from the airport, there were not enough official cars. Ige had to drive in Chief Michael Koleoso\u2019s car. Koleoso, who had served with us in old Oyo State, was now the Secretary to the State Government. Koleoso\u2019s car was not an official car and so it was not allowed to join presidential and governorship convoys.\n\n\u2018\u2019Adesina drove with the president while I was in my own official car and we drove into the Liberty Stadium together. By the time Koleoso\u2019s car came, the president and the governors and the official delegation had taken position in the state box. The gate had been closed and both Koleoso and Uncle Bola had to use the pedestrian gate. As soon as Uncle Bola entered and the public recognised his famous face, the stadium erupted into the chant of \u201cIge!! Ige!!! Ige!!!\u201d Everyone stood up including those of us in the state box as if on cue.\n\n\u201cThe cheering never stopped until Uncle Bola joined us at the state box. It was a defining moment authenticating Bola Ige\u2019s enduring romance with the people and magic of his presence.\n\n\u201cI saw Dr. Jerry Gana, Obasanjo\u2019s Minister of Information making jest of Chief Sunday Afolabi and other Yoruba leaders of the PDP. It was clear who was in control of politics in Yorubaland and that certainly, it was not Obasanjo and his troops. I believe it was after that outing that some element closed to the president met and decided to deal with Bola Ige. The next time Obasanjo would enter that stadium was to participate in the burial ceremonies of Ige. I believed the leader was silenced because he was deemed to be too popular with the people.\n\n\u201cUncle Bola\u2019s main ambition in his last days was to resign from Obasanjo\u2019s government and come to help us reorganise Afenifere.\u201d\n\nAkande added that, \u201cThere was enough evidence that the government of President Obasanjo reluctant to find the killers of Bola Ige.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, his summon to Abuja to meet with Chief Obasanjo and the involvement of a former Osun State deputy governor, Iyiola Omisore, in the wake of the assassination was a fundamental poser that the government was bent on sweeping the murder of the attorney-general under the carpet.\n\n\u201cWhen I was about to board the aircraft on my return trip back to Ibadan, I saw Omisore. The jet had gone ahead to bring Omisore to Ibadan. What they told him I did not know. So why try to bring us together for a chat? All this created suspicion in my mind that cover-up was actively in the offing. That was why I came to the conclusion that the Federal Government was complicit in the assassination of Uncle Bola Ige,\u2019\u2019 he buttressed.\n\nLamenting his relationship with his former deputy, Omisore, he said the politician crept into his life like a silent malignant cancer.\n\nAkande, in the autobiography said: \u201cIyiola Omisore crept into my life like a silent malignant cancer. He came in full force. In a few months, I thought I knew him. I regret I did not know him in his true colours.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since Omisore was introduced to him by Yekini, popularly known as Bisi Adedotun, he started visiting him regularly in Lagos and Ila Orangun and \u201ccalling me Baba, while I called him Iyiola.\n\n\u201cEvery place in my home, including my bedrooms, was made accessible to him even though I did not bother to know his house or wherever he might have been coming from. I very much admired Yekini and by intuition, I merely transferred the same admiration to Iyiola Omisore.\u201d\n\nAkande explained that at the initial time, he did not want to use Omisore for his running mate but that pressure mounted on him to use him.\n\nAccording to him, Omisore\u2019s closeness to the Abacha regime made matters of trust difficult, but that he had to settle for him after all.\n\nAkande said the Alliance for Democracy (AD) later won the election in Osun in January 1999.\n\n\u201dIt was part of my immediate problems after the election that Sola Akinwunmi who seemed to have had a very soft and kind disposition for Omisore began to alert me about Omisore\u2019s disloyalty. They were earlier close friends because Akinwunmi, as an article of faith, wanted me to become the governor of Osun State at all cost.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dHe entered into friendship with whosoever shared that faith with him. Sooner after our election, Sola Akinwunmi, as the then secretary to the party, was disappointed at Iyiola\u2019s attitudes towards me,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande noted that Omisore was reported to have been withdrawing some party funds from Sola Akinwunmi, using his name without his authority.\n\n\u201cHe would go to the party secretariat and use my name to collect money, sometimes, N100,000. On one occasion, Ayo Opadokun lost his father in Offa, Kwara State and we thought we should honour him. I said I would visit him. I funded a gift from my own pocket for my visit to Opadokun in Offa.\n\n\u201dThen, one Omisore\u2019s messenger came and met with Opadokun. He whispered to me that his boss sent him to give money to Opadokun and also give him N50,000 on my behalf. I told the emissary not to worry about mine because I had already seen Opadokun. It was later I learnt that Omisore took money on my purported authority from the party secretariat for the simple act of condolence,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn another occasion, he added that Omisore was said to be collaborating with the Commissioner of Police to impose ADC of his choice on him, but the plan was exposed and thwarted.\n\nAkande also in the book reminisced that when Peugeot 504 cars were being given to every governor-elect by the then military authorities as take-off transport needs to the governor before inauguration, Omisore was said to have used his name without his authority to collect the four cars from the then Osun State Secretary to the Government, Elder Femi Adefowokan.\n\n\u201dHe sent one to me and appropriated three to himself. I then requested for the other three cars. After a while, he claimed one was snatched by robbers on the way to Cotonou in Benin Republic and that another had a serious accident.

          "text": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE), has written the federal government of Nigeria why a Nigerian carrier, Air Peace, lost its flight frequency slot at Sharja airport.\n\nIn a letter dated December 10 and addressed to the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika and signed by Abdulla Bin Touq Al Mari, Minister of Economy and Chairman of the UAE\u2019s General Civil Aviation Authority, the Arabian country said Air Peace, initially operated at Sharjah Airport, and shifted to Dubai Airport and then returned to Sharjah Airport, saying the airport authorities could not keep their slots after the airline left.\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) withdrew the ministerial approval granted Emirates Airlines by the Ministry of Aviation following the refusal of GCAA to grant equal rights to the sole Nigerian carrier, Air Peace flying to Dubai via Sharjah.\n\nHowever, on Friday, Emirates also announced the suspension of operations between Nigeria and Dubai until both countries resolved the fresh diplomatic row.\n\nIn a travel notice on its website on Friday evening, the United Arab Emirates flag carrier said the suspension would start on Monday until when Nigeria and the Arab nation resolve the ongoing issue.\n\nBut, UAE said the action taken by the NCAA regarding the Air Peace\u2019s approval at Sharjah was unjustifiable and not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two nations.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport.\n\n\u201cThe General Civil Aviation Authority of the United Arab Emirates presents its compliments to the Federal Ministry of Aviation of Nigeria and has the honour to refer to the letter Ref. No. NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/329 dated 9th December of 20921, whereby Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) notified the country manager, Emirates Airline (EK) in Nigeria, regarding the withdrawal of the ministerial approval granted to that airline with respect to their winter schedule.\n\n\u201cThe NCAA further advised EK that its withdrawal become effective on Sunday 12, 2021, and hence EK is granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays.\n\n\u201cThe GCAA has the honour to highlight that such a decision by the NCAA is totally unjustified especially, at it has come to our attention that their action is being taken against the background of Air Peace not securing all 3 slots at Sharjah Airport which they desire.\n\n\u201cAir Peace initially operated at Sharjah Airport, shifted to Dubai Airport, and then returned to Sharjah Airport. It would be unreasonable for an airline to expect any airport to maintain their slots when they ceased operating at that airport.\u201d\n\nThe UAE aviation authorities further said Sharjah Airport was currently operating at 140 per cent slot capacity \u2014 and that the country had made goodwill by accommodating Air Peace with one slot of the three requested.\n\nIt, however, urged NCAA to review the decision and restore the approval of the Emirates Airline winter schedule, as filed.\n\n\u201cWe wish to kindly advise you that Sharjah Airport is currently operating at 140% slot capacity, but with goodwill and tremendous efforts on their side, this Airport was able to accommodate Air Peace with 1 of the 3 slots that this airline requested.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe GCAA wishes to stress that the action being taken by the NCAA is obviously not in line with the spirit of the agreed air services arrangements between our two nations.\n\n\u201cAs we are both aware, the relations between our two brotherly countries are vintage in nature, one hallmark being the recent visit of the President of Nigeria to the UAE, which certainly mirrored the status of the positive relations.\n\n\u201cFinally, we suggest that Air Peace should consider flying their two flights to any UAE airport at which there are available slots. As expected, the GCAA will support Air Peace in this activity, where required.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, your kind support is anticipated so that the NCAA reviews their decision and restores the approval of the Emirates Airline winter schedule, as filed. In this regard, we wish to reiterate that this is purely an operational matter between Air Peace and Sharjah Airport, and in any case, it should have absolutely no implication for Emirates Airline,\u201d the letter added.",

          "text": "A suspect, Abdulazeez Ibrahim, 26, has disclosed that he paid N2,650 for a Camry Toyota car valued at N2,650,000 out of luck.\n\nIbrahim, who was paraded at the Osun State Police Command Headquarters in Osogbo during the weekend, added that he had a small car but the need to change the car made him leave his residence at Iwo for Osogbo, where he bought the car.\n\n\u201cI owned a motorcycle and a small Mazda car. But on a Friday last month, I left Iwo for Osogbo on the motorcycle to get a bigger car. I got to a dealer and negotiated Toyota Camry car, we agreed on N2,650,000 but I transferred N2,650 to his account.\n\n\u201cHe gave me the car documents and let.

          "title": "How the Buhari govt promotes corruption: Wike's stunning revelation",
          "text": "\n\nOkafor Ofiebor/ Port Harcourt\n\nGovernor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has offered a stunning revelation about how the Buhari Federal Government inadvertently promotes corruption through contracts.\n\nHe said this is done by allocating paltry sums in its yearly budget for a project, instead of the entire money required to complete it within the agreed time.\n\nHe said such practice encourages variation of the value of the projects, elongates the time specified to complete such projects and most often, leads to abandonment.\n\nWike gave the explanation while speaking at the inauguration of the GRA Junction Flyover project that was performed by Mike Agbedor Ozekhome, SAN, on Saturday in Port Harcourt.\n\n\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t like the word variation. It is not in my dictionary. That is where you see corruption. That is why when you see federal government budget; how can you award a job of N60billion, then in the budget of the year, you put N2billion.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of contract is that? Why will there not be variation. That job will last in the next ten years and that is the problem we have in our contract execution.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explains that in such situations, the contract value becomes affected by inflation and there is a likelihood of adjustment of the items, which eventually breeds corruption.\n\nHe pointed out that such culture is not encouraged in Rivers State under his administration and there is no rationale for him to spend four years, for example doing a particular project.\n\n\u201cNow, if you\u2019re putting N2 billion each year, that means in ten years time, it\u2019s N20 billion. So you cannot finish the project in 20 years. And then, looking at the inflation trend, every year, the contractor will put variation. Why?\n\n\u201cBecause the price of things have gone up. So, they\u2019ll put variation and at the end of the day, the job will not be N60 billion. It will go to N80 billion.\n\n\u201cBut here, Julius Berger cannot tell us of variation because we have already given them 70 percent upfront. No. By giving you 70 percent, we expect you to work up to 80 or 90 percent.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike stated that days were gone when politicians give excuses to cover up their lack of leadership capacity.\n\nHe boasted that no administration can measure up to what he has done within six years in terms of project infrastructure in the state and the completion of five flyover bridges, with four ongoing and one about to be awarded.\n\nSpeaking further, Governor Wike asserted that the quality projects executed in the state are sufficient testament to electorate in the state to continue to vote for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) when the elections comes.\n\nHe advised who ever will become his successor not to award projects if there is no money to complete them as agreed.\n\n\u201cAnybody that is taking over from us, know that we have campaigned for the person. The campaign is over. That is why everybody is jostling to be governor because they know what I have done. I have cleared the road, so everybody is saying I want to be governor.\u201d\n\nThe governor vowed not to abandon the Trans-Kalabari road despite attempts by some hoodlums who kidnapped workers handling the multi-billion Naria project.\n\nPerforming the project inauguration, legal luminary and human rights activist, Mike Ozekhome, SAN, said Governor Wike has through the execution of numerous infrastructural projects , demonstrated transparency and accountability in the management of the resources of Rivers State\n\n\u201cHe has shown that it is not enough for a governor to get his monthly allocation from the revenue account under Section 162 of the constitution but without showing evidence of what you are using that money for.\u201d\n\nOzekhome noted that accountability, which has been the hallmark of the Wike\u2019s administration, is the essence of governance and the essence of government.\n\nHe further commended the governor for showing that investing in human capacity is the best way to live in the heart of the people.\n\n\u201cHe has shown that he possesses the capacity to develop the people, not just in terms of infrastructure, but in terms of their education and human capacity building.\u201d\n\nProviding the description of the project, Rivers State Commissioner for Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi explained that construction of the GRA Junction Flyover is intended to solve traffic conflicts experienced at the intersection of Port Harcourt-Aba expressway, Ezimgbu road and Tombia Street.\n\n\u201cThis flyover built by Messers Julius Berger, has 2 Service lanes on either side of the bridge, each measuring 7.3m in width and 775m in length. You will find a round about, pedestrian underpass, midway turns, traffic and streetlights within the project.\n\n\u201cThe bridge itself is 502m long with the suspended section being 292m. It has 4 lanes, in dual carriage configuration with 2 lanes of 7.3m width headed in either direction both separated by a median. As is our standard practice in the construction of road infrastructure, the carriage way is finished with 2 layers of Asphalt, a Binder course and a wearing course.\u201d",

          "text": "The leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide stated on Friday that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s upcoming visit to Ebonyi State will be crucial in securing the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, from DSS custody.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, and made available to journalists in Abakaliki, the Apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation cautioned youths in the South East zone to refrain from any action that may jeopardize President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Ebonyi State.\n\nThose opposed to President Buhari\u2019s scheduled visit to Ebonyi State, according to the organization, are incapable and inept to carry out such rogue operations, and if they fail, it will result in their demise and terrible end of existence and relevance.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cAny attempt to obstruct, thwart or hinder the planned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Ebonyi State will have disastrous consequences on the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu and destroy the efforts of Igbo leaders, led by Pa Mbazulike Amaechi and religious leadership in Igboland, as there are no forces and opposition to hinder the rights of a sitting President of a country from visiting any section of the country under his territory and jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cAnd those opposing the planned visit of President Buhari are incapable and incompetent of carrying out these rogue operations and if they fail, it will lead to their own extinction and disastrous cessation of existence and relevance.\n\nOhanaeze, however, urged the leadership of IPOB to stop any attempt or action that will warrant President Buhari to decline in actions that will lead to the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cIPOB shouldn\u2019t give credence to the antagonism and friction of Northern groups like Arewa Consultative Forum, Northern Elders Forum, Coalition of Northern groups and Arewa Youths that President Buhari shouldn\u2019t release Nnamdi Kanu, because this imbecility and absurdity will make President Buhari to decline in actions that will lead to the release of Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cNdigbo will welcome President Buhari to Ebonyi State in line with Igbo traditional culture and norms of welcoming esteemed visitors. This is another window of opportunities for the ongoing persuasive engagement with President Buhari by Ndigbo, to grant amnesty and Presidential pardons to all Ipob/ ESN and other Biafran agitators including Nnamdi Kanu and others who are languishing in numerous detention facilities across the country.\u201d\n\nThe group also tasked the south east governors to do everything possible to ensure that the release of Nnamdi Kanu is secured as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cSoutheast Governors led by Governor Umahi will secure the release of Nnamdi Kanu and others in Abakiliki. We have implicit confidence that the southeast political leadership and Igbo leadership led by Ohanaeze Ndigbo will seal the deal and facilitate the release of Nnamdi Kanu. It\u2019s predestined that Abakiliki is the venue where Ndigbo will secure the release of all detained freedom fighters including Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d\n\n\u201cIPOB should without further delay rescind and withdraw the earlier decisions to obstruct the planned Presidential visit to Ebonyi State and disown the earlier provocative statements or unless that they want Nnamdi Kanu to remain in detention till the end of the year 2023 when another President will succeed Buhari.\n\n\u201cIPOB should apologize to Pa Mbazulike Amaechi and Southeast Governors for ignorantly hampering and thwarting their diplomatic and tactful efforts to secure the release of Nnamdi Kanu, as diplomatic ways remained the best approach to ensure that President Buhari will keep his previous promise to look for a political solution to the incarceration of Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB should end all hostilities and resort to prayers and traditional ordinances until Presidential pardon and amnesty is given to all Biafran agitators,\u201d the group stated.",

          "title": "Young Graduates Can Solve Nigeria\u2019s Biggest Problems, Says Osinbajo",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Saturday expressed optimism that young Nigerian graduates can provide solutions to the biggest challenges confronting the nation.\n\nHe made the remark while speaking at the 60th anniversary of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, in Osun State, according to a statement signed by presidential spokesperson, Laolu Akande.\n\nThe Vice President, who was the Special Guest of Honour at the convocation ceremony of the University, stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari as Visitor, and was accompanied by the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola. While the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, delivered the Convocation Lecture at the event presided over by the Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Dr. Yahaya Abubakar, as Chancellor of the University.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018Don\u2019t Be Afraid To Say It Out,\u2019 Sanwo-Olu Asks Students To Report Bullies\n\nAccording to the VP, while young Nigerians, particularly the OAU graduands, stood on the shoulders of great men and women before them, the onus is on their generation to \u201cdeal with the biggest issues that confront the world, and our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it is big and innovative ideas that will solve those problems. You will have to confront the problems of climate change and a world moving away from fossil fuels, and you will usher in the age of renewable energy and green solutions,\u201d the Vice President said.\n\nHe added that this generation of young Nigerians are equipped and could proffer solutions in the areas of education, agriculture, health care and security.\n\n\u201cYes, the challenges are huge, but you are well equipped to resolve them; and the evidence is there\u2026 Since 2016, despite two recessions, young Nigerians have built 6 unicorns; a unicorn is a company that is valued at over a billion dollars,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe VP added, \u201cYou will deal with the issues of feeding, educating, providing healthcare and jobs for the fourth largest population in the world in a few decades. We will need smarter Agric solutions to feed the huge numbers, technology is already helping to crowd-fund Agriculture and develop more prolific seedlings.\n\n\u201cYou will confront the need to vastly improve our public and clinical healthcare. We must build on the work of the Genomic Centre at Ede, and the local vaccine production efforts going on already and make local drugs for hundreds of millions of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn education, while noting that the sector needed several new solutions, including designing methods to teach millions even outside of classrooms, the VP stated that \u201cthere are many young men and women already doing great things using technology to reach children in far flung areas with education.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President added that the use of technology and improvement in nationwide policing would further help the country address its security challenges.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity problems we are experiencing, the rise of terrorism in several parts of this large country and access to modern weaponry by non-state actors tell us that we must be smarter in policing the country, using smart drones and surveillance equipment. The politicization of importation of arms tells us that we must manufacture our own arms.\n\n\u201cAlready Proforce, led by Ade Ogundeyin, is manufacturing APCs and MRAPS in their factory in Ode Remo and exporting. So are Imperium, and the government-owned DICON (Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria) producing different types of munitions. The future is smart weapons benefiting from A.I. and machine learning,\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Osinbajo then praised the vision of the University\u2019s founders and management in driving the academic excellence for which the Obafemi Awolowo University is known, an institution, which he said has produced great thinkers and leaders throughout its history.\n\nCopiously quoting the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, for whom the university was renamed, the VP recalled that \u201cChief Awolowo, for many years Chancellor of the University, gave some of the most memorable and consequential lectures on the political economy of Nigeria; and addressed some of its most crucial problems, including the imperative of democracy, national economic development, ideology of governance and national census figures.\u201d\n\nHe also observed that OAU was very much ahead of its time when it named its medical faculty, the Faculty of Health Sciences, and its engineering faculty, the Faculty of Technology.\n\nCommending the achievements of several alumni of the university over the years, Prof. Osinbajo narrated how US-based Prof Oluyinka Olutoye, an alumnus of the faculty of health sciences gained \u201cglobal recognition when he led a team of surgeons, to successfully take a 23-week-old baby out of her mother\u2019s womb, removed a tumour and returned it to the mother\u2019s womb where the injuries from her operation healed and she continued to grow until she was born, the second time at 36 weeks.\u201d\n\nHe also observed that \u201cnot surprisingly, the early leaders in tech and tech-enabled businesses were alumni of OAU\u2019s Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering; Segun Ogunsanya, CEO of Airtel Africa, and Karl Toriola, CEO of MTN Nigeria. Another Great Ife Alumnus and product of this same department, Prof. Akintayo Akinwande, who teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is one of the world\u2019s most respected professors of electrical engineering and computer science.\u201d\n\nMost recently, according to the VP, \u201canother alumnus of the Electronics and Electrical engineering department. Miss Funke Opeke, made global investment news when Equinix, the global conglomerate announced that it was acquiring MainOne, the company she founded, for $320 million.\u201d\n\nContinuing on the feats of OAU Alumni, Prof. Osinbajo recalled that he had \u201cthe pleasure of meeting with Professors Adesuyi Ajayi and Femi Babalola, both OAU alumni, when they undertook ground breaking research and clinical trials into the potential use of Ivermectin as a prophylactic and cure for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nOther notable OAU alumni and lecturers mentioned in various fields of endeavours included Segun Osoba, Sesan Dipeolu, Toye Olorode, Oladipo Fashina, Segun Adewoye, G.G. Darah, Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina (President of the African Development Bank), Dr. Okey Oramah (President of Afrexim Bank) and Prof. Toyin Falola, the distinguished historian now of the University of Texas at Austin, USA.\n\nHe also noted OAU\u2019s new generation alumni, including Nairaland\u2019s Seun Osewa; Jobberman\u2019s Olalekan Elude, Ayodeji Adewunmi and Opeyemi Awoyemi, among others.\n\nThe VP added that \u201cit was while still teaching here also that Prof. Wole Soyinka won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. But less well known is the fact that he was also a lecturer at the University of Ife, Ibadan Campus, in the early 1960s.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President congratulated the graduands, who were doctoral candidates bagging their Doctors of Philosophy degrees. He also congratulated the two honorary doctorate recipients at the Convocation: the Ooni of Ife, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, and well-known business tycoon, Chief Michael Ade-Ojo.\n\nAccording to him, the calibre of honorary graduands at the ceremony was testament to the University\u2019s high standards.\n\nPaying tributes to the faculty of the university, the VP, himself a professor, paused \u201cto celebrate my colleagues in academia, the great scholars, and fine academics who make up the faculties here at the OAU; you are the thought leaders at a historic moment, whose great task is to guide the present and inspire the future.\u201d\n\nHis speech also highlighted the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2025 as including establishing a strong foundation for a diversified economy, investing in critical infrastructure, power and broadband, enabling human capital development and improving governance and strengthening security.\n\nIncidentally, the VP also noted that \u201cone of the crafters of the Plan, Ambassador Yemi Dipeolu, the Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, is also an alumnus of OAU, while his father, Mr. Sesan Dipeolu of blessed memory, was Ife\u2019s first African librarian.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo said \u201cthere is much to show and many stories to tell; stories of the institution itself and many of incredible successes of its alumni; stories of the triumphs of human endeavour, the primacy of ideas, the creative force of the introspective mind and the power of vision.\u201d\n\nIn the opinion of the Vice President, \u201cOAU is and continues to be very much a bastion of progressivism and innovation, and not surprisingly you will find the phrase \u201cAluta against all oppression\u201d in the Great Ife anthem. This progressivism is evident in the outlook of staff and students alike.\u201d\n\nPresent at the Convocation were eminent Nigerians, government dignitaries, top officials, traditional rulers, academics, staff and students.\n\nAt the end of the Convocation, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Eyitayo Ogunbodede, conducted the VP and other dignitaries around an arts exhibition to commemorate the event.",
          "summary": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Saturday expressed optimism that young Nigerian graduates can provide solutions to the biggest challenges confronting the nation.\nHe made the remark while speaking at the 60th anniversary of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, in Osun State, according to a statement signed by presidential spokesperson, Laolu Akande.\nYou will have to confront the problems of climate change and a world moving away from fossil fuels, and you will usher in the age of renewable energy and green solutions,\u201d the Vice President said.\nHe added that this generation of young Nigerians are equipped and could proffer solutions in the areas of education, agriculture, health care and security.\nAt the end of the Convocation, the Vice Chancellor of the University, Prof. Eyitayo Ogunbodede, conducted the VP and other dignitaries around an arts exhibition to commemorate the event.",

          "text": "Along with the new restrictions, the British government is offering everyone 18 and up a third, booster dose of vaccine to try to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThe emergence of omicron, which is spreading quickly in Britain, has shaken the government\u2019s hopes that vaccinations would be enough to keep the virus in check. British scientists and officials say omicron spreads more quickly than the currently dominant delta variant and likely is more resistant to current vaccines. It is not yet clear whether it causes more severe, or milder, cases off COVID-19.\n\nFace masks are once again compulsory in indoor public spaces in England under the measures British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced this week to slow the spread of the new omicron virus variant. Vaccination passes will be needed for nightclubs and large events starting next week, and residents will be told to work from home, if possible.\n\nTighter restrictions to curb the coronavirus came into force in Britain on Friday, as the government faced new allegations that officials flouted rules they had imposed on the nation with lockdown-breaking parties last Christmas.\n\nThe return of restrictions is unwelcome for many, and revelations of apparent rule-breaking by government officials during tough lockdowns last winter have heightened opposition to the new measures.\n\nThe government has asked Britain\u2019s most senior civil servant to investigate several gatherings, including a Dec. 18, 2020, event at the prime minister\u2019s 10 Downing St. offices, where staff reportedly enjoyed wine, food, games and a festive gift exchange at a time when pandemic regulations banned most social gatherings.\n\nMultiple media outlets reported Friday that one of Johnson\u2019s most senior advisers, Director of Communications Jack Doyle, attended the Dec. 18 party and gave awards to staff members. At the time, he was the deputy communications director.\n\nIn his current role, Doyle has directed the government\u2019s public statements about the party allegations. For several days, Johnson\u2019s office denied a party had taken place and insisted rules had been followed at all times.\n\nThat claim unraveled when a leaked video showed senior staff members joking about the alleged party. The most senior official in the video, Allegra Stratton, apologized and resigned on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult week for the government,\u201d Paul Scully, the U.K.;s small business minister, said Friday adding that the investigation needed to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of the allegations.\n\n\u201cWe want to see beyond doubt that there were no rules broken, which is what the assurances have been to the prime minister, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Scully told the BBC. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Christmas party claims are the latest in a string of allegations of rule-breaking and ethics violations by Johnson and government officials. On Thursday, Britain\u2019s electoral watchdog fined the prime minister\u2019s Conservative Party 17,800 pounds ($23,500) for failing to keep a proper record of money from a donor that was used to refurbish Johnson\u2019s official residence.\n\nWes Streeting, health spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, said the stream of allegations undermined trust in the government during a public health crisis.\n\nStreeting blamed Johnson, saying \u201cit\u2019s his untrustworthy nature, his disorganization, his dishonesty, which is undermining trust in public health measures.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s character and behavior starts to undermine a whole series of things: the system of standards in Parliament, the way the law is applied in the country and crucially, whether the government can get its message across about public health at a critical time,\u201d Streeting said.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Jolted by Unending Killings, Buhari Sends NSA, IG to Sokoto, Katsina",
          "text": "Apparently jolted by recent killings in Sokoto and Katsina states by terrorists, President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday dispatched a high-level five-man security delegation, made up of the heads of the nation\u2019s intelligence and security services, to the two states, with a mandate for quick recommendations on how to end the carnage.\n\nOn the same day, hundreds of youths stormed the streets of Kano State, with banners and placards, protesting mass killings in Northern Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, the Buhari delegation, led by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Munguno (rtd) was sent to Sokoto and Katsina states in response to the spike in activities of terrorists.\n\nOther members of the delegation are the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba; the Director-General of the DSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi; the Director-General, National Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Ahmed Rufa\u2019i Abubakar and the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Major General Samuel Adebayo.\n\nThe President is expecting an immediate situation report and recommendations on actions to follow to effectively deal with the worrisome situation.\n\n\n\nTerrorists have been ravaging Sokoto State for almost three years, with several local government areas under the control of the outlaws. Daily, scores are killed, many abducted and houses burnt in these places.\n\nLast Thursday, three people were killed by extremists who invaded Kurawa village in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nThe attack occurred hours after Governor Aminu Tambuwal visited the area on a condolence visit to the families of travellers burnt to death by terrorists last Sunday.\n\nJust last Monday, scores were killed when the terrorists struck in Gidan Bawa village, Isa Local Government Area of the state.\n\nDuring the attack, the terrorists burnt 23 travellers in a bus heading to Kaduna.\n\n\n\nIn Katsina State, the terrorists are active in virtually all the local government areas. Worst hit are Kurfi, Dutsinma, Matazu, Musawa, Malumfashi, Dandume, Bakori, Funtua, Kafur and Danja.\n\nLast Wednesday, the Katsina State Commissioner of Science and Technology, Dr. Rabe Nasir, was killed in his House located at Fatima Shema Quarters, Katsina.\n\nOne of the residents, who does not want his name in print, said: \u201cThe gunmen stormed the house at night and attacked him. They killed him and locked his corpse up in one of the rooms where we discovered it today (Thursday).\u201d\n\nNasir, 61, a former member of the House of Representatives, was also a former official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.\n\nThe Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has persistently expressed worries about the security challenges bedeviling the state, noting that 10 out of 34 local government areas of the state are under persistent attacks by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nHe affirmed that the deteriorating spate of banditry, kidnapping, rape and armed robbery were clogs in his government\u2019s effort at restoring peace and normalcy in the state.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the state by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, he said: \u201cWe here in Katsina, if we say we are very happy, we are not being honest. We are disturbed with this issue of banditry accompanied with kidnapping, raping of innocent women, armed robbery on our highways. I want technology to be properly deployed to bring these activities under control.\n\n\u201cTen out of 34 local governments in Katsina State are under severe bandits\u2019 attacks daily. So, with that in mind, there is no way we can sleep. Our phones are permanently on to hear what is happening in local governments. Before breakfast, I am briefed about what happened last night. So, General, we are not in a very comfortable situation but we thank God.\u201d President Buhari yesterday expressed sadness over the gruesome killing of Nasir, vowing to bring the culprits to justice. He has ordered a manhunt for those behind the urder.\n\nHe said death of the commissioner had illuminated the need for all and sundry, agencies, organisations and institutions to understand the gravity of the security challenges and the need to forestall future occurrence of such incidents.\n\nThe president\u2019s security delegation, led by Monguno, condoled with the government and people of the state over the incident.\n\nMonguno noted that the nation had been gripped by the news of the tragic incident and that efforts were on to arrest and bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe gruesome murder of Dr. Rabe Nasir, a serving commissioner in Katsina State, is a great loss, not only to Katsina State, but also to the entire nation.\n\n\u201cMr. President has the confidence that the Nigeria Police Force will uncover those who perpetrated the crime and the proper criminal justice and the process of the law will take place and these people will be brought to book.\n\n\u201cThis has illuminated the need for all of us in this country, whatever agency, organisation or institution to understand the gravity of this sought of incident and to ensure not only to forestall such incidents in the future but to actually reach an end stage.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMr. President wants me and the members of our delegation to reassure you of his commitment to ensure safety and security of individuals and institutions. Mr. President is deeply touched and shocked over this sort of assassination.\u201d\n\nResponding, Masari, challenged security agencies to arrest the perpetrators of the act in order to face the wrath of the law. Hundreds of youths yesterday in Kano besieged the government house roundabout with banners and placards in peaceful protest over mass killings in Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe protesters carried placards with different inscriptions, asking President Buhari to act immediately.\n\nThey marched from Audu Bako secretariat to Kano Government House, where security operatives received the group of protesters, listened to them and promised to take the matter further to the appropriate quarters.\n\nThe Convener of the protest, Zainab Naseer Ahmad, lamented how insecurity was threatening the lives and livelihood of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe come to share our concern and send a message to our leaders; we are tired of the worsening state of insecurity in the country.\u201d\n\nThe protesters, chanting songs of peace, called on President Buhari and the governors to show more interest in tackling insecurity.\n\nThere has been outrage in the North since terrorists burnt alive some travellers in Sokoto State early in the week.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",

          "text": "Former NIgeria president Olusegun Obasanjo and the former vice-president of Uganda, Specioza Wandira-Kazibwe, have condemned the travel ban on African countries over concerns relating to the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nA number of countries in Europe banned travel from countries in Africa following the discovery of the variant by South African scientists.\n\nObasanjo is a member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, while Wandira-Kazibwe, the immediate past chair of the African Union Panel of the Wise, was the first female in Africa to become vice-president of a sovereign nation.\n\nSpeaking on the development regarding Omicron, the duo, in a joint article published yesterday in The Africa Report, expressed concern over the actions taken to shut out certain countries.\n\n\u201cWhat message was being sent? That each country by unilaterally bolting its gates will be able to hold back the tide of a pandemic, alone? That contributing to our global understanding of the evolution of a world plague, by sharing the fruits of years of genomic capabilities development, should lead to a country being ostracised?\u201d they asked.\n\nThey also wondered how countries gather annually in New York to address injustice \u201cand yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare related patents.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, rather than issue travel bans, what the world needs \u201cin these Omicron times is smart multilateralism.\n\n\u201cEven after we had learnt that shutting the doors made no sense at this point, the emotive comfort of locking out the other proved too tempting to resist,\u201d they said.\n\nThe two leaders continued: \u201cYet, to run effective contact tracing in a time of rapid global physical connectivity, information and goodwill is required from countries far and near to plot the trajectory of a virus moving at the speed of flight. Detecting a variant in a person who happens to be from or at point A on the globe says nothing about all the other places the variant may have touched before eventually slipping into the cells of the unfortunate carrier.\n\n\u201cA very different form of global hyper-cooperation is required to match the pace of such a fast spreading virus. We in Africa have learnt the hard way that we are in an age where the old models of multilateralism have run their full course.\n\n\u201cMarked by slow bureaucracy and symbolisms of comity rather than pragmatic trust and modern instruments, this old multilateralism has frozen attempts to reform global trade to serve the people rather than corporations.\n\n\u201cIt has hobbled efforts to turn the energy transition into a moment to balance the obscene imbalances in population and consumption. And it has led to a world where annually we assemble in New York to address injustice and yet refuse to align on how to make quicker progress on a host of issues, from labour rights to agricultural subsidies and healthcare-related patents.\n\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 threatened to disrupt Africa\u2019s biggest multilateral endeavour in half a century \u2013 the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) \u2013 \u2018radical agility\u2019 became our only path forward.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s embrace of smart multilateralism is manifest in being the first continent to agree on a common digital platform for bio-surveillance and biosecurity. Absolutely convinced that the each-for-herself idea embodied in border closures has serious limits, we set out to work with the private and civil society sectors to create both institutional and technological innovations to keep the borders open but the virus out.\n\n\u201cThrough a combination of skillful compromises and modern technologies, we pressed on and ensured that the timeline for start of trading would be maintained. It was as clear as noonday to those of us championing African multilateralism that retreating behind the walls of nationalist survival would be continental suicide. It would also be generational suicide because COVID and AfCFTA are both once in a lifetime opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is smart multilateralism at work. It is the only way forward for a continent like ours that has long been marginalised in the global scheme of things. But the more we look at the state of globalisation in the world today, the more convinced we are that it is the whole world that needs smart multilateralism and not just Africa.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY",
