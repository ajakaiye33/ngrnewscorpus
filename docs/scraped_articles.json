          "text": "By Evelyn Usman & Ikechukwu Nnochiri\n\n\n\nSuspended Commander of the Intelligence Response Team, IRT, DCP Abba Kyari, who is remanded in the custody of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, over his involvement in a 25kg cocaine deal, has refused to officially respond to the query issued him by Force Headquarters.\n\n\n\nThis is even as the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, yesterday, threatened to strike out the N500 million fundamental right enforcement suit Kyari filed against the Federal Government.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that the embattled detective was handed the query while in NDLEA\u2019s custody, close to a month ago.\n\n\n\nRather than answer the query, sources told Vanguard that Kyari said he could not write from where he was.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat alone is a reply to the query. He stated that he could not write from where he was. He said when he gets out, he would officially answer the query, as he was not in the right frame of mind to answer officially,\u201d a source said.\n\nCourt threatens to strike out his N500m suit against FG\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has threatened to strike out the N500 million fundamental right enforcement suit Kyari filed against the Federal Government.\n\nHe had before his arraignment on March 7, instituted the legal action to challenge his arrest and detention by the NDLEA.\n\n\n\nThe applicant, among other things, is praying the court to order the FG to pay him N500 million and also tender written apology to him in two national dailies for the unlawful violation of his fundamental human rights.\n\nMeanwhile, at the resumed proceedings in the matter, yesterday, the NDLEA, through its Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Mr. Joseph Sunday, told the court that he was just served a further affidavit by Kyari\u2019s lawyer, Cynthia Ikenna.\n\n\n\nSunday noted that the agency served its counter-affidavit on the applicant since February 24.\n\n\n\nHe argued that going by rules of the court, the applicant filed the further affidavit out of time.\n\n\n\nResponding, Kyari\u2019s lawyer, prayed the court for a short adjournment to enable her to regularize her processes.\n\n\n\nBefore he adjourned the matter till April 7, Justice Inyang Ekwo warned that he would strike out the matter for lack of deligent prosecution.\n\n\n\nJustice Ekwo said: \u201cIf on next date you are not ready, I will strike out the matter. Put your house in order before the date of hearing.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you have an excuse not to be here on that date, I will take it that you are out to frustrate this matter and I will strike it out.\u201d\n\nKyari had in his suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/182/22, accused the NDLEA of assisting drug peddlers to ship in cocaine into the country, alleging that a corrupt officer of the agency framed him up after he went to demand for compensation for a whistleblower that gave information that led to the arrest of a suspect by the Police Intelligence Response Team, IRT.\n\n\n\nHe told the court that the said suspect had been shipping cocaine into the country from Ethiopia, using all the airports, \u201cwith the knowledge of the NDLEA officers\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn an affidavit deposed to by one Muhammad Nur Usman, who identified himself as his younger brother, Kyari told the court that NDLEA officials usually cleared the drug baron \u201cand even escort him from the airport to his destination\u201d.\n\n\n\nNarrating the circumstance that led to his present ordeal, Kyari, said: \u201cThat on that fateful day, the suspect as usual shipped drugs (cocaine) from Ethiopia to Enugu Airport. The officer of NDLEA cleared him within the airport, then officer of FIB-IRT arrested the suspect with the help of an information.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat before the informant accepted to work with the officers of FIB-IRT, they both had an agreement to compensate the informant.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat officers of FIB-IRT, having noticed that officers of NDLEA were the ones clearing the said suspect with his drugs (cocaine), they immediately took the suspect to NDLEA and also reported those officers involved in the act.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat instead of the NDLEA to handle the matter accordingly and bring their officers involved to book, they decided to frustrate the informant, thereby refusing to compensate the informant.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat it was at this juncture that the attention of the DCP Abba Kyari was called, who because the NDLEA officer involved is his friend, decided to intervene for the purpose of compensating the Informant.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat the NDLEA officer who refused to compensate the informant was the one who framed DCP Abba Kyari up on a trump-up allegation that he was trying to bribe him.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat the agent of the Respondent declared the Applicant wanted because of a mere allegation that he was trying to bribe an NDLEA officer without sufficient proof.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat the Nigerian Police Force, based on the allegation of the Respondent arrested the Applicant on February 12, 2022, and handed over to the NDLEA.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe maintained that his continued detention amounted to an infringement on his fundamental human rights.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "As the war in Ukraine rages on, two Nigerian students who have since returned home after fleeing Russia\u2019s invasion of the country have described their traumatic escape.\n\nAdetomiwa Adeniyi, 24, and Amamchim Steve-Ajufo, 17, were both studying medicine in Ukraine before Russian troops invaded. The Nigerian government has been evacuating its citizens escaping the war in Ukraine, and more than 1,500 of them have been flown back home, according to the authorities.\n\nAdeniyi and Steve-Ajufo were among Nigerian students recently evacuated by the government.\n\nThe pair crossed into neighboring Romania through the Ukrainian border. The experience, they said, was harrowing and unfamiliar.\n\n\u201cThere were three lines: one seemingly for the Ukrainians, one for the Indians, and one for Africans. I wondered why it was like that since we were all trying to get out,\u201d Adeniyi told CNN\u2019s Zain Asher.\n\n\u201cIf you were Ukrainian\u2026or white, it was almost as though you had a fast track to the gate (of the border to Romania). I lost the hope that I\u2019ll be able to cross,\u201d he added.\n\nSeveral people CNN spoke with in recent days \u2014 mainly African and Indian students schooling in Ukraine \u2014 complained of difficulty crossing the Ukraine border to bordering nations.\n\nOthers said they had experienced racist treatment by Ukrainian security forces and border officials who reportedly prioritized Ukrainian refugees and \u201cshowed prejudice against foreign students.\u201d\n\nSteve-Ajufo said she was ordered back to the queue meant for Africans by Ukrainian border officials when she was seen standing among Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cI accidentally went to the Ukrainian line and instantly I was told to return to my side. I cried a whole lot. The border officials kept screaming \u2018go back, go back!.\u2019 I was so tired and cold, and I did not understand what was going on. I wanted to give up several times but I kept reminding myself of my mum,\u201d the 17-year-old medical student said.\n\nAdeniyi and Steve-Ajufo were eventually able to cross into the Romanian capital of Bucharest, where they were flown back to Nigeria in a chartered flight provided by the Nigerian government.\n\nThe young Nigerian students, however, told CNN that Ukraine had become their home, and they were devastated to leave the Eastern European country now under siege by Russian forces.\n\n\u201cIt (Ukraine) is my home. I\u2019ve almost spent six years there,\u201d Adeniyi told CNN.\n\nAccording to Steve-Ajufo, her home (Ukraine) has been \u201csnatched\u201d from her.\n\n\u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cAnytime I think about it or see news that somewhere else (in Ukraine) has been bombed or someone else has died, I\u2019m angry that my home was snatched from me. I\u2019m traumatized,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nUkraine is home to many foreign students who opt to study there because it is more affordable than other western nations. The country also has a strong reputation for medical courses.\n\nAround 4,000 Nigerian students study in Ukraine with most of them studying medicine, according to the Nigerian President\u2019s office",

In the past couple of weeks, we have listened to some of the utterances from those seeking positions of power, responsibility and trust.\n\n\u201cWhile we commend them for the courage to offer themselves to be service of our state in different capacities, we urge them to moderate the language, tone and modes used in seeking the support of our people.\n\n\u201cIf the motive is to serve our people, then no one should intimidate anyone, insult opponents or prevent others from the ongoing electioneering consultations. Any candidate who markets violence as a way of gaining electoral victory will govern with violence.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Ibom Patriots advises our fathers, and mothers as well as our sons and daughters not to do anything or follow anyone that wants to return our state to those better forgotten years. I urge you our dear youths, to think wisely.\n\n\u201cWhen that politician asks you to cause mayhem and attack your fellow citizens, you should ask him if he too will bring his sons and daughters to do likewise.\n\n\u201cAnd if somebody is using combative language, or encouraging use of combative language that will lead to violence, you should reject that person (aspirant), that is what we are talking about\u201d\n\nThe Chancellor, however, noted that they (Ibom Patriots) have decided to endorse Pastor Umo Eno for governorship position in 2023 in the interest of Akwa Ibom, peace and harmony of the state.\n\n\u201cWe believe that with Umo Eno after Governor Udom Emmanuel, the future is assured, our youths and rural areas shall continue to be the focus, we believe that the developmental strides already started by governor Emmanuel shall be continued, the peace and safety we enjoy shall not cease\u201d, he stressed",

          "title": "COVID-19: Ex-NANTA VC urges FG to review PCR test rules, says policy \u2018making tourism business moribund\u2019",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Ebunoluwa Sessou\n\nFormer Vice Chairman of National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies, NANTA, Otunba Segun Adewale has urged the Federal Government to review the pre-arrival PCR test rules in order to allow tourism business to be revived in Nigeria.\n\nAdewale who described the pre-arrival PCR test charged $200 by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), as a way of extorting Nigerians maintained if the policy is not revisited, it might hamper smooth operations of travel and tourism business in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the policy is inimical to Nigeria\u2019s economy and it is a fraudulent development in that no other country is collecting money upon arrival for post two days tests.\n\nNCDC policy states that \u201cUpon arrival in Nigeria, Fully vaccinated travellers are required to conduct a COVID-19 PCR test on day 2 of arrival. Unvaccinated and partially vaccinated passengers are required to observe a mandatory 7-day self-isolation in addition to a COVID-19 PCR test on days 2 and 7 post-arrival. Passengers who do not adhere to the travel protocol will face the penalty as stipulated by the PSC-COVID-19.\n\nAdewale who is also the CEO of Aeroland Travels Limited, in a chat with Vanguard disclosed that while worst-hit countries in the world are winding down and relaxing their stiff measures to give room for an economic rebound, Nigeria through the NCDC managed by the Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on COVID-19 still maintains a hard stance, bringing untold hardship to the travel and tourism industry.\n\n\u201cFor travellers arriving Nigeria, Covid-19 PCR test is compulsory within 48 hours irrespective of your vaccination status. This should be reviewed. If you are vaccinated, there is no need for another compulsory test.\n\n\u201cA family of five needs hundreds of naira to do the test upon arrival. At the end of the day, upon payment of the $200 once the QOR code is generated, the health of the person involved is of less concern to them.\n\n\u201cIt is not helpful to the economy and the industries if travellers have to pay 200 dollars in advance into the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) account for another test on arrival into the country.\n\n\u201cThis is the highest charge anywhere in the world. These charges are discouraging travellers into Nigeria and indirectly affect our GDP.\n\n\u201cThis is adversely affecting our GDP growth as the Forex we could have gained through tourism is stifled.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that this policy is reviewed because businesses are moribund, due to the exorbitant PCR test charge. People\u2019s livelihoods have been destroyed and these countries are now bringing back their businesses, reviving the travels, aviation, tourism, hotels and hospitality industries.\n\n\u201cSo, if we can copy the West and America as regards Covid-19 guidelines and policies, why are we not copying them with financial implications as related to Covid-19 PCR test,\u201d he said.\n\nAdewale, who berated the multiple compulsory PCR tests and charges imposed on travellers into the country, said such was enough to discourage tourism and other connected industries.\n\n\u201cBefore Nigerians could not enter Europe except for the PCR test but now they are relaxing the rules. In fact, they are not even asking travellers to do any more to enter their countries once they are vaccinated\u201d he stated.\n\nAccording to him, in England, the United Arab Emirates and most countries in Europe, if anyone is vaccinated, the PCR test was not needed again to come into those countries.\n\nHe said that the Covid-19 test on arrival in some of these countries was free, adding that the development had increased the number of people coming into them thereby improving their economy.\n\nAdewale added: \u201cAs things are getting better and countries are relaxing rules, we need to do the same in Nigeria for the sake of our economy; we should not make the rules stiffer.\n\n\u201cSince we have copied all the guidelines and health policies from Europe and America on the COVID-19 pandemic safety measures, even the quarantine here, now that they have relaxed the rules, it is pertinent that Nigeria also follows suit.",

Igboayaka, the National President of the Council and spokesman of Indigenous Ethnic Youth Leaders of Nigeria, gave the charge in a statement issued on Wednesday.\n\nHe reiterated that the only available option for youths is to make use of the ongoing voter\u2019s registration to register enmass to secure their future in the next political dispensation.\n\nHe insisted that all political profiteers in Igbo nation would be sacked at the forthcoming 2023 general elections, hence there will be a political tsunami in the entire Igboland.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI detest the lackadaisical approach of new generation of Igbo extraction over the re-registration of voter registration. 2023 general election will be a political tsunami in Igbo land, there will be total retirement of all politicians that have stolen our wealth from 1999 till date. The Igbo youth shall organize a send-forth protest to all National assembly bench warmers. None of the Governor\u2019s from Igbo extraction shall near the Senate seat.\n\n\u201cThe youth shall beat a new drum for our governors who think that it\u2019s a political culture that after after eight years looting, misappropriation and diversion of local funds they will acquire Senatorial seat. This culture of decorating looters with juicy position must stop as we open a new political chapter from 2023.\n\n\u201cI therefore advice all the legible voters from secondary schools to University level to earnestly use this recent new voters registration to register and get the PVC, the parents and guidance should verily ensure that youths under their care are all registered to vote in 2023 general election.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Igboayaka noted, \u201cif Igbo youth will translate their population into PVC, Southeast at least will record over 50 million votes. There is no community in Igbo land that\u2019s not up 15, 000 people. The data shows that there\u2019s over 660 autonomous communities in Imo state and each of the community population is over 15, 000 people, making only Imo population approximately 9.9 million people. The available data shows that only Ndi Imo can produce over 5.5 legible voters if we harness our population.\u201d\n\nThe Igbo youth leader further advised Ndigbo to beware of political profiteers who, according to him, have launched charity foundations, noting that such organizations cannot be used as a yardstick to quantify capacity of leadership.\n\n\u201cThe youth shall escape from every mental manipulation from politicians, shun electoral thuggery and violence\u201d, those politicians who have been using the youth for only in political thuggery without meaningful source of living or gainfully employment should prepare their own children to lead the political gangsters in 2023,\u201d Igboayaka stated.",

          "text": "Clash over returnee-defectors rocks National Caucus meeting\n\nEx-VP: 2023 poll our last chance\n\nConfusion broke out at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Caucus meeting on Monday night, forcing National Chairman Dr Iyorcha Ayu to abruptly reschedule proceedings till today.\n\nThe uproar at the meeting was triggered by the insistence of some leaders from the South that members, who defected from the party to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the past and returned, should be excluded from seeking the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nA vocal governor from the South, according to sources, spearheaded the call.\n\nAtiku, former Senate President Bukola Saraki; former Kano State Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso and Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal are among prominent PDP chieftains that defected to the APC in the run-up to the 2015 general election.\n\nHowever, they all returned to PDP following irreconcilable differences with the Muhammadu Buhari Presidency and the APC leadership. Some of the returnees won and lost elections in 2019 on the platform of the PDP.\n\nThey are all believed to be eyeing the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nThose canvassing the exclusion of former defectors argued that their defection to APC was the major reason PDP lost power in 2015. They were said to have argued that the PDP found itself in the opposition today because of their past actions.\n\nThe southern power brokers in the party, who were also reported to have insisted on zoning of the ticket to their region, pointed out that the failure of former President Goodluck Jonathan to respect the zoning arrangement for the 2015 election led to the mass defection that hit PDP.\n\nBut some members, mainly from the North, reportedly countered the arguments, saying the call for exclusion was not only a distraction but a witchhunt of the returnees.\n\nA source close to the meeting said: \u201cWe are all aware that these same people contested elections in 2019 on the platform of PDP after returning to our great party.\n\n\u201dIf nobody called for their exclusion in 2019, on what grounds are they calling for their disqualification now?\n\n\u201dIt is quite unfortunate that some people have been carrying on as if PDP is their personal property.\n\n\u201dWe need to make it clear that some people built PDP from scratch to become what it is today. So people should stop conducting themselves as if they are the owners of the party. We all have an equal stake in PDP.\u201d\n\nStating their case further, they declared that it\u2019s against the spirit of the PDP constitution and the 1999 Constitution to prevent interested members from seeking the party\u2019s ticket for any elective position.\n\nAnother source told The Nation that when the disagreement degenerated, Dr Ayu brought the meeting to close.\n\nConsequently, the meetings of the National Caucus, the Board of Trustees (BoT) and National Executive Committee (NEC) which were to hold yesterday were all shifted to today to allow for further consultations.\n\nThose at the National Caucus meeting included former Vice-President Namadi Sambo; BoT Chairman Walid Jibrin; Atiku; Senator Ike Ekweremadu; former PDP Chairman Okwesilieze Nwodo; and Saraki.\n\nTen PDP governors; former Senate Presidents Anyim Pius Anyim and Adolphus Wabara; Senator Ahmed Makarfi; Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Abubakar Baraje; Ndudi Elumelu; and Chief Bode George were also in attendance.\n\nSpeaking after the truncated meeting, PDP Spokesman Debo Ologunagba explained that the decision to end the meeting abruptly was taken to allow various committees of the party study documents to be presented to NEC for approval.\n\nThe disagreement over moves to exclude some persons from vying for the presidential ticket was confirmed by Chief Raymond Dokpesi, who coordinates Atiku\u2019s consultative engagements, during a meeting between Atiku and members of the BoT yesterday.\n\nAddressing the BoT members, Dokpesi said: \u201cThe information reaching me now is not very palatable. It\u2019s a case of attempting to divide this party.\n\n\u201cInformation available to me indicates that some persons, who are founding members of the party, but who left the party in the past and came back, should not be allowed to contest for the PDP presidential ticket.\n\n\u201dSentiments and emotions have been brought in by various interest groups. It is for you, as fathers and mothers of this party, to defend what the vision should be, and to discern what the agitations from certain quarters appear to be\u201d.\n\nMy position on zoning, by Atiku\n\nFormer Vice-President Atiku Abubakar yesterday intensified his presidential aspiration by meeting with BoT members.\n\nAddressing the party\u2019s elders at the Yar\u2019 Adua Centre, Atiku said 2023 presents PDP with the last opportunity at regaining power or going down completely.\n\nHe said: \u201dYour excellences, friends, brothers and sisters, we are now at a crucial moment in this country. For many of you here, it is either we retire together or we move on together.\n\n\u201dAs one of the speakers said, I am worried and you should be worried too, that if we do not win, it means we will be in opposition again for the next eight years.\n\n\u201dBy the next eight years, I don\u2019t know how many of you will be left in politics. It (defeat) may even ultimately lead to the death of the party because people gravitate, particularly in developing countries, towards governments.\n\n\u201dOrdinary people naturally gravitate towards the government. So, this is a very, very crucial and historical moment in history for our survival. I want you to think about it.\u201d\n\nAtiku dismissed his alleged disregard for zoning, saying the PDP had always been faithful with the zoning arrangement.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, people have not stopped talking about power rotation and zoning, or whatever it is.\n\n\u201dFor sure, in the party, we invented and formulated this zoning policy simply because we wanted every part of this country to have a sense of belonging and I personally have paid my dues on the issue of zoning.\n\n\u201dMany of you were members of our government when all PDP governors came in 2003 and said I should run and I said no.\n\n\u201dWe had agreed that power should remain in Southwest. Why should I contest? Some of those governors that supported me at the time went to jail. Some of them were kicked out of their offices but we made sure that we kept the zoning policy.\n\n\u201dSo, you cannot come and try to imply that PDP has not been following the zoning policy.\n\n\u201dIn the many years of PDP government; eight years and six years, all of them (President) were from South.\n\n\u201dMy vision is to build bridges across the country. Please, join me in building bridges across this country so that every part of this country will have a sense of belonging.\u201d",

          "text": "For two consecutive months \u2013 January and February \u2013 Nigeria failed to meet its quota as allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nIn its March report released yesterday, OPEC said Nigeria produced 1.399m barrels per day in January and 1.25 million barrels per day in February.\n\nThis is far below the 1.7mb/d allocation for January and 1.8mb/d for February\n\nThe report added that Nigeria maintained an average daily oil production of 1.424mb in 2021.\n\nIt did not, however, give reasons why the country could not meet its quota.\n\nOPEC said: \u201cAccording to secondary sources, total OPEC-13 crude oil production averaged 28.47 mb/d in February 2022, higher by 0.44 mb/d month -on-month.\n\nIt noted that Crude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia and Libya, while production in Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea declined.\n\nIt further explained that Saudi Arabia is on top of the list as the highest producer with 10.225mb/d exceeding the 10mb/d that the Organization approved for it in the month under review.\n\nGroup Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, had blamed the country\u2019s inability to meet its OPEC quota on lack of funding.\n\nHe said financing was badly needed to improve the country\u2019s production capacity.\n\nAccording to him, following the decision to allow more oil in the market, Nigeria and other members of OPEC would face challenges to quickly pump more oil.\n\n\u201cEven if OPEC members decide to pump more oil it may not be very, very realisable as the financing needed for more development is lacking,\u201d Kyari said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.\n\nA report by Cordros Capital indicated that Nigeria\u2019s oil sector contracted for the seventh consecutive quarter with a negative growth print of 8.1 per cent in fourth quarter 2021, bringing 2021 full year oil sector negative growth to 8.3 per cent.\n\nHowever, providing some comfort was the trend of slowing contraction in the oil sector as the negative growth of 8.1 per cent in fourth quarter 2021 was 4.6 percentage points and 2.7 percentage points slower than the 12.7 per cent and 10.7 per cent contraction in second quarter 2021 and third quarter 2021.\n\nAccording to the report, the sustained contraction in oil sector GDP remains down to persistent reduction in crude oil production.\n\nFor context, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that crude production averaged 1.5mb/d in Q4-2021, 3.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent lower than fourth quarter-2020 and third quarter 2021\u2019s 1.6mb/d.\n\nIn addition, average crude oil production for full year 2021 printed at 1.6mb/d, 10.0 lower than full year 2020\u2019s average of 1.8mb/d.\n\nAccording to analysts, the steady decline in oil production is directly associated with operational and maintenance issues, supported by incessant pipeline vandalism, which has prevented Nigeria from meeting its OPEC+ production quota, despite upward adjustment that has seen Nigeria\u2019s production quota rise to 1.72mb/d (excluding condensates).\n\nIn addition, capital expenditure investment in the oil and gas sector continues to lag below pre-pandemic levels, despite oncoming of the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nAs a result of contraction in the sector\u2019s output, contribution to real GDP in 2021 declined to 7.2 per cent as against 8.2 per cent in 2020 down by 1.0 percentage points. For additional context, oil sector contribution to real GDP prior to the Covid-19 outbreak was 9.5 per cent in first quarter 2020.",

Every arrangement is in place now to give him a rousing welcome by both secretariat staff and party stakeholders,\u201d said the source..\n\nHowever, a showdown appear imminent as it was learnt that Niger State Governor, Sani Bello, would also resume duty to continue in his role as acting chairman.\n\nRepresentative of the youths in the CECPC, Ismaeel Ahmed, confirmed Bello\u2019s resumption in a chat with newsmen after a meeting of the Caretaker Committee at the party\u2019s headquarters.\n\nOn why Akpanudoedehe, who resumed yesterday, was absent at the caretaker committee meeting, the newly-appointed spokesperson of the party said he could not account for the movement of the party\u2019s chief scribe.\n\n\u201cHe does not speak to me before he comes to the office, he does not speak to me when he is leaving. I am not even aware that he is in the office today. I personally thought he has travelled.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe just finished the regular routine meetings of the caretaker committee and I have been mandated to announce that sales of forms have began for all the offices both zonal and national. We expect stakeholders of every zone to meet and decide on certain things since we already released the list of zoning arrangements.\u201d\n\nHe said the CECPC agreed during the meeting that the proposed emergency virtual meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) would still hold on Thursday despite the rejection by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nOn the number of delegates, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact delegates we are expecting but it will be in the neighbourhood of 4,000. You ask if INEC has given us the go ahead to hold the NEC on Thursday and I can tell you that we are going to hold our NEC meeting on Thursday here in the secretariat.\n\n\u201cOn the prices for the forms, the position for the chairman has been agreed by the party to be sold at N20 million, National Secretary will go for N10 million, Deputy National Chairman (South and North) will be sold at N10 million. All other NWC positions will be sold at N5 million.\n\n\u201cThe NEC positions like non-members of the NCW positions will go for N1 million. All positions of the zonal levels without the position of the National Vice Chairman, which are also members of the NWC will be sold for N500,000.\n\n\u201cThat goes with the provisions of women, people living with disabilities which will be 50 per cent of the fees. Convention will still hold March 26, sacrosanct and we are going to be having our NEC meeting on Thursday,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, speaking to newsmen at the secretariat of the party shortly after addressing the 250 selected ushers, chairman convention accreditation of volunteers/diplomats/diaspora/observers sub-committee and Governor of Kano State, Umar Ganduje, assured that there was no reason to entertain any fear on the convention holding on the agreed date.\n\nThe trainees, 200 young ladies and 50 young men, had settled at the NEC Hall, and were screened and drilled for hours.",

          "text": "Peter Uzoho with agency report\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government plans to tap \u20ac2 billion ($2.2 billion) this month or next of the money it raised through Eurobond sale last year and target more local borrowing in 2022 to help fund its costly petrol subsidies as oil prices rise, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed has revealed.\n\nShe told Reuters that the country would not tap the Eurobond market this year.\n\n\u201cRising oil prices has put us in a very precarious position \u2026 because we import refined products \u2026 and it means that our subsidy cost is really increasing,\u201d she said on the sidelines of an Arab-African conference in Cairo.\n\nThe federal government in January reversed a plan to end fuel subsidy by the middle of this year, and instead extended them by 18 months to avert any protests in the run-up to presidential elections next year.\n\nBut the price of oil soared recently, but the price of Brent crude \u2013 the global benchmark for prices \u2013 dropped below $100 a barrel for the first time since March, yesterday.\n\nThe West African country depends almost entirely on imports to meet its domestic gasoline needs, even though it is a crude oil exporter.\n\nIt is also facing shortages after taking delivery of some unusable substandard gasoline.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari in a letter to parliament in February had requested for extra funds to pay for petrol subsidies and with that the country\u2019s budget deficit was expected to four per cent of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the government eyes new domestic borrowing.\n\nThe deficit was originally set at 3.42 per cent of GDP. Petrol subsidies cost Nigeria up to $7 billion a year in revenue.\n\nAhmed said the government was working with lawmakers to boost revenues and that the rise in oil prices means that borrowings will increase more than planned.\n\nAhmed had lamented that the rise in crude oil price had further widened the country\u2019s budget deficit, pointing out that the federal government was presently in the process of amending the budget to accommodate fuel subsidy.\n\nShe had explained, \u201cWe are cleaning up our subsidies; we had a setback as we were to remove subsidy by July this year, but there was a lot of pushbacks. We have elections coming and also because of the hardship that companies and citizens faced due to the COVID and we were told that the timing was not right, so we pulled back.\n\n\u201cBut we have been able to quietly implement subsidy in the electricity sector and as it is, as we speak, we don\u2019t have subsidies in the electricity sector.\n\n\u201cFuel subsidy is a huge problem for us. It has thrown up our deficit much higher than we planned. What is happening to the global oil prices is also going to, perhaps, worsen matters. But the current review we are doing is to say we will hold the subsidy at the level in which it is planned.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on how much global prices would affect subsidy payment, Ahmed had said, \u201cWe are currently doing a budgetary amendment to accommodate the incremental subsidy as a result of the reversed decision and we want to cap it at that.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the parliament will agree with us and also at least contain the subsidies; otherwise, the way things are going now, we will not be able to predict where the deficit will be as a result of the fluctuation in the global markets.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022CECPC secretary commend INEC for standing firm, says party is crisis-free\n\n\u2022Reconciliation still on-going, Ganduje declares\n\n\u2022Party commences sale of forms ahead of convention, chairmanship goes for N20m\n\n\u2022Bid to vacate order stopping convention suffers setback\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nIndications emerged yesterday that all governors elected into the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would be standing down in a no victor, no vanquished deal reached with the Chairman of the committee and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, and allow other members of the CECPC to continue and conclude the party\u2019s national convention scheduled for March 26th, 2022.\n\nAlready, Osun State governor, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, who was a member of the CECPC had resigned in order to face the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state wherein he is contesting for a second term.\n\nSo, THISDAY gathered that in line with the deal reached, Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello and Buni have elected to resign from the committee so that they can face governance in their respective states and allow the CECPC to continue.\n\nHowever, the fate of the National Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe remains uncertain and a decision on him would be reached at the emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting scheduled for tomorrow which the President will virtually participate in. The meeting\u2019s one item agenda is the convention. Although other matters can be introduced under, Any Other Business, AOB.\n\nThese were the arrangements reached with President Muhammadu Buhari in London.\n\nThe convention would hold on March 26 and former Nasarawa Governor, Abdulahi Adamu is expected to emerge new chairman of the party.\n\nAfter weeks of leadership tussle that plagued the ruling APC, Akpanudoedehe yesterday issued an optimistic statement that gave the impression that Buni had taken back control control as Chairman of the party\u2019s CECPC.\n\nAkpanudoedehe commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for standing firm in the face of the crisis that almost undid the party, declaring that APC is crisis-free.\n\nAlthough, Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, yesterday, assured members of APC that the party\u2019s national convention, scheduled for March 26, would go on as planned, saying reconciliation and consensus are already taking place.\n\nAhead of the convention, the party commenced the sale of nomination forms for various positions on Monday, with the exercise slated to conclude on Friday. It fixed N20 million as cost of nomination form for the position of national chairman.\n\nAt the same time, efforts by APC to set aside an order of Justice Bello Kawu of the Abuja High Court, stopping the party\u2019s March 26 national convention suffered a setback yesterday due to legal representation.\n\nBuni had travelled out of the country, to Dubai, for medical reasons, when a faction of the APC governors moved against him. The governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, assumed the leadership of the party in acting capacity, when Buni was away.\n\nHowever, while the crisis raged, there was confusion over the fate of Akpanudoedehe, after reports claimed he had resigned, but he later insisted he remained the secretary of the party. He said he remained the secretary until Buhari decided otherwise.\n\nAkpanudoedehe had said, \u201cI have read in social media that I have resigned as Secretary of the APC. I want to state that it is not true, I didn\u2019t resign. If I had resigned, you would have seen my letter of resignation written by me. Someone cannot just say somebody is dead, when he is alive.\u201d\n\nIn a dramatic twist, after weeks of uncertainly, Buni\u2019s personal assistant, Mr. Muritala Yakubu, was given access to the national secretariat of the party for the first time. Though Buni was not back in the country.\n\nA meeting between Buhari and of some governors billed to hold in London appeared to have given the CECPC chairman and others a glimmer of hope.\n\nAfter Buni\u2019s aides gained access to their offices, Akpanudoedehe also arrived at the national secretariat of the party around 12:08 pm yesterday.\n\nAddressing journalists at the APC national secretariat in Abuja, Akpanudoedehe said the ruling party was now crisis-free, despite the events of the last few days.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe CECPC of the APC under the chairmanship of Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State makes this press release to clarify the events of last week and reassure the membership and stakeholders of the party as well as the Nigerian people, in general, that the governing party is crisis-free, strong and remains united in giving the country the transformative leadership and good governance, which she promised them.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said CECPC had always done its best to steer the affairs of APC in line with the mandate vested in it at inauguration by the National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nHe explained that on February 28, Buni took a long-delayed trip abroad on health grounds, leaving behind a written authorisation for other members of CECPC to continue work in his absence, particularly the day to day management of APC.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn his absence, sundry activities earlier scheduled for action appeared to develop fresh urgency in order to satisfy the timetable for the 2023 general election released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), thus, galvanising some within the CECPC to act in their best understanding of both the situation and the leadership dynamics in the committee/party.\n\n\u201cThat all such actions were clearly identified at all times as happening in an acting or proxy capacity, and under the auspices of the substantive chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni, contrary to widespread speculations that the chairman, secretary or some other officials of the CECPC have been removed from office or otherwise replaced.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said the caretaker committee was intact and functional as originally constituted. He assured that delivering a seamless national convention of APC on March 26 was top priority for the caretaker committee.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe shall continue to execute such assignments as are legal, pending the return of the chairman who is on his way back to the country and shall resume office on arrival with the full support of all members and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to INEC for her firm guidance in the entire circumstances.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe revealed that the party had engaged a team of senior lawyers to address a court order halting the planned APC national convention.\n\nThe ruling party called on the judiciary to give the matter the needed expedient attention in a bid to vacate the court order and allow for the conduct of a transparent and rancour-free national convention.\n\nAkpanudoedehe restated the loyalty of CECPC to APC and the leadership of the party under Buhari.\n\nHe also reassured members and citizens that the ruling party was stronger than ever before and poised to extend its winning streak to 2023 and beyond.\n\nBut despite the statement by Akpanudoedehe, as stated earlier, in the meeting between Buhari and the governors, it was agreed that Bello and Buni would resign in line with the no victor, no vanquished deal.\n\nBut the CECPC would continue and the convention planning committee would organise the convention and a new chairman would emerge. When the chairman emerges, he would take over and that chairman is likely going to be former Nasarawa governor, Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nConvention: Reconciliation, Consensus On-going, Says Ganduje\n\nMeanwhile, Kano State Governor Abdulahi Ganduje assured APC members that the national convention of the party would take place as planned, saying reconciliation and consensus are already in progress.\n\nGanduje, who chairs the protocol sub-committee, said the party was preparing for the convention.\n\nThe Kano State governor spoke yesterday in Abuja while fielding questions from journalists at the APC national secretariat.\n\nGanduje said, \u201cWe are preparing for the convention. Apart from the selection of about 250 able young men and women, they are undergoing training after which they will proceed to the Eagle Square, the venue of the convention. I will be there myself together with other members of the committee and protocol sub-committee.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the court order barring the party from holding the convention, Ganduje said he had no fears, but was optimistic that the convention would hold.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have no fears; our convention will hold, inshallah. Don\u2019t worry, we are equal to the task. We are the biggest party in Africa and we have the experience to handle it.\n\n\u201cWe are organising the convention, reconciliation is taking place, consensus is taking place, and we believe we will give you the best.\u201d\n\nSale of Forms Ends Friday, March 18\n\nAPC fixed N20 million for purchase of nomination form for the national chairmanship position ahead of the convention. Director of Organisation, Professor Al-Mustapha Medaner, disclosed this in a statement yesterday.\n\nThe sale of nomination forms, which started on Monday, March 14, would close on Friday, March 18.\n\nThe party said CECPC took the decision on the timetable/schedule of activities for the national convention at its 25th regular meeting held on March 14.\n\nAccording to the party, aspirants vying for the position of Deputy National Chairmanship would pay N10 million for nomination form, while nomination forms for other positions in the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party would be sold for N5 million each.\n\nThe ruling party noted that female aspirants and the physically challenged were to pay 50 per cent of the prescribed fees for the positions they were vying for.\n\nHowever, as of Tuesday, the forms for the various party positions were yet to be sold.\n\nBid to Vacate Order Stopping Convention Suffers Setback\n\nEfforts by APC to set aside the court order stopping the party\u2019s scheduled national convention suffered a setback due to legal representation of the party.\n\nThe order delivered on November 18, 2021 by Justice Bello Kawu of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court restrained the party from going ahead with the planned convention.\n\nBy the order, APC was barred from proceeding with the convention on any date, pending the hearing and determination of a suit against the conduct of the convention.\n\nFollowing the discovery of the order and being determined to conduct its convention on March 26, APC had swiftly moved to get the court to vacate the order by filing an application to that effect.\n\nHowever, when the application was called yesterday at the FCT High Court sitting in Kubwa, there was a mild confusion as two lawyers claimed to be representing APC and Buni, the first and second defendants in the suit, respectively. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is the third defendant.\n\nMr. Shuaibu Aruwa and Michael Adoyi, who claimed to be from the chambers of Musa Yakubu, both announced appearance for both APC and Buni.\n\nAruwa said the first and second defendants had briefed him to take over the matter from Yakubu. But Adoyi, who held brief for Yakubu, countered the senior lawyer, stating that his principal has not been debriefed from the matter.\n\nResponding, Aruwa told the court that they had a copy of the letter of instruction to represent the first and second defendants in the matter.\n\n\u201dAfter we were briefed, we filed a notice of change of counsel and we informed counsel in court of the changes and there was no complaint,\u201d he added.\n\nBut Adoyi insisted that his chambers had not been debriefed, adding that the case file is still with him.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe were not served with the hearing notice of this matter today and we did not receive any letter debriefing us. The case file is still with me.\n\n\u201cMai Mala Buni told my principal that the brief is still extant. We are still in this matter representing the first and second respondents.\u201d\n\nFollowing the confusion over the rightful counsel to the first and second defendants, the court observed that the case could not go on as scheduled and, subsequently, announced a short adjournment to enable APC put its house in order.\n\nThe judge said, \u201cHaving heard from counsel, it appears there is disagreement over who the counsel representing the first and second respondents will be.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, order the first and second respondents to write to the court who their counsel is. This matter is hereby adjourned to March 17, 2022.\u201d\n\nKawu had on November 18, 2021, while ruling in an ex-parte application, halted the APC convention to enable him reach a decision in the originating summons by Honourable Salisu Umoru challenging the planned convention.\n\nIn the case with suit number FCT/HC/CV/2958/2021 and motion number FCT/HC/M/9655/21, the plaintiff prayed the court for an Order of interlocutory injunction restraining the first and second defendants and their agents from organising, holding or conducting the national convention of APC in January and February or at any other date either before or after, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe judge after granting the order warned that the subject matter of the case was now subjudice and must not be tampered with.\n\nThe claimant informed the court that the mere inauguration of sub-committees for the March 26 national convention, when the order of the honourable court was in force, was a demonstration of disdain for the rule of law in the country.\n\nLast week, INEC wrote to APC, insisting that the commission does not recognise Bello\u2019s leadership, and also informing APC that it has not performed one of the requisite requirements for a valid NEC meeting or national convention.\n\nIn the letter signed by Secretary to the Commission, Rose Anthony, the attention of APC was drawn to Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act, which provides, \u201cEvery registered political party shall give the commission at least 21 days\u2019 notice of any convention, congress, conference or meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any of the elective offices specified under this Act.\u201d\n\nAPC NEC Meeting Still Holds Thursday\n\nAPC insisted it was going ahead with its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting slated for Thursday. Spokesperson of the party and the National Youth Leader, Mr. Ismaeel Ahmed, stated this yesterday in Abuja while briefing journalists at the end of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) meeting held at the party secretariat.\n\nThe proposed emergency NEC meeting had earlier hit the rock after INEC failed to recognise the leadership of the party under Bello, who signed the notice of the meeting.\n\nBut the decision to go ahead with the NEC meeting means that Buni\u2019s position as Interim Caretaker Chairman is not on the agenda as he and Bello are expected to stand down. It should also be noted that Buni is still on medical leave as the letter he transmitted to Bello is still in force.\n\nAlthough Akpanudoedehe was at the party secretariat yesterday, where he declared that the ruling party was no longer in crisis, his decision not to attend the caretaker committee meeting, which was presided over by former President of the Senate, Ken Nnamani, was an indication that all was still not well with the ruling party.\n\nRegardless, Ahmed told journalists, \u201cWe just finished one of our regular committee meetings. As you are all aware, I told you last Friday that I would be interfacing with you for the next couple of days. I know that there is a couple of information that would go out in writing from the Office of the Director of Organisation. But I just wanted to make a couple of clarifications, because there were a lot of social media reports on the date and activities.\n\n\u201cThe caretaker committee has mandated me to say that the sale of forms has begun for all the offices, both zonal and national. Like I said on Friday, the zonal congresses will now be moved to 26th of March on Saturday. So, there will be no separate zonal congress apart from the national convention. All will happen on the same day.\n\n\u201cOf course, we expect stakeholders from every zone to meet and decide on those things. The prices for the zonal positions, I think that is where there is a bit of misinformation or typographical error.\n\n\u201cThe position of the national chairman has been agreed by the party to be sold at N20 million. The form for the position of the National Secretary is agreed to be sold at the price of N10 million. The forms for the position of Deputy National Chairman (North and South) will be sold at the same N10 million. All other NWC positions will be sold at N5 million.\n\n\u201cAll other NEC positions, those are the deputy positions that are not members of NWC, the forms are going to be sold for N1 million. All positions at zonal level, with the exception of the Zonal Vice Chairman, which is also a member of the NEC, would be sold at N500, 000.\u201d\n\nHe noted that women and physically challenged persons would buy the forms at 50 per cent of the prescribed rates, adding, \u201cConvention is still 26th of March, we are working towards it and we are looking forward to it. We are going to be having our NEC meeting on Thursday, 17th of March.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the secretary of the party was at the secretariat earlier but left before the commencement of the meeting, Ahmed said he was not aware that Akpanudoedehe came.\n\n\u201cWalahi, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not in control of his itinerary. He doesn\u2019t speak to me before he comes to the office, he doesn\u2019t speak to me when he\u2019s leaving. I\u2019m not even aware he was in the office. I personally thought he had travelled,\u201d Ahmed said, stressing that Bello travelled but was back, and would be at the secretariat today.\n\nHe said the party was expecting between 3,000 and 4,000 delegates at the convention.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Explains why he rejected Tinubu as running mate in 2007\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\n\n\nA former Vice President and presidential hopeful, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, said the reason he did not run against his principal\u2019s re-election, former president Olusegun Obasanjo in 2003, was because he wanted to keep the zoning policy of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\n\nAtiku, who spoke when he appeared before the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), also said he refused to make a former governor of Lagos, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, his running mate in the 2007 election, while still in the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), because he didn\u2019t want the Southeast to claim that they were being marginalised.\n\nAtiku also said the south had ruled Nigeria more times than the north since the country returned to democracy. The former Vice President was probably referring to eight years each for former President Olusegun Obasanjo and President Muhammadu Buhari respectively; five years for former President Goodluck Jonathan and three years for late former president Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nBut analysts have drawn the attention of the former vice president to the fact that the argument for power shift by those from Southern Nigeria was firstly, based on the rotation principle that power must go between North and South and that one region cannot have it for 16 years continuously because the other region would be marginalised. Secondly, on balance, the fact is that the North has had more leaders since 1960 than the South.\n\nHowever, continuing, Atiku told the BoT members that: \u201cMany of you were members of our government, when all the PDP governors came in 2003 and said I should run and I say no. We have a creed that power should remain in the Southwest, why should I?\n\n\u201cSome of those governors then that supported me, some of them went to jail, some of them were kicked out of their offices; we made sure that we kept the policy.\n\n\u201cSo, therefore, you cannot come and try to imply that the PDP has not been following the zoning policy. The many years of PDP government eight years and six years all of them were from the south. So, we should not be stampeded by the opposition party. They have a moral obligation which is inescapable.\u201dAtiku told the BoT members.\n\nOn the 2007 issue, he said, rather than pick Tinubu, he picked Senator Ben Obi, to ensure a sense of belonging and inclusiveness for the southeast.\n\nIt was because of this, he also claimed to have chosen a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, in 2019, when they ran on the PDP platform.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen I joined the CAN, which my friend Bola set up, he gave me a set of condition for giving me the ticket; that I should make him vice president. I said no, I\u2019m not going to make you Vice President, instead, I took Senator Ben Obi.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the ticket again to run, I took another Obi coincidentally. So, there is absolutely no reason why they should say that there is deliberate attempts to exclude the South East in political participation or power sharing.\n\n\u201cSo, I thought I should disabuse your mind and ,of course, as an enlightened political class, I don\u2019t think that for me, as far as this party is concerned, as far as we\u2019re concerned, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any deliberate policy to exclude anybody in this country.\n\n\u201cYes, people have not stopped talking about power rotation and zoning, or whatever it is. For sure, in the party, we invented and formulated this zoning policy simply, because we wanted every part of this country to have a sense of belonging and I personally have paid my dues on the issue of zoning.\u201d\n\nOn why the PDP should give him another chance, Atiku said, \u201cNow, I wish to call on you to please give me another opportunity to advance all these ideas of our party, well-beautiful ideas, so that we will come further to consolidate democracy, unity and development for our country.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is based on facts. Take any aspect of our growth whether, it is economy, whether it is healthcare, whether it is agriculture, whether it is education, the landmark achievements we made in 1999 to 2007, have not been matched by any subsequent administration.\n\n\u201cWe are now at a crucial moment in this country. Many of you here, it is either we retire together or we move on together. Somebody said we recorded 12 million votes during the last election. Those are not only my votes, those were our votes. In achieving or recording those 11 million votes, it was all of us and I believe if we work together again, we can surpass those votes.\n\n\u201cAs one of the speakers said, I am worried and you should be worried too that, if we do not win, it means we will be in opposition again for the next eight years. By the next eight years, I don\u2019t know how many of you would be left in politics and it may even ultimately lead to the death of the party, because people gravitate, particularly in developing countries, towards governments.\n\n\u201cOrdinary people naturally gravitate towards government. So, this is a very, very crucial and historical moment in history. For our survival, I want you to think about it,\u201d he said, explaining why he should be given the ticket.\n\nOn his vision, Atiku explained that, \u201cMy vision is building bridges across the country. Please join me in building bridges across this country so that every part of this country will have a sense of belonging.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The battle for the Enugu State Government House, the Lion Building, has assumed a new dimension as members of the State House of Assembly are reportedly being bribed by a cabal in the state government to say that there is a subsisting governorship zoning arrangement in the state.\n\nThe issue of zoning, not development programmes of aspirants, has been a major issue in the build-up to the 2023 general elections.\n\nWhereas some of the state's political leaders like a former governor, Okwesilieze Nwodo, claim there is a zoning arrangement, which favours Enugu East senatorial zone, another former governor, Sullivan Chime had in a November 23, 2018 interview with a newspaper (not SaharaReporters), dismissed such as a fallacy.\n\n\"In 2013, when we were holding a town hall meeting in Nike Lake Hotel, one journalist asked that since I was leaving office, which zone will succeed me as governor. When Chimaroke Nnamani became governor, it wasn\u2019t zoned to Nkanu, he won against somebody from the West, even in his re-election bid. When I contested, it was free for everybody, people from the North, from the East, from the West, the same thing during my re-election. Then I said fate had made it that the East had done their two terms, myself in the second term at the time, I said it will only be fair that we take it to the North to reduce tensions and I promised to work towards it. That was how it happened. We zoned it to the North, not that there was any agreement; it was common sense to reduce problems. I was the leader and I took that decision,\" he had said.\n\nFormer Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who hails from Enugu West zone, had at the weekend declared his intention to vie for the governorship election, saying there was never a zoning agreement in the state\n\nHe said he headed Chimaroke Nnamani's campaign organisation in 1998/1999 and knew that there was no time they discussed succession order noting, however, that the good thing was that power had rotated around the three senatorial districts.\n\n\u201cWhoever is talking about zoning has interest and candidates that they want to put in power.\n\n\u201cBesides, I don\u2019t want to be a zonal governor, but the governor of the entire people of Enugu State,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, reliable sources said there are plans to launch a media campaign to push the narrative that there is a zoning arrangement for the governorship position in the state.\n\nOne of the sources, a member of the State House of Assembly from Enugu North revealed: \"We were summoned up today (Monday) at the Majority Leader's (Hon. Ikechukwu Ezeugwu's) house to sign a document prepared for House Members and LGA Council Chairmen of our (Enugu North) zone to the effect that there is zoning.\n\n\"They will be publishing it soon. They are paying each lawmaker N5 million to sign the document.\"\n\nAnother lawmaker who confirmed the situation said, \"Unfortunately, we thought by now all aspirants should be encouraged to table their programmes on how to end insecurity in Enugu State. There is no water anywhere in the state. The unemployment rate is very high and we're being harassed by our constituents.\"\n\nSaharaReporters also learnt from sources that the state government is moving to zone governorship to Enugu East to rule former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu out of the race.\n\nIt was learnt that Ekweremadu is a dominant force in Enugu West and some prominent people in government, including the state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.\n\n\"You know Ekweremadu was the Deputy Senate President and is serving his fifth term in the Senate. He is a powerbroker in the state and was also instrumental to the emergence of Governor Ugwuanyi. The idea is to cut his wings,\" another source said.\n\nCalls put across by SaharaReporters to the leader of the House, Ezeugwu Ikechukwu were not answered nor returned.

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), now NNPC Limited, failed to account for about 107,239,436 barrels of crude oil lifted for domestic consumption in 2019, records from the office of the Auditor-General for the Federation (AuGF) have shown.\n\nThis was contained in the \"Federal Government of Nigeria consolidated financial statements\" for the year ended December 31, 2019, submitted to the clerk to the National Assembly via a letter dated August 18, 2021, and signed by the Auditor General, Adolphus Aghughu.\n\nNNPC\n\nIn a similar vein, performance report of two depots shows that about 22,929.84 litres of PMS valued at N7.06 billion pumped to the two depots (Ibadan-Ilorin and Aba-Enugu) between June and July 2019 were not received by the depots.\n\nAccording to the report, there were discrepancies between the amounts reported by the NNPC as transfer to the federations account and what was reported by the AuGF.\n\nWhile the NNPC records showed that N1,272,606,864,000.00 was transferred by the corporation, the amount recorded by the Accountant General for the federation was N608,710,292,773.44, showing a discrepancy of N663,896,567,227.58.\n\nThe AuGF said the Group Managing Director of the NNPC should be asked to explain the discrepancy between the two figures and remit the balance of N663,896,567,227.58 to the federation account or face sanctions.\n\nAlso, the sum of N519,922,433,918.46 was transferred to the federation account by the NNPC based on transfer mandates, while demanding that the company provide \u201creconciliation statement for the difference of N88, 787, 862, 853.96 between SGF\u2019s figure of N608, 710, 296, 772.42 and NNPC\u2019s figure per transfer mandate of N519, 922, 433, 918.46.\u201d\n\nIt said: \u201cAudit observed that 107,239,436.00 barrels of crude oil were lifted as domestic crude, while the allocation of crude oil to refineries for a billing date on January 9, to May 29, 2019, was 2,764,267.00 barrels valued at N55,891,009,960.63.\u201d\n\nIt further noted that \u201cInformation on the sale of un-utilised crude oil by refineries for 2019 was not provided, and information on crude oil allocations from May 30, to December 31, 2019, was not provided for scrutiny.\u201d\n\nThe report alleged possible diversion of domestic crude, diversion of sale of un-utilised crude as well as possible loss of federation account revenue, stating that the management of the NNPC failed to respond to the audit query.\n\nThe AuGF said the Group Managing Director of NNPC should justify non-adherence to the transfer of all federation revenue to the federation account as provided by the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and ensure that all revenue is paid into the federation account going forward.\n\nThe report also said that \u201cthe audit examination on \u2018schedule of inflow of revenue\u2019 by NNPC to federation account obtained from the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation revealed that the domestic gas receipts of N4.572 billion was transferred to Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT)-gas in the month of January 2019, and was not made in the subsequent months of the year.\n\n\u201cThis transfer reduced the amount due to Federation Account for the month of January 2019 to the tune of N4.572 billion\u201d leading to possible \u201creduction of distributable revenue in the Federation account, misapplication of fund and diversion of revenue.\u201d\n\nIt said that about 22,929.84 litres of PMS valued at N7,056,137,180.00 pumped to two depots in the country in 2019 were not received by the depots while no reason was advanced by the agency for the non-receipt of the product, demanding that the value of the products be remitted to the federation account.\n\nIt further said that a total of 239,800 barrels of crude oil valued at N5.498 billion was received in Warri and Kaduna refineries respectively between January and December 2019 with the source of the crude not validated due to the absence of source documents, while money was allegedly classified as crude oil losses without duly completed form 146 to be processed for further investigation.",

Iduma Igariwey never participated in the gubernatorial election in 2019. He vied for and won election for the house of representatives to represent Afikpo north and Afikpo south federal constituency. Therefore, he is incapable of being nominated to replace a governor.\n\n\u201cSection 33 of the Electoral Act, 2022 is the nearest law that draws our attention to what should be done in a situation where the general election is yet to be held. The section requires that a political party can substitute its candidate in cases of death or withdrawal by holden a fresh primary election within 14 days from the date of such death or withdrawal.\n\n\u201cBut, in this case, the general election had been concluded with a winner and the first runner up. I emerge the runner up in that election. Therefore, if for any reason the PDP or its candidate gov. Umahi are incapable of continuing in the office of governor and a need to replace them arises, it is only proper that the first runner up in the election is the most legally qualified person to be named as a replacement.\n\n\u201cI hold this strong view because it is the people\u2019s votes for both the party and its candidate that confers the authority to govern and if the votes of a particular party and candidate is no longer reliable, then the next legitimate votes are those of the first runner up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOgbuoji said he has instructed his lawyers \u201cto file an application before the court of appeal in Abuja and the FHC (where a motion for stay of execution is pending) to be joined in the suits so as to ensure that all the issues are resolved adequately in line with our laws\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy most earnest desire is the good of Ebonyi state and our people.

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Sokowatch, an e-commerce company offering tech-enabled supply chain solutions to Africa\u2019s informal retailers, on Wednesday said it has closed a $125 million Series B equity round at a valuation of $625 million, per TechCrunch.\n\nAlongside the new funding, the company has rebranded to Wasoko, which translates to \u201cPeople of the Market\u201d in Swahili and also launched in Abidjan (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Dakar (Senegal), its first locations in West Africa.\n\nInitially launched in Kenya by founder and CEO Daniel Yu in 2015, Sokowatch scaled into neighboring East African markets Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda in 2018. The West Africa expansion thus brings its total markets to 6.\n\nSokowatch explains in a statement its new brand reflects a \u201cshift from its origins as a backend distribution software platform in East Africa to a public brand providing free delivery of essential goods and working capital financing to informal retailers across opposite ends of the African continent\u201d.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhat Wasoko does\n\nMore than $600 billion of consumer goods are sold in Africa through informal retail channels every year, supplying the vast majority of the 1.2 billion population.\n\nDespite its importance, the informal retail sector still remains highly fragmented and inefficient with local shops facing a number of major challenges including frequent stockouts, limited access to capital, and difficulty receiving goods from suppliers.\n\nThrough Wasoko\u2019s platform, informal retailers are able to order products at any time via SMS or mobile app for free same-day delivery to their stores. And leveraging purchasing data, the platform also evaluates retailers to provide them with access to Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) financing.\n\n\u201cInformal retailers capture the vast majority of consumer spending in Africa, and they are dramatically underserved by existing distribution and financial infrastructure,\u201d Andrew Sugrue, Founding Partner at Avenir Growth Capital said on the VC firm\u2019s investment in Wasoko. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about what Wasoko is building and the efficiencies it brings to these retailers and their suppliers.\u201d\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasoko claims to have delivered 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal with revenue growth over the past 12 months at over 500%. It currently has more than 800 full-time employees across Africa.\n\nOn why the company is expanding into francophone West African markets instead of Nigeria, which is arguably the largest market for informal retail in Africa, Yu explains to TechCrunch that the choice reflects the strong growth that its choice countries have exhibited in the region overall.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the past 10 years, both Senegal and Cote d\u2019Ivoire have experienced solid year-on-year GDP growth,\u201d the CEO said. But Wasoko adds it is exploring expansion into Southern Africa and Nigeria nonetheless while continuing to consolidate its position across its six current countries.\n\nA mega-round for the record books\n\nLed by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth Capital, Wasoko\u2019s latest raise is the second-largest venture financing round ever secured by a non-fintech startup in Africa and the largest in the B2B retail e-commerce space, where a host of players like TradeDepot, MarketForce, Omnibiz, Alerzo, and others ply their trade.\n\nThe round comes 2 years after Wasoko closed a $14 million Series A and saw participation from VNV Global; Binny Bansal, co-founder of Flipkart; and Sujeet Kumar, co-founder of Udaan; Quona Capital; 4DX Ventures; and JAM Fund.\n\nThe new capital will enable Wasoko to drive further geographic expansion and product growth across the continent, according to the company.\n\nThe company said it is also examining opportunities to expand its product offering to verticals such as merchant point-of-sale systems, bill payments, and social commerce through both internal innovation as well as strategic investments and acquisitions of relevant companies.\n\nIn addition to the fundraising and rebranding, Wasoko has made several appointments to its senior leadership team.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How the Cameroon Angel Network invests in startups",
          "text": "On a cool evening in the summer of 2016, a group of friends in Cameroon were having a nice time over a bottle of wine.\n\nAfter a while the conversation drifted to the topic of investments and the opportunities that abound in the country. As the conversation got more serious, Serge Nnmatak, then Director of Public Policy at Microsoft; Rebecca Enonchong, founder and Chief Executive Officer of AppsTech; and other friends talked about pooling resources together to start investing in Cameroonian startups.\n\nMembers of the group started attending startup pitches and investing informally, learning the ropes of angel investing along the way. They invested individually in the startups, or collectively invested in a startup pitched by a group member.\n\nAfter two years of doing this and welcoming new members to the group, it was time to make the investing arrangement formal by registering the group.\n\nThis was where they faced their first big challenge.\n\n\u201cWe got a very interesting challenge from the government, because people were asking us, if your organisation\u2019s name is Angel, it means you\u2019re probably a church. You should be registered as a religious group, so follow the registration process for churches,\u201d Nnmatak said over a call.\n\nAfter much back and forth over the span of 2 years, the government officials finally accepted that Cameroon Angel Network (CAN) was not a church and, in 2020, their registration was finalised.\n\nSince then the Cameroon Angel Network has continued to invest in startups and attract new members, mostly entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cWe have a few other people running their businesses or making a living from Cameroon,\u201d Nnmatak said, explaining the composition of the Cameroon Angel Network. \u201cOur members include a former executive at Microsoft, IBM and Oracle who now owns his own business. We have a former CEO of the largest company in Cameroon. We also have people in the diaspora who are investors, some in Silicon Valley, California.\u201d\n\nHe also stressed that to qualify to be a member of the Cameroon Angel Network you just have to be someone who is interested and willing to invest in Cameroonian startups. You don\u2019t need to live in Cameroon or be from Cameroon.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How\u2019s it being like recruiting people to join CAN?\n\nSerge Nnmatak: It\u2019s been mostly through word of mouth. It\u2019s as simple as just mentioning it to someone I come across that I think is a good fit. We all know people within our network.\n\nIt\u2019s important to add here that, in the beginning, we didn\u2019t want too many people. We wanted a few people who were entrepreneurs and could bring something to the table. Now we want to get more people to invest because we\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a lot of money in circulation. However, we need to convince people to spend this money on startups or else they\u2019ll typically build bakeries, hotels, or residential properties.\n\nFor this new set of people, joining the Cameroon Angel Network is no longer just based on personal relationships but through a proper explanation of how angel investing works: how much they can invest, the risk they\u2019re exposed to, and possible returns. We\u2019re going to take a structured and professional approach.\n\nDA: That\u2019s awesome! So what\u2019s different about investing in francophone startups?\n\nSN: I\u2019d like to first point out that Cameroon has a dual culture: you have the French-speaking parts, which is the majority of the population, and the English-speaking regions. (Remember, Cameroon shares borders with Nigeria in Adamawa state.)\n\nNotably, the startup scene started in the anglophone part of Cameroon. Why? The government invested in a small training centre that grew into a full university. It became the bedrock of entrepreneurship and an area now called Silicon Mountain. This helped increase the maturity of entrepreneurs and investors in that region.\n\nOn the francophone side, however, the available body of knowledge was small; there wasn\u2019t much knowledge about how to build a startup. This is because the francophone ecosystem is a bit closed. Here people turn to France a lot, and, until recently\u20142\u20133 years ago\u2014there wasn\u2019t much you could learn from France. France was very inward-looking in terms of entrepreneurship and building startups. Although we\u2019ve made progress in the past 5 years. So the first thing to note about investing in francophone Africa is the maturity of the players in the startup ecosystem.\n\nNext is the market size and sophistication. In terms of market size, Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya are top in Africa. Whereas, while C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for instance\u2014when you look at basic economics today\u2014is the leading country when it comes to Gross Domestic Product (over $60 billion) and has a population of over 20 million people, its wealth is heavily concentrated in Abidjan, the capital. The bulk of the wealth resides in 1 or 2 spots in the country. So it\u2019s difficult to invest in that market.\n\nCameroon, for example, has a similar population size to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, but a different landscape. This is a market, for instance, where our top employers are government-owned enterprises. The top companies in Cameroon are either retail or FMCG companies in the beverage industry. Many of the companies in our economy are geared towards addressing our basic needs.\n\nIn general, however, you have to be careful about generalisation in francophone Africa. There are some common threads, but there are some differences among the countries. It\u2019s no surprise that Wave partly came out of Senegal. Senegal is in a league of its own; it\u2019s a more open country, with an enabling environment for young entrepreneurs. For instance, Senegal was one of the first countries in West and Central Africa to have internet connection\u2014I think back in 1995. It\u2019s also one of the closest African countries to the US and less than 400km away from Brazil.\n\nDA: You mentioned the top companies in Cameroon are in retail and FMCGs. What then are people building in tech?\n\nSN: In the last 5 years, from my perspective, I\u2019d say there have been 3 different startup waves in the market. First, startups were building classifieds, for instance online classifieds and e-commerce platforms, when Jumia launched in Cameroon everyone wanted to do eCommerce.\n\nNext, I saw people building more advanced products that use artificial intelligence. There were a lot of startups trying to facilitate real estate business. There was also a company that was trying to facilitate real time interaction.\n\n\n\nIn the last 2\u20133 years, it\u2019s been more of fintech. Fintech is growing. The good thing about fintech in francophone Africa is that the region is divided into 2 monetary zones. So, while Nigeria and Ghana have separate central banks, we have two central banks and almost the same currency for the 21 countries in francophone Africa.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re able to get authorisation from the central bank and you\u2019re a Cameroonian fintech, what you\u2019ve built for Cameroon is valid for Gabon, Central Africa Republic, Congo, and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nWe\u2019ve also made some progress in health tech. One of the potential success stories we\u2019ve seen is a healthtech company that started out as a platform that enables pregnant women to schedule their hospital visits and control their decision over the course of their pregnancy. Now it\u2019s going to become a fully-fledged tech company.\n\nIn the transportation sector, just like we saw in Nigeria, motorbikes play an important role and offer a big business opportunity. We\u2019ve seen a few players come into that space. Lately, we\u2019ve seen activity in the social impact space like recycling and reusing tires from the road side for other things.\n\nDA: How does the Cameroon Angel network operate now?\n\nSN: We give members the opportunity to come up with proposals and recommendations for a startup that they find fascinating. The member who comes up with the recommendation can get the startup to pitch to us separately during a single session or a pitch demo day.\n\nToday, because we\u2019re still developing the rules, that\u2019s still largely how we operate. The second approach we\u2019re looking at is partnership with local hubs. At the stage that we invest in, seed or pre-seed, we believe it\u2019s important to be very efficient, to have access to the right pipelines of startups. We also expect that these startups have the right background, passing through an incubation program. At the end of the year we want to ensure that 60\u201365% of our portfolio companies are from incubation programs.\n\nWe encourage startups to reach out despite our desire to work with innovation hubs. It helps us feel the pulse of the ecosystems and hear directly from startups.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your average ticket size?\n\nSN: We don\u2019t have a generally agreed ticket size, but usually I\u2019ve mostly seen investments of $1,500\u2013$4,000. We\u2019ve also seen investment go as high as $10,000 or $15,000. Our investment is often matched by Catalytic Africa, a programme by the African Business Angel Network (ABAN) with support from the French government agency. This helps increase the total amount we invest.\n\nEssentially, we work with ABAN to identify 1 or 2 startups that we can invest in, and they\u2019ll match the funding. It increases the size of our ticket and helps amplify the size. In addition to this, It often takes about 2\u20133 months to decide. It varies depending on the startup, sometimes we\u2019ve decided after a week or just a call.\n\nDA: What do you look out for in founders or startups before investing?\n\nSN: I\u2019d say all the investors look for the same thing in startups, they invest and want a return on their money. So we look at similar things like what\u2019s your product, addressable market, traction gained and competition. We also look at the composition of the team in terms of skills and experience. We consider the use of technology or the lack of technology, if you come up with an idea and its game changing, you have to prove that it works.\n\nThe third thing we focus on is progress made so far. There are a lot of startups that only run around, winning awards, but if you look at their track record, they\u2019re not making progress.\n\nDA: Hmm, $4,000 sounds small compared to the million people are raising, is this amount helpful to the startups?\n\nSN: Yes, it\u2019s very helpful to them. We come in at a stage where they\u2019ve just moved from an idea to having a little traction. If we bring in $4,000 and multiply it by 2 or 3 depending on Catalytic Africa\u2019s contribution, that\u2019s about $8,000\u2013$12,000. The amount is significant considering the scale at which the startup operates.\n\nOne more thing we do to ensure the money is helpful is we ask that the money needed be tied to specific projects or activities. We ask them what they need the money for, whether it\u2019s to hire a CFO or buy more tools, and how much it will cost. For example, one of the startups that Catalytic fund invested in alongside us wanted to acquire some motorbikes. This made it easy, as we knew where the money was going. We work with local law firms to do due diligence, some of our members have that background.\n\nDA: How much equity do you ask for in exchange for the amount invested?\n\nSN: There are usually two options: convertible debt or equity. The equity is usually between 0.5\u20133%, depending on the amount invested. Most times we use SAFEs, It\u2019s very rare that we\u2019ll invest in a priced round.\n\nDA: You earlier mentioned ABAN\u2019s catalytic fund support, in what other ways has ABAN supported CAN?\n\nSN: ABAN has been very helpful. An additional challenge investing in Equity/SAFE rounds raises is that we initially struggled a lot with contract law\u2014how to ensure that our investments were bounded by the law.\n\nFrancophone African countries have a common business law framework which doesn\u2019t refer to angel investors and it\u2019s very prescriptive, compared to the business law in most English speaking countries where players are free to create rules. In Francophone Africa if the law doesn\u2019t prescribe it\u2019s difficult to enact.\n\nThis is one area ABAN helped out, by translating these new forms of investing into contractual terms that are in line with our own legal framework. They also made them freely available to ease investments. They also helped in capacity building, by training members of our group on how to invest better.\n\nThe reality is that even me I got into angel investing out of interest. I love innovation, I used to work for Microsoft, I travelled to Seattle and Silicon valley but all of that didn\u2019t mean I understood how things worked.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Meet the Nigerian filmmaker who is taking African art to Hollywood",
          "text": "After months of struggling to sell his artworks, Okedoyin Oluwatosin, a Nigerian artist who displays his pieces at Jakande, a popular market in Lagos, wanted to quit making art. But then, ArtDey, an African online art marketplace, offered to help him sell them, for prices ranging from \u20a650,000 to \u20a6150,000. Okedoyin evolved his art while working with ArtDey, and today, some of his pieces are on display on the international online marketplace, Artsy, selling for as high as $3,000.\n\nArtDey\u2014co-founded in 2020 by Chioma Onyenwe, a 33-year-old filmmaker, and her siblings: Emeka Onyenwe and Adaobi Onyenwe\u2014is an online marketplace that connects contemporary African artists to a global audience. Onyenwe studied economics at the University of Lagos, before going on to the Imperial College in London for a master\u2019s in management. Before going into film full-time in 2013, she had worked in investment banking and consulting for firms such as Chapel Hills and Accenture, for a few years\n\nIn 2013, she got her first job in the film industry as a programme coordinator at the Africa International Film Festival (AFRIFF); she left the organisation last year after some time as its artistic director. In 2014, she benefited from Project Act Nollywood, a programme created by Nigeria\u2019s federal government to fund filmmakers for production and distribution and capacity building. With help from the programme, she produced her first short film 8 Bars and a Clef through her production company, Raconteur Productions, back in 2015. Since then, she has worked across different mediums\u2014theatre, podcasting, and documentary filmmaking.\n\nOnyenwe, who has been collecting African art since 2015, went to collect art in an art market in Kenya in March 2020 but found she could afford only 1 of the 2 paintings she liked. She decided she would return to the art market later for the second painting, but, during that weekend, Kenya recorded its first COVID cases and was set to close its airports. Onyenwe had to take the first flight on Monday back to Lagos. She never went back to the art market, and never got the piece, mostly because there wasn\u2019t a way to move the artworks across countries.\n\nFast forward to June, Onyenwe visited the art markets in places such as Jakande and Muri Okunola in Lagos, but they were empty, and the shops that opened did so on specific days. These markets were tourist attractions, but air travel restrictions, because of COVID, had shrunk their sale of art pieces.\n\nOnyenwe created ArtDey\u2019s website in June 2020 to supply art to collectors outside Nigeria. At the end of June that same year, the website went up. Apart from trying to help relieve the struggles of these artists, Onyenwe revealed that, at the time, she, too, was struggling as the pandemic had destroyed her plans for the year, and she needed to get something to work.\n\nArtDey set out to provide a platform for local and emerging African artists who are not digitally savvy enough to use the internet to connect to a global audience themselves.\n\nArtDey wants to supply art to people who want to buy art simply because they like the work\u2019s colours, or it fits their house curtains; they don\u2019t need to read deep meaning into these pieces. \u201cEverybody can own a piece of African original art.\u201d\n\nArtDey organises physical pop-ups\u2014and has done 8 of them\u2014to introduce art to people who wouldn\u2019t normally go into galleries, by going to public spaces, such as bars, and selling art pieces for prices ranging from \u20a630,000 to \u20a6200,000. This pricing, Onyenwe noted, was to help buyers make a decision on the go. The pop-ups have taken place in Abuja, Lagos, and Copenhagen.\n\nOnyenwe noted that the pop-ups and exhibitions were prompted by Nigerians\u2019 consumer behaviour which makes it difficult to sell art pieces that were sometimes above the country\u2019s minimum wage without a physical presence. Nigerians, she noticed, are not used to standard-sized measurements which are important to selecting art pieces\u2019 sizes. \u201cIf I tell a customer an art piece is 42 inches by 42 inches, for example, they wouldn\u2019t know what that looks like. They tend to ask to see if it can fit the space in their house.\u201d This is because their buyers are not your traditional collectors who probably have bigger houses and have experience in interacting with African art. So, the people we sell to tend to buy for functionality.\u201d\n\nInitially, ArtDey found it difficult to convince local artists that they weren\u2019t a swindler trying to rip them off by taking pictures of their art and replicating it. But the artists got convinced as soon as their pieces sold. ArtDey only picks up the art it displays from the artist online when it sells it. This gives the artists the opportunity to sell on their own. Today, these artists are leaving their pieces with ArtDey and even creating collections for ArtDey.\n\nOnyenwe noted that they have higher margins from the sales that come from the website compared to the pop-ups, even though they have sold more pieces from the pop-ups, exhibitions, and open houses.\n\nArtDey in Bel-Air\n\nFela by Chukwuemeka Image hanging in the background of a scene in the ongoing series, Bel-Air.\n\nIn the last quarter of 2020, ArtDey tried to target Nigerians and Africans in the diaspora, whom it suspected most likely felt an affinity to African art. It started cold emailing set designers and cinematographers, but despite interest, no production house took up their offer; lockdowns had not been completely lifted, so production had not properly opened up.\n\nNormally, filmmakers acquire a licence from artists to use a replica of their works on set, but Onyenwe wanted to get the original works to these filmmakers at a lower cost.\n\nMorgan Cooper, Bel-Air\u2019s director, expressed interest in ArtDey\u2019s artworks. So, Bel-Air, a re-imagination of the award-winning 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, bought over 10 art pieces belonging to artists on the streets of Lagos: such as Bright Osodalor, Abiola Daniel, and Bertha Onyekachi, from ArtDey.\n\nWhen ArtDey launched, it had 3 artists on board and sold 5 pieces in its first week. Today, it has been in operation for 20 months and has sold about 300 pieces.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there!\n\nEmmanuel here,\n\nAfrica\u2019s tech space is witnessing massive highs, and the media has ridden on that wave. But sometimes, we have to ask, how much of Africa\u2019s big picture narratives affect our everyday lives?\n\nLet\u2019s ponder on that as we discuss:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpleet\u2019s $625k raise\n\nJumia\u2019s ailing stocks\n\nSouth Africa vs Meta\n\nSpleet\u2019s $625k pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s prop-tech startup, Spleet, has raised $625k preseed led by MetaProp VC. Other investors, including Future Africa, FEDHA Capital, VFD Group, Moonshot VC, HoaQ, CEO of Squarefoot, Jonathan Wassersturm, CEO of Flutterwave, Gbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola, also participated in the round.\n\nSpleet plans to build financial services solutions for landlords and tenants in Africa. Planned features include tenant vetting and payment automation for landlords and a rent-now-pay-later option for tenants.\n\nWhy this matters: Renting apartments is notoriously tricky in major African cities. Both landlords and tenants are unsure what they\u2019re getting into by signing a tenancy agreement. Based on my personal bias, I believe Lagos takes the cake.\n\nDecent housing in suitable environments are rarely affordable, and affordable houses are rarely ever decent. Adding in a mix of religious, cultural, and tribalistic bias, then you\u2019re stuck with an impossible situation.\n\nWhere Spleet comes in: Spleet\u2019s overall mission is to make housing easier in Africa, but its current solution, like other proptech companies, is targeted at the premium end.\n\nSpleet CEO, Tola Adesanmi acknowledged that Spleet\u2019s initial housing marketplace did not address the grating affordability problem. He believes that the rent-now-pay-later financing solution would plug this gap.\n\nThe big picture: A financing solution only addresses part of the problems mentioned above. Frankly, only people of a relatively higher earning cadre would opt to finance an apartment that costs \u20a62 million per year ($4,000). Considering other solutions available in the space, the industry appears wide-open for further disruption.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ll leave you with this piece: Why solving Nigeria\u2019s housing problem is beyond proptech startups for now\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumia\u2019s crashing stocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, I regretted not buying Jumia shares, considering how much it appreciated. Today, the eCommerce company, publicly traded in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), experienced a one year low as its stocks dipped to $6.5.\n\nIn trouble regardless: In its earnings report, Jumia posted improved earnings in Q4 2021, but the overall outlook for the year remained shaky. Orders and Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) only increased marginally, but losses quadrupled to $52.5 million.\n\nRecall that for most of 2020, Jumia pushed for profitability and shifted its focus from electronics (which had higher value but less volume) to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs), which meant high volume but less value per order. It also cut down on marketing expenses.\n\nThe outcome? Jumia\u2019s losses were reduced, but so did its monthly orders and revenue.\n\nRead: 18 months into a new strategy, how close is Jumia to profitability?\n\nA U-turn: The company has reignited aggressive marketing and advertising while maintaining its focus on FMCGs.\n\nOutcome? Monthly orders, users, and revenue are increasing, but, predictably, its losses are skyrocketing once more.\n\nThe big picture: Despite its well-documented struggles, African entrepreneurs and a handful of investors are still betting on eCommerce in Africa. There\u2019s a whole lot to rummage through here.\n\nCheck this out: Betting $165 million on Africa\u2019s B2B eCommerce in 2021\n\nMeta and antitrust in South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dima Solomin on Unsplash\n\nIf you\u2019re a keen observer of global tech or a fan of Wondery\u2019s business wars, you can probably guess what\u2019s coming. A big tech company facing anti-trust allegations is, pretty much, par for the course.\n\nFacebook\u2019s parent company, Meta, could face prosecution from the South African Competition Commission for placing restrictions on the government-owned platform, GovChat. According to the regulator, Meta had prevented the citizen-engagement platform from using its WhatsApp business APIs.\n\nWhat is GovChat? The South African government created GovChat in 2018 as a citizen engagement platform that uses the WhatsApp business API to aid real-time alerts and complaints on civic issues like potholes, faulty government facilities, COVID-19 distress, and social security applications.\n\nIt reportedly has 8.7 million active users and has processed over 582 million messages.\n\nThe elephant in the building: The regulator alleges that WhatApp Business\u2019 terms are designed to insulate it from any competition which the GovChat platform could present, but Meta completely denies this, stating that GovChat had breached terms by signing people up without going through WhatsApp\u2019s onboarding process.\n\nThe big picture: Like I pointed out earlier big tech companies might be expecting antitrust allegations every day of the week. The likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft have been caught up in this web.\n\nRead more: Meta faces prosecution in South Africa for alleged antitrust breach\n\nInterested in diving deeper into this issue, especially as it relates to Africans?

This influenced the decision to set up a banking service that is simple and easy to access without being physically present at the bank.\n\nThe digital bank started with 5,000 users and has been in operations since March 2021. Currently, they have over 250,000 registered users. They aim to have 300,000 users in the nearest future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, RavenBank has Nigerian customers in the diaspora who bank with them. These customers have to register with their National Identification Number (NIN) and Bank Verification Number (BVN).\n\nApart from providing fast banking services(bills payment, transfers, deposits), RavenBank also offers overdraft services for small businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe launch, led by Uchenna E. Nnodim, Chairman, RavenBank, had partners and other firms in attendance.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nTime was when funding announcements in Africa hovered around the $1 million mark. These days, a typical week has at least one startup announcing over $100 million.\n\nSpeaking of startups, last Friday, we hosted a few people at the first edition of Pitch Friday this year, and it was amazing. Two startups were pitched, and the founders were grilled on various aspects of their business.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately \u2014 depending on how you look at it \u2014 it is held once a month, so you can\u2019t attend this week, but you can participate next month. Watch this space as we\u2019ll inform you when the time is near.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust before we get into the business of the day, could you please take a minute to share this newsletter with three people you know? We write these insightful beauties every weekday and would love more people to read the gospel of tech.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get into today\u2019s stories.\n\nWe\u2019re discussing financial services for supply chain SMEs, vehicle financing by Moove, and salary-on-demand.\n\nA neobank for Africa\u2019s supply chain SMEs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few weeks ago, I was speaking with a female startup founder when I asked what she felt could be done to increase the number of African startup founders who are women. Her response was simple: employ more women. Looking at Pivo, a startup founded by an all-female team, I would say she was right.\n\nPivo was founded by Nkiru Amadi-Emina and Ijeoma Akwiwu. The two co-founders, who have been friends for over eight years, have about a decade of experience in IT roles and law. Amadi-Emina previously founded Jalo, a logistics startup acquired by Kobo360, while Akwiwu has held legal positions in tech companies and has a Master\u2019s degree in software engineering.\n\nWhat does Pivo do? In simple terms, provide financial services for small and medium businesses operating in Africa\u2019s supply chain sector. These services include loans which it has started with its flagship offering \u2014 Pivo Capital \u2014 asset financing, inventory financing, and corporate account services.\n\nThe startup, founded in 2021, has recorded impressive growth, disbursing over $1 million in less than a year to approximately 200 customers while catching the eye of investors who have invested an undisclosed amount into the startup. The investors include Microtraction, ODX accelerator, Mercy Corps Ventures, Ventures Platform, FirstCheck Africa, and Bold Angel Fund.\n\nCurrently operating in Nigeria, the startup has plans to dominate African trade. There\u2019s more to this story, and you can read it here: How Pivo is providing fast and reliable financial services for Africa\u2019s supply chain businesses\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoove\u2019s plan for vehicle financing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoove\u2019s founders, Jide Odunsi and Ladi Delano\n\nIn Lagos, Nigeria, commuting using public transportation can be an unpleasant experience for anyone. A combination of the sturdy wooden benches in danfos, uncouth drivers, poor road conditions, and traffic congestion that often defies logic is enough to set commuters on edge. It\u2019s no wonder residents of the city can be easily provoked into starting a fight.\n\nFortunately for a select group of people, ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt provide an alternative, albeit more expensive. These companies onboard drivers who use their vehicles or lease vehicles from others to transport passengers.\n\nWith approximately 15 million inhabitants, there is potentially a huge market for mobility entrepreneurs, aka taxi drivers, in the city. However, with soaring car costs, only a few can afford to buy vehicles for this purpose.\n\nThis is the problem that mobility fintech startup, Moove, plans to solve. The startup, founded in 2019 by Ladi Delano and Jide Odunsi, co-CEOs and Co-founders, provides drivers with a financing option, enabling them to own their cars rather than borrow cars from vehicle owners.\n\nYesterday, Monday, March 14, 2022, the startup announced that it had raised $105 million in a Series A2 round that brings the total funding raised by the company to $174.5 million. The round had a mix of new and existing investors, including Left Lane Capital, Speedinvest, thelatest.ventures, AfricInvest, MUFG Innovation Partners, Kreos Capital, and Latitude Investment Management.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funds to drive its expansion across Asia, Europe, and the MENA region. Also, it intends to provide financing for a broader range of vehicles, including trucks, bikes, three-wheelers, and buses.\n\nIn a statement, Julius Tichelaar, Partner at AfricInvest, said, \u201cAt AfricInvest, we are focused on supporting, and growing companies that we believe will go beyond their own borders and become regional champions.\n\n\u201cLadi and Jide have proven that Moove has the potential to transform the lives of millions of people across the continent, and we\u2019re delighted to be supporting them as they expand Moove in Africa and beyond into more emerging markets. Through the AfricInvest FIVE Fund, we\u2019re incredibly proud to be joining Ladi, Jide and all the Moovers on their exciting journey of disrupting financial services.\u201d\n\nSalary-on-demand with Cadana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCadana team\n\nThere\u2019s some sort of hope and renewed vigour you can feel among many working-class Nigerians from the 20th day of any month. The reason for this is quite simple: it is less than a week before payday.\n\nIn Nigeria and most parts of Africa, salaries are paid once, in the last week of the month. But employees often need money before payday. A school of thought advises that you cut your coat according to your size, but sometimes, you don\u2019t even have enough materials to do that.\n\nThe usual solution is loans with high-interest rates for many people, but Albert Owusu-Asare and Ameer Shujjah believe their new startup, Cadana can solve this problem. In addition to other services, Canada provides salary-on-demand for employees. They do this by partnering with employers to set a cap for how much employees can access before the month runs out.\n\nAs exciting as the business sounds, it throws up some questions. What happens when an employer does not pay salaries at the right time? What happens if an employee withdraws part of their salary then bolts without performing tasks that justify the amount taken?\n\nBolu Abiodun does an excellent job of providing answers to these questions in this article: Inside Cadana\u2019s plan to provide salary-on-demand without payback or interest\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nHave a great day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Aliko Dangote, chairman and chief executive of Dangote Group, Nigeria\u2019s largest company, warned last week of an impending food scarcity by June as the adverse consequences of the Russian-Ukraine war shake Nigeria\u2019s fragile economy.\n\nBut June is when Nigeria\u2019s political parties will be concluding their primaries and submitting the names of their flag-bearers to the electoral commission ahead of elections in 2023.\n\nWhat this means is that Nigeria\u2019s leaders are more likely to mark June in their calendars for the conclusion of who represents their parties rather than the month earmarked for a likely food scarcity.\n\nA looming food shortage is not the only problem facing Nigeria.\n\nFrom manufacturers to airlines and bakers, several businesses are threatening shutdown over the ripple effect of the Russia-Ukraine war, which has led to soaring diesel, aviation fuel and petrol prices at a time public power supply is dwindling.\n\nThe internal crisis in the ruling political party is, however, arguably of more interest to President Muhammadu Buhari, who is receiving medical attention in London, than an economy bleeding on every side.\n\nThe most notable news to emerge from Buhari\u2019s medical trip to London is that he has waded into the crisis in his party by backing embattled Mali Buni, the governor of Northeastern Nigerian state, Yobe, to continue as chairman of the party after meetings with some politicians.\n\nBuhari may be distracted by politics at this time but so are several others in top leadership positions in Nigeria.\n\nThe Vice President, left in charge while Buhari, who is seeing out his second term as president, is away, is also said to be interested in contesting with veteran politician and one-time governor of Lagos state, Bola Tinubu, for the nod of the APC to run for President in 2023.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, is also under pressure to run for President by supposed friends who have been vocal in asking him to throw his hat in the ring.\n\nVarious groups, no fewer than a dozen, have bought advert spaces in newspapers to make a case for Emefiele to succeed Buhari in 2023.\n\nAs the leaders of Nigeria are distracted by politics, Nigeria\u2019s economic woes are deepening.\n\nThe impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, which began with the steep rise in wheat prices, may soon spread to other foods including maize and other components of input for industrial food production, triggering low production and low supply, according to Dangote.\n\nRussia and Ukraine account for about 30 percent of the world\u2019s urea production and 26 percent of the world\u2019s potassium supply, and access to these input components will increasingly be stifled for as long as the war persists and could cripple the goal to fortify staples from source.\n\nThe impact is already being felt. Headline inflation in Nigeria accelerated in February to 15.7 percent, reflecting a 14bps jump in core inflation to 14.0 percent, the fastest jump since April 2017.\n\nThe core inflationary pressures mirrored the recent surge in the cost of energy-related products. Specifically, energy inflation touched a 56-month high of 13.1 percent, driven by a prolonged period of fuel scarcity and higher diesel and aviation fuel prices.\n\nRead also: Power cuts exposes Nigeria\u2019s diesel-dependent economy\n\nNigeria has faced petrol shortages since February following the importation of substandard fuel, resulting in weeks of severe scarcity and long queues at filling stations.\n\nThe shortage has seen transport cost rise and is slowingly affecting the prices of goods and commodities.\n\nPrices are expected to rise further amid a global shortage made worse by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Without functional refineries, Africa\u2019s largest oil producer relies almost entirely on imported petroleum products.\n\nThe surge in energy prices is also fuelling rising operation costs for several businesses with some threatening a shutdown, which would lead to even higher unemployment rate in a country that has the second largest percentage of unemployed people globally and the world\u2019s highest number of poor people.\n\nDiesel prices have nearly tripled since the start of the year, with manufacturers facing higher operational costs.\n\nHigher crude oil prices could be fingered for the surge but Nigeria would be less dependent on diesel if power supply was stable.\n\nNigeria\u2019s installed power capacity (12,522 megawatts) is five times less than South Africa\u2019s (58,095MW), the continent\u2019s second largest economy and home to about a third of Nigeria\u2019s population. That leaves large swaths of Nigeria reeling from under supply and with urgent need of generating independent power to keep the lights on through diesel or petrol generators.\n\nFor most businesses in Africa\u2019s largest economy, stable power in smaller countries from Ghana to Rwanda is a luxury.\n\n\u201cWe are not even asking for 24 hours power supply, we can make do with 20 hours,\u201d said Frank Onyebu, chairman of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria for Apapa branch.\n\n\u201cManufacturers are closing shop on the back of the rising diesel prices which is biting really hard,\u201d Onyebu said.\n\nLocal airlines in Nigeria also have concerns of their own. They say they may have to shut down operations this week over lack of aviation fuel which has nearly quadrupled to N670 from only N190 this year.\n\nSpeaking before the special House committee investigating the unavailability of the product with the aim of proffering solutions, the airlines, represented by Allen Onyema, chief executive officer of Airpeace, said they could not afford the fuel anymore.\n\nOnyema said that if they were to continue flying, an average Nigerian would spend N120,000 for an economy ticket.\n\nMeanwhile, banks are rationing dollars again. That\u2019s in spite of higher oil prices.\n\nFrom Zenith to Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria\u2019s largest banks are reducing dollar spending limits on local currency cards to free more resources to fund imports after the central bank signalled it will stop foreign-exchange sales to banks.\n\nThe CBN said last month it would stop selling foreign currency to lenders by the end of the year to encourage them to source their own dollars and also support the government\u2019s target to lure $200 billion of inflows yearly by 2025.\n\nThe regulator has struggled to fulfill its dollar obligations to portfolio investors since 2020 after oil prices collapsed.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that the central bank has a backlog of $1.7 billion in unmet demand to investors. That backlog has kept investors on the sidelines and unwilling to touch Nigeria with a ten-foot pole.\n\nThe rally in oil prices, which should trigger increased dollar inflows, is not having the desired impact due to low oil production.\n\n\u201cAt a time that oil prices are going up, exports from the East, for all producers going into Bonny terminal, are grounded,\u201d a source in the oil industry told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cSince 2020, the level of crude oil loss has progressively risen to the point in February there was very limited inflow into the terminal from the (Trans Niger Pipeline) TNP. Shell was obliged to call force majeure. The hit on forex inflow will be felt in 30 days, It\u2019s really pouring,\u201d the source said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s foreign trade deficit widened to a record N1.94 trillion in 2021 as the cost of importing commodities exceeded the value of the country\u2019s exports, official data released on Tuesday show.\n\nThis is 986 percent wider than a deficit of N178.2 billion recorded in 2020 as Africa\u2019s biggest economy continues to grapple with low oil production and higher import bills.\n\nThe country imported N20.8 trillion worth of goods in 2021, 64 percent higher than the N12.7 trillion recorded in the previous year, according to a report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Tuesday.\n\nIts exports jumped 51 percent to N18.9 trillion in 2021 from N12.5 trillion the year before.\n\n\u201cThe wider trade deficit in 2021 is reflective of twin pressures from exports and imports. Despite the rally in crude prices, significant underproduction of crude oil has meant Nigeria is yet to enjoy the full benefits of higher crude prices,\u201d said Ayorinde Akinloye, a research analyst at United Capital Plc.\n\nOil price averaged $70.54 per barrel in 2021, compared to $39.95/bbl in 2020. However, the benefits have eluded Nigeria as the country\u2019s average oil production plunged to 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 from 1.5 million bpd in 2020. This is low, considering that the country produced 2.5 million bpd in 2011.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit hit N1.94 trn in 2021\n\nCrude oil exports, which account for more than half of Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange earnings, rose 53 percent to N14.4 trillion in 2021 from N9.4 trillion. On the other hand, non-crude oil exports hit N4.49 trillion, 46 percent higher than N3.08 trillion in 2020. This however did little to close the deficit.\n\nAkinloye noted that import bills continued to rise due to the weak currency and imported inflation.\n\n\u201cStronger consumer demand following recovery from the pandemic has supported a higher import bill. As a result, import growth continues to outpace export growth significantly, resulting in further pressure on external conditions reflected in wider trade deficit,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NBS shows that the country\u2019s total foreign trade grew 58 percent to N39.8 trillion in 2021 from N25.2 trillion the previous year.\n\n\u201cSome of our foreign exchange policies are not also helping to promote export because the exchange rate is not flexible and this is penalising export,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, an economist and CEO of Centre for Promotion of Private Enterprise.\n\nYusuf, a former head of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also explained that some exporters are not declaring their figures officially because when they bring their export proceeds, they would be asked by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to exchange at N416/$.\n\n\u201cThis has led to many underground transactions or many take their goods to neighbouring countries for export.\u201d\n\nBefore 2020, the last time Nigeria recorded a deficit was during the recession of 2016. It recorded a surplus of N4.03 trillion, N5.36 trillion and 2.23 trillion in 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the trade deficit narrowed to N1.99 billion from N312 billion in 2020.\n\nThe top three countries that accounted for the highest share in Nigeria\u2019s total exports in Q4 2021 were India (15.17 percent), Spain (13.69 percent) and France (8.42 percent). China (27.8 percent), Belgium (10.3 percent) and India (7.24 percent) were the countries Nigeria imported the most goods from during the period.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, for Nigeria to see a better performance in exports, the CBN needs to liberalise its foreign exchange policy so that exporters can have free access to their foreign exchange.\n\nOn the import side, he added that Nigeria needs to explore ways to substitute its import by local production. \u201cIf we have scaled up our refining capacity, we would be saving a whole lot in terms of oil import and that will help our trade balance,\u201d Yusuf said.",

          "title": "Nigeria facing unprecedented budget shortfall, says EIU",
          "text": "Analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) have said Nigeria\u2019s fiscal situation will worsen considerably this year under the weight of soaring energy prices, which should otherwise have been a blessing, with budget deficit rising to six per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation surging past 16 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe will revise up our inflation projection of 13.7 percent in 2022, probably to within the 15-16 percent range, to account for global supply shocks,\u201d the analysts said in their report published Tuesday.\n\n\u201dWe will also modify our fiscal deficit forecast for 2022, from 4.5 percent of GDP to about six percent, which would be the highest since the 1990s.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the situation of Nigeria is being compounded by \u201cunderwhelming crude oil production, of about 1.3m barrels/day on average over the past 12 months (which is 400,000 barrels shy of Nigeria\u2019s current OPEC+ target production quota, owing to disinvestment and theft), has been netting out recent price gains.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s current oil production level is now half what it was in 1992, hobbled by a woeful management of the industry by the government. Shell, the Anglo-Dutch energy giant, which produced about 900,000 barrels of oil in 1992, has seen its production fall to a mere 200,000 barrels today.\n\nThe report said, \u201cNigeria is encountering a mini-crisis regarding petrol. In early February, the authorities withdrew adulterated petrol from circulation, after it emerged that an unsanctioned blend was causing the breakdown of motor vehicles and shutdowns of emergency power-generation equipment.\n\n\u201cPetrol grew scarce, and the regulated price became hard to manage. Nigeria\u2019s state oil firm, NNPC Limited, raced to fill the gap, but Russia invaded Ukraine shortly after, exacerbating Nigeria\u2019s fuel-supply crisis. Surging energy prices since the conflict began are inflaming price expectations and motivating speculative behaviour, including hoarding.\u201d\n\nThe precarious situation of the continent\u2019s largest economy is also a drag on the growth of the private sector and a pain in the neck of ordinary Nigerians.\n\nRead also: Russia-Ukraine conflict adds to MPC\u2019s inflation headache\n\nBrent crude oil prices breached the $130/barrel mark in early March, raising the prices of fuel products like diesel and petrol in tandem. Most Nigerian firms and businesses rely on stand-by diesel generators for electricity supply.\n\nOver the last one month, diesel prices, which are not regulated like petrol, rose by more than two-folds to as high as N625 (US$1.5)/litre in the first week of March, and there is little sign of relief any time soon as the Russian-Ukrainian war weighs on global supply chains.\n\nRegulated petrol prices have become volatile too, reportedly rising unofficially to as high as N220/litre as fuel marketers impose varying premiums under the counter on the regulated price of N165/litre.\n\nAnnual inflation stood at 15.6 percent year-on-year in January, unchanged from the December rate. In 2021, there was a general trend towards disinflation. Recent developments indicate renewed upward inflationary pressure in 2022, although increases will be limited by petrol prices staying anchored near the official price.\n\nThe EIU report said, \u201cThe authorities\u2019 planned fuel subsidy bill of N3trn (US$7.2bn) for 2022 could be nearly twice as much by end-2022, if Brent crude oil prices remain elevated (we expect US$116/b in 2022).\n\n\u201cAn upwardly revised fiscal deficit projection of 4.9 percent of GDP for 2022 by the authorities, owing to the continuation of fuel subsidy, could easily rise to as high as six percent of GDP as the government insists on footing the burgeoning bill to avoid a political backlash ahead of a crucial general election in 2023. Ideally, higher crude oil prices should boost the public purse.\u201d",

It\u2019s that risk we try to mitigate by encouraging them not to migrate through the Sahara Desert.\n\n\u201cWe accepted the problem facing us and set up a taskforce to deal with the problem. We took up the responsibility of resettling returnees, tackling the root cause of the problem, dealing with perpetrators and understanding migration in the context of development.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that what is happening in the country today and the very difficult economic situation that is emerging will put pressure on young people to want to travel again. I don\u2019t believe that our response should be the same as we did in Migration 1.0 as we may not be able to prevent irregular migration,\u201d Obaseki added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cOur strategy for Migration 2.0 is to work with destination countries and the federal government to look for pathways for regular migration. Post-COVID-19, a lot of the destination countries require labour and we have no excuse not to prepare our people properly to migrate safely.\n\n\u201cWe will discuss with the Italian Ambassador as we strategize on how to prepare and structure proper labour contracts, train and prepare our people to travel and do their job regularly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Migration 2.0, we would expect you to work closely with us to look at the data we have and support some other intervention programmes that we have. Migration 2.0 for us, is that every player in the spectrum needs to sit across the table with us to enable us to know what you are doing and how to optimise resources together to strengthen our partnership, reducing waste and achieving more,\u201d Obaseki noted\n\nReassuring that his government will create more opportunities to support women and build structures that will allow them to achieve their fullest potentials, Obaseki further stated, \u201cIn Edo State, we will encourage our women to come up and be part of the political process to ensure we have equal female representation in the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe are happy with the representation in the executive and judiciary. Our task is to make sure that in Edo State, our women have due representation in the legislature.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Dankabo commended Obaseki commended Obaseki for his affirmative action for women in his cabinet and the government\u2019s commitment to the fight against human trafficking and illegal migration.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "As anticipated, several healing, marriage, financial testimonies and miracles were recorded at the just concluded Next Level Prayers Conference in Ibadan. The conference which held in the evening hours of Sunday March 6 at Jogor event centre, Ibadan has gone down as one of the most heavily attended gospel events to be held in Ibadan this year. Over 7,000 people were reported to have come in from different parts of the state to attend the conference. \u201cThe numbers beat our projections\u201d, said a member of the organising team.\n\nThe hall was filled beyond its capacity such that the car parks and exterior parts of the premises were used to accommodate the swelling mammoth crowd. The conference began at 4pm, yet up till 7pm, more and more people were pressing for access into the premises just to have a glimpse of the conference and benefit from the sermon and prophecy of Pastor Bolaji Idowu.\n\nAt the conference, Pastor Bolaji, the convener, ministered healings and made firm declarations in his usual prophetic fashion and indeed the testimonies came through. Amongst several testimonies recorded were the healings of decades of arthritis, partial blindness, deafness, inflamed knee caps and pains. \u201cI thank God for my healing and Pastor Bolaji for doing God\u2019s work. For the first time in years, I can hear with both ears\u201d, one of the testifiers said.\n\nA woman who could not walk for over 10 years stood to her feet and walked without assistance. A young lady who had been experiencing excruciating pains on her wrist, testified that the pains had ceased. There was also a testimony of a man who could not walk properly because of a severe pain in his knee. That day, he moved around without feeling any sign of pains.\n\nIt was a futile attempt trying to count the number of joyous testifiers who received their miracles, however, over 500 instant testimonies were recorded. As they took turns to share their testimonies, shouts of amazement and excitement filled the premises and environs in gratitude to God.\n\nAnother high point of the conference was the music ministration of Big Bolaji, a prolific gospel music minister and mellifluous worship of the music team \u2013 The exalted tribe. As they raised songs of praise and worship, the crowd danced and gave glory to God. From the camera feed which displayed the scene in overflow, it was shown that the atmosphere outside was as electric as it was inside the hall.\n\nIt was an amazing night altogether. Pastor Bolaji shared that the next train of the Next Level Prayer conference will be moving to Ghana in April. Another iconic event to look forward to.",

          "text": "Jostle for the 2023 vice president ticket has sparked fresh crisis among northern governors in the All Progressives Congress (APC) as they are locked in a bitter battle for the slot.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that based on the zoning arrangement where all elective positions would be swapped between North and South, and the national chairmanship slot already zoned to the North Central, four two-term northern governors immediately revved up machinery to secure the vice presidential ticket in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nWith the South expected to produce the APC candidate for the 2023 presidential poll, the battlelines became drawn between North West and North East governors. Three North West governors, it was learnt, began to individually plot how to get the ticket.\n\nBut, information soon filtered out that a first-term governor from the North East was favoured by party apparatchiks for the VP ticket and the centre couldn\u2019t hold among the five governors jostling for the slot from the region.\n\nA senior APC chieftain, privy to the matter, detailed the genesis of the crisis among the APC governors.\n\n\u201cInitially, four northern governors were on the same page, but when the zoning formula was released, that the North would swap all elective positions with the South, things went awry.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that, one of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s associates from the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party and, also, the Congress for Progressive Change days approached the Chairman of the Caretaker, Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, that he was interested in the position of Deputy National Chairman (North) and needed the president\u2019s support before he could declare his interest openly. He begged Buni for support, and also, to get the support and buy-in of the president.\n\n\u201cBuni obliged him, and took him to the Presidential Villa and disclosed his ambition to the president. The president neither opposed nor endorsed the former lawmaker for the position.\n\n\u201cBut, words soon filtered to his state governor, whose state borders Kano. The governor was peeved that Buni went to introduce his \u2018arch-enemy\u2019 to Buhari because the permutation is that if the president eventually endorses the former lawmaker\u2019s ambition, it would affect the governor\u2019s VP chances.\n\n\u201cAlso, another cause of affront among the ranks of the northern governors is that two North East governors are being considered as vice president and the plan leaked to their North West counterparts. They felt it was time to move against Buni by aligning with governor-colleagues who were angry that the Yobe governor was not \u201ccarrying them along\u201d as they believed \u2018he could no longer be trusted.\u201d",

          "text": "A gang of terrorists reportedly killed three police officers and four local vigilantes, including the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Nasko in Magama local government area of Niger state.\n\nThe criminal elements were said to have attacked Nasko town Tuesday afternoon during which the police gallantly repelled the attack, with the DPO and others however, felled in the battle.\n\nBut scores of the terrorists were also neutralised by the police in the gun duel.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Niger state police command, DSP Wasiu Abiodun confirmed the incident in a statement in Minna Tuesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn 15/03/2022 at about 1300hrs, armed bandits/terrorists invaded Nasko village, Magama LGA of Niger State. Police operatives with vigilante members were immediately mobilised by DPO Nasko and engaged the bandits in a fierce gun battle in which some the hoodlums were neutralised and others escaped with gunshot injuries.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Abidoun said, during the gun battle, the DPO, two other policemen, and four vigilante members lost their lives.\n\n\u201cArea Commander, Kotangora immediately drafted reinforcement with the military personnel to the area to forestall break down of law and order,\u201d the statement further said.\n\nThe PPRO said the state\u2019s Commissioner of Police, Monday Bala Kuryas, has condoled with the families of officers and vigilante members, who lost their lives in the unfortunate incident,\n\nKuryas reassured members of the public that the Command would not be deterred or relent in its effort to curb terrorism in the state.\n\nKebbi too\n\nAlso in Kebbi state, an unspecified number of terrorists in Danko/Wasagu local government area of Kebbi state, crossed over to Ngaski local government area of the state, killing four police officers and one civilian in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nA source told Blueprint in a telephone interview that the hoodlums launched the attack during the day.\n\nThe terrorists were also reported to have visited GB Foods Africa limited- a Chinese company which is second largest factory in Nigeria that specialised in production of Tomatoes paste.\n\nThough the terrorists, according to our source, had earlier sent a message three days ago to both residents and the company management, notifying them of their intent to attack them.\n\nIt was also gathered that residents of Ngaski town had to flee the area for safety while the Chinese expatriates were put under safety and evacuated to Yauri enroute Birnin Kebbi, the state capital.\n\nWhen contacted, spokesman of the state Police command, SP Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed the report, adding that the gallant police officers died while serving their nation.\n\nOn Thursday, 17th June 2021, the bandits had abducted over one hundred students and eight teachers of Federal Government College Birnin yauri in Yauri emirate.\n\nINEC raises the alarm\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said eligible voters from 270 polling units displaced from their homes by bandits may not be able to cast their votes in the next general elections in Niger state.\n\nThe commission also said the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in 14 local government areas of the state would only vote in the IDP camps if security situation in the state does not improve before 2023 general elections.\n\nINEC stated this Monday at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting with political parties, security agencies and other citizens at the commission\u2019s headquarters in Minna.\n\nAddressing the meeting, the state\u2019s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Professor Sam Egwu said: \u201cEligible voters from 270 polling units have been completely displaced from their homes of which 46 polling units are from Munya LGA, 100 polling units from Mariga LGA, 62 Polling units from Shiroro LGA and 62 Polling units from Rafi LGA have been affected.\u201d\n\nHe said if the current security situation does not improve, voters in Shiroro local government area would have to travel to Minna, the state capital, to vote after which the results would be taken back to Shiroro LGA.\n\nEgwu, however, said it was not the responsibility of the commission to convey the IDPs to wherever it establishes to be safe for them to vote.\n\nHe explained that INEC already had a policy for IDPs to vote, noting, \u201cbut we are calling for support and cooperation from political parties and other stakeholders to achieve the results.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, INEC has created 1,765 new polling units in addition to the existing 3,186 in the state.\n\nIn a remark, the Niger state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Monday Bawa Kuryas explained that, although the state was experiencing a lot of security challenges, security agencies had recently recorded success in the fight against banditry, terrorism and criminality.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe state faced a lot of security challenges in 7 Local Government Areas, but we have been recording a lot of successes in our fight against banditry and criminality.\n\n\u201cIf we maintain the momentum, the IDPS will return back to their homes.\u201d\n\nOn the level of preparedness of security agencies ahead of the 2023 elections, the commissioner said they were battle ready for the polls.",

          "title": "Mustapha, Al-Makura, Musa first to pick N20m chairmanship form as Buni\u2019s CECPC bounces back, APC kick starts convention activities",
          "text": "After about two weeks of confusion and uncertainty around the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee(CECPC) triumphantly returned to the Muhammadu Buhari House national party headquarters amidst jubilation by secretariat staffers and some party officials.\n\nAlthough Buni had yet to resume after his medical trip abroad, Blueprint correspondent, who was at the national secretariat, saw most of his aides at the party secretariat carrying out one task or the other.\n\nWith the return, the purported change in leadership by a group of 19 governors, as claimed by Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai, has been finally laid to rest, thus signalling the return of the Buni-led caretaker committee.\n\nNiger state Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello, had while taking over the committee leadership, said he was doing so in acting capacity.\n\nAnd when asked what Buni\u2019s position was in the scheme of things, the governor said he wouldn\u2019t know.\n\nFurther to that, Sani-Bello said he had the blessing of President Muhammadu Buhari to oversee the party\u2019s affairs and conduct its national convention scheduled for March 26.\n\nBut the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rejected a letter inviting it to an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee(NEC) of the governing party where Bello\u2019s chairmanship was to be ratified, a development that threw the party into further disarray.\n\nAlso, the meeting with President Buhari by some ministers and other party stakeholders, led by Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN), was all that was needed to end Sani-Bello\u2019s short tenure as acting chair.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, Buhari directed the restoration of the Buni leadership of the committee.\n\nThe rousing return\n\nAnnouncing the committee\u2019s return Tuesday at the party secretariat in Abuja, CECPC National Secretary Senator John Akpanudoedehe said Buni\u2019s comeback as the party chair was an indication that the APC was crisis-free.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, who was given a rousing welcome by the staffers and officials of the party, had earlier been shoved aside by the party leadership under the Niger state governor.\n\nDecked in an immaculate white attire with a white face mask to match, Akpanudoedehe confidently walked into his office to face the curious journalists to speak up on what he called the \u201crecent events and the state of leadership in the party.\u201d\n\nThe party scribe said, contrary to the belief in some quarters that the chairman, himself and some officials of the CECPC were sacked from office, all actions taken in Buni\u2019s absence were done in an acting or proxy capacity, and under the auspices of Buni, the substantive chairman.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, who told journalists that the Yobe governor was on his way back to Nigeria after his medical trip abroad, said the party chair would resume office upon arriving, with the full support of all members and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) under the Chairmanship of His Excellency, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, makes this Press Release to clarify the events of last week and reassure the membership and stakeholders of the Party, as well as the Nigerian people in general, that the Governing Party is crisis-free, strong and remains united in giving the country the transformative leadership and good governance which she promised them.\n\n\u201cThe CECPC therefore informs the Press and the General Public as follows: That the CECPC was appointed, and has always done her best, to steer the affairs of the APC in line with the mandate invested in her at inauguration by the National Executive Council (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cThat on the 28th day of February, 2022 the CECPC Chairman took a long-delayed trip abroad on health grounds, leaving behind written authorisation for other members of the CECPC to continue work in his absence, particularly the day to day management of the APC.\n\n\u201cThat in his absence, sundry activities earlier scheduled for action appeared to develop fresh urgency in order to satisfy the Timetable for the 2023 General Elections released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), thus galvanizing some within the CECPC to act in their best understanding of both the situation and the leadership dynamics in the Committee/Party.\n\n\u201cThat all such actions were clearly identified at all times as happening in an acting or proxy capacity, and under the auspices of the substantive Chairman, His Excellency, Governor Mai Mala Buni, contrary to widespread speculations that the Chairman, Secretary or some other officials of the CECPC have been removed from Office or otherwise replaced.\n\n\u201cThat the CECPC is intact and functional as originally constituted. That delivering a seamlessly successful National Convention for the APC on March 26, 2022 is top on priority for the CECPC and we shall continue to execute such assignments as are legal pending the return of the Chairman who is on his way back to the country and shall resume Office on arrival with the full support of all members and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to INEC for her firm guidance in the entire circumstances.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the party has engaged a team of senior lawyers to address a purported court order halting the planned APC National Convention. We hereby call on the Judiciary to give the matter the needed and expedient attention in our bid to vacate the purported Court order and allow for the conduct of a transparent and rancour-free National Convention deserving of our great party, APC.\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) hereby restates absolute loyalty to the APC thanks the National Organs and leadership of our Party led by His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR and reassures our members and citizens that the Party is stronger than ever before and poised to extend her winning streak since 2015 into 2023 and beyond.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the 4th Estate of the Realm, we thank you,\u201d he said.\n\nNomination forms\n\nAnd further to Buni\u2019s return as party chair, the ruling party Tuesday announced the sale of nomination forms for all categories of aspirants ahead of its national convention.\n\nThe APC fixed N20 million for the national chairmanship nomination form while aspirants for the office of Deputy National Chairmanship would pay N10 million and other positions in the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party attract N5 million each.\n\nIn a template issued by APC Director of Organisation Prof Usssiju Medaner and obtained by Blueprint, \u201cthe CECPC reached the decision at its 25th regular meeting of 14th March, 2022.\u201d\n\nThe meeting also reviewed and adopted the timetable/scheduled of activities for the national convention.\n\nMustapha, Al-Makura, Musa pick form\n\nAnd as a mark of his readiness for the convention, a frontline national chairmanship aspirant, Mallam Saliu Mustapha, Tuesday, picked up his nomination forms.\n\nDirector General Saliu Mustapha Campaign Organisation (SAMCO) Balla Usman collected the Expression of Interest and nomination forms on behalf of the former national deputy chairman of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja, Tuesday.\n\nA statement by Mustapha\u2019s media aide, Dapo Okubanjo said APC\u2019s Deputy Director of Organisation Sabiu Bello handed over the two forms after receiving the mandatory N20 million from the aspirant\u2019s representatives.\n\nReceiving the forms at his campaign office, Mustapha said: \u201cThis is a clear confirmation that I\u2019m in the race and a testament to the seriousness I\u2019ve shown since I threw my hat into the ring.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve collected the forms on the same day they were made available, I would intensify consultations with key party stakeholders with a view to letting them know why I\u2019m the best man for the job.\n\n\u201cI however want to express my appreciation to President Muhammadu Buhari for paving way for what we have just done today.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Mustapha was the first aspirant for the national chairman to collect the nomination forms.\n\nSimilarly, it was gathered that the duo of Senator Mohammed Sani Musa and former Nasarawa state governor, Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura, also picked the forms Tuesday.\n\nGanduje hopeful\n\nMeanwhile, Kano state Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has confirmed that the forthcoming national convention of the APC slated for March 26 stands.\n\nGovernor Ganduje spoke to journalists after a technical training session with ushers and protocols selected to work during the convention.\n\nGanduje, who heads the protocol committee, said he had no fear about the March 26 date for the national convention.\n\n\u201cI have no fear the convention would not hold. The convention would hold Insha Allah. Don\u2019t worry, we are equal to the task. We are the biggest party in Africa. And we have experienced hands. A lot of reconciliation has taken place, consensus has taken place and we believe we will give you the best,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his committee\u2019s preparations, Ganduje said: \u201cWe are preparing for the convention. Apart from the selection of about 250 able young men and women, they are undergoing training after which they will proceed to the Eagle Square the venue of the convention. I will be there myself together with other members of the committee protocols sub-committee.\u201d\n\nAPC still intact \u2013 Musa\n\nIn a related development, a leading national chairmanship aspirant, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, has said despite the seemingly diverse interests, the ruling party was still united and intact.\n\nThis is as he reiterated that President Buhari, as leader of the party, was on top of the situation in APC and had everything under control.\n\nSpeaking on Television Continental (TVC) News Tonight, the lawmaker representing Niger East in the National Assembly, also discussed about APC\u2019s preparations for the convention and his plans for the party, if elected the national chairman of the party.\n\nFielding questions on if the selection of candidates for the chairmanship position would go down to consensus or votes by the delegates, Musa in his response, affirmed that \u201cboth are within the party\u2019s constitution and he will support whichever of the two the party leadership decides on.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker further stated that if he emerges as the party chair , he would strengthen the party structure in line with the ideology of its founding father and make it a worthy institution as the largest party in Africa.\n\nReeling out some of his programs, the chairmanship aspirant pledged \u201cto institutionalize and make the APC a political party that will work its policies to support the women and youths in both the internal working and developmental structures of the ruling party, if given the opportunity at the forthcoming National Convention.\u201d\n\nMusa, who is the Chairman of the Senate Services Committee, also promised to adapt to a participatory work style that will usher visionary and pacesetting leadership for the party that will guarantee affirmative action.\n\n\u201cUnder my leadership the party will embrace more technology in our operations which will reduce waste and abuse of our party best practices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll run a party that will preserve the legacy of our founding fathers to build a strong country that is more tolerant, more prosperous and fairer by giving every member of the party equal opportunity,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "Further to that, Sani-Bello said he had the blessing of President Muhammadu Buhari to oversee the party\u2019s affairs and conduct its national convention scheduled for March 26.\n\u201cMeanwhile, the party has engaged a team of senior lawyers to address a purported court order halting the planned APC National Convention.\nMustapha, Al-Makura, Musa pick formAnd as a mark of his readiness for the convention, a frontline national chairmanship aspirant, Mallam Saliu Mustapha, Tuesday, picked up his nomination forms.\nSimilarly, it was gathered that the duo of Senator Mohammed Sani Musa and former Nasarawa state governor, Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura, also picked the forms Tuesday.\nGanduje, who heads the protocol committee, said he had no fear about the March 26 date for the national convention.",

          "text": "Kogi state government has berated a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Moh. Lukman, over his outbursts against the state governor and the Governor Mai Mala Buni APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nMr Lukman had accused the party leadership of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention and also asked that Bello be prevented from getting the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nThe former PGF DG also alleged that Bello had yet to commence payment of N30,000 minimum wage as announced and that workers were earning 25 per cent of their salaries.\n\nBut reacting in a statement issued on Tuesday and signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, the state government said Lukman\u2019s allegations were baseless, adding that he should not \u201callow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of disparaging party leaders.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Kogi State, Comrade Onu Edoka, has confirmed that the state government has embarked on the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to workers in the state, saying the Governor Yahaya Bello administration has not been owing salaries or paying 25 per cent of salaries, contrary to Lukman and other naysayers\u2019 claims.\n\nRead full statement below:\n\nBello: Your unceremonious exit as PGF DG has affected your reasoning, Kogi lambasts Lukman\n\n\u2026 as NLC debunks ousted PGF DG\u2019s claims\n\nKOGI State Government has tongue-lashed a former Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Salihu Moh. Lukman, over his outbursts against the state governor and the Governor Mai Mala Buni APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nLukman had accused the party leadership of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention and also asked that Bello be prevented from getting the presidential ticket of the party. The former PGF DG also alleged that Bello had yet to commence payment of N30,000 minimum wage as announced and that workers were earning 25 per cent of their salaries.\n\nReacting in a statement issued on Tuesday and signed by the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Kingsley Fanwo, the state government said Lukman\u2019s allegations were baseless, adding that he should not \u201callow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of disparaging party leaders.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Kogi State, Comrade Onu Edoka, has confirmed that the state government has embarked on the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to workers in the state, saying the Governor Yahaya Bello administration has not been owing salaries or paying 25 per cent of salaries, contrary to Lukman and other naysayers\u2019 claims.\n\nEdoka, in an interview with the media on Tuesday, said the minimum wage was only approved for the state\u2019s civil servants on level 1 to 6, adding that \u201cit is not true that workers earn 25 per cent of their salaries.\u201d\n\nFanwo, in his statement, said, \u201cThe attention of the Kogi State Government has been drawn to the disparaging statements credited to a former employee of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman concerning the popular presidential ambition of Governor Yahaya Bello.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Lukman could allow the frustration of his unceremonious and embarrassing exit as the Director-General of PGF take possession of his reasoning to the extent of accusing His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni\u2019s APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of extorting aspirants ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more saddening that Lukman decided to expose his main fear when he unwittingly revealed that the candidate to beat in the 2023 APC primary was my principal, His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello. To the amateur politician, the unfounded allegations against the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello should sway the minds of Nigerians or party leaders.\n\n\u201cBut asking the party to prevent Yahaya Bello, a leading presidential hopeful, from getting the party\u2019s ticket, already stamps the fact that all eyes are on him to take the party to victory in the 2023 General elections, which everyone knows will be keenly contested.\n\n\u201cFor the records, Lukman\u2019s anti-party escapades while at the secretariat of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum did not only cost him his job, but also cast more ridicule on his already battered image.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, not surprised at his recent disgraceful outburst against key party leaders. He has proved himself to be a mole in APC with a mission to undermine it and ultimately hand advantage to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe, however, want to assure him that no one has the monopoly of caustic statements. Governor Yahaya Bello has only refrained from dignifying detractors with response, venom for venom, because of his sound upbringing. But if Lukman should allow frustration to take a total grip of his senses, then, he should be ready to face the consequences of his actions as we will not leave any stone unturned to seek redress legally. We will not watch him continue to rubbish the image of our dear party in the manner he has been doing.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Governor Yahaya Bello remains a key figure holding the party together and he has the support and endorsement of overwhelming majority of party faithful to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Lukman should wake up to the fact that his campaign of calumny will not wane the love APC and Nigerians have for Governor Bello.\n\n\u201cWe find it needful to inform the public that the historic and audacious staff verification exercise undertaken by the Yahaya Bello Administration at inception did not only paint the payroll in the colours of integrity and transparency, but also ensured efficiency in the service.\n\n\u201cMany unintended beneficiaries were removed and the State immediately ensured that 100% salaries were paid to the civil servants.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that the staff verification exercise was carried out with the full cooperation and deep involvement of labour unions who have always cooperated with the state government in its bid to reposition and strengthen the service.\n\n\u201cNigerians are adequately informed of the meagre allocation shared during the last FAAC meeting. Many states have yet to pay their February salary.\n\n\u201cInternally generated revenue wasn\u2019t at the standard our administration had set as a result of economic downturn, owing to the energy crisis that hit the nation in February.\n\nBut as an administration that is committed to the welfare of the civil servants, the Kogi State Government sat with labour leaders and agreed to pay 75%.\n\n\u201cIt has since been paid with the full implementation of the minimum wage. This is against the lies peddled by Lukman that Kogi workers received 25 percentage of their old salaries.\n\n\u201cOnly civil servants on grade level 7 and above received 75%. Civil servants on Grade Level 1 to 6 received 100% salary with the 30,000 minimum wage. The Governor and all political office holders also received 75% in solidarity with our workforce. To us, this is responsible and responsive leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to reiterate the commitment of the administration of Governor Yahaya Bello\u2019s administration towards the welfare of the workforce and that no amount of lies sponsored by Lukman will prevent Governor Bello from answering the popular call by the Nigerian masses to serve the nation in the presidential capacity,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "A former Vice President and presidential hopeful, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on Tuesday, said the reason he did not run against his principal\u2019s re-election, former president Olusegun Obasanjo in 2003, was because he wanted to keep the zoning policy of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)\n\nAtiku, who spoke when he appeared before the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), also said he refused to make a former governor of Lagos, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, his running mate in the 2007 election, while still in the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), because he didn\u2019t want the Southeast to claim that they were being marginalised.\n\nAtiku also said the south had ruled Nigeria more times than the north since the country returned to democracy. The former Vice President was probably referring to eight years each for former President Olusegun Obasanjo and President Muhammadu Buhari respectively; five years for former President Goodluck Jonathan and three years for late former president Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\nBut analysts have drawn the attention of the former vice president to the fact that the argument for power shift by those from Southern Nigeria was firstly, based on the rotation principle that power must go between North and South and that one region cannot have it for 16 years continuously because the other region would be marginalised. Secondly, on balance, the fact is that the North has had more leaders since 1960 than the South.\n\nHowever, continuing, Atiku told the BoT members that: \u201cMany of you were members of our government, when all the PDP governors came in 2003 and said I should run and I say no. We have a creed that power should remain in the Southwest, why should I?\n\n\u201cSome of those governors then that supported me, some of them went to jail, some of them were kicked out of their offices; we made sure that we kept the policy.\n\n\u201cSo, therefore, you cannot come and try to imply that the PDP has not been following the zoning policy. The many years of PDP government eight years and six years all of them were from the south. So, we should not be stampeded by the opposition party. They have a moral obligation which is inescapable.\u201dAtiku told the BoT members.\n\nOn the 2007 issue, he said, rather than pick Tinubu, he picked Senator Ben Obi, to ensure a sense of belonging and inclusiveness for the southeast.\n\nIt was because of this, he also claimed to have chosen a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, in 2019, when they ran on the PDP platform.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen I joined the CAN, which my friend Bola set up, he gave me a set of condition for giving me the ticket; that I should make him vice president. I said no, I\u2019m not going to make you Vice President, instead, I took Senator Ben Obi.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the ticket again to run, I took another Obi coincidentally. So, there is absolutely no reason why they should say that there is deliberate attempts to exclude the South East in political participation or power sharing.\n\n\u201cSo, I thought I should disabuse your mind and ,of course, as an enlightened political class, I don\u2019t think that for me, as far as this party is concerned, as far as we\u2019re concerned, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any deliberate policy to exclude anybody in this country.\n\n\u201cYes, people have not stopped talking about power rotation and zoning, or whatever it is. For sure, in the party, we invented and formulated this zoning policy simply, because we wanted every part of this country to have a sense of belonging and I personally have paid my dues on the issue of zoning.\u201d\n\nOn why the PDP should give him another chance, Atiku said, \u201cNow, I wish to call on you to please give me another opportunity to advance all these ideas of our party, well-beautiful ideas, so that we will come further to consolidate democracy, unity and development for our country.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is based on facts. Take any aspect of our growth whether, it is economy, whether it is healthcare, whether it is agriculture, whether it is education, the landmark achievements we made in 1999 to 2007, have not been matched by any subsequent administration.\n\n\u201cWe are now at a crucial moment in this country. Many of you here, it is either we retire together or we move on together. Somebody said we recorded 12 million votes during the last election. Those are not only my votes, those were our votes. In achieving or recording those 11 million votes, it was all of us and I believe if we work together again, we can surpass those votes.\n\n\u201cAs one of the speakers said, I am worried and you should be worried too that, if we do not win, it means we will be in opposition again for the next eight years. By the next eight years, I don\u2019t know how many of you would be left in politics and it may even ultimately lead to the death of the party, because people gravitate, particularly in developing countries, towards governments.\n\n\u201cOrdinary people naturally gravitate towards government. So, this is a very, very crucial and historical moment in history. For our survival, I want you to think about it,\u201d he said, explaining why he should be given the ticket.\n\nOn his vision, Atiku explained that, \u201cMy vision is building bridges across the country. Please join me in building bridges across this country so that every part of this country will have a sense of belonging.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the sanctions on Twitter.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\n\u201cIn response to a series of unprecedented sanctions prohibiting, among other things, entry into the United States for top Russian officials, effective March 15 this year, the Russian \u2018stop list\u2019 includes @JoeBiden, @SecBlinken and a number of other American figures on the basis of reciprocity,\u201d the ministry said on Tuesday.\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine began last month, the United States and other nations have imposed severe sanctions on Russia. The measures have devastated the country\u2019s economy, and experts believe Moscow may soon default on its debts.\n\nThe sanctions have also specifically targeted Russian President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle, freezing their assets and barring their entry into some countries, including the US.\n\nThe wording of Tuesday\u2019s statement made it clear that Russia\u2019s sanctions against American leaders, past and present, are meant as a retaliation against those measures \u2013 \u201con the basis of reciprocity.\u201d\n\nAs some experts pointed out, however, reciprocity has its limits.

          "text": "Several loud explosions were heard at dawn on Wednesday in Kyiv, followed by columns of black smoke in the sky according to reporters.\n\nAround 6 a.m. local time at least three strong explosions sounded in the west of the capital, already targeted the day before and placed under curfew until Thursday morning.\n\nSeveral thick columns of black smoke were observed shortly after in the sky of the city, like the day before, where several Russian strikes hit residential buildings.\n\nOther explosions were heard in the early morning but no assessment or details were given immediately by the local authorities, while the press was not allowed to travel around the city because of the curfew.\n\nIn an overnight video message posted on social media, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian demands during negotiations are becoming \u201cmore realistic.\u201d\n\nHowever, he also cautioned that \u201cefforts are still needed, patience is needed\u201d for the talks to be successful, and that \u201cany war ends with an agreement.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the president also seemed to signal that Ukraine would not be able to join NATO. \u201cThis is the truth, and we have simply to accept it as it is\u201d, he told northern European leaders, who were meeting in London on Tuesday.\n\nThe Ukrainian city of Zaporozhye, south of Dnipro, was targeted by Russian forces on Wednesday morning, with a railway station damaged in the attack.\n\nThe regional governor says \u201ccivilian sites in Zaporozhye were bombed for the first time\u201d and that \u201crockets fell on the Zaporozhe-2 station area\u201d and also on the city\u2019s botanical gardens.\n\nThe governor says that nobody was killed in the attack.\n\nZaporozhye is the destination for hundreds of thousands of people using a \u2018humanitarian corridor\u2019 to flee from the besieged city of Mariupol.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct Cavusoglu is in Moscow on Wednesday where he\u2019s set to hold talks before continuing to Ukraine on Thursday to try and negotiate a ceasefire in the war which is now in its 21st day.\n\nTurkish President Erdogan said the minister \u201cwill continue our efforts to obtain a ceasefire and peace by discussing with the two parties.\u201d\n\nThere are no details yet on who Cavusoglu might meet with, but it comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity with the Polish president also due to visit Ankara on Wednesday.\n\nLast week Turkey organised and hosted the first meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers since the start of the war.\n\nThe direct talks between the two men, described as \u201cnot easy but civilized\u201d by the Turks, had not made it possible to reach a ceasefire.\n\nBut Cavusoglu had indicated he would still like to facilitate a meeting between Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Russian President Putin.\n\nTurkey is an ally of Ukraine and a member of NATO but has not joined many other countries in imposing sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) will deliver its verdict on Wednesday in a case launched by Kyiv, which is asking the UN\u2019s highest court to order Moscow to immediately halt its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKyiv believes that Russia illegally justified its invasion by falsely alleging genocide against Russian-speaking populations in the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Lugansk.\n\nUkraine wants the ICJ, which was created in 1946 to settle disputes between states, to take emergency measures, to order Russia to \u201cimmediately suspend military operations\u201d.\n\n\u201cRussia must be stopped, and the court has a role to play in stopping that\u201d Ukraine\u2019s representative told a hearing.\n\nRussia declined to appear at the ICJ hearings into the case on March 7th and 8th, but in a written statement Moscow refuted the court\u2019s jurisdiction over Ukraine\u2019s claim.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military claims they shot down three more Russian attack jets\n\nUkraine\u2019s Ministry of Defence has given a new operational update for Wednesday morning covering the last 24-hour period.\n\nThey claim to have destroyed three Russian aircraft, including two Su-34 fighter-bombers. In addition the ministry says Ukrainian forces shot down a Russian helicopter, three tactical UAVs, and two \u201cwinged missiles.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Defence says its forces continued to launch strikes at Russian forces including air attacks on Russian convoys.\n\n\u201cThe opponent continues to suffer losses and retreats in different directions\u201d the statement says.",
