          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA new study carried out by researchers at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, United States, has revealed how psychological stress causes grey hair.\n\nAccording to the researchers, while stress can accelerate graying, the hair colour can still be restored when stress is eliminated.\n\nTheir finding contrasts with a recent study in mice that suggested that stressed-induced gray hairs are permanent.\n\nThe study, published in ScienceDaily, has broader significance than confirming age-old speculation about the effects of stress on hair colour, says the study\u2019s senior author Dr. Martin Picard, an associate professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the mechanisms that allow \u2018old\u2019 gray hairs to return to their \u2018young\u2019 pigmented states could yield new clues about the malleability of human aging in general and how it is influenced by stress.\n\n\u201cOur data add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that human aging is not a linear, fixed biological process but may, at least in part, be halted or even temporarily reversed.\n\n\u201cJust as the rings in a tree trunk hold information about past decades in the life of a tree, our hair contains information about our biological history.\n\n\u201cWhen hairs are still under the skin as follicles, they are subject to the influence of stress hormones and other things happening in our mind and body. Once hairs grow out of the scalp, they harden and permanently crystallize these exposures into a stable form\u201d, Picard says.\n\nThough people have long believed that psychological stress can accelerate gray hair, scientists have debated the connection due to the lack of sensitive methods that can precisely correlate times of stress with hair pigmentation at a single-follicle level.\n\nThe researchers analysed individual hairs from 14 volunteers. The results were compared with each volunteer\u2019s stress diary, in which individuals were asked to review their calendars and rate each week\u2019s level of stress.\n\n\u201cThe investigators immediately noticed that some gray hairs naturally regained their original colour, which had never been quantitatively documented. If you use your eyes to look at a hair, it will seem like it\u2019s the same colour throughout unless there is a major transition. Under a high-resolution scanner, you see small, subtle variations in colour, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re measuring\u201d, Picard added.\n\nCo-author of the study and professor of dermatology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Ralf Paus, said \u201cOur data show that graying is reversible in people, which implicates a different mechanism.\n\n\u201cMice have very different hair follicle biology, and this may be an instance where findings in mice don\u2019t translate well to people.\u201d\n\nTo better understand how stress causes gray hair, the researchers also measured levels of thousands of proteins in the hairs and how protein levels changed over the length of each hair.\n\nUS and Brazilian researchers had in a recent study on mice said stem cells that control skin and hair colour became damaged after intense stress.\n\nBut scientists were not clear exactly how stress affected the hairs on our heads.\n\nMen and women can go grey any time from their mid-30s, with the timing of parental hair colour change giving most of the clues on when.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s mostly down to the natural ageing process and genes, stress can also play a role.\n\n\u201cWe now know for sure that stress is responsible for this specific change to your skin and hair, and how it works,\u201d says Prof Ya-Cieh Hsu, research author from Harvard University.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Some of them are gossip machines, some wey be wives, na men dem be, but dem be wives to their ogas.\n\n\u201cThey are celebrating, they are quick to celebrate but let me tell you, whether you care to listen or not Abba Kyari is not going down by the grace of God. He has done too [much] good to go down because of one mistake, even if it is true.\n\n\u201cAmerica cannot tell us how to live our lives, America is not heaven. We have homeless people in America, we have jobless people in America, we have Indian hemp smokers in America, we have cocaine smokers in America, we have armed robbers in America, we have serial killers in America, what are they going to tell us, is America better than Africa if not for bad leadership?\n\n\u201cWhat do they have that we don\u2019t have? We stand behind Abba Kyari, DCP Abba Kyari and God will vindicate him.\n\n\u201cOne day this young man will become IGP, they are just envious of him because of his extraordinary performance, they can\u2019t do half of what he is doing. He is too intelligent for their liking. He is a civil police officer, he is not pompous.\n\n\u201cYes, there is an allegation on him, no matter how bad e be, name wey you give you dog naim neighbours go call am. How many of Abba Kyari we get for Nigeria in the police. For you to hold that type of office, temptation abounds,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUna know how many cases this man don uncover? Some police officers dey wonder how hin dey do am. Some say na juju, some say na magic. He is a modern police [officer], he is using technology.\n\n\u201cIf they had arrested Abba Kyari in America, that is a different thing, you are telling us to send our own?\u201d",

Our hearts go to the families of those who lost their lives and properties in this unfortunate incident,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cInformation available to us indicates that if not for the prompt response of men of Operation Safe Haven, the casualty figure of this needless attack and this reprisal attack would have been alarming.\n\n\u201cWe, however, wish to caution some individuals, organizations, tribal and religious bigots as well as some crises merchants who rather than speak the truth in times like this, would rather criminalize only one group of people as the aggressors and blame security agencies for their actions\n\nThe advocacy group appealed to Irigwe people to call out the criminals rather than blame security agencies for the crisis.\n\n\u201cAs a professional group, we will not take sides with any group or persons no matter the sentiments and emotions. We will continue to speak the whole truth so that peace can reign.\n\nThe Coalition maintained that the only way genuine peace can be achieved is through sincerity and truthfully calling out those who are guilty of violence no matter who is involved.\n\n\u201d Our community leaders from all sides must take responsibility for their youths and hand over the criminals to the security agencies otherwise we will continue to go round this cycle of violence and crisis,\u201d it advised.",

Akenyemi Olaide; David Leon; Abba Ali; Prof Tahir Mamman; Ismail Ahmed and Senator Akpan Udoedehe.\n\nThe claimant in his originating summons filed by his counsel, Chief Oba Maduabuchi, SAN, is further asking the court to dissolve the Committee known as and called caretaker/extraordinary convention planning committee as there is no organ of the party or any such organisation in the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nHe further sought a declaration that pursuant to section 87(4)(b)(1) of the Electoral Act (as amended), only the National Executive Committee of a political party can validly appoint a date for the holding of primaries for the nomination of the gubernatorial or other candidates of the political party.\n\nA declaration that unless an election is conducted in accordance with the Electoral Act and by an organ known to and created by the constitution of the APC, no valid candidate can emerge from such a primary.\n\nNgwu, who stated that he wanted to contest the position of the national chairman of the party in 2018, has further urged the court to grant an order set tong aside all actions and decisions taken by members of CECPC of the party.\n\nBefore seeking the above declaratory reliefs, the claimant posed the following questions to be determined by the court: \u201cWhether there is any organ of the APC known as Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee created in or by the constitution of the party.\n\nWhether the organisation known and called caretaker/extraordinary planning committee is one of the organs created by Article 11 of the constitution of the political party known and called the APC.\n\nWhether pursuant to section 87(4) (b) (1) of the Electoral Act (as amended) any other organ of a political party can validly appoint a date for the holding of a congress for the purpose of nominating the governorship candidate of the political party Including the APC apart from the National Executive Committee of the party.\n\nWhether a valid candidate or officer of the party can emerge from a congress fixed by any other organ of a political party outside the National Executive Committee of a political party including the APC.\n\nThe originating summons is supported by a 10-paragraph affidavit wherein, the claimant averred that in 2018, he had wanted to contest for the National Chairman of the party after the tenure of the then national chairman of the party expired but was prevailed upon to allow Adams Oshiomhole to be returned unopposed.\n\nThat he was prevailed upon to sheath his ambition because he (Oshiomhole) had only four years to be in office and then he will contest the election for the position of the national chairman.\n\nThat after just two years, I was surprised to hear that the National Executive Committee and National Working Committee had been dissolved and a contraption known as Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee had been created by an unknown person and Mai Mala Buni asked unilaterally to head the committee.\n\nThat I was surprised as by the constitution of the party, the National Executive Committee would be in office for four years until June 22, 2022.\n\nThat my supporters and I also knew that only a duly elected National Executive Committee could validly hold any primaries to nominate candidates for the party for the various elections to be held between the day of the dissolution of both the National Executive Committee anf National Working Committee.\n\nThat the CECPC is unknown to our party\u2019s constitution and it is operating without reference to the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nNigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has predicted that the worst of COVID-19 is yet to manifest going by the trend and the poor attitude of Nigerians towards the pandemic.\n\nThis, it said, was evident in the rise in confirmed cases, which might had heralded the third wave that came with Delta variant said to be more lethal because of its high transmissibilty.\n\nNCDC Director General, Dr. Chike Ihekweazu, who spoke at the maiden edition of the Nigerian Conference of Applied and Field Epidemiology (NiCAFE) in Abuja, suggested a new approach that would be more effective in educating and sensitising the people against COVID-19 and other epidemics in Nigeria.\n\nNiCAFE conference which had as its theme, \u201cBuilding back better: COVID-19 and other disease outbreaks\u201d brought together public health professionals, laboratory scientists, field epidemiologists, researchers, health care professionals and members of the public.\n\nThe participants reflected on the response to infectious disease outbreaks, reviewed gaps in epidemic preparedness and response and brainstormed on innovative solutions to strengthen health security.\n\nDr. Ihekweazu said: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has, undoubtedly, turned our lives upside down with over 190 million infections and four million deaths, globally. In Nigeria, we have had over 170,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths. However, It\u2019s painful to say there is a possibility that we are yet to see the worst of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are not only faced with COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria but multiple concurrent disease outbreaks. In the last month alone, we have been responding to an increasing number of COVID-19 cases, outbreaks of cholera in several states and the panic associated with the detection of a monkeypox case in the US with travel history from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEvery week, we detect cases of yellow fever, Lassa fever, measles, and other infectious diseases that are endemic in Nigeria. The reality is that our tropical climate, population density, poor socio-economic factors, leave us at risk of annual, multiple, concurrent disease outbreaks. Therefore, we must be one step ahead of these pathogens.\n\n\u201cWe must also think of the other public health challenges that lie ahead of us. Our population is growing at a rapid phase and this will have an incredible impact on our health system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NCDC said 407 persons tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday.\n\nThe latest positive samples of COVID-19 were recorded in 17 states, according to the agency\u2019s update for August 1.\n\nLagos topped the COVID-19 infection chart with 160 new cases, 75 in Akwa Ibom, 51 in Ondo, and 33 in Abia. Other states include Oyo (29), Kaduna (18), Katsina (7), Gombe (6), Ogun (6), Ekiti (5), Delta (4), FCT (4), Ebonyi (3), Edo (2), Niger (2), Bayelsa (1) and Nasarawa (1).\n\nThere were no fatalities on Sunday. The coronavirus death toll in the country still stands at 2,149.\n\nThe NCDC said 11 people were discharged on Sunday after recovering from the infection. With the new figure, a total of 165,005 patients have so far recovered from COVID-19 in Nigeria.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu, David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi, Paul Osuyi, Asaba and Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin\n\nConcerned family members have begun evacuating their loved ones from government-owned hospitals as the industrial action declared by members of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) enters its second day.\n\nNational President of NARD, Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, announced the strike during the association\u2019s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Umuahia on Sunday.\n\nHe said the strike followed the expiration of the 113 days ultimatum issued to states and the federal governments to address welfare, training and service delivery issues to members.\n\nIt was tales of anguish and tears in all the hospitals visited by our correspondents yesterday morning, barely 10 hours after the medics turned their backs on their patience.Normal activities were reduced as some patients were turned back. The few consultant physicians on duty could not fill in for the jobs of the resident doctors as their capacity was restricted.\n\nSome patients expressed regret at the situation and appealed to government to expedite action toward finding a lasting solution to the perennial strike by doctors all the time. A nurse said patients who were on admission were asked to pay their bills and go home or seek care elsewhere.\n\nThe Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Abeokuta, Ogun State, last night had started discharging patients on admission. A nurse said patients who were on admission were asked to pay their bills and go home or seek care elsewhere.\n\nNARD Chairman at the centre, Dr Busuyi Adebiyi, said the strike was a directive from the national body, hence all affiliates must join.\n\n\u201cUntil a counter directive is received, the strike goes on. It\u2019s a nationwide strike; all affiliates are expected to join, so doctors at the Federal Medical Centre are not working.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, doctors at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) branch also stood in solidarity with the call by the national body to press home their demands.\n\nIn a Communiqu\u00e9, the association accused governments of insincerity on the issues affecting the welfare of members. It observed that government was reluctant in implementing the memorandum of action after 113 days, saying \u201cthe NEC unanimously resolved by vote to resume the total and indefinite strike from 08.00hrs of August 2\u201d.\n\nDr Habeeb Badmus, president of ARD-UITH, stated that part of their demand was the delay by the Federal Government in disbursing the Medical Residency Training Funds.\n\n\u201cThe association also decry the undue hardship members on Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) platform face, due to the delays in payment of their salaries ranging from three to seven months.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the industrial action was to ensure smooth running of the health sector, adding that they can only serve efficiently and effectively when members welfare are given the desired attention.\n\nAt the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Ituku Ozalla and the Enugu State University Teaching Hospital (ESUT-TH), Parklane Enugu, patients were seen complaining and waiting for doctors endlessly even after paying for doctors\u2019 consultation fee while relatively healthy ones were being discharged in their numbers to go home.\n\nDaily Sun observed that there were few Consultants and House Officers attending to the large number of patients already admitted at the hospital before yesterday.\n\nOn the development, President, ARD ESUT-TH, Parklane Chapter, Emmanuel Edoga, said the association in the state-owned teaching hospital had fully mobilised and joined the ongoing strike.\n\n\u201cWe have down tooled as directed and what we did early this morning is to stabilize patients previously under our care and discharge some of them fit to be out-patient.\n\n\u201cHowever, we still have our senior doctors, the consultants, as well as House Officers still attending to patients and holding sway until we resolve the current impasse with the Federal and state governments.\u201d\n\nEdoga noted that they would also review the situation after 72 hours and hoped that the authorities would do the needful.\n\nMeanwhile, patients and relations were furious in complaining of the man-hour they wasted waiting to be attended to in vain. One of them, Mrs. Juliet Onyia, who brought her baby to children ward, claimed she had waited for over four hours. They knew about this, they should not have collected the doctor\u2019s consultancy fee of N500 from me since they are not working. Nobody deemed it fit to inform me earlier about the development for me to take my child to another hospital. This situation is unfortunate.\u201d\n\nA patient at the surgical ward, Mr Emma Onuh, said he was not aware of the strike\n\n\u201cI came all the way from my village in Eke community, Udi Local Government.\u201d\n\nThe situation was same at the UNTH, as according to a resident doctor who spoke to Daily Sun, \u201cWe have joined the strike. It is the Consultants and House Officers that you will see in the hospital. We are bound by the decisions of the national body of our association.\n\nAt the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) branch, NARD president, Ifeanyi Ufuani, said said compliance was 100 percent.\n\nHe explained that it is only the association of resident doctors that is on strike.\n\n\u201cThe hospital has other cadres of doctors such as consultants, and they are working. However, we make about 80 percent of the workforce.\n\n\u201cEverybody believes and knows this is what we are fighting for because they are things that affect us and that is why we had compliance. We are affected and suffering, and this is the only way because negotiations have failed that is why everyone is complying.\n\n\u201cWe have had 100 percent compliance in UBTH, the consultants are still on ground while resident doctors are not offering services until the strike is called of\u201d, he said.\n\nCommenting on the industrial action, Chairman of the Edo State Hospital Management Board, Osayande Edorisiagbon, said despite delivering healthcare services to patients, they are in full support of the action until the government grants the demands of the striking doctors.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate we are not part of the strike because sometime ago we had some issues with the National body but that is not to say we are not in support of the action.\u201d\n\nChairman, Nigerian Medical Association, Edo State chapter, Harrison Omokhua, said the strike is germane and a lot of persons have been mobilised to ensure full compliance.\n\nHe assured that they would sustain the compliance level until the federal government decides to answer the striking doctors.\n\nAt the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH), Nnewi branch, doctors turned their backs on patients as early as 8am after being briefed to comply with the union\u2019s directives.\n\nNAUTH\u2019s president, Golibe Ikpeze, said the striking doctors had already left clinical services in the hands of the consultants and others who were not members of the NARD. He explained that the patients were briefed about the development with the assurance that the consultants were still on ground.\n\n\u201cAs members of the NARD, we ensure 100 percent compliance to the strike which was the resolution we had after a meeting in Umuahia, Abia State. None of us would go against that. Doctors are still in the hospital who are not our members. Our members counselled the patients on what is happening and we handed over the care to consultants.\u201d\n\nBut Acting Chief Medical Director of the NAUTH, Dr Joseph Ugboaja, assured that the hospital would continue to do its best to ensure patients were taken care. He also assured that the Consultants and other health workers would be doing their job as the issues were resolved. He told the patients not to panic as the hospital would not relent in its efforts to care for them.\n\nThis is as patients at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba, Delta State, appealed to doctors to call off their strike.\n\nThe frustrated patients and their relatives also appealed to government to meet the demands of the doctors.\n\nSome in-patients and out-patients who spoke said they were already feeling the negative impact of the strike which has crippled activities at the hospital.\n\nNMA seeks withdrawal of controversial circular on doctors\u2019 scheme of service\n\nThe Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) said it was actively involved in ensuring that removal of House Officers and NYSC doctors from scheme of service does not lead to crisis in Lagos State health sector.\n\nDr. Adetunji Adenekan, NMA Chairman, Lagos Zone, gave the assurance at a media briefing yesterday.\n\nAdenekan said NMA through the Medical Guild, had been liaising with government on withdrawing the crisis-prone circular released by the Head of Service.\n\nHe said that the National Council on Establishment (NCE) released a policy document for the removal of House Officers and NYSC doctors from the scheme of service, labelling them as students.\n\n\u201cIt is important to clarify that medical/dental interns are graduates and very essential frontlines that render indispensable services in Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) approved hospitals, albeit under supervision.\n\n\u201cAlso, NYSC doctors are full-fledged medical/dental practitioners and fully registered by MDCN,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, there is a scheduled tripartite meeting involving Head of Service of the Federation, National NMA and MDCN, aimed at resolving irregularities in the circular.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, only Lagos State Government hastily commenced its implementation out of all the 36 states and FCT, even the Federal Government is yet to.\n\n\u201cThe NMA Lagos condemns, in totality, the hasty posture of the Lagos State Government toward the implementation of the circular as this may only culminate in crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nAdenekan appealed to the state government to withdraw the circular to further strengthen the current harmonious relationship between the association and the state.\n\nHe said it was obvious that huge gap exist in the understanding of medicolegal aspect of medical practice across board, in spite of all efforts to ensure justice and fairness for all parties when necessary.\n\nThe NMA chairman said that the association\u2019s Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference would provide the platform to address the issue.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Monday listed a plethora of outstanding issues that have to be totally resolved before major oil companies can successfully divest their interests overseas.\n\nThey are as follows: abandonment and relinquishment costs; severance of operator staff; third party contract liabilities; competency of the buyer; post-purchase technical, operational, and financial capabilities, especially in the era of activist investor\u2019s sentiments against funding of fossil fuel projects and alignment with Nigeria national strategic interest.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mr Mele Kyari, made the disclosure in Lagos at the 2021 edition of the Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition (NAICE) organised by Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) with the theme: \u201cThe Future of Energy: A Trilogy of Climate Change, Public Health & Global Oil Market\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC management\u2019s decision to unveil a Comprehensive Divestment Policy (CDP) that will guide the entire divestment process follows the structured exit plans currently being implemented by Shell and other NNPC partners, as they seek to invest in cleaner and more environmentally friendly energy in other climes.\n\nKyari explained that sorting out the aforementioned matters with the oil majors would ensure a win-win situation for all parties, rather than hurting the Nigerian economy in a hurried departure.\n\nAccording to Kyari, while the NNPC partners reserve the right to divest their interests, the national oil company also has a duty to provide clear-cut guidelines and criteria for such divestment to guarantee equity, fairness and justice.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are seeing a wave of divestment by oil majors operating in Nigeria. NNPC as a national oil company cannot stop partners from divesting their interest, even though it creates a challenge for us in ensuring that we get right and competent investors to take position and add value to the assets.\n\n\u201cNNPC will ensure that Nigeria\u2019s National strategic interest is safeguarded, by developing a Comprehensive Divestment Policy\u201d.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the NNPC will, in subsequent deals, adjust its rules of engagement by making clear distinctions between divestment of shares and operatorship agreements under various joint operating agreements, while leveraging its rights of pre-emption as well as evaluating the operational competency and track records of new partners.\n\nKyari noted that the imperatives of energy transition and the influence of activist investors on the global energy industry are making oil and gas companies diversify their portfolio to low-carbon investments by whetting the appetite for investment in cleaner energy sources like; wind, solar, hydrogen, natural gas and bio-fuels.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Sanwo-Olu: Lagos Recorded 4,300 Cases, 30 Fatalities in July",
          "text": "\u2022Says only 1% of Lagos residents vaccinated\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, raised the alarm about the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, saying in July alone, some 4,300 confirmed cases were recorded with 30 fatalities. Sanwo-Olu said the current figures were worse than what obtained at the height of the pandemic last year, when a total of 64,032 cases were recorded with 56,336 recovering and 320 death.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFrom the beginning of July, we started to experience an increase in the number of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Lagos State, with the positivity rate going from 1.1% at the end of June 2021 to 7% at the end of July 2021. As at the 1st of August 2021, the positivity rate in Lagos is 8.9%.\n\n\u201cThis is an 8-fold increase over the recorded figure a month ago, and it should rightly alarm all of us. This has resulted in 4,300 confirmed cases in July alone and 352 admissions into our isolation facilities. But let me make it clear that this necessary sense of alarm should not be responded to with panic, but instead with a firm resolve and determination to reverse the trend.\n\n\u201cWe have done it before and we can do it again. We dealt with the first and second waves and did our best to prevent a third wave. Now that it is fully upon us, we must dig deep into what we have learnt from the previous waves, as well as summon the will to do everything necessary to bring down the numbers, on the way to eventually defeating the virus once and for all.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu explained that with the epidemiology update from the beginning of the outbreak in February 2020 to date, Lagos State had recorded a total of 64,032 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and of this number, 56,336 had recovered in community, while 2,755 cases were currently being managed actively in community.\n\nHe added that while managing the COVID-19 pandemic, about 5,029 patients had been admitted into the various COVID-19 centres in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have, sadly, recorded 390 fatalities in Lagos State, 30 of which have taken place in this current 3rd wave of the pandemic. Essentially, we have recorded on average 6 deaths per day since last week. With Home-Based Care Given the huge population of our state and the rising numbers of confirmed cases during the first and second waves of the pandemic, it became necessary for us to deploy telemedicine in managing positive patients.\n\n\u201cIn this vein, we launched a homebased programme, driven by our EKOTELEMED call center service. The home-based programme works by delivering care packs to symptomatic Covid-19 patients \u2013 those who do not require admission in a treatment facility \u2013 in the comfort of their homes, and making specialist care available over the phone.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, following the receipt of the first instalment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the federal government, it was administered to a total of 404,414 first doses and 243,374 second doses of the vaccine to residents.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs of today, the percentage of residents of Lagos that have received two doses of the vaccine stands at one per cent. This is quite low, especially, considering that we are now confronted by a third wave, and we are exploring all avenues possible to ramp up access to vaccination so as to reach our herd immunity target of administering vaccines to at least 60 per cent of the population of Lagos State.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that experience from other regions of the world showed that a majority of the confirmed cases that resulted in death were in unvaccinated persons.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cThis is why we are seriously looking to scale up vaccination coverage for our people. On the 1st of August 2021, Nigeria received 4 million doses of the Moderna vaccine. It is our expectation that as the epicentre of the epidemic, Lagos State will receive a sizeable amount of this allocation.\n\n\u201cThis vaccine cannot be mixed with the AstraZeneca vaccine, so it will ONLY be for people that have not been previously vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are still expecting the second five allocations of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and will inform you when it is received. We will ensure that all future vaccine administration exercises are based solely on appointment, to avoid a situation in which vaccine administration turns into a super-spreader event.\u201d\n\nDelta Variant May Spread to More States, Says NCDC\n\nThe National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said the deadly Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus may spread further to many more states if conscious efforts were not made to curtail it. Confirming the mark-up in the number of cases of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in the country, Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, said current data showed that one in every 10 persons that were tested in Lagos State came out positive.\n\nIhekweazu, who spoke at a media briefing by PSC on COVID-19, said the positivity rate of the virus test in states, like Lagos and Akwa Ibom, had gone up to 10 per cent.\n\nHe said, currently, the national COVID-19 positivity rate was six per cent, adding that the detection of increases in positive cases in some state like Lagos, Rivers, Oyo and Akwa Ibom was an indication that the surveillance architecture put in place by NCDC had worked well.\n\nThe federal government said the four million and eighty thousand doses of Moderna vaccines donated by the US government would undergo efficacy test evaluation by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, (NAFDAC) before their deployment. Executive Director, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, stated this while inspecting the vaccines that arrived the country since Sunday.\n\nHe said it would take up 48 hours for the evaluation results to be out before the commencement of the inoculation.\n\nShuaib, who led other top officials of the Federal Ministry of Health to inspect the vaccine doses at the National Strategic Cold Store, Abuja, said an effective cold chain management of any COVID-19 vaccine was key to ensuring the success of the national vaccination programme.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe vaccines would assist in stepping up efforts to battle a third wave of COVID-19 infections. The donation was part of President Joe Biden\u2019s promise to give 500 million vaccines to the world by the end of 2022.\u201d\n\nShuaib said Nigeria had storage facilities that could store COVID-19 vaccines, including the Moderna vaccine.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government had earlier acquired an additional 60 ultra cold freezers that would accommodate both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\nShuaib said, \u201cThe Moderna vaccine was expected to remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for 30 days. Shipping and long-term storage conditions are at standard freezer temperatures of -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F) for six months while mRNA-1273 to be distributed using widely available vaccine delivery and storage infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOnce the vaccine is removed from the refrigerator for administration, it can be kept at room temperature conditions for up to 12 hours.\u201d\n\nRepresentative of the US government, Dr. Melissa Freeman, said the vaccine doses were part of a donation that was set up to boost the country\u2019s vaccination rollout campaign. Also, representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Anne Baptiste, said Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine was effective against several variants of concern, including the Delta variant.\n\nUNICEF Representative in Nigeria, Mr. Peter Hawkins, said the donation would help the country implement its expanded vaccination programme by reaching more people.\n\nHawkins said the life-saving vaccines had arrived at a time, when Nigeria was seeking to vaccinate a total of 110 million citizens.\n\nStrike by Resident Doctors Disrupts Hospital Activities\n\nMeanwhile, the strike embarked upon by resident doctors on Monday morning adversely affected healthcare services at the hospitals. At some of the government hospitals visited by THISDAY in Abuja, doctors were seen going about without attending to patients. Only few ones, mainly the consultants that were in their offices, attended to patients.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Ehanire said the Federal Ministry of Health had started to engage the doctors with a view to quickly resolving the issues.\n\n\u201cWhile this is on-going, medical directors at federal and state hospitals are directed to ensure that service delivery is not disrupted in their centres,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why Nigeria\u2019s central bank is banning forex sales to money changers",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s eNaira: Experts reveal how CBN\u2019s digital currency will operate and its implications",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIs Nigeria launching its own Bitcoin? Is the Naira going to be as valuable as the dollar? Are we now going to save our Naira on crypto exchanges?\u201d\n\nThese are questions a young friend of mine bombarded me with when I mentioned that Nigeria was going to have its own digital currency. I responded with a confident \u201cno\u201d however I had no answer to the follow-up. \u201cHow exactly would it work?\u201d\n\nDigital currencies have grown in popularity over the years. One of the most notable being Bitcoin, the first successful version, created in 2009 by the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIts popularity stems largely from the stories of people who made huge sums of money investing it and ironically those who lost money through it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt a Senate hearing in February, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele, famously described them as \u2018money out of thin air.\u2019\n\nIn an interesting turn of events, the CBN is using the technology behind this \u201cmoney out of thin air\u201d to create the eNaira. It revealed on July 22, 2021, that the pilot scheme for the project will begin.\n\nWhile digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Elon Musk\u2019s coveted Dogecoin are relatively popular, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are not as well-known.\n\nA digital currency issued by a government works differently from a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by a singular entity. The creation and distribution of Bitcoin is decentralised meaning anyone can participate.\n\nTo get an insight into how CBDCs work, Techpoint Africa spoke with some experts about what to expect as Nigeria launches its CBDC in October.\n\nWhy is Nigeria launching the eNaira?\n\nAdedeji Owonibi, founder and COO of Blockchain solutions company, Convexity, explains that CBDCs are trending and countries want in on the action. Over 80 countries are testing and researching the possibility of a central bank digital currency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Owonibi speaking at Techpoint Africa\u2019s Digital Currency Summit in March, 2021\n\nHe adds that the CBN was also fearful of the traction cryptocurrencies were getting. Ownonibi, who is also a crypto forensic investigator, explains that he tried to allay their fears. \u201cWhen the central bank displayed their fear about crypto gaining so much traction, I was invited to speak with them and I explained how crypto monitoring can be done through the banks.\u201d\n\nAnkit Singhal, CTO of Modulus, US-based financial solutions company, says countries are adopting CBDCs \u201cbecause they have realised the capability of the Blockchain, how fast, cheap and reliable they\u2019re\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a PowerPoint presentation seen by Techpoint Africa, the CBN says the objective of the eNaira is to aid financial inclusion, improve payment efficiency, improve revenue and tax collection, targeted social interventions, amongst other objectives.\n\nWhile the eNaira will play an important role in financial inclusion and propel a cashless policy, Owonibi believes it will not have any major improvement on the Nigerian economy.\n\nSinghal in contrast sees the adoption of CBDCs as a realisation of the power of Blockchain. The technology, he says, can improve several sectors of the African economy.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they compare to cryptocurrencies?\n\nCBDCs are digital currencies issued by the government. While they might share similarities with cryptocurrencies \u2014 running on a Blockchain for example \u2014 they\u2019re not necessarily cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the words of Chimezie Chuta, Founder/ Coordinator Blockchain Nigeria User Group, Vice Chairman Blockchain Industry Coordinating Committee of Nigeria (BICCoN), and Member Fintech Alliance Coordinating Team (FACT), \u201cThere are characteristics that make cryptocurrencies what they\u2019re which CBDCs are not.\u201d\n\nHe states that the CBN is not creating a cryptocurrency as some might think. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do basically is to turn our Naira fiat currency into a currency that is designed for the internet.\u201d\n\nSimply, CBDCs are currencies created digitally to facilitate digital transactions. While we can already perform digital transactions with the Naira, the eNaira does not need to be backed by physical cash.\n\nWill the eNaira grow in value like Bitcoin?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nThe eNaira will not grow or plummet in value like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n\nInterestingly, the eNaira will function the same way the Naira does. The difference being the former is digital. The eNaira will be pegged to the Naira so their value remains the same, like stable coins pegged to the dollar.\n\n\u201cIssuing CBDC will not suddenly turn your fortunes around,\u201d Chuta says.\n\nThe eNaira is pegged to the Naira, meaning it maintains the value of the Naira.\n\nOwonibi corroborates Chuta\u2019s stance, emphasising that the eNaira \u201cdoesn\u2019t provide insulation from inflation.\u201d\n\nEssentially, it works the same way stablecoins maintain value. A stable coin is a cryptocurrency that is immune to volatility. They are pegged to with a fiat currency and hold the same value as the fiat. Per Investopedia, they are backed by reverse assets like commodities or a foreign currency. In the case of the eNaira, it will be backed by the Naira.\n\nHow will the eNaira work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nOwonibi, who is one of the brains consulted by the CBN on how a digital currency could work, reveals that banks and fintech will have a significant role to play in deploying the eNaira.\n\n\u201cThe interconnected nature of the payment landscape will be maintained, meaning\u2026the deposit money banks and Nigeria Inter-bank Settlement System (NIBSS) will still have a role\u2026fintech companies will also have a role and the central bank will be in the middle.\u201d\n\nThis suggests that while the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain, the Blockchain network selected by the CBN for the eNaira to run on, is permissioned, the government will grant access to all the parties stated by Owonibi. Nevertheless, it has full control of the system.\n\nFinancial institutions will play roles in identity verification, payment processing amongst other things.\n\nOwonibi adds that \u201canyone holding a fintech licence can mint the eNaira and also create wallets for customers.\u201d\n\nIn Chuta\u2019s explanation of how the digital currency will work, he points out that it will be a peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction by people who have the eNaira wallet \u201c just like we do in crypto, the wallets will enable you to store, send and receive the eNaira\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Owonibi\u2019s claim that fintech with licences will be able to mint the eNaira, Chuta believes the CBN will be the only one minting the digital currency. A legal claim by the CBN will back up every digital currency minted to keep inflation in check. He describes it as \u201ca legal claim of the availability of that Naira in a physical vote\u201d\n\nChuta highlights steps for the implementation of the eNaira which includes issuing of the currency by the CBN, distribution through licensed financial institutions, exchange between individuals and businesses and monitoring by the CBN.\n\nOwonibi clarifies further by saying wallets will be created through financial institutions the same way bank accounts are created.\n\nSimilarly, China\u2019s digital Yuan is being distributed through commercial banks. Per CNBC, they will be responsible for getting the currency in the hands of consumers.\n\nWill the eNaira be connected with existing bank accounts?\n\nNo, the eNaira will be created independently of bank accounts. According to Owonibi, the wallets will be created by financial institutions that will create customer identification through an application product interface (API).\n\nChuta on the other hand says the connection of CBDC wallets to existing bank accounts is a bit tricky. While he\u2019s not certain, he believes that there should be a linkage between Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) and the wallets. \u201cWithout that, an individual could have two identities,\u201d he says.\n\nIn China\u2019s case, however, the digital Yuan has no ties with existing bank details. People\u2019s Bank Of China (PBOC) Deputy Governor, Fan Yifei tells CNBC that existing bank accounts may not necessarily be linked to digital Yuan wallets.\n\nCan the government monitor transactions with the eNaira?\n\nYes, the government can monitor all eNaira transactions on the Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain.\n\nThe government is issuing a CBDC to maintain its own monetary sovereignty, Chuta tells Techpoint Africa. If cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherum gain more traction, the government will lose that control. Hence the eNaira is a way of retaining control.\n\nHe admits that \u201csadly\u201d, the government sees and controls all that happens with the eNaira directly.\n\n\u201cAt which point do you clear the intersection of citizens\u2019 privacy?\u201d\n\nThese are some of the questions Owonibi says he put to the CBN but got no response. He reveals that the Chinese government unequivocally stated that transactions with the digital Yuan will be monitored meticulously. Perhaps Nigeria could follow suit.\n\nSeveral questions remain unanswered\n\nUntil the pilot scheme for the eNaira commences in October, no one knows for sure what to expect. From how cross border payments will work, to how privacy will be ensured, Owonibi admits to me that he has several unanswered questions\n\nCome October, he hopes to get more clarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

On August 2, 2021, digital microfinance bank, Kuda, announced that they had secured a $55 million Series B.\n\nWho participated? This Series B \u2014 which follows a $10m pre-seed in November 2020 and a $25m Series A in March 2021 \u2014 was co-led by previous investors, Valar Ventures and Target Global.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, Kuda has secured $91.6m in funding. The startup had a valuation of over $500m, with a customer base of 1.4 million registered users.\n\nWith only 298 million banked Africans as of 2017, this figure is estimated to double by 2022. Kuda plans to extend its reach beyond Nigeria into other African countries with this funding.\n\nKuda Bank was founded in 2018 and initially operated as a Nigeria-based savings platform. It has now transited into a digital microfinance bank licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nRead more about Kuda\u2019s Series B here: Nigerian fintech, Kuda Bank closes $55 million Series B to expand into other African countries\n\nPayPal joins Catalyst Fund to support fintech programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalyst Fund homepage\n\nManaged by BFA Global, Catalyst Fund has announced the 9th cohort of its inclusive fintech programme and welcomes PayPal on board as a new sponsor.\n\nThis cohort includes six fintech startups that focus on agricultural financing, healthcare facilities, credit access, and digital banking, with three from Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa.\n\nFun fact: Though Africa only contributes 7.7% of the annual global greenhouse gas emissions, it bears the brunt of climate change.\n\nWhy is this fact important? Despite the continent\u2019s relatively small contribution to annual global greenhouse emissions, it is the hardest hit by the impacts of climate change, with temperature increases and unpredictable rainfall bad for African populations heavily reliant on nature for food and their livelihoods.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it is important to explore the role of digital finance in combating these challenges on the continent.\n\nRead the full story here:\n\nPayPal joins US-based accelerator, Catalyst Fund as it announces 9th cohort of its inclusive fintech programme\n\nThrive Agric\u2019s Adia Sowho is now MTN\u2019s CMO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdia Sowho, Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), MTN Nigeria.

The Delta variant is very contagious and spreads very wide, with a greater impact on those that are yet to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here at this center to check the readiness of the facilities and the availability of oxygen, as well as ensure that we have all it takes to move 100 patients for treatment,\u201d he stated.\n\nNoting the level of the state\u2019s preparedness, the governor said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have an industrial plant here but buy retail cylinders into this facility, ensuring adequate planning and back up so that no matter the amount of oxygen needed, we would get it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on plans to vaccinate more Edo people to protect them from the deadly virus, Obaseki further noted: \u201cI spoke with the National Primary Healthcare Agency last week and as we speak now, I believe that the plane conveying about four million vials of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines should be landing in Abuja, if it hasn\u2019t already.\n\n\u201cWe are making arrangements, as a state, to go out and pick up our own consignment and bring them in here to vaccinate more of our people; we don\u2019t have to wait for the national logistics to come and deliver to us. I have made arrangements to charter a plane to go bring them; if I have to personally go and collect those vaccines, I will do so.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Stella Obasanjo Hospital, Dr. Osagie Ebomwonyi, said the facility currently has about 18 patients, out of which 17 are serving corps members.\n\nHe said the confirmed cases are unvaccinated, adding, \u201cWe are undertaking studies and analysis to find out if we have the Delta variant in the state.\u201d\n\n...",

Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu who addressed journalists in Benin City, on the performance of Adegoke noted that if not for the bad luck that hit the athlete, he was on the path to claim a medal for Nigeria at the event.\n\nHe said despite the outcome of the race in the final, the Edo State Government will give Adegoke a red-carpet reception when he returns to the country as he is a worthy ambassador of Edo State.\n\nShaibu said, \u201cEdo people are very proud of the performance of Enoch Adegoke. He was a medal hopeful until that muscle pull. The incident in the final was unfortunate as his takeoff was very good just about 40 to 50 meters before the bad luck in the game caught up with him. We will celebrate with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus is to bring him back home as our ambassador and prepare him for other future activities and also check his medical condition to ensure in future events he doesn\u2019t suffer such ill luck.\u201d\n\nHe added that lack of preparation has a lot of impact on the performance of Nigerian athletes which include Enoch Adegoke as they all depended on the goodwill of spirited Nigerians to embark on their training, noting that Edo State also gave their support.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at this level today because we have reduced sports to politics. We are proud of Enoch Adegoke who made us proud in Tokyo following his outstanding performance in the race until the muscle pull stole the show from him in the final of the 100m mens final,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

Many of these victims are afraid of revealing information on their traffickers because of threats, but we are taking measures to provide safe houses and cover for them until we are able to get prosecutions.\u201d\n\nHe explained that in the last four years under his watch, the number of persons trafficked from the state had reduced with the rehabilitation and reintegration of over 6,500 returnees.\n\n...",

          "text": "Barely two weeks after the Emir of Muri in Taraba State, Abbas Tafida, issued a 30-day ultimatum for cattle herders to vacate forests in the state or be flushed out, a Fulani herders\u2019 group in the state say they are working hard to fish out criminals in their ranks.\n\nThe state Chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, Sahabi Mahmud, stated this when he led leaders of Fulani communities in the state to a meeting with the emir in his palace in Jalingo on Monday.\n\nThe emir\u2019s threat arose from the worsening security situation in Taraba, where herders have been blamed for abduction for ransom, highway robbery and killings in the state.\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, Mr Mahmud said the leadership of Miyetti Allah was disturbed by the spate of abductions and other criminal activities in the state being blamed on herders.\n\nHe said the leaders had held a series of meetings and resolved \u201cto crush the criminal elements among our groups.\u201d\n\nMr Mahmud said they have sworn to an oath not to harbour criminals and to also expose sponsors of bandits, no matter the positions they hold in the society.\n\nUrging the emir to give them time to fulfill their house cleaning pledge, he promised the communities would work closely with security agencies to ensure the criminal elements among them are brought to book.\n\nIn the communique issued at the end of the over four hours meeting, Mr Mahmud said the group would record repentant bandits and hand over unrepentant ones to security agents.\n\n\u201cThose who repent would be documented, while those that refuse to repent and stop kidnapping and other crimes would equally be handed over to security agents to face the appropriate laws of the land,\u201d the communique stated.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed not to harbour criminals, even if they are our biological children, and we have sworn to an oath to expose their sponsors no matter their standing in the society.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, fulfilling the oath will be tasking but they will use everything they have to ensure that the bad eggs among the Fulanis are flushed out of the state in order to restore the damage to their image caused by the few bad elements in their midst.\n\nResponding, the emir, Mr Tafida said the 30 days ultimatum he issued during his Eid-el-Kabir speech was targeted at herders behind crimes such as kidnapping and armed robbery in the state.\n\nHe lamented that the image of the Fulani as a race was endangered by the criminal activities of the few among them involved in kidnapping and other crimes.\n\nThe emir urged the people not to misunderstand his comment, as it was intended to sanitise the conduct of Fulani herdsmen who are his kinsmen.\n\n\u201cAs a leader who stood firmly on the side of the truth and honesty, I would never allow injustice among my subjects.\n\n\u201cThere is no limit to the steps a father can take to correct the bad behaviour of his children,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs you know the Fulani have continued to be proud of the scholarship of leaders like Shehu Usman Danfodio and Sultan Muhammadu Bello who reformed and spread Islam and ensured justice for all in Northern Nigeria but the integrity of the Fulani as moulded by these past leaders was fast fading away because of the activities of the criminal elements,\u201d the emir said.\n\nHe also cited Modibbo Buba Yero, the founder of the Muri Emirate, as an exemplary leader of Fulani that fought injustice.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThose were role models of the Fulani who never associated themselves with shame and who distanced their ethnic groups from crime and criminality,\u201d he said.\n\nHe then commended the leadership of the Fulani communities for tasking themselves to fish out the bad eggs among them in the interest of peace in the state.\n\nThe emir also directed the leaders to submit the list of those that are willing to repent and those that are not willing to him after sorting it out.\n\nThe meeting was attended by herders and Fulani community leaders \u2013 Ardos and Jauros \u2013 drawn from 14 out of the 16 local government areas of Taraba State.\n\nThe Security Adviser to Governor Darius Ishaku, Angyo Agbu, was also at the meeting.",

Gbenga Elegbeleye who stated these while addressing a press conference in Osogbo on Monday, at the State party secretariat, expressed satisfaction with the Ward Congresses held in Osun at the weekend, describing it as huge success.\n\nHe also debunked insinuations making the round that members of the Committee did not meet with stakeholders of the party before exercise, saying those peddling such insinuations were on a self-serving motive.\n\nElegbeleye disclosed that the Committee met with stakeholders of the APC in the State including three former deputy governors, serving members of the National Assembly, Speaker of the State House of Assembly, among other key stakeholders of the party.\n\nHe therefore noted that it would be hypocritical of any discerning mind and member of the party to say that those whom the Committee met with are not stakeholders of the APC in Osun.\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cWe came in on Friday and held a Stakeholders\u2019 meeting with the leaders of the party who are critical stakeholders of the party. This stakeholders\u2019 meeting had the Governor in attendance, with three former Deputy Governors, Speaker of State House of Assembly, members of the National Assembly among other leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cSo, you can not say such generality of the party\u2019s leaders that we met are not representatives of the people. We actually met with those we all know as leaders of the party. They are indeed the leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cWhat we did on Saturday was to ensure that only those who got and filled nomination forms, passed through screening process participated in the Ward Congresses, and it is only this set of people that can be declared the winners of the Ward Congresses.\n\n\u201cWe were given the mandate from the National Secretariat, so, there is no way we will declare those who didn\u2019t collect nomination forms, who didn\u2019t fill them and who didn\u2019t pass through the screening process as winners.\n\n\u201cSo, it is those who participated in the Congress who collected forms, filled forms, passed through screening exercise that we can say are eligible.\n\n\u201cI have the forms of each of the three senatorial districts with me and I am using this opportunity, on behalf of my colleagues in Congress Committee to declare those who were screened as elected representatives and new executive of each of the wards they represent.\u201d",

          "text": "For his achievements in bursting criminals and confronting all forms of insecurity, Abba Kyari became Nigeria\u2019s super cop. The toast of many police officers. The most decorated police officer succeeded in arresting high profile criminals like Chukwudi Onuamadike, the notorious kidnap kingpin better known as Evans, in 2017.\n\nHe said the kidnapper gave him $2 million if he could keep quiet and let him go but he did not collect. This revelation fetched him a round of applause from many including the presidency.\n\nIn 2019, Kyari\u2019s team busted Taraba\u2019s most wanted kidnap kingpin, Hamisu Wadume. Unfortunately, soldiers opened fire on the police officers along Ibi-Wukari Road while driving Wadume to Jalingo. Three officers and a civilian died in the process.\n\nMore success stories\n\nAfter the death of former Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) Air Marshal Alex Badeh, Kyari led the team that arrested the killers and he also helped government to capture Boko-Haram Commander Umar Abdulmalik alongside eight of his terrorist gang members.\n\nFor these feats, he won the police medal for courage three years in a row (2012, 2013 and 2014), and the House of Representatives last year honoured him for his hard work and outstanding performance over the years in the Nigeria Police.\n\nKyari got the attention of President Muhammadu Buhari who honoured him with the Presidential Medal for Courage in April 2016. He is also a three-time recipient of the Lagos State Governor\u2019s Award for Gallantry, Leadership and Service Excellence in 2011, 2012, 2013, and the Lagos State Commissioner of Police Commendation Award for Courage in 2011.\n\nHe was declared Africa\u2019s Best Detective in 2018. Kyari recently bagged the best police officer of the decade award and the 2018 hero of the year award by the Silverbird Group.\n\nHis dubious activities with Hushpuppi\n\nHushpuppi was a widely known \u2018Instagram celebrity\u2019 in Nigeria. Before his arrest in June 2020, he had a global following of over 2.5 million on Instagram, where he posted pictures and videos of his exotic cars, watches, designer clothes, and bags from luxury brands like Gucci, Fendi, and Louis Vuitton. He also shared posts of himself boarding helicopters with celebrities, footballers, and Nigerian politicians.\n\nHe was busted last year by FBI in Dubai and was extradited to the U.S. to face trial. He recently name Kyari as part of those who made his fraudulent activities successful in the past. Hushpuppi had disagreement with his co-fraudster, Vincent Kelly Chibuzo, over a $1.1 million fraudulent deal against a Qatari businessman, he reportedly contacted Kyari to arrest Chibuzo and Kyari sent pictures of Chibuzo in jail to Hushpuppi.\n\nKyari allegedly sent a bank account number to Hushppupi to wire the fee for the arrest and detention of his co-fraudster. This triggered outrage on social media and in swift reaction, Kyari said he only helped the fraudster to facilitate the purchase of native attires. He said Hushppupi directly paid about N300,000 into the seller\u2019s account.\n\nNigerians felt Kyari was economical with the truth and FBI further revealed that he got N8 million from Hushpuppi.\n\nThe Fall\n\nFollowing his recent entanglement with Hushpuppi, the police authorities have ordered and Kyari has been suspended by Police Service Commission as recommended by the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba.\n\nThe spokesperson of the force, Frank Mba, said in a statement on Sunday that \u201cthe suspension is also expected to create an enabling environment for the NPF Special Investigation Panel to carry out its investigations into the weighty allegations against DCP Abba Kyari without interference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension is without prejudice to the constitutional presumption of innocence in favour of the officer. The probe panel will be led by Joseph Egbunike, deputy inspector-general of police in-charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SIP, inter alia, is to undertake a detailed review of all the allegations against DCP Abba Kyari by the US Government as contained in relevant documents that have been availed of the NPF by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The SIP is also to obtain detailed representation of DCP Abba Kyari to all the allegations levelled against him, conduct further investigations as it deems fit, and submit recommendations to guide further actions by the force Leadership on the matter.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the IGP appointed Tunji Disu as Kyari\u2019s replacement.",

They contribute to comprehensively advancing digital inclusion, focusing on multiple dimensions of human rights, open Internet, quality of access, and inclusive multi-stakeholder governance for building resilient West Africa and achieving SDGs.\n\nDorothy Gordon, Chair of UNESCO\u2019 Information for All Programme, reaffirmed the need for strong advocacy from national and regional stakeholders to implement the national assessment of IUIs across the West-African countries. She further called for more engagement from civil society to represent vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as disabled people, women, or the youth.\n\nProfessor Alain Kiyindou pointed out that the assessment of the ROAM-X indicators in countries like Benin and Niger offers tremendous opportunities to push forward the development of the Internet in West Africa. This framework empowers national stakeholders to gain a better understanding of their digital landscape and engage in the digital transformation and inclusion process.\n\nRepresenting Development House, Kafui Aheto introduced the initial findings of the ongoing national assessment of ROAM-X indicators in Ghana. He highlighted the importance of multi-stakeholders in guiding the overall assessment process and building policy development in Ghana.\n\nROAM-X indicators assessments have been progressing in 28 countries, including the following African countries: Benin, Senegal, Kenya, Ghana, Niger, Ethiopia, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Cabo Verde, Burkina Faso. All participants agreed on the importance for African countries to mainstream ROAM principles and the urgent need to expand advocacy, capacity-building, resource mobilization, and multistakeholder partnerships to scale up national assessment projects across the region.\n\nUNESCO encourages all countries in the West-African sub-region to continue using the ROAM framework and join the Dynamic Coalition on Internet Universality Indicators (IUIs) to bring the Internet forward in the region.",

          "text": "Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has raised an alarm over the increasing figure of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the state and warned foreigners who violate guidelines that they risk deportation.\n\nAt a press briefing on Monday, the governor called on residents to adhere strictly to the guidelines put in place to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nLagos State, the epicenter of the pandemic in Nigeria has witnessed a rise in positivity rate; from 1.1 percent at the start of July to seven percent by the time the month ended.\n\nThis has left the Governor worried.\n\n\u201cAs of August 1, 2021, the positivity rate in Lagos is 8.9 per cent. This is an eight-fold increase over the recorded figure a month ago, and it should rightly alarm all of us,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in 4,300 confirmed cases in July alone and 352 admissions into our isolation facilities.\u201d\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu believes everyone should be concerned about the rising cases, but he does not want people to panic.\n\nInstead, he expects them to approach the situation \u201cwith a firm resolve and determination to reverse the trend\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have done it before and we can do it again,\u201d he said.\n\nSix Deaths Per Day\n\nThe third wave of the pandemic has no doubt hit Lagos State proper and while it has not been as disruptive as the first and second waves, it has led to the reintroduction of restrictions and forced the management of the University of Lagos to send students home.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu admitted that the state was already in the third wave of the pandemic but he believes previous experiences battling the disease will help the state prevail over it.\n\nTo achieve that objective, according to him, the state and its resident will have to dig deep and summon the will to do everything necessary.\n\nFrom the start of the outbreak in February 2020, Lagos has recorded a total of 64,032 confirmed COVID-19 cases, out of which 56,336 have recovered and 2,755 being managed actively in the community.\n\n\u201cWe have, sadly, recorded 390 fatalities in Lagos State, 30 of which have taken place in this current third wave of the pandemic. Essentially, we have recorded on average six deaths per day since last week,\u201d the governor said.\n\nOver the course of managing the pandemic, about 5,029 patients have been admitted into various care centers in the state.\n\nVaccination has played a crucial part in the battle against the pandemic and Nigeria has not been left out.\n\nIn Lagos, Governor Sanwo-Olu said 404,414 people and 243,374 residents have received both doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nWith an estimated 21 million residents in the state, the Governor is worried that just one per cent of residents have received both COVID-19 jabs, considering that the state was already confronted by a third wave.\n\nTo better the statistics, he said the government would explore all avenues possible to ramp up access to vaccination, so as to attain its herd immunity target of administering vaccines to at least 60 per cent of the population.\n\nDefaulting Passengers Risk Deportation\n\nA major obstacle to the race to end the pandemic is compliance with guidelines and protocols and the governor is taking a tough position when it comes to violations.\n\nHe warned returning passengers from red-listed countries \u2013 India, South Africa, Brazil, and Turkey \u2013 to observe protocols including mandatory isolation or risk sanctions.\n\nAnyone caught breaching the isolation protocols would be subjected to a host of sanctions and penalties, including fines and possible prosecution under the public health laws, the governor warned.\n\nAlready, he said, the state was preparing a list of absconders that would be sent to the Presidential Steering Committee and the Lagos State Ministry of Justice.\n\nAccording to the governor, defaulting foreigners risk revocation of their permanent residency and deportation while erring Nigerians will be duly prosecuted.\n\nMeanwhile, the vaccination drive received a boost on Monday as the Federal Government received over four million doses of Moderna vaccine donated by the United States Government.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectation that as the epicentre of the epidemic, Lagos State will receive a sizeable amount of this allocation,\u201d Governor Sanwo-Olu said, commending the US for the donation.\n\n\u201cThis vaccine cannot be mixed with the AstraZeneca vaccine, so it will only be for people that have not been previously vaccinated. We are still expecting the second allocation of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and will inform you when it is received.\u201d",

          "text": "Authorities in Wuhan on Tuesday said they would test its entire population for Covid-19 after the central Chinese city where the coronavirus emerged reported its first local infections in more than a year.\n\nChina is battling its largest coronavirus outbreak in months, confining the residents of entire cities to their homes, cutting transport links and rolling out mass testing as the fast-spreading Delta variant challenges its zero-Covid strategy and homegrown vaccines.\n\nBeijing had previously boasted of its success in crushing the virus, allowing the economy to rebound and normal life to return while swathes of the globe have struggled with the pandemic that has killed more than four million people worldwide.\n\nBut the latest outbreak is threatening China\u2019s success with more than 400 domestic cases reported since mid-July when a cluster among airport cleaners in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, sparked infections in over 20 cities across more than a dozen provinces.\n\nWuhan, a city of 11 million, is \u201cswiftly launching comprehensive nucleic acid testing of all residents\u201d, senior city official Li Tao said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities announced on Monday that seven locally transmitted infections had been found among migrant workers in the city, breaking a year-long streak without domestic cases after Wuhan squashed an initial outbreak with an unprecedented lockdown in early 2020.\n\nAnd the holiday destination of Zhangjiajie in central China\u2019s Hunan province abruptly announced Tuesday that no one would be allowed to exit the city, after closing tourist attractions and encouraging visitors to leave last week.\n\n\u201cAll residents, tourists and other personnel are forbidden to leave Zhangjiajie,\u201d according to a brief notice published in the city\u2019s Communist Party mouthpiece Zhangjiajie Daily.\n\nMajor cities including the capital Beijing have now tested millions of residents while cordoning off residential compounds and placing close contacts under quarantine.\n\nChina reported 61 domestic cases on Tuesday.\n\n\u2018Spare no expense\u2019\n\nThe eastern city of Yangzhou, near Nanjing, was the latest local government to order residents to stay home after large-scale testing detected 40 new infections over the past day.\n\nThe more than 1.3 million residents of Yangzhou\u2019s urban core are now confined to their homes, with each household allowed to send only one person outside per day to shop for necessities, the city government said Tuesday.\n\nThe announcement comes after Zhuzhou city near Zhangjiajie imposed similar orders in recent days on more than two million people combined.\n\nThe outbreak spread to Hunan from Nanjing last month after people in the airport cluster attended theatre performances in Zhangjiajie.\n\nOfficials have since been desperately tracking down thousands of fellow theatregoers and urging tourists not to travel to areas where cases have been found.\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing has blocked tourists from entering the capital during the peak summer holiday travel season and asked residents not to leave unless necessary, with top officials vowing over the weekend to \u201cspare no expense\u201d in defending the city.\n\nPhotos from Wuhan on Monday showed supermarket shelves stripped bare by shoppers apparently stocking up in preparation of being locked back down, in scenes reminiscent of the panic buying before the city was cut off from the rest of the world for 76 days last year in the first lockdown.\n\nOfficials took to social media on Tuesday pledging to \u201ccalm the panicked mood of city residents\u201d, announcing that stores had promised to keep prices and supply chains stable.\n\nMao, a 27-year-old Wuhan resident, told AFP he was \u201cnot worried\u201d about the new outbreak as \u201cWuhan has accumulated rich experience\u201d, including widespread vaccination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned at all that the city will be locked down again,\u201d he said, giving his surname only.\n\n-AFP",

          "text": "Afghan forces battled to stop a first major city from falling to the Taliban as the United States and the United Kingdom accused the group of \u201cmassacring civilians\u201d in a Kandahar town they recently captured near the Pakistan border.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban massacred dozens of civilians in revenge killings. These murders could constitute war crimes,\u201d the embassies of Washington and London said in separate tweets on Monday regarding the alleged atrocities committed in Spin Boldak.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban\u2019s leadership must be held responsible for the crimes of their fighters. If you cannot control your fighters now, you have no business in governance later.\u201d\n\nSuhail Shaheen, a Taliban negotiating team member based in Doha, told Reuters news agency that tweets containing the accusations were \u201cbaseless reports\u201d.\n\nThe US and UK diplomatic condemnations come after Afghanistan\u2019s Independent Human Rights Commission also said Taliban fighters had indulged in revenge killings in Spin Boldak.\n\n\u201cAfter taking over Spin Boldak district, the Taliban chased and identified past and present government officials and killed these people who had no combat role in the conflict,\u201d the group said, adding at least 40 people had been killed by the Taliban.\n\nAfghan security forces start operations against Taliban around Torkham border point between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Nangarhar province, Afghanistan [Anadolu Agency/Getty Images]\n\nMeanwhile, Taliban fighters continued to assault at least three provincial capitals \u2013 Lashkar Gah, Kandahar and Herat \u2013 after a weekend of heavy fighting that saw thousands of civilians flee.\n\nThe war has intensified since early May, with the Taliban capitalising on the final stages of the withdrawal of the US-led foreign forces after almost 20 years in the country.\n\nFighting continued in the southern Afghan city of Lashkar Gah overnight as Afghan forces beat back a fresh assault from the Taliban.\n\n\u201cAfghan forces on the ground and by air strikes repelled the attack,\u201d the military in Helmand said.\n\nResident Hawa Malalai told the AFP news agency that there was a growing crisis in the city: \u201cThere is fighting, power cuts, sick people in hospital, the telecommunication networks are down. There are no medicines and pharmacies are closed.\u201d\n\nMedical charity Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres, or MSF) said casualties were mounting in Lashkar Gah.\n\n\u201cThere has been relentless gunfire, air strikes and mortars in densely populated areas. Houses are being bombed, and many people are suffering severe injuries,\u201d said Sarah Leahy, the aid group\u2019s coordinator for Helmand, in a statement.\n\nHelmand for years was the centrepiece of the US and British military campaign in Afghanistan \u2013 only for it to slip deeper into instability.\n\nThe loss of Lashkar Gah would be a massive strategic and psychological blow for the government, which has pledged to defend provincial capitals at all costs after losing much of the countryside to the Taliban over the summer.\n\nFighting also surged in some districts of Kandahar province, the former bastion of the Taliban, and on the outskirts of its capital.\n\nIn the west, hundreds of commandos were also defending Herat after days of fierce fighting.\n\nKabul has repeatedly dismissed the Taliban\u2019s steady gains over the summer as lacking strategic value, but has largely failed to reverse their momentum.\n\nThe capture of any important city by the Taliban would take their current offensive to another level and fuel concerns about the ability of the Afghan military.\n\nThe Taliban has seized Afghan cities in the past but has retained them only briefly.\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s President Ashraf Ghani blamed the country\u2019s deteriorating security on the US deciding \u201cabruptly\u201d to withdraw its troops.\n\nPresenting his security plan before parliament on Monday, Ghani said the situation in the war-torn nation will be \u201cunder control within six months\u201d, adding that the US has pledged its full support.\n\n\u201cThe reason for our current situation is that the decision was taken abruptly,\u201d he told parliament, adding he had warned Washington the withdrawal would have \u201cconsequences\u201d.\n\nThe president added that \u201cprotection of the people\u201d is a duty he will maintain.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s James Bays, reporting from Kabul, said while Ghani was addressing the security problems in the country, he was \u201cnot really talking about solutions\u201d, causing concern among members of the international community.\n\n\u201cWe have not heard a detailed plan \u2026 I\u2019ve spoken to many members of the international community and diplomats here [Kabul], who are concerned,\u201d Bays said.\n\n\u201cThey believe the president really does need to set out a plan \u2013 not only a plan in order to execute it, to solve the military problems on the ground, but also because they say the Afghan people need to hear that he has a plan because morale is slumping,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the US said it will take in thousands of more Afghan refugees as violence surged across the country.\n\n\u201cIn light of increased levels of Taliban violence, the US government is working to provide certain Afghans, including those who worked with the United States, the opportunity for refugee resettlement,\u201d the State Department said in a statement on Monday.\n\nThese will include current and former employees of the US-based news organisations, US-based aid and development agencies and other relief groups that receive US funding.\n\nCurrent and former employees of the US government and the NATO military operation who do not meet the criteria for a dedicated programme for such workers are also covered.\n\nWashington has already started evacuating thousands of interpreters and their families who worked with the military and embassy over the past 20 years.",

          "text": "As part of the many measures taken to address the allegations levied against a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, Monday, approved the posting of DCP Tunji Disu as the new Head of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT).\n\nA statement issued by Force Public Relations Officer, Mr. Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said the posting of the officer followed management\u2019s decision to fill the leadership gap within the IRT and refocus the unit for better service delivery.\n\nBut THISDAY has learnt that the presidency, apparently feeling obligated to its extradition treaty, had Saturday evening directed the Baba to suspend Kyari.\n\nThis is as the DIG Joseph Egbunike-led panel set up by the Inspector-General of Police to probe the allegations against Kyari, has also begun sitting in Abuja.\n\nAccording to a statement by Mba, which stated that the posting took immediate effect, \u201cThe IGP has charged the new head of the IRT to demonstrate his professional competence in his leadership of the unit.\n\n\u201cHe also assured citizens that the IRT will remain focused in the discharge of its duties in line with national statutes and international best practices\u201d, he said.\n\nPrior to his appointment as the new Head of the IRT, Disu, the statement stated, is a former Commander of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) Lagos State, and Deputy Commissioner of Police, Department of Operations, Force Headquarters, Abuja.\n\nHe had also previously served at the State CID, Rivers State as the Deputy Head of the Unit. He was also a Commander of the Nigeria Police Contingent to the African Union (AU) Peace Keeping Mission in Dafur, Sudan.\n\nDisu holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the Lagos State University (LASU) and a Master\u2019s Degree in Public Administration from the Adekunle Ajasin University, Ondo State.\n\nHe has also attended several professional courses both at home and abroad, including small arms smuggling training in Botswana, internet fraud training at the Cambridge University, UK, strategic leadership command course at the Police Staff College, Jos, forensic investigations and criminal intelligence course at the University of Lagos, amongst others.\n\nHe is a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Nigeria Institute of Public Relations and Chattered Institute of Personnel Management, among other professional bodies.\n\nMeanwhile, more details on how Kyari got to this point have emerged as the IG, THISDAY gathered, had a four-hour marathon meeting on Friday with Kyari, where he directed him to respond to the allegations against him as contained in US court papers and served on the police by the FBI in writing.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the Egbunike-led panel sat and deliberated on the terms of reference as prescribed by the IG before moving forward.\n\nKyari, the man at the center of the $1.1million fraud linking him with notorious internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas also known as Hushpuppi, is expected to appear before the committee this week.\n\nDuring the meeting with the IG on Friday, Kyari had allegedly made a preliminary response, which served as a guide in reviewing the case before the presidential directive on his suspension was communicated to Force headquarters.\n\nIt was gathered that officials of the US government had reminded the federal government of the existing extradition treaty between the United States and Nigeria and the need for the latter to discharge its obligations under the treaty.\n\nCompetent sources told THISDAY that pressure from the US had compelled the presidency to take urgent steps on the matter in order to maintain the anti-graft posture of the government and to satisfy its international treaty obligations.\n\n\u201cThe directive to suspend Kyari was from the presidency. The IG was directed to suspend him and investigate the matter. But he cannot do that without making a recommendation to the Police Service Commission (PSC), which he did and the PSC immediately approved his suspension.\n\n\u201cThere is international pressure and you know this is a serious issue that cannot be left for IG alone to handle. The image of this country is at stake here\u201d, a police source said.\n\nA foremost human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana, had in an interview with THISDAY, urged the federal government to adhere to the extradition treaty.\n\n\u201cThe United States and Nigeria have an extradition treaty, which covers the offences allegedly committed by DCP Abba Kyari. If the police officer insists on his innocence, he may want to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the District Court in the United States.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the United States government will have to request for his extradition in accordance with the terms of the Treaty. Once the request is received by the federal government, the Attorney-General/Minister of Justice will commence extradition proceedings in the Federal High Court. Alternatively, the office of the Attorney-General may file charges against the police officer since the offences were committed in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen I suggested to the federal government to request for the extradition of Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a Igboho), I was simply advising the authorities of both Nigeria and Benin Republic to operate under international law. I am also asking Nigeria and the United States to handle Abba Kyari\u2019s case under international law,\u201d he said.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

This was contained in a statement signed by Registrar, Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN), Dr. Tajudeen Sanusi.\n\nThe statement followed the declaration of an indefinite industrial action by the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) from Monday.\n\nSanusi said the law regulating the housemanship programme does not condone strike action by House Officers. He said anyone found to be disobeying the rule should be reported to the Chief Medical Director, Medical Director or Medical Superintendent of the affected housemanship training Institution.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cDuring the housemanship, doctors and dentists are required to undertake 12 weeks\u2019 uninterrupted postings in each of Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and Paediatrics and other relevant specialties for dentistry.\n\n\u201cAny interruption for any reason, including embarking on strike actions, during any of the postings will not be condoned, and should be reported immediately to the Chief Medical Director, Medical Director or Medical Superintendent of the housemanship training Institution.\u201d\n\nThe registrar said Section 2d(iii) of the Guidelines on Registration (2003 ed.) prescribed that \u201ca supervising doctor who fails in his duties in this regard is liable to proceedings being commenced against him at the Disciplinary Organs of Council if his misdeed in the matter is brought to the notice of Council.\n\n\u201cEmbarking on strike actions by house officers will lead to repeat of the posting(s) afresh without remuneration. House officers are, therefore, advised to avoid participation in activities, like industrial actions, that could lead to interruption in their postings.\u201d\n\nThe registrar also cautioned medical and dental practitioners that provisional registration did not guarantee automatic admittance to the full register. Full registration is granted only on satisfactory completion of housemanship training, he stated.\n\nSanusi added, \u201cChief Medical Directors, Medical Directors and Medical Superintendents should note their responsibilities to ensure that all doctors, over whom they have administrative charge, abide by all extant regulations.\u201d\n\nNational President of NARD, Dr. Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, had announced the strike on Saturday in Umuahia at the end of the union\u2019s National Executive Council meeting. Uyilawa cited the inability of the federal government to implement agreements it entered with the association more than three months ago as reason for the industrial action.\n\nThe NARD president gave other reasons to include poor working environment in public hospitals and irregular payment of doctors\u2019 salaries and hazard allowances.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
