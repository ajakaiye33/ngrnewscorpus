          "text": "THE Federal Government on Sunday said it was not aware of any plan by the National Association of Resident Doctors to embark on strike on Monday (today).\n\nThis was just as NARD maintained that there was no going back on the planned strike.\n\nThe spokesperson for the Federal Ministry of Labour, Charles Akpan, told The PUNCH that the ministry was not aware of the intended strike.\n\nAkpan said, \u201cAs you are aware, this is the weekend and offices are closed. I cannot confirm if there is any document in the office concerning NARD and strike. You will have to call or contact me on Monday.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the President, Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, in an interview with one of our correspondents on Sunday, revealed that the Federal Government had not reached out to the association.\n\nOkhuaihesuyi said, \u201cThey have not reached out to us at all; so, the strike continues. We are not calling it off until our requests are attended to. It is quite sad but we apologise to Nigerians for the inconveniences.\n\nLagos denies slashing NYSC doctors\u2019 pay\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Government has dismissed claims by NARD that it directed a reduction in the monthly payment of National Youth Service Corps doctors from N75,000 to N15,000.\n\nRecall that NARD, at the end of its annual National Executive Council meeting in Abia on Saturday, had criticised Lagos for its hastiness in the implementation of a Federal Government directive to stop the enrolment of interns, house officers and NYSC members on the National Health Insurance Scheme, among others.\n\nBut the government in a statement on Sunday by the Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pension, Mrs Ajibola Ponle, maintained that at no time did the Government Issue any order to cut the allowances of NYSC doctors.\n\nThe statement titled, \u2018LASG did not issue directive to reduce allowances of NYSC doctors \u2013Commissioner,\u2019 described the claim of the purported reduction of NYSC doctors\u2019 allowances as false and misleading.\n\nIt read in part, \u201cGovernor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu remains committed to the welfare of Lagos State Government employees, particularly the health workers who have showed commitment, bravery and resilience in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe government, however, said NARD\u2019s decision to go on strike was hasty and pleaded with the Lagos chapter of the association to show restraint and wait for the outcome of a stakeholders\u2019 meeting to be held in the coming week.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Insecurity: Nigerians urged to go beyond prayers, activate rights to self-defence",
          "text": ".\n\n\u2026As Christian Stakeholders Launch Leadership Training Institute for Hope to a Better Nigeria\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja\n\nAgainst the backdrop of increasing security and economic challenges in Nigeria, Christian stakeholders have expressed hope for a greater Nigeria, urging Christians to go beyond prayers and explore their rights to self-defence in tackling insecurity in the country.\n\nThe stakeholders, including security experts, spoke at the inauguration of the Africa Kingdom Business Forum Institute (AKBF-I) by the Africa Kingdom Business Forum (AKBF) in Abuja at the weekend.\n\nFormer Chief of Defence Research and Development of the Nigerian Army and the Ex-Commander of Special Task Force (STF) Operation Safe Haven, in Plateau State, Major Gen. Henry Ayoola (rtd) in his keynote address at the inauguration of the Africa institute recommended \u201call citizens approach\u201d to end insecurity and other challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nThe Continental Chairman Africa Kingdom Business Forum (AKBF), Engr. Steve Olumuyina as well as the Chairman of the occasion, Barr. Emeka Nwankpa on their part noted that prayers were not enough in dealing with the mirades of the country\u2019s challenges.\n\nDr Sam Amadi, who is a visiting Professor at the Emerald Energy Institute at the University of Port Harcourt, and former Head of Department of International Law and Jurisprudence at Baze University, Abuja harped on the need to redefine the process through which leaders emerge in the country.\n\nAccording to Major-General Henry Ayoola, Nigerians should learn to defend themselves, adding that the country is in the final push to actualize a new Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen on security issues in the country, Maj. Gen. Ayoola said \u201cYes, the security challenges! Well, one thing to say upfront is that our problems, not only security, simply put, are self-inflicted problems.\n\n\u201cWe have been living like nobody is really interested in solving the problems because it\u2019s not for lack of what to do. It\u2019s not for lack of what to do, advice, ideas, or strategies.\n\n\u201cIt just appears as this is the eldorado some people know for Nigeria. This is the golden era, so we should allow it last.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I see. I don\u2019t see any palpable attempt to solve a problem. Like I said, one can easily conclude that it is self-inflicted problem.\n\n\u201cNot only because I know the genesis of those problems has been a player in it myself but I think Nigerians themselves are too timid, too docile that we will just allow anything goes.\n\n\u201cWe take everything and anything. At what point are we going to get sufficiently aroused as to rise up and solve our problems ourselves?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. What else do we want? Until half of us are dead or what?\n\n\u201cFor me, self-defence, like I said, is a divine right, it\u2019s a universal right \u2013 Article 51 of the UN charter talks about the inherent right of the individual and the collective self-defence. So, if somebody is threatening my life, I don\u2019t have to wait until he has killed me before I respond.\n\n\u201cThere is preemptive defence, which is part of self-defence. So, the ball is in our court really. Even the government is overwhelmed. So, it\u2019s gone beyond them. It should be an all citizens approach when everybody is ready to put an end to this nonsense we\u2019re going through\u201d, Maj. Gen. Henry Ayoola said.\n\nFormer Chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Dr Sam Amadi noted that \u201cLeadership presupposes a common vision. That means people have a vision of where they are going; they have a common understanding of the problems of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have never had a common vision and a common understanding of our problem.\n\n\u201cEven before colonialism, our people were disparate people, different people and the colonial authorities put us together and never cared about our well-being. They put us together for their own good.\n\n\u201cWhen they left, our leaders were trapped into ethnic competition and that also led to why they didn\u2019t build a common consensus.\n\n\u201cToday in America they talk of the American dream because different immigrants came together and had some degree of what America represents for them. That is the first problem of leadership in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe second is: how do you recruit leaders? How do your leaders come up?\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to be first-class people but they are leaders, people who have gone through a process. If you look at countries all over the world: China, America, or Britain or any other places in the world, you see that leaders rise through a process that give those leaders some common vision about their country and some have some experience about solving problems.\n\n\u201cIn Nigerian democracy today, leadership can emerge from anywhere. A mechanic who is doing his work can this year become Senator because the Governor likes him. So, the tide changes and people just emerge from nowhere. That\u2019s another problem.\n\n\u201cThe third issue is a leadership task, what should leaders be doing? So, leaders diagnose the problem, they pay attention. Why is there unemployment? In paying attention they find solutions.\n\n\u201cThe fourth become implementation of that solution. If it\u2019s a leadership that is looking for ethnicism, you won\u2019t implement it well because some of the solutions may require you disrupting some dominance if you take some actions.\n\n\u201cFor example, when we were building the power sector, we knew that the best thing was for us to take the power to Niger Delta where we have all the gas. But because we are a country that is consumed by geographical competition, they can\u2019t take it to the South-South.\n\n\u201cWe have to take some to the North Central and so on. But those ones don\u2019t have glass again. We have to spend a lot of money to carry the gas to those places.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a simple story that tells you that there is a dysfunction in leadership because leaders are not solving problems based on the based ways of solving them. They are solving problems in a way that will align with their own strategic ethnic geopolitical needs.\n\n\u201cSo, the Nigerian crisis is a crisis of leadership. But we should start first with a vision \u2013 what we want to be as a people, understanding our problems \u2013 where are we in history? Where are we now? Why are we trapped?\n\n\u201cThat is why we talk about restructuring; people don\u2019t want to hear about restructuring. It is not about changing geography or changing who collects what money. It is about changing the underlying factors that are creating the problems we want to deal with.\n\n\u201cSo, if you don\u2019t want to solve those underlying structural problems and you keep preaching \u201cwe\u2019re going to be a great nation\u201d we have been preaching before you became President, the present President is doing his best preaching. Later, another person will come and start preaching.\n\n\u201cThey blame the Nigerian people, the youths are not working hard, the Nigerian people are divided. That\u2019s what they are answering because we don\u2019t have leaders who have knowledge about the problem and the process of solving those problems and have the will to execute.\n\n\u201cLike I said today, you need humility to say that you don\u2019t know and seek for answers to \u201cwhy is this happening? Why is the economy like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at Nigeria, a country that is spending 89% of its revenue serving debts, not paying for them and you keep borrowing. You dedicate 40% of revenue to seek for oil where you know that you may not find oil at a time you know that oil is a wasting asset. The future is to invest in human beings to create wealth.\n\n\u201cSo, how can such self-deception lead to leadership growth? How can it lead to country prosperity?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trapped because we leaders who not even leaders because they neither have the priestly profile of humility and compassion nor the kingly profile of effective execution. They don\u2019t know the problem, they don\u2019t care about the people and they cannot even execute the solutions well\u201d, Dr Amadi said.",

This claim is false and misleading.\u201d\n\nPonnle explained that the resolutions reached at the 42 National Council on Establishments (NCE) Meeting held in Lagos on Monday, November 30 \u2013 Friday, December 4, 2020, necessitated the issuance of a circular by the Head of Service of Lagos State, Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, to communicate the decision taken at the Federal level to public servants in Lagos.\n\nThe directive was that Internship Programmes/Houseman-ship/NYSC Doctors in the Public Service should no longer attract Grade Levels in the Salary Structure as the programmes form part of the training.\n\n\u201cGovernor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu remains committed to the welfare of Lagos State Government employees, particularly the health workers who have showed commitment, bravery and resilience in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d she stated.\n\nPonnle added that the state government, through the Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions, would hold a stakeholders\u2019 consultative meeting in the coming week on the implications of the decision taken by the National Council of Establishments on Internship, Housemanship and NYSC Doctors in the Civil/Public Service, which prompted the action.\n\n\u201cThe decision of NARD is hasty.

It must rid itself of bias considerations for, favourable or unfavourable disposition to DCP Kyari while equally availing him ample opportunity to make a representation of his defence against the allegations against him.\n\n\u201cThe very image of the Nigeria Police Force, particularly its ethos and claims to be corruption-free is being examined by the watchful public at national and international levels. IGP Usman Alkali Baba thus has an uphill task to dutifully acquit himself in this matter and in doing so, help save the reputation of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s, therefore, a demand in the interest of justice that the conduct of the investigations be transparent and open, with full press access. The NPF should know that Nigerians are struggling to trust the process and in view of this the Press must be allowed unfettered access to its proceedings for record and posterity sake, too.\u201d\n\nDAILY POST recalls that Kyari, who is the Head of the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), was suspended over his link to the internet and cybercrime fraudster, Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nThe United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, had linked Kyari to Hushpuppi during their investigation.\n\nThe FBI had alleged that Hushpuppi bribed Kyari to jail an errant gang member over a fraud deal worth millions of dollars.\n\nFollowing the revelation, the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, had recommended Kyari\u2019s suspension pending the outcome of investigations.\n\nBut Kyari had since denied the allegations but admitted acting as a go-between the fraudster and a local tailor in which Hushpuppi allegedly made payments.",

          "title": "It\u2019s unlikely to see an Igbo President in our lifetime \u2013 Okolo-Olisa",
          "text": "Anthony Okolo Olisa is a legal practitioner and the President of Igbo National Movement (INM). In this interview with CHRIS NJOKU he expressed doubt over the success of the Igbo 2023 project and says that at present, Nigeria does not have the soul of a federation, but is at heart a federation of proud nations which is why most of the states created by the military have continued to fail to bring the people the development that they require. Excerpts\n\nWhat is the ideology behind INM, which has been very vocal recently in defense of issues, as it concerns the Igbo people?\n\nSimply put, the Igbo National Movement is a movement created to re-establish our Igbo nation. It is established for the progress of the Igbo national or as we call ourselves, \u201cNdigbo\u201d wherever we may be found on the earth, and also for the development of Igbo homelands or \u201cAla-Igbo\u201d, through the enhancement of our Igbo Republican institutions. The movement envisions the development of a nation of Ndigbo, arising into the world polity with a society that encourages justice, merit, equality and treats people with respect. Reinforcing this vision are three core values: Justice, Equality, and Merit.\n\nNdigbo meet all the criteria for nationhood. We have a common tongue, a common territory which is known to us and our neighbours, a common culture and now, a common purpose to regain that which the British took from us forcibly. We have been indigenous to the lands that home Ndigbo for over 3,000 years and lived in peace with our neighbours in all that time. Why then should we look to the very recent past of the last 100 or so years, as if that is the foundation of our identity? Ndigbo are a far more ancient people than that, and as such, we are ripe for a re-awakening of who we are, and to seek to control our destiny in non-violent and constitutional agitation.\n\nIn this, I believe we are closely related to our brothers and sisters of other indigenous nations in Nigeria, who are also in the process of their cultural awakening. We commend the Ijaw, the Yoruba, the peoples of the Middle Belt and the plurality of Nigerian Indigenous Peoples to take control of their individual destinies, and to call for a real debate on the path for a new future, for the administrative entity that is the Nigerian Federation. This we believe will be achieved through a sovereign national conference of the Indigenous Peoples of Nigeria. It is one of our objectives to make this call and to support all Nigerian Indigenous Peoples to join this call. It may be the only way to save this Federation, by re-creating it into a system that the people can recognize and respect.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on IPOB and the recent arrest of Nnamdi Kanu?\n\nMazi Nnamdi Kanu is first and foremost an Igbo man and he is one of our own. In any family group, there are a variety of characters. Some are prudent and diplomatic, while others may be brash and confrontational. A wise family will always align itself with the former and will at the same time, seek to curb the excesses of the latter. But a wise family never abandons their child to an outsider\u2019s discipline, lest they be viewed as uncaring and unwise. So, while the family will always stand \u201cwith\u201d its own, it will not necessarily stand \u201cfor\u201d them where their ideology does not follow the wisdom of the family group.\n\nWe stand with Mazi Kanu because Ndigbo do not abandon each other in adverse circumstances. We protect our own from the outsider. We believe that discipline is best meted out within the family group, and Igbo justice is harsh indeed. But we do not stand for the ideology that suggests that all non-Igbos are our enemies. However, we believe that his recent abduction was unlawful and we have said so plainly.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the Attorney-General of the Federation pretends he does not know the law. He seems to believe that a warrant of arrest in Nigeria can be executed at will internationally without the process of extradition \u2013 He is wrong. He thinks there is nothing unlawful in the Nigerian government kidnapping a British citizen who has renounced his Nigerian nationality, in a foreign country, which he has entered legally with a British passport \u2013 He is wrong.\n\nWe believe he knows he is wrong, but we understand he must try to justify these illegal acts, because it is what the government wishes him to do. But justifying illegality is not the job of the Chief Law Officer of a democratic country. He must stand for Justice and Truth, even where it is against the instructions of the government he is part of. Not even Kenya will be so na\u00efve as to agree with him and certainly, Britain will not allow their citizen to be made a fool of as it is a poor reflection on them.\n\nI believe that with this kidnapping, the Nigerian government has made a monumental error in judgement, which will sour our relationship with Britain and our neighbours. It will however, make no change in the calls for a restructuring of the Federation or for self-determination. In fact, it will make these calls even louder.\n\nWho is funding your group and what is the agenda behind it all?\n\nThe movement is being funded by love. Of what use is a hidden agenda? What is the use of hiding a lamp beneath an opaque bucket? No, our agenda is open to one and all, we are proud to share it. For in sharing it, we do not diminish ourselves or others. We wish to reassert our rights as an indigenous nation and for the Federation to recognize these rights as well as the rights of all indigenous nationals who are desirous, to chart their own course, whether within a re-negotiated Nigerian confederation, or in a clearly defined Commonwealth of Independent Nigerian States.\n\nNo Nigerian, who is Nigerian by birth, can be a Nigerian, if they were not first born to the nations indigenous to the land, upon the amalgamation by the British in 1914. To be Nigerian, is to be first Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, Kanuri, Ijaw, Jukun, Tiv or any of the various nationalities that make up the Nigerian Federation. The promise of Nigeria lies not in replacing these identities, but in harnessing our diversity, allowing each to become the best version of ourselves. The government and Nigerians know that at present, Nigeria does not have the soul of a federation made up of the administrative units we have come to know as states, but is at heart a federation of proud nations. That is why most of the states created by the Military have continued to fail to bring the people the development that they require. They have failed to energize the loyalty of the people and the people question the legitimacy of these units consistently.\n\nThat is why we continue to have National Orientation Agencies and agitations for state creations as the people strive to connect emotionally with their local government. That is why we continue to unsuccessfully mimic the British colonial administrative system of \u201cdivide and rule\u201d and to export our national wealth to other nations, to the detriment of our own people. How else can you justify the fact that we would rather sell our crude oil and other raw materials to foreign countries, than satisfy our own local demand for energy or means of production? It is just a hopeless situation which is based on faulty thinking.\n\nThe British knew this and fought hard to destroy our individual national identities because that was a way to keep us weak and easy to administer. Now we are governed by our own, we should not have the same fears the British did. We know ourselves and have traded and lived with each other peacefully for centuries as individual nations, so why do we think we cannot do that again? To fear our diversity is to fear ourselves for whom we are, and that is why the Nigerian project as designed by the British, and continued by the corrupt military establishment, is failing. It is structurally defective and so is the constitution it has birthed. Our ideology seeks to end this system.\n\nHow do you see the present political leadership in Igbo land?\n\nWith very few exceptions, the present political leadership in Ala-Igbo has failed to unite our people behind a common \u201cpost-war\u201d ideology that meets the dynamism of Ndigbo. We are builders, democratic in nature and believe in merit. Ndigbo would rather perish in the field of work than go cap in hand to beg for our supper. This monthly pilgrimage to Abuja to beg and scrape for our livelihood is un-Igbo. It has to stop. We have never really needed the support or interference of outsiders to develop our land. After the war, we pulled ourselves out of the mire, with very little help from the victorious Federal Government who impoverished us. We rebuilt all we see in Ala-Igbo today from a pauper\u2019s dowry of \u00a320 per person. The Imo Airport, the state universities, Anambra Broadcasting Service, vegetable oil production companies, palm-oil production camps, Innoson, Air Peace, Peace Mass Transit, Ibeto Industries, and many more than I can name, were all built in-spite of policies designed to subjugate and de-franchise Ndigbo, and without a penny of government support and certainly without government patronage. Even today, all attempts by policy or interference to kill these industries have failed to dampen the entrepreneurial spirit of Ndigbo. So please tell me, how can these so-called leaders not realise that all we need from them is to support our internal economy and support cooperation among our people?\n\nBy failing to establish and implement a joint strategic plan for inter-state cooperation, that will build inter-state roads, railways, healthcare and financial systems, these leaders have lost legitimacy in the eyes of the people. By allowing themselves to become pawns in a greater play of misdirection of effort from outside Ala-Igbo, they have sacrificed the future of millions of Igbo youth, who now have to sojourn far and wide to make an honest living, abandoning our homelands which no longer can sustain their dreams and desires.\n\nThe people are awake and it is impossible to lull us back to sleep. Ndigbo will take back Ala-Igbo from these faithless overlords and will use the ballot box to put in people who have the interest of Ndigbo at heart, and who will serve our people the way we deserve to be served; \u2013 with courage, humility and a steadfast zeal to the progress of all peoples who live in our lands.\n\nAre you in support of Nigerian president of Igbo extraction, or, like IPOB, you are against the present electoral system?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is unlikely we will see an Igbo President in our lifetime. The people who know the Igbo for what we are and despise us because of it, will never let that happen. If they do allow it, they will hope to force upon us an Igbo man or woman of such flawed character, that we will all be ashamed to call ourselves their kinsmen. We have some of them who have been rigged in as Governors today to provide proof of such perfidy. What we need is for Ndigbo to use the power of the vote and social activism to regain control of Ala-Igbo. We should employ the best of us to the work towards regaining our national pride and to focus our energies on building an economy that will be a force to reckon with globally. Ndigbo are never content with anything less than excellence, so why should we continue to settle for mediocrity to please those who choose to be indolent?\n\nUnlike IPOB, we are not hung up on what we are against; rather we are very clear on what ideology we are for, and the means by which to achieve that ideology. When we are ready to do so, our people will direct an appropriate vehicle to achieve these aims. But to answer your question, I believe there should be an Igbo leader for the Igbos, a Hausa leader for the Hausa and a Yoruba leader for the Yorubas, and so for all others. If each individual nation is able to select their own to direct their fate, then the issue of who and what sits on the lame duck national seat will be irrelevant. That position will be purely ceremonial and a representative government can be fashioned out to deal with common issues that will remain between all indigenous nations that make up the Nigerian Federation, such as the repayment of our joint debt and treaties for free movement of goods and persons between us.\n\nWhen you say, Igbo National Movement where does your Igbo map start and where does it stop?\n\nBeing Igbo is not about drawing maps and forcing people into an identity which they do not believe in. Ndigbo know ourselves and we know where our homelands are to be found. Our neighbours know our lands and we have no disputes with them over it. As I have mentioned before, we are an ancient people and wherever we have settled, we have been there for hundreds if not thousands of years, practising our customs and farming our lands. The nomads who come to feed their flocks know our lands, and they know they cannot take them forcibly.\n\nIn some families, there are those who are born to them, but for some reason or the other, they seek a different identity and then they go to the newspapers and issue a notice of change of name. Does it mean that they are still not the sons or daughters of their father? But they cannot be forced by anyone to continue to answer their former name. Their decision is theirs to make. However, if they return to the family and decide to take up that name again, no one can stop them, for it is their heritage and their right.\n\nNdigbo everywhere know ourselves and we know where all our brothers and sisters live. We will always consider them our brothers and sisters. Ndigbo will continue to stand \u201cwith\u201d them when they are in distress, and if they call on us and live by our values, we will stand \u201cfor\u201d them too.\n\nLooking at Nigeria today, what do you think 2023 will look like?\n\n2023 will bring Nigerian indigenous people closer and closer to their freedom. For the first time the corrupt military establishment is running out of alter-egos to set upon the throne that they have created for themselves within the Nigerian government \u2013 For it is them we call the \u201ccabal\u201d. Their generation is old, dying and they grow weak. Their stronghold on the younger and vibrant generation is dissipating and their achievements will eventually evaporate in smoke. 2023 will bring us closer to the realisation that \u201cWe the People\u201d mentioned in the constitution of Nigeria, must have our voices heard. The choice for Nigerians will be whether to heed these voices or to continue to allow the oligarchy to supress them in the hope that once silenced, they will go away. Our voices will not go away. We will grow stronger and stronger until the tipping point is reached.",

          "title": "El- Zakzaky, Shi\u2019ites and their many battles with authorities",
          "text": "Long before the December 12, 2015 clash between followers of Zaria based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ibraheem Yakub El-Zakzaky and the entourage of the immediate past Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, the outspoken preacher was already well known across the country for his belief and style that often brought him into conflict with successive administrations in Kaduna State and Abuja, the Federal Capital. But all previous confrontations have now been dwarfed by the 2015 episode which got him and his wife incarcerated for close to six years. Who really is El-Zakzaky? What does he and his moment stand for? Correspondent ABDULGAFAR ALABELEWE has the answer.\n\nIBRAHIN Yakub El-Zakzaky is the spiritual leader of the Shi\u2019ite Islamic sect otherwise known as Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN). He was born on May 5, 1953 in Zaria in present day Kaduna State, into the family of an Islamic scholar and farmer, Sheikh Yakub.\n\nZakzaky is rated the most intelligent among his siblings and peers.\n\nHe started learning and memorizing the Quran at a very early age from his father, in line with the family tradition that a child must first memorize the Quran before leaving home for further studies.\n\nBy the time he was 14 years old,he had the Quran committed to memory .He subsequently enrolled at Zaria Provincial School to learn Arabic literature.He passed out of the school in 1971.\n\nTwo years later, Zakzaky became a student of the School for Arabic Studies (SAS) in Kano, where he studied English literature, Economics, Government, Hausa, Arabic and Islamic Studies from 1971 to 1975.\n\nOn completion of his education there ,he got direct admission into Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria, where he studied Economics.He graduated in 1979.\n\nHow he started IMN\n\nZakzaky\u2019s journey into Shi\u2019ism, began in the early 70s when he became an active member of the Muslim Students Society (MSS) at ABU.He rose to become Secretary General of the association and later its national Vice Chairman.\n\nAlthough, there is no clear record of exactly when Sheikh Zakzaky started following the Ahlul bayt school of thought, his elder brother, Malam Sani Yaqub traced Zakzaky\u2019s involvement with Shi\u2019ism to when he graduated from the School of Arabic and Islamic Studies (SAS) Kano.\n\nHe said:\u201dWhen Ibrahim graduated from the School of Arabic and Islamic Studies (SAS) Kano, he started writing letters to different countries especially China and Iran, saying that he developed interest in relating with China largely because China had revolutionalised her economy through agriculture and moved her people out of hunger.\n\n\u201cIran was responding to his letters by sending their books to him; trying to lure him into their creed of Shiite. Because of that, he turned his attention to Iran, especially after the Ayatollah revolution in 1979. They started having meetings in England every year, before they moved their meetings to Iran. When Iran attained a certain level of development, he sometimes travelled there twice in a year.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw that, we decided to start counseling him, particularly with our teachers Malam Sani Abdulqadir and Malam Usman Maccido because even at that time we knew that Shia was not Islam. Based on that, we sat him down to tell him the implication of what he was doing. He kept saying that he was not into Shi\u2019a, that he was only into the struggle for revival of Islam. This started in early 1980s. When we realized that he would not listen, largely because it involved a lot of money, we left him alone.\n\n\u201cBut our eldest brother, Malam Abdulqadir Yakubu, did not stop counseling him. In fact, about a week or so before their clash with the Army, our elder brother wrote him. In the letter, he told him that what they were doing was not part of Islam.\n\n\u201cZakzaky believed that the establishment of a republic along similar religious lines in Nigeria would be feasible.\u201d\n\nIMN\u2019s membership strength\n\nIn its four decades of existence in Nigeria, members of the Zakzaky led Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) have grown from thousands to millions. In fact, the group prides itself in having a membership strength of over 10 million people, who are scattered mainly around Northern Nigeria and some neighboring countries like Niger Republic and Chad.\n\nShi\u2019ite members are found majorly among students, housewives, the academia and almost all the professional callings, including the security forces.\n\nActivities of Zakzaky\u2019s movement\n\nSome critics see no difference between the ideology of Zakzaky\u2019s Shi\u2019ite group and that of Boko Haram.\n\nSuch critics say the two groups have \u201chaving little or no regard for political establishment\u201d and refuse to be subservient to an authority not established by the tenets of Islam.\n\nEl Zakzaky are allegedly indoctrinated to lose their belief in the establishment so much so that they pledge allegiance to him.\n\nIt was against this back ground that the military administration of Colonel Hammed Ali in Kaduna State once clashed with the group ,forcing El Zakzaky and his followers to relocate from the outskirts of Zaria where he was allegedly operating his \u2018Islamic\u2019 government to Zaria town.\n\nFollowing the return of civil rule in 1999 and the emergence of Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Makarfi as governor of the state,government decided to forget and forgive the sect\u2019s previous \u2018sins\u2019.\n\nBut its members soon began to show their hands afresh prompting complaints after complaints from the public about alleged infringement on their rights by El Zakzaky\u2019s followers.\n\nThe main complaint centred on how the Shi\u2019ites often restricted other people\u2019s movement on the highways whenever they (Shi\u2019ite members) had their processions from one city to another.\n\nTravellers on Kaduna-Zaria Road and Kano-Zaria Road were usually restricted to one side of the highway by the Shi\u2019ites,and this usually happened twice a year.\n\nResidents of Kaduna, Zaria, Kano and other Northern Nigerian cities were always at the mercy of the Shi\u2019ites during such processions as their security personnel would subject any vehicle that crossed their path to thorough check before being allowed to pass.\n\nIn Zaria in particular where the sect leader resided,residents accused the sect members of usually mounting road blocks and subjecting motorists attempting to pass through to thorough check.\n\nSome people say the roads were blocked totally on some occasions.\n\nThe allegations have been denied many times by the group.\n\nIn 2016 in the aftermath of the confrontation between the sect members and the entourage of the then Chief of Army Staff in Zaria,Governor Nasir El-Rufai outlawed the movement, because \u201cIMN does not recognise the constitution of Nigeria, they do not recognize Muhammadu Buhari as President of Nigeria, they do not recognise me as governor of Kaduna state because they had their governor in Tudun Wada. Their allegiance is not to Nigerian government, their allegiance is to somewhere else.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nContinuing, the governor said: \u201cThey have their para military wing, the call them \u2018Hurras\u2019. They train them in violation of our laws. They do not accept that any law in Nigeria applies to them. They block public high ways, they occupy schools when they are doing their processions and they feel that to practice their religion, they have to infringe on the right of others. That is completely wrong!\n\n\u201cBecause IMN doesn\u2019t recognise Nigerian laws, they are not registered with CAC, so they cannot be sued or held responsible. They build anywhere they want without approval. They don\u2019t even bother to acquire title to land. If you put all these facts together, IMN looks like an insurgency waiting to happen.\n\n\u201cIMN is a political organisation. The objective of El-Zakzaky is to gather enough followers to effect an Iranian type of Islamic Revolution in Nigeria and everyone knows what that can cause! Nigeria is not 100 per cent a Muslim country that you can do Islamic Revolution, it is a recipe for crisis.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Governor El-Rufai\u2019s claims, the then State Director, Department of State Services (DSS), Mustapha Sani told the Judicial Commission of Inquiry set up by the Kaduna State government to probe the 2015 clash between IMN members and soldiers, that the Zakzaky group\u2019s highest objective was creation of an Islamic State in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that IMN owed its allegiance to Iran where, according to him,it receives financial assistance and other support.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe sect has remained and will always remain a security threat, as their ultimate objective is the establishment of an Islamic State based on their doctrines\u201d.\n\nResponding to the allegations, IMN said it was not possible for them to run a parallel government ,saying: \u201cIf you say we are running a parallel government you should tell us who our governors, our commissioners are.\n\n\u201cIn any given society or group, there are supposed to be a structure for coordinating the activities. And this is not abnormal. Name any group whatsoever; even if it is not religious, it has a structure.\n\n\u201cSo, to claim that we are running a parallel government is a surprise. After all we are paying our taxes. In fact, I can boast that if you go to the police station you hardly see any members of the Islamic movement accused of any criminality. We are law-abiding citizens; we are not running a parallel government.\u201d\n\nA Quranic teacher and member of IMN, Abubakar Zaki, told Aljazeera television that he joined the movement in 1986 and claimed that \u201cback then, the Nigerian government would even send boys to attack us.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe tension is not between us and the Sunnis. Or us and the Christians. It is between us and those who hate the truth.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic Movement of Nigeria is for everyone who wants the truth. It\u2019s for anyone, Sunni or even Christians. We have a Christian forum. We have Christians who are members of the Movement. Sheikh el-Zakzaky is trying to unite everybody. Sheikh is very powerful. He has many followers.\n\n\u201cPeople say we don\u2019t respect the Nigerian government, but then how is it that we are sending our children to government schools? Most of the children here are acquiring Western education and then in the evening time like this, they do their religious studies.\n\n\u201cOnce you stand for the truth, you face challenges. Buhari is the leader of Nigeria but el-Zakzaky is my leader. He is the leader of justice. We must continue to denounce the injustice of the Nigerian government.\u201d\n\nA businessman and local politician, Adamu Salisu, wants a member of the sect to become president of Nigeria.\n\nHis words: \u201cMy brother was a Shia before me. My father is a Sunni imam and he told me if you practise what the Shia preach, people will turn against you. Evil people will go after you. My father told me that what the Shia are saying is not a lie.\n\n\u201cI listen to Sheikh el-Zakzaky and he speaks against stealing, corruption, and everything he mentions is found in Nigeria. So I removed myself from politics. I saw what was happening among politicians and I was disgusted. The corruption was of the highest order. I still play politics, but I know my limits.\n\n\u201cI joined IMN in 2012, but I had been researching IMN\u2019s teaching for six years.\n\nGod did not create humans to become presidents and ministers. He created us so we can bring justice to the world and help the downtrodden. Sheikh el-Zakzaky is doing that. Sheikh El-Zakzaky preaches Justice. It\u2019s not only a Muslim who needs justice. Idol worshippers need justice. Christians need justice.\u2019\n\n\u201cPeople are saying we are violent but look at what happened in 2014 and 2015. How many of our people were killed and how many Nigerian soldiers were killed?\u201d\n\nZakzaky\u2019s many troubles with the authority\n\nDuring the tenure of President Shehu Shagari in 1981, a year after the \u201cISLAM ONLY\u201d procession, Sheikh Zakzaky attended a program in Sokoto where he delivered a lecture. He was arrested alongside a few others immediately after the lecture. They were subsequently arraigned before a court and sentenced to three years in jail.\n\nZakzaky was arrested again in 1984 by the military administration of General Muhammadu Buhari for civil disturbance in December 1984. The IMN leader was newly married then and his wife gave birth to their first child Muhammad, while he was still in custody.\n\nGeneral Ibrahim Babangida also arrested Sheikh Zakzaky in connection with a conflict in Kafanchan. He got a two year jail term for that. He was arrested for the second time by the Babangida government at the Aminu Kano International Airport while on his way to attend an international conference in London, but he was released five days after.\n\nDuring the Sani Abacha regime, the IMN leader was arrested and detained for two years and three months from 1996 to 1999. He was alleged to have questioned the authority of the military government. Though, he was never arrested or jailed by the Obasanjo, Yar\u2019adua and Jonathan\u2019s governments, Zakzaky cannot be said to have enjoyed a good relationship with the administrations.\n\nIn July 2014 towards the tail end of the Jonathan administration, members of the IMN during their Quds day procession in Zaria, clashed with men of the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe army said the IMN members attacked their personnel on patrol, while the IMN alleged that the soldiers opened fire on peaceful pro Palestinians procession during which 34 sect members were allegedly killed including three biological sons of El-Zakzaky, Ahmad, Hameed and Mahmud.\n\nThe 2015 Shi\u2019ites/Army clash and the subsequent detention/trials\n\nThe latest bloody confrontation between the sect members and the army occurred on Saturday 12th December, 2015 when soldiers on the entourage of the former Chief of Army Staff, Lt-Gen. Tukur Yusuf Buratai clashed with the Shi\u2019ite sect members, leaving no fewer than 10 persons dead.\n\nThe then Army spokesman, Colonel Sani Kukasheka Usman said of the incident on Twitter: \u201cShiites attempt to assassinate the Chief of Army Staff in Zaria\u201d.\n\nIn a statement that soon followd,he said: \u201cThe Shiite Sect on the orders of their leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky today (12th December) in Zaria attacked the convoy of the Chief of Army Staff while on his way to pay homage on the Emir of Zazzau and attend the Passing Out Parade of 73 Regular Recruits Intake of Depot Nigerian Army, Zaria.\n\n\u201cThe sect numbering hundreds carrying dangerous weapons, barricaded the roads with bonfires, heavy stones and tyres. They refused all entreaties to disperse and then started firing and pelting the convoy with dangerous objects. The barricade was obviously a deliberate attempt to assassinate the Chief of Army Staff and members of his entourage while on a legitimate official assignment as Special Guest of Honour at the passing out parade which had earlier been widely publicised.\n\n\u201cThe troops responsible for the safety and security of the Chief of Army Staff on hearing explosion and firing were left with no choice than to defend him and the convoy at all cost as well as open up the barricaded road for law abiding citizens. This is in line with the Nigerian Army Rules of Engagement and Code of Conduct. This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated from any individual or groups and should not be allowed to repeat itself.\u201d\n\nThe army authorities also made available to the public a video recording of how the sect members rejected Army officers plea to allow their Chief passage before the situation got out of control.\n\nArmed soldiers later moved to El-Zakzaky\u2019s residence in Gyallesu area of Zaria at midnight and whisked away the sect leader.\n\nThe IMN alleged that, about a thousand of their members including El-Zakzaky\u2019s son, second in command and their spokesman were killed in the process. But, the Army in a joint press conference with the police said El-Zakzaky and his wife were in protective custody and would be allowed to address his followers at a later time.\n\nThe events of the two days led to the detention of both Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat until December 2016, when the Justice Kolawole of the Federal High Court in Abuja ordered their release and also ruled that, the duo be paid damages of N50 million and a new house be built for them in their choice area within Northern Nigeria.",
          "summary": "IBRAHIN Yakub El-Zakzaky is the spiritual leader of the Shi\u2019ite Islamic sect otherwise known as Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN).\nEl Zakzaky are allegedly indoctrinated to lose their belief in the establishment so much so that they pledge allegiance to him.\n\u201cI listen to Sheikh el-Zakzaky and he speaks against stealing, corruption, and everything he mentions is found in Nigeria.\nSheikh El-Zakzaky preaches Justice.\nGeneral Ibrahim Babangida also arrested Sheikh Zakzaky in connection with a conflict in Kafanchan.",

          "text": "May 30, 2021 will remain etched in the memory of Mrs. Hadiza Hashim of Tegina, Niger State for the rest of her life. It was the day armed men stormed her children\u2019s Islamic school in the town and kidnapped all five of them, including a two-year-old toddler.\n\nNothing, perhaps, provoked her agony and helplessness more than the screaming of the kids as the gunmen made away with them.\n\nShe recalls seeing from her hiding place one of the terrorists carrying her youngest child in his arm into captivity.\n\n\u201cI saw my two-year-old carried by a man with a gun. He was shouting at the boy to shut up because he was screaming for me, his mother. I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Mrs Hashim told the BBC.\n\nAlthough Walid and Rahama, the youngest of her five abducted children, have since been released, the remaining three are still in the kidnappers\u2019 den.\n\nThey were among the more than 100 children kidnapped from the school on that day.\n\nWhile many of the more than 1,000 children abducted have been released, often after extortionate ransom amounts were reportedly paid, hundreds of families are still desperately waiting for news of their children, the BBC reported.\n\nUmma, 13, is the eldest of Mrs. Hashim\u2019s children and loves watching cartoons like Tom and Jerry with her younger brothers and sisters. Wracked with anxiety, her mother has not heard from them since the kidnapping incident.\n\nThe woman said on the fateful day, a Sunday, she had rushed to the school after hearing gunshots. Forced to take cover for her own safety, from her hiding place she saw dozens of armed men enter the school.\n\nShe said: \u201cThey broke the padlock and started shouting for the children to remove their shoes, to prevent them from running away. The children started screaming for their parents.\n\n\u201cI saw my two-year-old carried by a man with a gun. He was shouting at the boy to shut up because he was screaming for me, his mother. I couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe two younger children are traumatised by the experience. Mrs Hashim describes how they wake up in the middle of the night screaming, terrified they will be taken again. They keep asking where their elder sisters and brother are, why their beds remain empty.\n\nMrs Hashim teaches science in a nearby junior school, now closed because of the insecurity caused by criminal gangs. The kidnappers have asked for N50 million ransom to release the children.\n\nParents of the missing children are desperately trying to raise funds.\n\nShe fears her children are being forgotten because they are poor.\n\n\u201cPeople have ignored what has happened because they are the children of nobodies. If they were the children of somebody, they wouldn\u2019t be left in the wilderness for weeks with no news. It wouldn\u2019t be allowed,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling on Ondo State governorship case between Rotimi Akeredolu and Eyitayo Jegede, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has shunned the legal advice from Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo (SAN).\n\nMeetings of legal experts, involving a senior ranking government official, who is also a senior lawyer, Daily Sun learnt, were held in Abuja, last week, to assess Keyamo\u2019s legal opinion that the party should ease out the caretaker committee led by Yobe Governor, Mai Mala Buni and hold congress to democratically elect new leadership. A source privy to the meeting said: \u201cThe groundswell of opinion at that meeting was that we should ignore what he wrote as Akeredolu, at that time, was validly nominated by the party for the election.\u201d\n\nA senior member of the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) told Daily Sun that Keyamo\u2019s legal opinion was \u201chis own interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment and of no consequence on the APC and the CECPC. The statusquo remains. The party remains unshaken.\u201d\n\nAsked if the party\u2019s National Executive Committee would meet and deliberate on the apex court\u2019s ruling, as it affects future elections to be conducted by the CECPC, he replied: \u201cThere\u2019s no scheduled meeting on this matter. It\u2019s all politics. As far as we know, he has a running battle with the Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege and it all boils down to the politics of 2023 and the governorship slot of the APC in Delta State.\u201d\n\nRegardless, another party chieftain disclosed that, with regards to the party affairs in Delta, \u201cthe APC national secretariat relates with Omo-Agege and not Keyamo; all you see now is the battle of 2023 at play here.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s chief scribe, Sen John Akpanudeudehe, and lawyer, Michael Akintola, also shared the same stance that the warning from Keyamo was his personal opinion which had no impact on activities of the party.\n\nDismissing the possibility of the Supreme Court judgment concerning Governor Buni\u2019s position having effect on the party, a party chieftain insisted that since the Yobe governor was not earning salary occupying the position of chairmanship of the party, he violated no law.\n\n\u201cThat should no longer be any issue now. Governor Buni\u2019s position is very legal. As governors, some are chairmen of Governors Forum, others are chairmen of certain committees. They can legally occupy those chairmanship positions as long as no salary is attached.\n\n\u201cGovernor Buni is not violating any law as chairman of the ruling party. So, he is legally qualified to endorse any document of the party. The party is on the upward trend with what happened last weekend during the just concluded ward congresses across the country,\u201d the chieftain who spoke in confidence told Daily Sun.\n\nMember representing North East in the APC Caretaker Committee, Prof. Mamman Tahir, had insisted that the party is on legal high ground with the decision to continue with Buni as party boss.\n\n\u201cThe business of the law is not about speculating what a court will decide in a particular dispute. We deal with what the court has presently decided on. That is the way the law operates. People can have fear on anything. And whatever decision anybody takes, it will always be subject to litigations.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

He also served as governor of Kwara State between 2003 and -2011. During his reign as Senate President, he had a running battle with President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn 2015, Saraki was tried by the Code of Conduct Tribunal, over alleged under-declaration of assets when he held sway as governor of Kwara State.

Executive Director in charge of Projects at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Dr. Cairo Ojougboh, and former governorship candidates of the party, Olorogun O\u2019tega Emerhor and Chief Great Ogboru, also distanced themselves from the exercise in Delta State with thousands of their supporters on account of the alleged hijack of the congress materials by the loyalists of the Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nAPC members backed by Senators Rochas Okorocha and Ifeanyi Ararume, also shunned the exercise in Imo State, just as the loyalists of Senator Magnus Abe boycotted the congress in Rivers State for the supporters of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, the supporters of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, accused the Secretary of the National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe of manipulating the exercise.\n\nAPC members loyal to the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, also kicked against the adoption of consensus arrangement by the loyalists of Governor Gboyega Oyetola in Osun State.\n\nHowever, despite the protests, the APC last night hailed the conduct of the congresses across the states, saying that its National caretaker chairman and Yobe State Governor, Mr. Mai Mala Buni, was not distracted.\n\nSupporters of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Akpabio, organised a protest at the party\u2019s secretariat along Ikot Ekpene Road, Uyo, the state capital.\n\nThe bonfire was set outside the party office, causing heavy gridlock along the major access road outside the Uyo metropolis.\n\nThe protesters demanded the cancellation of the ward congress, alleging that Akpanudoedehe \u201cfraudulently manipulated the lists to include only his loyalists as candidates for the congresses\u201d.\n\nSome of the placards displayed during the protest read: \u201cAkpanudoedehe cannot decide for us in Akwa Ibom\u201d; \u201cThe list cannot stand;\u201d \u201cWe reject this shambolic manipulation by one man\u201d; This congress cannot hold\u201d and \u201cEnough of one-man dictatorship in Akwa Ibom APC.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, stakeholders under the aegis of APC Elders Forum led by the Board of Trustees (BoT) member, Group Captain Sam Ewang (rtd), had passed a vote of no confidence on the state caretaker Chairman, Dr. Ita Udosen, alleging that he was playing the card of Akpanudoedehe by manipulating the exercise and doctoring the candidates\u2019 list in his favour.\n\nThe crisis rocking the Kwara State chapter of the ruling APC deepened yesterday as the two leading factions in the party embarked on separate congresses to elect their ward executives at the 193 wards in the state.\n\nA group loyal to the state Governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, under the platform of AA Group adopted a consensus arrangement for the emergence of their executives at the ward congresses.\n\nBut a group loyal to the Information Minister, Mohammed, under the platform of the Loyal Group used direct system for the emergence of their ward executives in the state.\n\nMembers of the APC in Osun State also yesterday adopted consensus in the election of their leaders across the 332 wards in the state amidst allegations of exclusion by loyalists of Minister of Interior, Aregbesola.\n\nA loyalist of the minister and former Osun State Assembly Speaker, Hon. Najeem Salam, who was at Ward 4, Ejigbo, alleged that the executives were imposed, and not elected.\n\nBut the Chairman of the National Congress Committee, Mr. Gbenga Elegbeleye, said the exercise was successful.\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola also said the congresses across the state were very peaceful.\n\n\u201cYou can see that members of the party are here, you know, in their large number to endorse the congress done in line with the directive of the national secretariat. It is free. Everybody has been allowed to express their wish, and you have seen it.\u201d\n\nIn Imo State, former Governor Rochas Okorocha and his supporters did not participate in the ward congresses.\n\nIn the same vein, another chieftain of the party, Senator Ifeanyi Araraume, and his loyalists did not also participate in the congresses.\n\nHowever, the supporters of the state Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, held the ward congress in all the 27 local government areas of the state in a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nIn his reaction, the factional chairman of the party loyal to the Okorocha, Mr. Daniel Nwafor, said they boycotted the congress concerning the court order.\n\nAn Abuja High Court presided over by Justice Valentine Oriji, had on Friday in a suit filed by Mr. Okey Anyikwa, the APC chairman in Ideato South Local Government Area, suspended the congress in the state.\n\nMeanwhile, one person was reportedly killed in Ado Ekiti during the exercise.\n\nThe man, simply identified as Jide, was said to have been hit with a charm when two rival groups clashed at Ward 10 in Ado Ekiti.\n\nAnother account said he was stabbed to death by thugs, who invaded the ward after the result of the exercise was not in their favour.\n\nAlso in Ado Ekiti Ward 08, where the Deputy Governor, Chief Bisi Egbeyemi, and the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, hailed from, the exercise was marred with violence as anti- and pro- Fayemi groups engaged in a fight.\n\nIn Wards 04 and 08, as well as some wards in Ikere Ekiti, Fayemi\u2019s loyalists and the members of the Tinubu group named South-west Agenda for 2023 (SWAGA) also engaged in a fierce battle.\n\nConfirming the killing, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti State Police Command, ASP Sunday Abutu, said the incident occurred at the Fajuyi area, when some people were celebrating their victory in the congress.\n\n\u201cA few hours ago, we got a distress call that someone was beaten with substance suspected to be charm during APC congress.\n\n\u201cThe police rushed to the area and by the time we got there, the person had been moved to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that he was beaten with charm and later died in the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nAbutu stated that his men and officers had begun an investigation into the matter, while clarifying that no arrest had been made as at press time.\n\nIt was gathered that the resistance put up by members of SWAGA, who turned up in large numbers, actually sparked up the crisis as Fayemi\u2019s supporters were also resolute to assert their supremacy.\n\nIn Lagos State, the leader of a group within the APC, Lagos4Lagos, Mr. Olajide Adediran, told THISDAY that his faction held a parallel congress.\n\n\u201cYes, all our members filed out today across all the 245 wards to affirm all members of our group, who paid for nomination forms, but were not given the forms because the delegation from the National secretariat saddled with the responsibility of selling forms alleged that the governor of Lagos State hijacked the forms from them. We will then send our exco list alongside evidence of payment to Abuja. We will all take it up from there,\u201d he said.\n\nBut amidst the reports that parallel ward congresses were conducted in the state, the party\u2019s Caretaker Committee Chairman, Alhaji Tunde Balogun, has debunked the report even as he maintained that members of the party adopted a consensus arrangement to elect the 37 executive members in each of the 245 wards across the 20 local governments and 37 development councils in the state.\n\n\u201cParallel \u2013 I don\u2019t know that one. I want people to stop emphasising things that will create problems in our fold. Make us cohesive, not emphasising a particular candidate or person trying to do something,\u201d he added.\n\nThe party, in a press statement signed by the state\u2019s Publicity Secretary, Mr. Seye Oladejo, said the ward congress was a success in the state.\n\nIn Kano State, the Chairman of Buhari Support Organisation (BSO), Mr. Shehu Dalhatu also kicked against the consensus arrangement adopted by the loyalists of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje.\n\nDalhatu argued that the party members should be allowed to exercise their franchise.\n\n\u201cWe are here to exercise our franchise. We came to witness justice and seek justice.\n\n\u201cThe statement by Governor Ganduje on the resolution to adopt consensus candidates is unfortunate. That is premeditating the election,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, Ganduje has allayed the fear that the nationwide ward congresses would be voided following the recent judgment of the Supreme Court.\n\nGanduje spoke to reporters at his ward at Ganduje town in Dawakin Tofa LGA, shortly after the congress held across the 484 wards in the state.\n\nWhile commenting on those having reservations on the Ward Congress, Ganduje stated that it was natural that people in any democratic contest would not be happy with anything that runs contrary to their interest.\n\nThe Enugu APC ward congress was also characterised by the allegation of missing result sheets across the 260 wards in the state.\n\nHowever, the congress took place peacefully despite a suit instituted by aggrieved members seeking to stop the exercise in the state.\n\nFour aggrieved members of the party had on Friday dragged some officials to the Enugu High Court, alleging that the exercise had already been compromised and urged the court to stop it.\n\nHowever, the party yesterday observed the congress with the adoption of consensus option in several wards and voting by delegates where the consensus option failed.\n\nBut some party leaders alleged that the officials deployed to the 260 wards for the exercise did not go to the congress venues with the result sheets.\n\nThey claimed the result sheets were not handed over to them.\n\nWhen contacted, the chairman of the party in the state, Dr. Ben Nwoye, confirmed he received the reports about the missing result sheets.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that in all the 260 wards, I have received calls that there were no results sheets. It was INEC officials that first alerted me about it,\u201d Nwoye said.\n\nHe, however, said the exercise was peaceful and there was no parallel congress across the state.\n\nAPC Hails Congresses, Says Buni Not Distracted\n\nMeanwhile, the National Secretary of the party, Akpan-udoedehe, has said the Chairman of the Committee and the Governor of Yobe State, Buni was never distracted, but kept faith with the party\u2019s Ward Congresses\u2019 date held yesterday.\n\nHe rated the conduct of the ward congresses across the country high despite reports of pockets of crisis in some states.\n\nAkpan-udoedehe, while reacting to the conduct of the exercise in a telephone interview attributed the success of the exercise to the support of President Muhammadu Buhari and the doggedness of Buni.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI want to thank Mr. President and our National Chairman (Buni). They did not succumb to all the plots to make us look back at the caretaker committee level. The chairman is not moved by all the distractions. He kept faith with the date. He has been focused and keeping to the agenda of the party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Suffers losses in mobile, data subscriptions\n\nEmma Okonji\n\nMTN Nigeria yesterday declared revenue of N790.3 billion, representing an increase of 24.1 per cent in its unedited half year results for the period that ended on June 30, 2021.\n\nThe company\u2019s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation (EBITDA), grew by 27.6 per cent to reach N417.2 billion. The EBITDA margin improved by 1.4 percentage points to 52.7 per cent and its Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) was up by 39.1 per cent to reach N186.4 billion.\n\nIts dividend per share rose to N4.55 kobo, which is about 30 per cent increase.\n\nThe telecoms company, however, suffered losses in the number of mobile subscribers and data subscriptions.\n\nAccording to the report, mobile subscribers declined by 7.6 million to 68.9 million, impacted by the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations.\n\nActive data users also declined by approximately 52,000 to 32.5 million.\n\nGiving details of the telecoms company\u2019s operational review for the half year, MTN Nigeria CEO, Mr. Karl Toriola said: \u201cService revenue grew by 24.1 per cent, Year-on-Year (YoY), driven by the sustained growth in data and also partly due to the lower base in comparative 2020 voice revenue that resulted from lockdowns during that period.\n\n\u201cVoice revenue grew by 13.1 per cent, benefitting from an 11.8 per cent increase in traffic and our customer value management (CVM) initiatives. The impact on voice revenue from the industry-wide suspension of new SIM registration was partly offset by higher usage in our active SIM base as well as migration to a higher quality of experience.\n\n\u201cData revenue continued the positive momentum from H2 2020, rising by 48.3 per cent,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said this was driven by increased usage from the existing base, supported by the acceleration in our 4G rollout and enhanced network capacity following the acquisition and activation of additional 800MHz spectrum in Q1.\n\nThe results showed that data traffic rose by 83.0 per cent YoY, while smartphone penetration was up by 5.8pp to 49.3 per cent.\n\n\u201cOur 4G network now covers 65.1 per cent of the population, up from 60.1 per cent in December 2020,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, Fintech revenue rose by 48.2 per cent driven by increased adoption of Xtratime and the core fintech services.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expand our MoMo agent network and broaden our service offerings. Our registered MoMo agents increased by 121,000 in H1 2021 to more than 515,000,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting further on the results, Toriola said: \u201cIn the first half of 2021, we made good progress strengthening the resilience of the business, managing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and enhancing support to our people, customers and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe extended our commitment to the Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) with an additional N3 billion contribution over a two-year period, half of which has already been paid. This is in support of efforts to promote the health and security of Nigerians, as we navigate our way through the pandemic, and in line with our Y\u2019ello Hope initiatives through which we provided support to our broad base of stakeholders to the value of approximately N25 billion in 2020.\n\n\u201cOur progress towards achieving greater business resilience is reflected in the upgrade by Global Credit Ratings (GCR) of our national scale long-term issuer rating to AAA and affirmation of our national scale short-term rating of A1+ with a stable outlook. This puts MTN Nigeria on the highest possible GCR scale for short-term and long-term ratings, providing a solid platform for growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, 2021 would mark the 20th anniversary of MTN\u2019s presence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate this milestone, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved our participation in the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit (RITC) Scheme. This is in response to government\u2019s drive towards public-private partnerships in the rehabilitation of critical road infrastructure in Nigeria. We intend to participate in the restoration and refurbishment of the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway. Conversations in this regard have already commenced, and further announcements will be made in due course,\u201d Toriola explained.\n\n\u201cIn line with our desire to plant deeper and more permanent roots in Nigeria, we have also initiated plans to commission a purpose-built, state of the art MTN Head Office, designed to act as a central hub for our network, a catalyst for creativity and innovation, and a showcase for the flexible working structures that are driving efficiency gains in this new normal working environment.\n\n\u201cAligned with our wider commitment to environmental sustainability, it will meet the highest global environmental standards, demonstrating the role of green technology in our future,\u201d Toriola added.\n\nHe promised that MTN would continue to invest in improved world class services and its network, accelerating the expansion of its 4G coverage and providing home broadband.\n\n\u201cAs part of our rural connectivity programme, we plan to connect approximately 1,000 rural communities to our network this year with an additional 2,000 communities in 2022. We are delighted that these are translating into strong operational performance in line with the objectives of Ambition 2025. In the next three years, we will invest over N600 billion to expand broadband access across the country in support of the government\u2019s broadband plan,\u201d Toriola further explained.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Consultants give 21-day ultimatum\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nNigeria\u2019s health sector is about to face another round of crisis as the resident doctors have resolved to commence a nationwide indefinite industrial action tomorrow (Monday).\n\nThis is coming as the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) has given the federal government and the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) a 21-day ultimatum to halt persistent cut in wages of members or face total and indefinite nationwide strike action.\n\nThe resident doctors, under the auspices of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), said they would embark on the strike due to the failure by the federal and state governments to attend to the issues affecting the welfare of its members.\n\nThe doctors said they were dismayed that despite several meetings with the Presidential Committee on Salaries and other top government stakeholders on the review of hazard allowance for health workers, the allowance still remained a paltry sum of N5,000.\n\nThey also noted the alleged non-payment of COVID-19 inducement allowance to some of its members in federal and state tertiary institutions.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of their National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, NARD said: \u201cAfter critical appraisal of the performance of both federal and state governments on all the issues affecting the welfare of our members as observed above and the insincerity of government in implementing the Memorandum of Action after 113 days, the NEC unanimously resolved by vote to resume the total and indefinite strike action from 08.00hrs on Monday, August 2, 2021\u201d.\n\nThe doctors demanded the immediate withdrawal of the circular removing House Officers from the scheme of service.\n\nThey also decried the undue hardship doctors on GIFMIS platform were facing due to the delays in payment of their salary arrears ranging from three to seven months.\n\nNARD further expressed concern over the poor response of most state governments in domesticating the Medical Residency Training Act of 2017 while commending states like Delta and Benue, which have adopted the law.\n\nIn addition, NARD lamented the acute manpower shortage in most tertiary health institutions and the attendant burnout effects on its members.\n\nIt said the situation has been made worse by the ongoing deadly brain drain decimating the nation\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nThe association also accused the Registrar of Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria, Dr. T B Sanusi of non- remittance of its membership dues.\n\nIt stated that its members were committed to the smooth running of the health sector, adding however that they can only do so when their welfare is given the desired attention.\n\nHowever, the Minister of Labour and Employment Senator Chris Ngige had said a lot of progress had been made in the implementation of the Memorandum of Agreement with the resident doctors.\n\nSpeaking shortly after a recent meeting of the federal government\u2019s team with NARD at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, Ngige said substantial progress was made in operationalising the insurance scheme.\n\nConsultants Give FG 21-day Ultimatum\n\nMeanwhile, MDCAN has given 21-day ultimatum to the federal government and NSIWC to halt persistent cut in wages of members or face total and indefinite nationwide strike action.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the ultimatum took effect from July 26, 2021.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Jos, Plateau State, the President and Secretary of MDCAN, Professor Ken Ozoilo and Dr. Moses Chingle, respectively, said it was disheartening that consultants teaching in universities across the country have continued to suffer underpayment for over 10 years.\n\nIn the joint statement read by Ozoilo, they said: \u201cThis income loss is the result of the fact that their work in the teaching hospitals is under-compensated, and also the fact that the remuneration system in the university does not recognise them as doctors, despite the fact that the University primarily employs them because of the fact that they are doctors.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Ozoilo said: \u201cThis income loss has led to the increasing difficulty in attracting the brightest and the best of consultants into the university as lecturers, a steady exodus of the few doctors in academia to service centres and a worsening of the brain drain phenomenon.\u201d\n\nHe added that a letter from NSIWC dated, April 23, 2021, with reference number: SWC/S/04/S.410/T/86 to the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation had directed the removal of doctors who are lecturers from the CONMESS Salary Scale on the IPPIS platform for the payment of their salaries in the universities, a development he described as unacceptable.\n\nOzoilo said MDCAN had made several efforts to engage various arms and agencies of government with the aim of achieving a negotiated peaceable solution in the past 10 years to no avail.\n\nHe stressed that efforts had been made by some federal universities to ameliorate the income loss by payment of clinical lecturers in those institutions on CONMESS Salary Scale in the university relying on appropriate and relevant circulars issued by government, adding that the letter from NSIWC had directed the removal of the consultants from CONMESS in those few universities is absolutely the last straw.\n\nOzoilo said: \u201cConsequently, MDCAN has resolved to withdraw the services of its members from all public institutions to press home its demand for an appropriate, fair and just compensation for the work of clinical lecturers. NEC therefore, hereby issues a 21-day ultimatum effective from today, Monday, July 26, 2021 to government and its agencies as a notice of its resolve.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe demand immediate withdrawal of the NSIWC letter Ref no: SWC/S/04/S.410/T/86 of 23rd April 2021 directing the removal of doctors from CONMESS on the IPPIS platform in the university. A directive that all universities previously paying their clinical lecturers on CONMESS Scale, before the aforesaid NSIWC letter should revert back to that practice immediately.\n\n\u201cAll clinical lecturers in the remaining universities should be placed on CONMESS Scale for the purpose of their remuneration in the university. Alternatively, award of a compensation for the income loss incurred by doctors in the university on account of being lecturers, provided that this shall also reflect in their pension contributions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Everybody has one creativity or the other. Everybody has something they\u2019re born to do in this world,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think we should discourage the youths from going out. If they need support, there are some government agencies saddled with the responsibility of providing many empowerment programmes.\n\n\u201cThese agencies can support youths to learn something and be productive, rather than looking at running out. We should not think of going out. We should try to look inward and believe in government\u2019s programmes.\n\n\u201cThe Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN) is there, and so many programmes that the government has put in place to help the youths \u2014 to encourage them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe director also cautioned youths against falling prey to traffickers in their quest to seek employment abroad.\n\n\u201cThe people coming to take them will not tell them the truth.

The children can stay back in Nigeria, even help Nigeria\u2019s economy, because when they use their hands to do something creative, they can add to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the nation, instead of even losing our good hands in the name of trafficking and they die in the process.\n\n\u201cBoth ways, we are trying to help the economy and we are also trying to save lives that are going to be lost.

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It had also gotten a $100m investment from Mastercard in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) in April.\n\nAMC BV is a subsidiary of Airtel Africa that functions as the holding company for several of the company\u2019s mobile money operations across 14 African countries.\n\nThe mobile money division is one of the largest financial services providers on the continent. It enables users to make mobile payments, international money transfers, borrow money, and use virtual credit cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer TechCrunch, the investment will be used to reduce its debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries.\n\nThe investment deal will be completed in two tranches, with the first $150m probably in August and $50m at a yet unspecified date.\n\nAirtel Africa says that QIA will hold a minority stake in the company while it retains the majority. However, what\u2019s different in this investment deal is that QIA now has the authority to appoint a director to the board of directors of AMC BV, as well as \u201ccertain customary information and minority protection rights.\u201d\n\nWe reported that the telecommunications company recorded significant growth in revenue between March and December 2020; however, profit after tax dropped.\n\nComparing revenue from Q1 2020 with Q1 2021, Airtel saw a significant increase in revenue at $1.03b, dwarfing Q1 2020\u2019s revenue of $899m by 21.7%.\n\nIn its Q1 financial report, Airtel\u2019s Mobile Money accounted for the least revenue at $110m. However, it surpassed the $83m of Q1 2020 by 38.7%. Its mobile money customer base went from 18.3 million in Q1 2020 to 21.7 million in Q1 2021, an 18.5% increase.\n\nIn February 2021, Airtel Africa made it known that it wanted to sell a minority stake in AMC BV to raise cash and sell off some assets.\n\nIn subsequent months, the telco giant sold off telecommunication towers in Madagascar and Malawi to Helios Towers for $119m and raised $500m from outside investors. And in June, the telco giant announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud, QIA CEO, believes that Airtel Money is critical for economic activity facilitation, particularly for customers who lack access to traditional financial services.\n\nHe also believes that the Sovereign Wealth Fund\u2019s investment in Airtel Africa will contribute to sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s financial inclusion.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Who puts out your IT fires when you\u2019ve deleted an entire file from the company\u2019s servers?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, the job of a system administrator \u2014 sometimes called a sysadmin or system admin \u2014 had begun to fascinate me. But before we start, a little back story.\n\nMy first experience with system administrators was with the technical support staff in the ICTU/CRPU unit of the University of Benin. Depending on the mood you catch them in, you could get a good-natured, friendly personality or, a trash-talking grump \u2014 most likely the latter.\n\nFast forward to 2021, my job at Techpoint Africa led me to meet people like Karo, a soft-spoken but highly opinionated sysadmin who takes his job seriously and, quite frankly, knows what he is doing.\n\nThe difference was stark, but I still didn\u2019t know what exactly sysadmins did. And I decided to find out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho are System Administrators?\n\nWhen I first began down the rabbit hole called research, I expected to find a pretty complex maze of confusing terms and techy words. In the end, I did find them \u2014 words like awk, Perl, and shell. I also found semi-familiar words like server, network, and information.\n\nBut I discovered an underlying thread, troubleshooting. At the heart of the job of a system administrator is the ability to find solutions to the IT fires an organisation dependent on technology inevitably needs to put out.\n\nKolade Alonge, a former server administrator at MultiChoice, puts it succinctly, \u201cWe are problem solvers.\u201d\n\nMore than that, System Administrators are responsible for the general management and maintenance of computer systems \u2014 servers, storage, CPU, PC \u2014 including software and hardware.\n\nThey manage user accounts, server configurations, install, configure and update software. Essentially, they keep an organisation from falling apart. System Administrators troubleshoot all day, every day.\n\nFor the average sysadmin, the day is spent attending to tickets \u2014 troubleshooting requests \u2014 from users, checking for errors and making sure the server is running perfectly.\n\nIt is quite demanding, requiring sysadmins to have knowledge of computer architecture \u2014 both hardware and software \u2014 and stay abreast of the latest updates to software; constantly think widely for economical solutions for the organisation while trying to maintain some semblance of calm.\n\nThe path to System Administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fatosa Adigun, his journey began in the four walls of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, as a student in the Electrical/Electronics Engineering Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI started as an intern after my national diploma. Even though I was studying Electrical/Electronics Engineering, I was privileged to do my industrial training in an IT firm somewhere in Ikeja. I was posted to the Network and IT Department. I knew I\u2019d end up in the IT field.\u201d\n\nHis love for IT led him to go back to school for a degree in Computer Science, a programme which will end next year.\n\nAlonge\u2019s path was a different one. He studied Computer Science as an undergraduate and began his career as an IT Auditor, but eventually wound up as a System Administrator at Multichoice for the better part of a year. An experience he believes every IT professional should have.\n\n\u201cEvery auditor needs to have that experience of providing service before auditing service.\u201d\n\nAlonge and Adigun agree on one thing, going to university barely gives you 10% of the knowledge you need on the job. Many skills they acquired were primarily learnt as they went along or via courses and certifications they have had to take.\n\nAccording to Alonge, in Nigeria, school will teach you what you need to understand about computer architecture. If you are lucky enough, you get a lecturer good at programming who teaches well.\n\nWhile entry requirements for system administrators are relatively low, companies often prefer to hire persons with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a computer-related course such as computer science, electrical/electronics engineering, or telecommunications and networking.\n\nHowever, according to Olusegun Balogun, an IT Support Specialist, you don\u2019t necessarily have to have those degrees to become a system administrator.\n\n\u201cAt Southgate Technologies, where I did my IT, I had a boss then. He was a subject matter expert in networking, but his first degree was in sociology. It depends first of all on the passion you have for computers, or it could be the first job you landed, and you decided to build a career in IT.\u201d\n\nReal-life experiences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonge recalls receiving a call from his office informing him that his server room was on fire. Thankfully, this was not the case. The problem was with the cooling equipment. The room was quite hot, and the servers had to be turned off to prevent downtime.\n\nHeat is a sworn nemesis of servers. The ideal temperature for a server room is between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius. You also have to be careful not to keep the server room too cold \u2014 very dicey.\n\nApart from the health of the servers, what concerned him most was the fact that fellow staff members would be unable to work.\n\nHe recalls another incident; the backup solution was not working for the file server \u2014 where organisations store their documents and important information. He would have to update the hard drive, a tricky situation that meant that if he failed, not only would important information be lost, he could lose his job as well.\n\nEventually, everything went off without a hitch, with some prayer backing it along the way. He counts this as both his best and worst experience on the job.\n\nFor System Administrators, a problem solved is a highlight of their day. Adigun\u2019s best experience involved solving a network issue for a very important client, a government parastatal which shall not be named.\n\nHis worst experience was a bad boss at a former workplace. His superior shouted at him for a mistake he had inadvertently committed.\n\nHow important are System Administrators?\n\nAccording to Balogun, as long as an organisation\u2019s system depends on IT infrastructure, sysadmins are important. But he also says it depends on the size of the organisation\n\n\u201cSome organisations have in-house administrators because they can afford to hire them. But there are some organisations that cannot afford to keep those engineers in-house, so they just outsource those roles to big organisations.\n\n\u201cUltimately, all organisations, as long as you have some IT setup, routers, switches, LAN, some servers, definitely you will need a system administrator for maintenance. It now depends on the size of the organisation to know whether you are going to outsource or not,\u201d he concludes\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer GFI Software \u2014 a business-IT essential software provider \u2014 IT admins rarely have enough time, find it challenging to work without impacting users, keep everything running smoothly, and find users unpredictable.\n\nThat post was made in 2014, and if Adigun\u2019s statements are factual, it remains the norm. For him, the job is quite time-consuming. Sometimes, he has had to leave the office at 10 p.m. He also finds dealing with users in other departments stressful and keeping up with updates to the software.\n\nAlonge identifies scenarios where an organisation wastes money to get gadgets that might not be needed or repair systems that can be repaired with a bit of technical know-how.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the gadgets; it\u2019s about the knowledge,\u201d he says.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAs is the natural progression of things, technology has evolved over the years. Many jobs now involve a lot more automation than they did in the last 10, 20 years.\n\nCan AI take over the job of a sysadmin? Experts disagree, at the very least not until AI does not need the input or guidance of a human being.\n\nA Medium post by mindsync explains this quite well, \u201cIn order to use the algorithms effectively, you need the talent of a living person (it\u2019s not enough to just teach the algorithm on a sample, you need to understand the business context, data features, and be able to interpret the results correctly).\u201d\n\nBoth Adigun and Alonge agree with this assessment\n\nSystems Administrators Appreciation Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you are probably wondering. Why are we talking about sysadmins?\n\nToday, Friday, July 30, 2021, is the 22nd annual System Administrator Appreciation Day. Ted Kekatos created it.\n\nKekatos was inspired by an HP magazine ad in which a system administrator is presented with flowers and fruit-baskets by grateful co-workers as thanks for installing new printers \u2014 the same model he had just installed at his workplace.\n\nIt is a day created specifically to appreciate the tireless and sometimes thankless job that sysadmins do, 24 hours a day, 365 \u2014 or six \u2014 a year.\n\nOn the website, it says: \u201cProper observation of SysAdmin Day includes (but is not limited to): cake & ice cream, pizza, cards, gifts, words of gratitude, custom t-shirts celebrating the epic greatness of your SysAdmin, balloons, confetti, did I say gifts?\u201d\n\nSo, to all sysadmins, up at 3 a.m. trying to work out a server downtime issue, or racking your brains, trying to find the answer to a firewall problem, we say thank you.\n\nAnd most of all, we say a big thank you to Muyiwa Matuluko, Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant and Ognenekaro Obrutu, former Technical Product Lead, for putting out our IT fires \u2014 which we may or may not cause ourselves.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Although dyslexia may co-occur with eye and vision conditions, these conditions are unrelated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat then is dyslexia? Dyslexia is a learning disability. Per the International Dyslexia Association, it is a \u201clanguage problem that refers to a cluster of symptoms that result in people having difficulties with specific language skills, particularly reading.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? Caused by a deficiency in the brain\u2019s ability to convert visual or auditory input into comprehensible language, dyslexia impacts reading comprehension and fluency, writing, memory, listening, and executive functioning in the workplace or school.\n\nBesides, dyslexics may struggle with spoken language, even after being exposed to positive language models at home and receiving appropriate language training in school.\n\nThey may have difficulty expressing themselves clearly or fully comprehending what others say. While such language difficulties are difficult to identify, they can cause significant difficulties in education, the workplace, and interpersonal relationships.\n\nHence, the need to adopt tech tools to help them perform better. Last month, we discussed how assistive technology helps people with learning disabilities to unleash their potential.\n\nThis is an excellent time to revisit it: The unique case of Africans with learning disabilities and assistive technology.\n\nMany assistive technologies exist to aid dyslexics with reading, writing, and organising their work or events, but we highlighted four tools that help them succeed academically and professionally.

Google has announced a new policy update on the Android Play Store to support user control, privacy, and security, beginning September 1, 2021.\n\nThe new update prohibits apps focused on \u201ccompensated sexual relationships.\u201d \u201cSugar dating\u201d apps will no longer be allowed on the Android Play Store as part of a series of platform policy changes.\n\nIs the old policy similar? Before announcing the update, Google\u2019s Play Store policies already prohibited apps promoting \u201cservices that could be interpreted as providing sexual acts for a fee.\u201d\n\nHowever, the updated policy includes \u201ccompensated dating or sexual arrangements in which one participant is expected or implied to provide money, gifts, or financial support to another participant.\u201d\n\nWhile Google didn\u2019t announce why the apps are being prohibited on its Store, there has been a significant rise in efforts to prevent sex work in the United States.\n\nSince implementing the FOSTA-SESTA legislation in 2018, the protections granted to online content for the promotion or facilitation of prostitution have been revoked.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with the new update, Google is providing a Developer Preview of app set ID for critical use cases like analytics and fraud prevention. Also, the search giant is adding new restrictions to its Family Policy which is aimed at children.\n\nIt is also adding a new section to its Enforcement Policy that will allow it to close inactive or abandoned developer accounts after one year of inactivity, among other things.\n\nGoogle claims that with its User Data Policy update, it will be illegal to link persistent device identifiers to personal and sensitive user data or resettable device identifiers unless for pre-approved use cases.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nFacebook Gave Investors 10.4 Billion Reasons To Be Happy\u2014But Its Stock Sank Anyways.

          "text": "Over 300 companies trapped in the shutdown of the Eleme-Onne section of the East-West Road area near Port Harcourt, Rivers State, have cried out over bleak weeks ahead.\n\nThis came as a result of the rejection of the offers by the Ministry of Niger Delta headed by ex-governor and ex-senator, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nOgoni youths had occupied the stretch on Tuesday, July 26, 2021, insisting on the repair of the road, but the Ministry sent the permanent secretary to announce a N2.5bn-compensation to property owners to enable construction to start and ordered RCC, the contractor, to move in on Friday to start work.\n\nThe youth did not budge and insisted on seeing the FG or work in action before they would vacate. The stalemate has caused panic within the companies as the youth began making arrangements for church service at the venue on Sunday.\n\nRead also: Wike demands completion of East-West Road\n\nA CEO in one of the multi-national corporations said the delay to address the issue was becoming worrisome to the businesses in the zone. \u201cWe are now afraid because it\u2019s scary,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother source staying away in Lagos to await outcome told BusinessDay on the telephone that the companies have lost man-hours running into hundreds of millions of naira, if not billions yet. \u201cYou have large scale corporations such as two fertilizer manufacturing companies who serve the entire country,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was gathered that farmers are waiting endlessly for their supplies to touch their crops because it is a seasonal application and it cannot wait.\n\nThe only petrochemicals company in the country is there. Trucks are stranded for days, not doing anything and not delivering value. Drivers are running losses. Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited also has a port facility (jetty for export of their products that earn hard currency to the nation). The place is dormant now, sources said.\n\nThe Oil and Gas Free Zone Area (OGFZA) with about 300 companies is now shut down. A huge loss of man-hours is being recorded. The source said: \u201cThis is an economic road that delivers traffic to Ogoni of Rivers State, to Akwa Ibom, and to the Cross River States. Travellers have been cut off from their destinations.\n\n\u201cThe call for attention to this road especially the bridge at Eleme has been ongoing for a long time with promises not kept. This road has been a huge loss to the economy; yet, this is the road that links the country to its huge economic nerves such as the only oil and gas port, light ocean terminal, deep ocean terminal, ports, customs, and many economic installations.\n\n\u201cIt is also the road that links the nation to the construction site of the N120billion Bodo-Bonny Road across the sea. Why is this matter being treated with a lukewarm attitude? The FG ought to consider all these losses and intervene in this deadlock. We hear the Senate proposing a concession action for this road. We say no to this. It would mean taxing people who work in the area going and coming, yet this is the road to the nation\u2019s economic hub,\u201d the CEO lamented on phone.\n\nSome insiders interviewed said the N725.77bn road has not had any serious provision in the budget right from the Olusegun Obasanjo time. They say those thinking that the present Minister of Niger Delta Affairs is implicated in the road project may find out that he is not sitting on any allocation meant for the road.\n\nThey argued that Akpabio is not the Minister of Works but he has rather been fighting to garner N100bn to complete the road. He has often stated that he should be one of those fighting for that road because it leads directly to his hometown. \u201cHe is a stakeholder, too. Besides, he wants to be on record as the minister that fixed that road. So, he has nothing to gain by sabotaging the road,\u201d a source said Friday.\n\nMany wonder why he is just offering N2.5bn to pay compensations to those whose property would soon be demolished to create space for construction to start. He has, however, explained that this is part of the expenditure earmarked for the project. There is N20bn from the Sovereign Wealth Fund that he is said to have wrestled out of those sitting on the fund for four years. He seems to seek more money to make it N100bn and deliver the road as one project.\n\nA source suspected that some conflict entrepreneurs in the communities may have got wind of the construction about to begin and may have felt left out and may have mobilised the youth to begin troubles ahead of works to force attention and be included into negotiations, something that is now common in the oil region.\n\nMeanwhile, more groups are threatening to mobilise more youths to the troubled area. In a statement signed by Ana Hyacinth, SSA Media, to the chairman, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), said: \u201cWe shall be mobilising youths from all communities in the state to Akpabio on Sunday, August 1, 2021, if the FG through the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs continues to pay lip service to the demands of the people.\u201d\n\nShe said they had been part of the ongoing protest and have keenly followed the Federal Government\u2019s \u201cslow and deceitful\u201d response measures to ensure that the demands are swiftly met. \u201cThis is a road with high economic importance to the development of the country and one begins to wonder the rationale behind the payment of lip service to the people\u2019s legitimate demands.\u201d\n\nFinal word\n\nThe leaders of the protests said they will not leave the place until they see work in progress. Leader of Ogoni Youths Federation, Yamaabana Legborsi told newsmen that they did not trust Akpabio\u2019s promise to mobilise contractors to fix the stretch. They said the company said to be ordered to site has not got there. It is not clear if any company would agree to mobilise to such a place under HSE rules.\n\nThe youth have vowed not to vacate the expressway except the contractor moved to the site and the company announces that Federal Government has given it money for the reconstruction of the failed portion of the road.\n\nReacting to Akpabio\u2019s announcement of the N2.5bn, Legborsi said: \u201cWe have received it with mixed feelings. We described it unambiguously as diversionary because the aim of the five-day-old mother of all protests remains on the front burner: which is the demand for the complete reconstruction of the entire stretch of the East-West Road. And that is the end, and we are serious about it.\u201d",

          "text": "New month, new week, new batch of COVID-19 vaccines\n\nThe federal government has said that Nigeria will receive a new batch of 4 million doses of Moderna vaccine, latest by Sunday, August 1, 2021.\n\nThe arrival of the new batch of the vaccine is expected to provide another opportunity for authorities to advance the protection of Nigerians against Covid-19 with the country expected to resume vaccination by next week.\n\nThis disclosure was made by the executive director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, during an interview on the NTA network news on Friday night.\n\nShuaib said that the vaccine would be taken to various storage facilities across the country for immediate deployment for the vaccination exercise.\n\nHe said that the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on Covid-19 had made adequate preparations for the storage and distribution of the vaccine by procuring 60 ultra-cold chain storage facilities across the country.\n\nHe explained that the Modena vaccine, expected to arrive on Sunday, requires ultra-cold temperatures ranging from 25 to 50 degrees Celsius whose storage equipment has been procured and installed.\n\nShuaib pointed out that as soon as the vaccines arrive, vaccination exercises will start by next week, assuring that other vaccines like the Oxford Astrazeneca vaccine, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson vaccines will be arriving in the country in September.\n\n\u201cIn Less than 72 hours from now, Nigeria will be receiving four million doses of Modena vaccines from the Covax facility and we are excited that this will be another opportunity for us to advance the protection of Nigerians against COVID-19 virus,\u201d he said.\n\nLagos to start online vehicle licence renewal next week\n\nThe Motor Vehicle Administration Agency (MVAA) has announced that the Lagos State Government will flag off its newly introduced online vehicle licence renewal with effect from August 1, 2021.\n\nThe state government said that the newly introduced vehicle registration portal via https: portal.autoreg.ng is to allow individuals to renew their vehicle licences from the comfort of their homes.\n\nThis disclosure was made by the general manager of MVAA, Lape Kilanko, during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting at Alausa, Ikeja, noting that the concept is part of the agency\u2019s efforts at enhancing service delivery in the area of vehicle documentation in Lagos State.\n\nRead also: Cement companies bounce back from COVID downturn\n\nKilanko explained that the hitherto common practice of visiting MVAA stations before renewal of vehicle licence could be done will soon be a thing of the past, stressing that with the laudable innovation, the vehicle information is secured as only the details supplied by the vehicle owner will be updated on the page.\n\nResident doctors to embark on an indefinite nationwide strike\n\nMedical doctors under the aegis of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) have agreed to commence an indefinite strike across the country with effect from Monday, August 2.\n\nThis action which is coming at a very critical time when the country is currently experiencing a rise in Covid-19 infections follows a directive issued on Saturday at the end of the executive meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) of the union held in Umuahia, the Abia State capital.\n\nThis disclosure was made by the National President of NARD, Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa, while briefing the press after the meeting, saying that members have been asked to proceed on a nationwide indefinite industrial action.\n\nFG to invest $200 million on pharmaceutical infrastructure\n\nThe managing director and chief executive officer of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Uche Orji has announced plans by the Federal Government to invest $200 million in pharmaceutical infrastructure.\n\nThe funds are expected to be used to execute 20 projects in the health sector under the Federal Government\u2019s Health Intervention Initiative.\n\nThis disclosure was made by Orji during a weekly briefing on Thursday, July 29, 2021, in Abuja.\n\nOrji said that some of the pharmaceutical infrastructure to be embarked upon with this fund includes the manufacture of essential drugs, vaccines, and the construction of cancer centres in the nation\u2019s health care sector.\n\nThe successful implementation of this initiative would help the country drastically reduce its dependence on foreign supplies.\n\nBullish sentiments favour the oil sector\n\nOil prices fell by nearly $1 on Monday as concerns about fuel demand from the spread of COVID-19 variants, as well as floods in China, offset expectations of tight supplies through the rest of the year.\n\nIndia has announced a move to commercialise its strategic crude oil reserves which is a sign the major Asian importer is taking steps to mitigate the high prices caused by OPEC+\u2019s output cuts.\n\nThe United States government says it is considering a ban on Chinese imports of Iranian crude as it is increasingly clear that Chinese firms are the central players in the supply of Iranian oil and reaching a deal with Iran before the inauguration of its new government is unlikely.\n\nOil prices recorded little change on Friday and headed for a weekly gain as demand grew faster than supply, while vaccinations are still expected to alleviate the impact of a resurgence in COVID-19 infections across the globe. Brent had a weekly growth of 3.3%.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be bullish on expectations of tighter supplies through 2021 as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis.\n\nCurrency market\n\nThe currency market was chaotic last week following the CBN\u2019s governor\u2019s pronouncement that the Regulator stopped the sale of FX to BDC operators at the end of the two-day MPC meeting held last week.\n\nThe Naira depreciated at the BDC market while it appreciated marginally at the I & E FX window on a week-on-week (W-o-W) basis.\n\nAgainst the US dollar at the BDC it closed at US$1/N525 depreciating by -5.00%, against the British pound it also depreciated by -1.42% to close at \u00a31/N715, and against the Euro by -1.34% to close at \u20ac1/N603.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira appreciated W-o-W by +0.05% and dipped by -0.02% at the NAFEX window.\n\nThe Naira closed the week at $/N411.44 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.19.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney market\n\nInterbank rates fell sharply for most of the week, as over N530bn inflow from repo and primary market strengthened system liquidity.\n\nAt the close of the trading session on Friday, funding rates dipped. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 7.50% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 7.75% indicating a W-o-W fall of -72.73% for OBB and -73.04% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trade in double digits trend in the coming week in the absence of any maturity.\n\nTreasury bills market\n\nThe treasury bills market was largely bullish for most of the trading session last week, as we saw some buying in the week.\n\nAt the close of the market last week, average benchmark yields for T-bills declined by -14.56% to 5.90% while OMO bills inched up by +1.38% W-o-W to close at 8.69%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill fell by -1.44% to close at 8.23%.\n\nActivity next week is expected to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and eurobond market\n\nThe Bond market sustained its bullish trend last week as positive sentiment was seen across the board. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.25% for the week which fell W-o-W by -3.85%.\n\nThere was a huge sell-off of Chinese investment as a result of the crackdown by the regulators on monopolistic tendencies of tech companies in China. This sent negative sentiment to investors in emerging and frontier economies. At the close of trading last week, average benchmark yields rose by +0.38% to close at 5.56% on a W-o-W basis.\n\nWe expect the relatively quiet trend to persist in the near term.\n\nThe Nigerian capital market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the week on a negative note as the Bears dominated the market. The NGXASI closed the week with a decline of -0.31%.\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange lost N62.95bn, year-to-date return moderated to -4.28%, while the market capitalization settled at N20.08trn. The volume and value of stocks traded on the exchange this week advanced by +48.92% and +92.53% respectively.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was broadly negative last week as the NGX Mainboard was the highest loser for the week with -2.59% while NGX Oil and Gas recorded the highest gain with +3.84%. NGX IND, NGX-30, NGX Consumer Goods, and NGX Banking closed the week with -1.32%, -0.60%, +0.06%, and -0.95% respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed positive with 37 gainers led by OANDO and BOCGAS as against 35 losers led by LINKASSURE and REGALINS\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of the result season. However, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments are also likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nIn addition, we expect investors to monitor the movement of yields in the fixed income market.",

          "title": "Insecurity: Arrival of Super Tucano in Nigeria raises hope of terrorists\u2019 defeat",
          "text": "With the arrival, a few days ago, of six Super Tucano jet fighters, Nigeria is set to put to rout the assorted terrorist groups in the country, but experts say Nigeria needs the political will and attitudinal change in order to win the low-grade war.\n\nConsidering the might of the Nigerian Army, especially at defending the West African region from internal aggressions amid commendable peace missions, one would have thought that by now, the Boko Haram terrorists, bandits and kidnappers should have been wiped out outright.\n\nRather, the notorious groups are thriving, expanding their territories, killing innocent people and destroying properties. Moreover, the difficulty in tackling these criminal elements and terrorists by the once-revered Nigerian Army is surprising to many, especially those who witnessed the military prowess of the army at the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, Bakassi, and some other international engagements.\n\nThe Nigerian government, which has shown little will power to tackle the country\u2019s security challenges, is at it again.\n\nRead Also: Security: Six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft leave US for Nigeria\n\nIt is celebrating the acquisition of six Super Tucano jets, which arrived Nigeria penultimate Thursday, and some people are commending the government, expressing the optimism that with the military jets, the days of Boko Haram, bandits and kidnappers are numbered.\n\nBut some keen observers think otherwise.\n\nTerfa Gekwe, a retired military personnel, from Benue State, explained that it is not about the ammunition, but soldiers in the right spirit to fight, smooth logistics, better welfare for families of slain soldiers and willingness to share intelligence by all security operatives and communities where the wars are raging.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian-made Super Tucano turboprop light-attack aircraft can only achieve result when the pilots are not ambushed, when right security intelligence is shared and secured, and morale needs to be very high for the pilots to hit the right targets because families of the dead colleagues are suffering today,\u201d Gekwe explained.\n\n\u2018Change of attitude is what Nigeria needs\u2019\n\nThe retired security personnel, who runs a security firm for luxury estates in Abuja, insisted that Nigeria does not need all the sophisticated weapons to win the war, but internal purging of the system to fish out saboteurs of military efforts, apologists and financiers of terrorist groups in the country and better collaborations with locals.\n\n\u201cYou need to show example by freezing accounts of suspected financiers, make open show of the killing of captured terrorists and forget the idea of repentant Boko Haram, if they cannot lead the way to the group\u2019s hideout, then they are still working together. Do you ever think terrorists will let a member go. The solution lies in government\u2019s hand and it knows it,\u201d he further said.\n\nToeing the same line, Amedu Tyem, a Plateau State-born serving senior security officer, regretted that the Nigerian government is announcing acquisition of jet fighters, which should have been secret, because \u201cyour enemy should not know your strength if you must win him,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe queries the source of the ammunition terrorists are using in shooting down military jets and that the government and the Nigerian Army should have tackled this challenge before acquiring jets that could be shot down soon by the waiting terrorists.\n\n\u201cI am a trained security officer and I know the kind of gun that will shoot down a fast jet. Such guns are not in the market, they are classified and can only be acquired by security institutions, so where did the guns come from, or are they saying it is Niger Delta when all the borders in the north are open to Niger, Mali, Chad and Libya by extension,\u201d Tyem noted.\n\nAs well, Peter Ogah, an activist and forensic lawyer, argued that buying jets when government is more than willing to negotiate with bandits makes no sense, rather the government should not have made noise about the jets, but bring them in secretly, use them to strike bandits and terrorists persistently until they all die or run away with their sponsors.\n\n\u201cIt is very disappointing that terrorists will shoot down military jet and nothing happens to them. The government is not telling us the truth, who are they, where did they get such guns, how did they know when to target and shoot right. If the government gets serious and sincere with the fight, it will force the Army to bring expected result. Which African country will want Nigerian soldiers now, when it is obvious that they cannot fight their own battle? Government should task the Army,\u201d Ogah said.\n\nOgah also thinks that the government should have insisted on getting foreign help rather than wasting lean resources on jet fighters that would be shot down soon by the so-called technically defeated terrorists.\n\n\u201cIf we engage the United States of America or even France as foreign partners in the fight against terrorism, they will come with their personnel and equipment as well, including jets. Who is advising Nigeria and why are we always taking the easy road?\u201d Ogah lamented.\n\nFor Ogah, the Nigerian government should be sued for the lives lost during the #EndSARS protest because trigger-happy soldiers should use the same passion in shooting innocent protesters to attack terrorists and bandits.\n\nAlso, considering the billions spent so far on security with little or no results, Marcus Angwe, a political scientist and newspaper public affairs analyst, thinks that security is now a money-making venture and that somebody is getting richer with the six Super Tucano jets deal.\n\n\u201cDo you think the six jets would have been possible if no jet was shot down? I see collaborations among a network of wicked people who want to live on the blood of innocent Nigerians. It is only in wars you shoot down jets because of the big guns required, what if it is a mercenary jet that shot down our own jet? We all need to wake up, we need to task government; we need to protest to the Army on why they are chickening-out,\u201d Angwe said.\n\nToeing a different line however, Gerald Mburi, a novelist and documenter of civil unrests in Africa in the last five decades, fears that the jets might be for military operations in the South East of the country, following Army threats in recent times.\n\n\u201cIn my three researches on civil unrest in Nigeria, I have discovered some dominant factors, which are huge challenge to security and one of them is the partiality in handling insecurity across the country. You cannot say a group is terrorist, another cultural group, and the other gunmen, and achieve same result. If those flying the new jets are Boko Haram or bandits\u2019 apologists, we will achieve no result. We need soldiers whose mission is to avenge the blood of innocent Nigerians killed directly or indirectly by these terrorists, to launch the attacks\u201d, Mburi said.\n\nThe novelist, who is also a security consultant due to his extensive documentations on insecurity, noted that the rate at which soldiers are absconding from battlegrounds with the terrorists is alarming and pointer to the need for reorientation and purging of the military.\n\n\u201cFrom experience, it is not just weapons that fight wars, but the soldiers handling the weapons are the most important and you need them to be 100 percent across board, else they will drop the weapons. Like they say, \u2018who wan die'\u201d, he enthused.\n\nIn their conclusion, many concerned Nigerians and security observers are insisting on boosting the morale of soldiers, sharing intelligence and collaboration among security operatives, working with communities affected, freezing accounts of financiers of terrorists, non-negotiation with them, making open show of their execution will save the country and not buying all the weapons that saboteurs will take to the enemies.\n\n\u201cBoost soldiers\u2019 morale now, before giving them weapons as financiers are doing to their recruit terrorists and they are getting results,\u201d Gekwe concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s a game-changer in the counter insurgency war \u2013 BMO\n\nThe Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has expressed the optimism that the arrival of the turboprop A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets which it described as \u201ca light attack aircraft, a versatile tool, rugged, well-armoured and available with the state-of-the-art avionics, was a game-changer.\n\nThe group says the new acquisition will further enable surgical strikes at the heart of various counterinsurgency operations by the troops of the gallant Armed Forces of Nigerian (AFN).\n\nIn a statement signed by its chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and secretary, Cassidy Madueke, BMO posited that these air assets would add impetus and renewed vigor to the fierce counterinsurgency operations in the North-East and the fringes of Lake Chad region, including the battle to eliminate bandits in the North-West.\n\n\u201cThe propeller-driven warplanes, which include munitions, spare parts and a maintenance package is tailored for counterinsurgency operations and will greatly bolster the nation\u2019s efforts to combat and efficiently degrade the terrorists and other sundry elements.\n\n\u201cBMO makes bold to note that, no African country has the Super Tucano in its inventory and the government of President Muhammadu Buhari would not relent in its effort to degrade all the agents of destruction in the country while retooling the Nigerian security services,\u201d the group said.\n\nBMO also highlighted how the Buhari administration has been upgrading the airpower of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) in the past six years, emphasising that, \u201cThis is a major milestone, a huge stride in the fight against terrorism. It is historical that since the civil war, Nigeria has not experienced a concise planning and acquisition of this amount of air assets which shall enable a swift termination of this prolonged asymmetric warfare.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, \u201cWe are optimistic that these new birds would complement the strategic onslaught against the terrorist elements by members of the AFN and orchestrate a narrative of success in their favour. The AFN is being repositioned as a formidable force of stability, not just in the Lake Chad region, but the greater Sahel.\u201d\n\nBMO further said: \u201cThe Super Tucano\u2019s value for improved targeting capabilities and lessened risk of collateral damage makes it a game-changer in the decade long warfare. It would ensure Nigeria continues with her willingness to lead in combating regional threats to peace and security in the sub region and the continent at large.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the procurement of these strategic platforms would lend a lot of effective air assets in the operational context of the knockdown of the terrorists\u2019 logistics hideouts. We believe the NAF would be providing close air support to the ground troops as they embark on a merciless counteroffensive strike on the Boko Haram/ ISWAP elements in the restive North East.\u201d\n\nToo early to say they are game-changers \u2013 Rtd Captain\n\nSpeaking to BusinessDay Sunday on the benefit of the Super Tucano, Aliyu Umar Babangida, a retired Army captain, said: \u201cCertainly the Air Force adding the aircraft to her inventory grants her some very significant leverage in the operations\u2026and that\u2019s the force multiplier aspect.\n\n\u201cHow, the aircraft are deployed and their impact on the North East operations is where we will begin to say if they are indeed \u2018game changers\u2019 or not. Only events as they unfold, can underscore our expectations\u2026\u201d\n\nThe retired captain further said, \u201cI am confident that within the next 90 days, a Gap analysis of the Super Tucano, and its deployment by the Air Force should indicate if they are game changers or not. And do not forget the adversary; be they insurgents or bandits, are not sleeping.\u201d\n\nOn the allegation that the major problem with the fight against insurgency is the very attitude of the soldiers themselves, particularly, the allegation of fifth-columnists and those who have turned the security challenge into money-making venture, Aliyu Babangida said that he had always maintained that humans, regardless (be they soldiers or not) are social in nature and creatures of habit.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian soldier is no less Nigerian than any citizen in Nigeria. It is thus, amazing that given the miasma of sleaze and financial heist and misappropriation we see daily; given the propensity of persons in this country to abuse our national currency openly\u2026to the rather primitive stage of littering our nations legal tender on the floor while threading on it\u2026 given these rather infantile and sybaritic appetite for primitive accumulation among Nigerians (the leaders and the led), it is indeed amazing that such a nation and the citizenry actually demand discipline and stoic dedication from her soldiers, that such soldiers should actually fight and die hard, while those they fight and die for party hard and recklessly?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cExemplary leadership, responsible citizenry also influence the values and priorities of our soldiers on the battle field.\n\n\u201cIf humans be social beings and creatures of habit, the soldier is no less, and will eventually mirror the finer dynamics of his environment, and its nuances, and that will include doing as his leaders do.\n\n\u201cTo put it succinctly, we must not engage in squander mania while expecting fellow humans or citizens or soldiers to live and die, fighting in the midst of lavish and stupendous show of ostentation, by citizens, private and public.\u201d\n\nOn the allegation that the Presidency may be complicit in the gale of insecurity sweeping through the country, the retired soldier, who also fought in the ECOMOG wars, said: \u201cThe president, presidency, and government cannot offer what they have not to give.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPut another way. An aggregate evaluation of the President and his team is directly proportional to and cannot be divorced from whatever is tenable and trending in Nigeria today.\n\nA president can only be as good as his cabinet, who are in turn, as good as their feats and achievement.\u201d\n\nJourney towards the acquisition\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Thursday, July 22, 2021 took delivery of the first batch of six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft from the United States.\n\nThe director of public relations and information, NAF Headquarters, Edward Gabkwet, an air commodore, announced the development in a statement in Abuja.\n\nApart from the Tucano fighter jets, Nigeria is also said to be expecting other fighter jets from Pakistan.\n\nAfter extensive discussions with the U.S. government, President Muhammadu Buhari in April 2018 placed an order for the aircraft.\n\nHe had said the procurement would help strengthen Nigeria\u2019s national security, as well as a timely end to the Boko Haram war.\n\nIn a letter he wrote to the National Assembly, the president said the Nigerian government transferred $469.4 million to the U.S. government for the purchase.\n\nFor years, Nigeria has engaged in a low-grade war with Islamist sect, Boko Haram. The security challenged has over the last five years worsened with the bloody campaign of various categories of terrorists across Nigeria, mainly, the northern part of the country.\n\nStakeholders in the security sector of Nigeria have continued to emphasise that the country lacked the 21st century equipment to prosecute successful war against the terrorists, who have since resorted to shooting down the nation\u2019s military aircraft.",
          "summary": "With the arrival, a few days ago, of six Super Tucano jet fighters, Nigeria is set to put to rout the assorted terrorist groups in the country, but experts say Nigeria needs the political will and attitudinal change in order to win the low-grade war.\nRead Also: Security: Six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft leave US for NigeriaIt is celebrating the acquisition of six Super Tucano jets, which arrived Nigeria penultimate Thursday, and some people are commending the government, expressing the optimism that with the military jets, the days of Boko Haram, bandits and kidnappers are numbered.\nWhich African country will want Nigerian soldiers now, when it is obvious that they cannot fight their own battle?\nApart from the Tucano fighter jets, Nigeria is also said to be expecting other fighter jets from Pakistan.\nThe security challenged has over the last five years worsened with the bloody campaign of various categories of terrorists across Nigeria, mainly, the northern part of the country.",

Hon.

He was a medal hopeful until that muscle pull. The incident in the final was unfortunate as his takeoff was very good just about 40 to 50 meters before the bad luck in the game caught up with him. We will celebrate with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus is to bring him back home as our ambassador and prepare him for other future activities and also check his medical condition to ensure in future events he doesn\u2019t suffer such ill luck.\u201d\n\nHe added that lack of preparation has a lot of impact on the performance of Nigerian athletes which include Enoch Adegoke as they all depended on the goodwill of spirited Nigerians to embark on their training, noting that Edo State also gave their support.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at this level today because we have reduced sports to politics.

But unfortunately, we have not been able to get any conviction. Not because the prosecutors are not doing their utmost best, but because of the very nature of our legal system.\n\n\u201cWe are working very hard with the High Courts and NAPTIP to ensure that we get convictions.

Joseph Iduoriyekemwen J.P., Elder Victor Aigbe, Elder O. Igbinidu, Monday Iduoriyekemwen and Elder John Eware, the community said the land was dubiously taken from the community some time ago by Ize-Iyamu.\n\nAccording to the community, \u201cWe, the indigenes of Amagba Community in Oredo Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo State, wish to express our appreciation to Governor Godwin Obaseki for listening and hearkening to our pleas expressed in the various protest letters written to him on the injustice and oppression meted on us by Osagie Ize-Iyamu.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are indeed grateful for the Governor\u2019s intervention and move to revoke the Certificate of Occupancy (C-of-O) on a land measuring over 18 hectares, which was dubiously taken from us some time ago by the said individual.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, \u201cWe hereby state, without equivocation that the said expanse of land, amounting to over 18 hectares did not wholly belong to Ize-Iyamu because portions of it were allocated to other individuals.\n\n\u201cThe portion of the land within the 18 hectares to which Ize-Iyamu laid claim, hitherto awarded to him by the community, has since been revoked by the people and leaders of Amagba, after several letters by the people and a final letter written to him by the legal representative of the Amagba Community.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a community, we decided to withdraw the large expanse of land over which Ize-Iyamu sat, under the guise of setting up an Agricultural Institution to create jobs as well as open up the area for increased economic activities,\u201d they added.\n\nThe community accused Ize-Iyamu of employing deceit when acquiring the land, noting, \u201cIt turned out that Ize-Iyamu only used the proposed agricultural institution to deceitfully acquire the land from the community, because in fact, there has never been any activity on the said parcel for these many years: Rather, the place, having been left unused, has become a den of criminals, posing severe security and safety threat to women, children and the entire people of Amagba Community.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that, even before the community began to solicit the intervention of the governor, several engagements have been ongoing to draw Ize-Iyamu\u2019s attention to the need to vacate the said property, having failed to put it to use for the purpose for which it was allocated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have, over the years, endured the pain and agony of the domination of Mr. Ize-Iyamu, who has depended on his political clout and connection with successive governments, to deprive us of the purposeful use of our land and also put our lives in danger, having left such a vast land unused in the midst of a thriving community, thereby making the land a cover for armed robbers, rapists, hoodlums, among others,\u201d they said.\n\nThey praised the governor for his decision, adding, \u201cWe are therefore immensely grateful to his Excellency, Mr. Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki, for his intervention in revoking the land title and opening up opportunities for the land to be used by government to advance the development of Amagba community and its environs.\n\n\u201cThe people of Amagba also acknowledge the numerous developmental projects embarked upon by the Governor in our community, including the over 15km Ugbor-Amagba Road, which has since been completed, as well as several other adjoining roads that have been constructed.

          "title": "In FUOYE, students toil for toilets on campus",
          "text": "One hot day in 2017, Oyindamola Adeniyi felt a flutter in her lower abdomen. She knew she needed to use the toilet quickly. But the thought of which toilet to use made her break out into a cold sweat: there was no toilet available for students.\n\nNow in her final year at the Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE), the trauma of that day in her first year has remained etched in Ms Adeniyi\u2019s memory.\n\n\u201cBack then, I was living in another town called Ilupeju Ekiti, which is like 20 minutes away from Oye. I was in a hurry so I ate hot food,\u201d recalled Ms Adeniyi, who is now in her early 20s.\n\n\u201cIn 100 level, we used to fight for seats in class and I did not want to stand throughout the class. We were supposed to have a test immediately after. Before the class ended, my stomach started acting up and I wanted to relieve myself. I was so disturbed.\u201d\n\nThe nearest toilets to Ms Adeniyi are the ones in the Faculty of Arts. But they were locked. They were locked on her first day in the university, in 2016. Now, in her final year, five years later, they are still locked.\n\nMs Adeniyi\u2019s next option was the toilet at the school\u2019s clinic, a three-minute walk from the class. When she got there, the staff at the clinic told her she could not use their toilet. Her pleas that she was suffering a runny stomach fell on deaf ears.\n\nHaving run out of options, she grabbed her bag, stopped a motorcycle, and decided to head home.\n\nThe motorcycle\u2019s sudden movement sent the contents of her stomach splattering on her body.\n\n\u201cI was so embarrassed, the bike man was shouting and students gathered. I began crying and begging,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople were pleading for me though. We were taken to a house near Oye market to wash the bike and clean myself. That day, I wore a stranger\u2019s cloth home and I felt like the ground should swallow me.\u201d\n\nMs Adeniyi is among the thousands of students at FUOYE who do not have access to basic, clean toilet facilities in the course of their studies.\n\nSince 2011 when it was established, FUOYE has not provided toilet facilities for students across its faculties.\n\nIn the Faculty of Arts, which is one of the largest in the school with four departments, all the toilets are permanently under lock and key, for the exclusive use of the lecturers.\n\nOnce in a while, the students stumble on an unlocked toilet and, expectedly, the crowd of users renders it unfit for use. As a last resort, students of the university turn to open defecation.\n\nDavid Amodu, a final year student and the president of the English and Literary Studies Department, said the problem not only affects the students but lecturers too.\n\nMr Amodu, who has been familiar with the issue since he gained admission into the school in 2016, said female students are more disadvantaged, owing to their need for toilets and adequate water supply, especially during their periods.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t speak well of a 21st-century institution like our prestigious FUOYE, that one of the few straws that will be breaking our camel\u2019s back is lack of toilets,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have many female friends. How about changing their pads, cleaning up during emergency flow? It means students would have to jump on bike and return home, missing tests and lectures, and not all lecturers would understand that.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAsked where he answers his own nature\u2019s call, the president replied, \u201cIt is the same thing our progenitors did some 400 years ago. It is into the bush, and we ease ourselves.\u201d\n\nBudgetary Allocations to FUOYE\n\nIn the last ten years, FUOYE has received N25.9 billion from the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Education, according to data provided by Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation.\n\nThe breakdown is thus:\n\n2012 N1,076,559,960 2013 N2,686,304,610 2014 N2,400,292,421 2015 N2,287,090,923 2016 N2,141,160,32 2017 N2,510,369,230 2018 N3,776,204,256 2019 N3,009,675,252 2020 N4,101,212,051 2021 N4,386,062,242\n\nThe President of Faculty Arts, Ayobami Jimoh, said two toilets were actually made available for the 3,000 students in the faculty.\n\n\u201cTwo toilets have been allocated to FASA, that I am sure of. It was announced at the Congress on May 19th, 2021 and the Welfare Director shared a broadcast recently too,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have the keys with us. Students are to get them from the Secretariat anytime they need it but very few have come for it.\u201d\n\nBut Okeke Salvation, a 200 level student of Theatre and Media Arts, said he was not aware of the allocation of the toilets. He noted that a water tank for use in the toilets was some distance away and buckets were not provided.\n\n\u201cSo, the toilets are now like storerooms where drums are kept and students mostly use the nearby bushes,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted, the Deputy Dean of Faculty of Arts, Harry Olufunwa, maintained that toilets had been assigned to students and lecturers in the faculty.\n\n\u201cWhen the current dean, Prof. Opoola came in, one of the first things he did was to identify the problems we had with toilet facilities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the biggest problem was the lack of water. So, what he did was that he set up a tank and a pumping system. This tank and pumping system was set up by him personally with his own money.\n\n\u201cAccreditation took place in November 2019. What they did in preparation for that exercise was to refurbish all toilets. They then made four available to students. Two in the first, two in the second building.\u201d\n\nStudents, however, said there is no water in the faculty and they have to rely on a shallow well.\n\nMs Adeniyi is now in her final year in the university, but memories of that incident five years ago are still etched in her memory. These days, the walk-time from her class to the school\u2019s clinic has increased to 20 minutes, after the clinic was relocated to its permanent site.\n\n\u201cI would like to plead with the management of the Federal University Oye-Ekiti to please, so that things like this could be curbed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe faculty and the departmental welfare should liaise with the student union body to be able to do this because we need it.\u201d",
          "summary": "But the thought of which toilet to use made her break out into a cold sweat: there was no toilet available for students.\nI was so disturbed.\u201dThe nearest toilets to Ms Adeniyi are the ones in the Faculty of Arts.\nSince 2011 when it was established, FUOYE has not provided toilet facilities for students across its faculties.\n\u201cSo, the toilets are now like storerooms where drums are kept and students mostly use the nearby bushes,\u201d he said.\nWhen contacted, the Deputy Dean of Faculty of Arts, Harry Olufunwa, maintained that toilets had been assigned to students and lecturers in the faculty.",

          "text": "Ace Nigerian accountant, Christian Ekeigwe, has harped on the need for accountants to exercise sufficient self-control as they play their gatekeeping roles in society.\n\nEkeigwe, a fellow of The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) and Certified Public Accountant (CPA, Massachusetts), traced audit failures to lack of self-control in people holding critical governance and control positions in organizations, and yet accounting wisdom does not recognize this pathology. He, therefore, describes self-control as \u201caccounting\u2019s blindside\u201d, which he said is the root cause of what ails it (accounting) and from where it suffers myriads of setbacks.\n\nEkeigwe who is the Chairman of Audit Committee Institute (ACI) and pioneered IT auditing in Nigeria decried the fact that \u201cself-control has been unremarked in the accounting conversation in our society despite recent egregious audit failures, which he said can only be explained by flaws in human judgment due to insufficient self-control competence.\u201d\n\nEkeigwe made these assertions in the third edition of his now sought-after allocution series to the accounting profession titled, A Letter to My Profession. He said that after four decades of training and working in the accounting profession, he has come to the conclusion that self-control, the \u201cskill that matters most,\u201d is the blindside of accounting. He argued that self-control is a blindside of accounting because it is not conceptually captured in the wisdom of accounting, despite the fact that its absence has resulted in a recent history of accounting that is punctate with, among other things, inexpiable audit failures. He asserted that failure of self-control is the root cause of what ails modern accounting, and that recognizing the profound role of self-control will have equally profound impact on the survival and prosperity of individuals, firms and nations.\n\nAccounting, he continued, must now include self-control as a deliberate competence that all accountants must consciously cultivate, recommending that accounting training should use instruction, examples and impressive imagery to inculcate self-control in the new generation of accountants to immunize them against the halo effect of hedonic histrionics of modern society.\n\nDwelling on the importance of self-control, Ekeigwe pointed out that empires, companies and individuals have collapsed as a result of poor self-control, noting that in all philosophies, religions and civilizations, self-control has been shown to be a critical success factor. According to him, the importance of self-control is well captured by Tony Schwartz, an American journalist and business book author, when he said \u201cwithout self-control, we can\u2019t accomplish almost anything of enduring value.\u201d Stretching the argument, Ekeigwe said \u2018in fact, civilization itself advanced only after humans started exercising sufficient self-control which made trust and cooperation possible.\n\nHe further argued that without self-control it is impossible to become trustworthy, a fundamental quality for accountants without which society would withhold the audit franchise. \u201cOne can conclude that the majesty and affordances of accounting could not be sustained without self-control as a deliberate competence\u201d, he added. He regretted that despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that self-control is a critical competence particularly for accountants and auditors in their gatekeeping roles in society, the profession has not recognized and emphasized it in its curriculum, wisdom and practice, noting that ethical standards of the profession touch on self-control only indirectly, tangentially. Pointedly, he said \u201cafter a fair search of accounting literature, I now conclude that self-control is the blindside of accounting and that we cannot fix what ails modern accounting and auditing until we accept the wisdom of the discipline of self-control into the wisdom of accounting.\u201d\n\nEkeigwe strongly recommended that \u201cin view of its prepotent role and benefits, self-control should be institutionally identified as a necessary deliberate competence for accountants and consciously cultivated\u201d. He also recommended that the auditability of self-control should be operationalized with appropriate risk assessment methodologies, audit work programmes that help identify reportable conditions and a reporting regime that sends subliminal message of the primacy of self-control in governance. In this regard, he said: \u201cA low rating of self-control should be identified as high risk organizations and should be an eliminator when selecting management and employees who would occupy critical and sensitive roles. In particular, job profiles that are associated with oversight of high-value assets or sensitive resources should require high self-control reliability index.\u201d\n\nEkeigwe maintained that \u201cself-control is the most important emerging competence for the accounting profession. He however lamented that \u201cwe are preoccupied with the impact of technology, forgetting that even technology itself depends on the self-control of the individuals who ideate, design, build, operate technology systems and on the self-control of those who use the data generated with technology tools for critical decision making.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, accounting cannot deliver on the promise of accounting to serve the public interest and uphold the public trust with a generation that is tragically low on self-control. He warned that ignoring the accounting profession\u2019s blindside, which he has identified as self-control, will be an undermining \u201cunforced error\u201d that could bumble the profession to irrelevance, obscurity and failure.\n\nRead more here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/self-control-blindside-accounting-christian/?trackingId=0rYuFkOwTLqV1Q04Os9hxg%3D%3D",

          "text": "The group managing director/chief executive of Zenith Bank, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, has called for increased impact investing in Africa for the continent to attain its full potential.\n\nHe made the call during his keynote address at the Africa Investment Risk & Compliance Summit 2021 organised by the Emerging Business Intelligence & Innovation (EBII) group, which held at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, last Friday.\n\nMr Onyeagwu delivered his keynote address after the special keynote address by the president of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, who was the special guest of honour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe African Union commissioner in charge of infrastructure and energy, Dr Amani Abou-Zeid, also delivered a keynote address at the summit.\n\nDelivering the keynote address with the theme \u201cLeveraging Impact Investment Opportunities for Growth in Africa\u201d, Onyeagwu described impact investing as an investment that yields optimal returns for investors, value for all stakeholders and guarantees continued sustenance and existence of humanity.\n\nHe decried the shallowness of Africa\u2019s financial market as depicted by the fact that no African exchange is among the Morgan Stanley developed markets index, only two African exchanges (Egypt and South Africa) are in the MSCI emerging markets index, and just six African exchanges are in the MSCI frontier market index. He noted that although the International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that the global investors\u2019 appetite for impact investing could total as much as $26 trillion, only approximately 8 per cent of the assets of impact intent funds are focused on Africa.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthis is not significant enough, and Africa appears to be in the room but not on the table, considering that Africa is in dire need of investment and the continent\u2019s 1.3 billion people represent about 17 per cent of the global population of about 7.8 billion.\u201d\n\nCiting the immense opportunities in Africa that represent enormous investment proposition for discerning investors, including the huge population, large market and active labour force, and the rich natural endowment, Onyeagwu described Africa as \u201cthe new frontier\u201d for global growth. He made a case for increased impact investment in Africa, noting that investment opportunities on the continent cut across agriculture, healthcare, housing, infrastructure, electricity, and the creative sectors.\n\nOnyeagwu exuded immense optimism on the coming into effect of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative, which would create a single, continent-wide market for goods and services, business and investment as being in one country on the continent grants investors access to the entire continent. He also called investors\u2019 attention to Africa\u2019s rich natural endowment, which includes 60 per cent of the world\u2019s uncultivated arable land and 9 per cent of the world\u2019s freshwater bodies, noting that Africa holds enormous potential for organic food production. He, therefore, implored investors in the agribusiness value chain to focus attention in Africa for organic food production instead of genetically modified food in other climes.\n\nOnyeagwu also noted that as a socially responsible organisation, Zenith Bank continues to promote impact investment in Africa.\n\nSpecifically, the bank has maintained strong advocacy for investment in Africa through its flagship sponsorship of \u201cInside Africa\u201d on CNN for 16 consecutive years, which is helping to highlight the immense creativity and talent that abound on the continent and the enormous investment opportunities on the continent of Africa.\n\nHe also said that the bank leverages its in-depth knowledge of the African market to guide investors and hedge their exposures.\n\nAccording to him, the bank has been on a steady Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) investment journey, which started with ESG integration as a business strategy as well as being a signatory to the Nigerian Principles for Sustainable Banking and the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) Principles for Responsible Banking. For its efforts, Onyeagwu noted that Zenith Bank received recognition as the \u201cBest Company in Promotion of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment in Africa\u201d at the 2020 Sustainability, Enterprise and Responsibility Awards (SERAS).\n\nIn his call to action, Onyeagwu called for a paradigm shift, noting that Africa is a work in progress, and leaders in the public and private sector should not despair.\n\nHe encouraged leaders to champion the changes they want to see, pay close attention to responsibility and accountability in leadership. He also called for the de-risking of Africa through reforms, improved ease of doing business, respect for the rule of law and sanctity of contract, and human capital development.\n\nOnyeagwu expressed satisfaction with the several reforms of the Federal Government of Nigeria, including the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme (RITC), the establishment of the Rural Electrification Agency\u2019s (REA) Rural Electrification Fund (REF), Infraco Plc, and several other development finance initiatives of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He also noted that several African countries, including Ghana, Kenya and Rwanda, are recording massive improvements in the ease of doing business, leveraging digital technology to simplify government processes and deepen the financial system.\n\nHe implored Africans to see themselves as brothers and sisters, say no to xenophobia, and speak with one voice and not with discordant tunes.\n\nOnyeagwu implored the rest of the world to look at Africa as an investment destination that guarantees optimal returns. He noted that Africa has profound talent that abounds across the world and contributes to the development of these climes, and this should be reciprocated. He encouraged Africans to imbibe the spirit of Ubuntu \u2013 \u201cI am because you are\u201d since we are all connected in humanity.",

Alternatively, the learned trial examined the oral testimony of the 15 witnesses called by the Prosecution, upheld the no-case submission of the defence and discharged the defendants.\n\nThe rights activist added that in apparent disregard of the epochal judgment of the Honourable Justice Gideon Kurada, the government sought to subject the defendants to trial under the Terrorism Prevention Act enacted in 2011 for offences that were committed as far back as 2008.\n\nHe said since the Kaduna State Government was not sure that the defendants would be convicted for terrorism, the Director of Public Prosecution, Mr. Bayero had announced that an appeal would be filed at the Court of Appeal against the Ruling of the Honourable Justice Gideon Kadura.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the new charge constitutes the worst abuse of the process of the Federal High Court. Once the case charge is served on the defence we shall not hesitate to file the necessary application for the immediate termination of the prosecutorial charade.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, we wish to state, without any fear of contradiction, that the filing of the new charge of terrorism and treasonable felony by the Kaduna State Government has no effect whatsoever on the valid and subsisting order of the Honourable Justice Gideon Kudura for the unconditional release of the defendants from prison custody,\u201d Falana said.\n\nIn the same vein, Falana stated that the filing of the proposed notice of appeal by the government would not constitute a stay of action with respect to the order for the release of the defendants.\n\nHe said, as law-abiding citizens, the defendants were free to continue to breathe the air of freedom, but noted that since the new charge had failed to achieve its oppressive objective of frustrating the release of the couple from further incarceration, he called on the government to discontinue it without any delay.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari appears to have been appointed as a special ambassador to Indian social media site Koo, with the app promising to give \u201cexclusive updates from him only on Koo App!\u201d\n\nIn June, the app Koo, which is comparable to Twitter, was released in Nigeria. This came shortly after the Nigerian government imposed a ban on Twitter and its operations in the country.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari threatened to punish regional secessionists in the country\u2019s South-East area in a tweet that was removed by Twitter two days later.\n\nAs official federal government social media outlets stopped tweeting and shifted to Koo, Koo\u2019s popularity skyrocketed.\n\nTop government officials, presidential aides, government agencies, and other pro-government figures joined Koo.\n\nAccording to the federal government, all social media platforms functioning in Nigeria must now be registered as a corporate entity in the country. One of the preconditions for the lifting of the Twitter ban was that the same condition be met.\n\nSince then, the Indian microblogging site has moved in to capitalize on the trend, preparing to open a physical presence in Nigeria and engage with key influencers.\n\nKoo co-founder Aprameya Radhakrishna hinted from his Twitter handle:\n\n\u201c@kooindia is available in Nigeria. We\u2019re thinking of enabling the local languages there too. What say?\u201d\n\nWithin days after the Twitter suspension, Koo was accessible in the Apple and Google app stores, and employment openings for local language speakers were advertised on LinkedIn.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Koo\u2019s launch to Nigeria are identical to those surrounding its introduction to its home market.\n\nThousands of farmers began protesting three unpopular agricultural legislation once Koo was introduced, and many others resorted to Twitter to express their displeasure. The Indian government has ordered that Twitter remove accounts belonging to various news organizations and political parties, claiming that they are propagating false information.\n\nBecause the Prime Minister Modi-led government did not accept Twitter\u2019s outspoken support for freedom of expression, Koo positioned itself as a government-friendly alternative. As a result, it became a platform for spreading anti-Muslim propaganda and hate speech.\n\nIn Nigeria, the Buhari-led administration has been loud about their goal to impose control over social media, which has been widely utilized by activists and opposition groups to question government narratives.\n\nUnder the pretense of combating \u201cmisinformation,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s ministry of information and culture has enforced increasingly strict controls.\n\nThe current advertisement featuring Mr Buhari as the face of Koo in Nigeria has been slammed by the Center for Democracy and Development (CDD), a civic society organization.\n\n\u201cIts a shame the #TwitterBan has persisted till now, despite the economic disaster it has proven to be for youths who depend on #twitter for their livelihoods.\n\nFor obvious reasons, we find this ad by #koo, another microblogging platform, both immoral and distasteful.\n\nKeepitOn,\u201d CDD tweeted on Sunday.",

          "text": "However, this development is largely predicated on the fact that the FG is presently in a serious dilemma, following its latest disastrous handling of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s s BAIT.\n\nFurther, I make bold to assert that the Criminal Abduction, Detention, Torture and Extraordinary Rendition of MNK is a Disastrous and Costly Blunder, which now constitutes a Big Bone, dangerously lodged in the Throat of the inept Federal Government of Major General Muhammadu Buhari (Retired).\n\nNevertheless, the International responses and/or consequences of this latest blunder by the Buhari Government will surely be a Case Study for Researchers and Students of International Relations and International Law. Just as the Decisions of both Local and International Courts that will be involved, would have serious Implications on International Law Jurisprudence.\n\nFurthermore, the failure of the FG to bring MNK to Court on July 26, 2021, to face the charges it brought against him, as ordered by the Trial Judge, as well as Its resort to cheap propaganda and irresponsible media trial, through its Traditional Media Hirelings as well as paid analysts, newspapers columnist and internet warriors; constitutes a Gross Abuse of the Court Process and a mockery of Nigeria\u2019s Criminal Justice Administration.\n\nSuffice it, that every right-thinking person from Eastern Nigeria, who CANNOT see that MNK is the FACE OF A COURAGEOUS BATTLE FOR THE TOTAL EMANCIPATION OF EASTERN NIGERIA; is either indulging in Self Delusion, a Simple Ignoramus (Intellectually Indolent), or a DIABOLICAL POLITICAL/ Business/ RELIGIOUS LEADER. The Undeniable fact is that the Existential Battle before the Land and People of Eastern Nigeria is not about Mazi Nnamdi Kanu or his ways and manners. Far from it. As Mosses in the Holy Bible, MNK may not even get to the promised land. He may also get there. But, you never know, as his life and mission on Earth, even as it concerns Eastern Nigeria/Biafra is in the hands of the Almighty God and must conform to the Dictates of the Almighty God\u2019s Divine Order. And presently, whether anyone likes his Personality or Not, I wish to emphasize that MNK Represents the FACE of a Courageous Battle for the Total emancipation of Eastern Nigeria/Biafra, by his beleaguered Generation.\n\nIt is also pertinent to note that I already alerted the People of Eastern Nigeria/Biafra, to be wary of the oncoming Propaganda Onslaught and Media Trial by the Federal Government, in my maiden Press Statement, following the Criminal Abduction, Detention, Torture and Extraordinary Rendition of MNK by the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nNonetheless, as a Peace and Conflict Theorist, I have always advocated for Peacefully Negotiated Settlement of all disputes, because it is the ONLY Route to ending violent conflicts, without the risk of recurrence; thereby bringing the much desired sustainable peace, necessary for Africa\u2019s development.\n\nI, hereby recommend as follows:\n\nA) The Federal Government of Nigeria should immediately commence the processes of returning to the only Authentic 1963 Republican Constitution of Nigeria, as well as the 1960 Constitution of Eastern Nigerian;\n\nOr\n\nB) immediately commence the processes of conducting a Referendum for the Sovereign State of Biafra, throughout the length and Breadth of Eastern Nigeria, before the Richard Constitution of 1946.\n\nCharles Obinna Chukwuanru, PhD\n\nPresident,\n\nEastern Nigeria Development Association\n\n(ENDA)",

Saunders, who is Black and gay, wears an \u201cIncredible Hulk\u201d mask when she competes, closed out the medals ceremony by lifting her arms above her head and forming an \u201cX\u201d with her wrists.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe Jacobs victory came later and left everyone outside Italy \u2013 and maybe some in the country, as well \u2013 letting out a collective \u201cWho?\u201d\n\nHe was born in El Paso, Texas \u2013 the son of an American father and an Italian mother. He moved to Italy as a young boy when the U.S. military transferred his dad to South Korea. He was a long-jump specialist for years, and his biggest major running success came in an indoor 60-meter title at European champions earlier this year.\n\nHis personal best was an Italian record, 9.95 seconds, set in May. It was the first time he\u2019d broken 10 seconds.\n\nNow, he\u2019s on the list with Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis and Bolt \u2014 an Olympic 100-meter champion.\n\nHis path was made that much easier when American Trayvon Bromell, who came into Tokyo with the world\u2019s leading time and as the odds-on favorite, didn\u2019t even make the final.\n\nBromell ran his semifinal heat in 9.996 seconds to finish third, and said \u201cI\u2019m not really sure what I could\u2019ve done better, but the race went the way the race went.\u201d",

In Marmaris, 159 people were treated and one person was still undergoing treatment for burns.\n\nNew fires erupted in southern Hatay province where flames jumped to populated areas but appear to have been brought under control.\n\nTurkish media said hotel guests in parts of the Aegean town of Bodrum were told to evacuate and authorities called on private boats and yachts to assist in evacuation efforts by sea.President Erdogan was visiting affected areas on Saturday, inspecting from a helicopter.\n\nErdogan declared the regions affected by the forest fires \u201cdisaster areas\u201d in a statement on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to take all necessary steps to heal our nation\u2019s wounds, compensate for its losses, and improve its opportunities,\u201d said Erdogan.\n\nSpeaking from the town of Manavgat, in the south of Turkey, Erdogan said at a press conference later on Saturday that while Ankara was not looking to politicise the incident, it was also \u201cconsidering the possibility of sabotage\u201d and an investigation was under way to determine the causes of the fires.\n\nTurkey has blamed some previous forest fires on arson or outlawed groups such as the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).\n\nErdogan said the government would provide compensation for families who lost their homes or agricultural lands. He said taxes, social security and credit payments would be postponed for those affected and small businesses would be offered credit with zero interest.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do anything beyond wishing the mercy of God for the lives we have lost but we can replace everything that was burned,\u201d he said.\n\nErdogan said the number of planes fighting the fires had been increased from six to 13, including planes from Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran, and that thousands of Turkish personnel as well as dozens of helicopters and drones were assisting the firefighting efforts.\n\nSpeaking from Antalya, Al Jazeera\u2019s Resul Serdar said there are still active forest fires in at least 10 locations in Turkey.\n\n\u201cErdogan said that huge efforts are in place to bring the fires under control. Yet it is still very difficult \u2026 fires keep erupting,\u201d Serdar said.\n\nWildfires are common in Turkey\u2019s Mediterranean and Aegean regions during the arid summer months.\n\nMore than 2,600 fires have erupted each year on average in the last decade, but that figure jumped to almost 3,400 last year, said Husrev Ozkara, vice-chair of the Turkish Foresters Association.\n\nA heatwave across southern Europe, fed by hot air from Africa, has led to wildfires across the Mediterranean.\n\nTemperatures in Greece and nearby countries in southeast Europe are expected to climb to 42 degrees Celsius (more than 107 Fahrenheit) on Monday in many cities and towns and ease only later next week.\n\nExperts have said climate change is fuelling extreme weather events around the world, including wildfires and floods.\n\nMark Diesendorf, an associate professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia, told Al Jazeera that climate change is producing heatwaves and droughts, which in turn creates dry vegetation that more easily ignites large fires.\n\n\u201cVery often most of that ignition is caused by lightning \u2026 and then you have a firestorm,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best job the politicians can do now is to respond and mitigate climate change, which is the main, driving factor that\u2019s increasing the severity and the frequency of these wildfires and also of floods.\u201d",

          "text": "Police in Beijing have detained Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu on suspicion of rape. Wu\u2019s detention on Saturday came after a 19-year-old student accused the singer of date-raping her when she was 17.\n\nThe claim prompted widespread condemnation of Wu on Chinese social media and resulted in several luxury brands dropping deals with him. The 30-year-old star denies the claims.\n\nPolice in Beijing said in a statement that Wu was \u201ccriminally detained\u201d on suspicion of rape \u201cin response to relevant information reported on the internet\u201d including that he \u201crepeatedly lured young women to have sexual relations\u201d.\n\nThe statement gave no further details.\n\nNews of Wu\u2019s detention was trending as the most searched topic on Weibo on Saturday night, and some users online started commenting on Wu\u2019s social media account, telling him to \u201cget out of China\u201d.\n\nWu also holds Canadian citizenship, according to the police.\n\nThe official paper of the Communist Party, the People\u2019s Daily, weighed in on the case, saying in a short opinion post online that \u201cHaving a foreign nationality is not a protective talisman, and no matter how big the name is, there is no immunity.\u201d\n\nWu originally shot to fame as a member of the K-pop boyband EXO, before leaving in 2014 to launch a successful solo career as a singer, actor, model and variety show judge.\n\nThe teenager publicised her accusations against him on social media last month and later in an interview with the internet portal NetEase.\n\nAccording to the interview, she thought she was meeting Wu for a career opportunity. Instead, his staff who was present forced her to drink.\n\nAs someone who did not go to bars, she said her tolerance was low and she was drunk after two drinks. The next day, she woke up in Wu\u2019s bed. That morning, he was kind to her and promised to take care of her, she said.\n\nThe teenager said that was the beginning of what she had thought was their relationship. This was the case until March when he stopped returning her messages.\n\nAt first, she said she felt sorry for herself. But after she learned that there were other women who had been treated similarly, she said she felt there were others who were worse off.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this is just my own personal matter. You can even say that this is a problem with the atmosphere in China\u2019s entertainment circle,\u201d she said in the NetEase interview.\n\nSince her accusations, more people have spoken out online, accusing Wu\u2019s staff of predatory behaviour such as inviting them to boozy karaoke parties.\n\nBrands, including Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, L\u2019Oreal Men and Porsche, last week suspended their partnerships with him as a result of the escalating fallout.\n\nWu, who grew up between Vancouver and Guangzhou, has denied all allegations of assault and insisted he was innocent in multiple social media statements.\n\nThe singer said on July 19 that he had met the young woman on December 5, 2020, but \u201cI didn\u2019t force her to drink,\u201d and \u201cthere was not this sort of \u2018details\u2019 she describes\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have never \u2018coerced women into sex\u2019 or engaged in \u2018date rape\u2019,\u201d he wrote, adding that he does not sleep with underage girls.\n\nWu\u2019s studio also published a lengthy response to the teenager\u2019s claims, denying any wrongdoing and alleging that she tried to extort his staff for millions of yuan and falsified her accusations.\n\nWhen the claims surfaced, luxury firm Bulgari said it \u201cattaches great importance to the incident relating to Kris Wu and decided to terminate all related collaborations with Wu from today\u201d.\n\nHis lawyers are suing the teenager for defamation.\n\nThe student has said she is also taking legal action against Wu and said the star had attempted to buy her silence with 500,000 yuan ($77,100).",

          "title": "How Nairobi Became a Thriving Arts Hub",
          "text": "For many years, the cultural spotlight in Africa has seemed to be stubbornly focused on the west or south of the continent rather than East Africa.\n\nAnd yet from Sudan and Ethiopia to Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania, this large, ancient and multifaceted region is brimming with unique histories, peoples and stories.\n\nMuch of this cultural verve is centred on Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, which has emerged as a creative hub.\n\nThe city boasts the annual East African Art Auction, the largest in the region that has taken place since 2013. This auction has put the city on the contemporary art map in Africa despite stiff competition from Cape Town and Lagos.\n\nNairobi is also an anchor for those fleeing conflict across the region. In the process they have created one of the continent\u2019s most exciting art scenes.\n\nOne such person is the Sudanese artist ltayeb Dawelbait, who took refuge in the city after fleeing the authoritarian regime of Omar al-Bashir and a hostile environment for artistic expression in Sudan.\n\nIn the two decades Eltayeb has lived in Nairobi, his artwork has been able to thrive with stunning results.\n\nWorking from his studio in the Westlands district of the city, his work is inspired by his rural Sudanese upbringing and the everyday encounters he has in Nairobi through portraits or simply objects he has found or recycled.\n\nFor example, for his 2019 piece Encounter, he depicts the male and female form painted on a set of doors discovered in the fabric of Nairobi, the paints are natural, which he himself mixes.\n\nHe is known for his inventive use of such materials, not only resurrecting these objects sourced from his beloved Nairobi, but reimagining their histories through his artistic practice.\n\n\u201cYou find a lot of different artists from countries around the world living in Nairobi. It is very inspiring \u2013 you can see new artists with new styles every day and that makes me happy, it encourages me,\u201d he told me when I interviewed him for a recent episode of Stance, a podcast about arts and culture.\n\nAnd Eltayeb is not alone.\n\nEthiopian artist Fitsum Berhe Woldelibanos has worked in the city creating vivid, brilliant pieces that examine the human form, often through portraits.\n\nBeyond Nairobi, across East Africa, creatives are also shaping a new cultural palette, fusing ancient histories with contemporary realities.\n\nIn Mogadishu, Italian-b rn Somali architect Omar Degan is re-examining the recent histories of a city ravaged by war.\n\nThrough his practice and contemporary documentation of decimated monuments and buildings, we get a different view of Mogadishu \u2013 not just a shell of a city synonymous with war, but a city made up of a unique architectural legacy rooted in ancient, colonial and post-colonial times.\n\nWhen we met on Stance, he spoke of the conflict in Somalia not only destroying the buildings and roads, but also destroying a \u201csense of belonging\u201d. For him, in order to recreate all this in particular, Somalis need buildings \u201cthey recognise as their own\u201d.\n\nThis burgeoning cultural output has been noticed in the West as well. US-based Ethiopian writer Meron Hadero has become the first person from her country to win the prestigious AKO Caine Prize for African Writing.\n\nJudges described her short story, Much of The Street Sweep, as \u201cutterly without self-pity\u201d, and said it \u201cturns the lens\u201d on the usual clich\u00e9s. It is about an Ethiopian boy called Getu, who has to navigate the fraught power dynamics of NGOs and foreign aid in the capital Addis Ababa.\n\nLast year, another US-based Ethiopian writer, Maaza Mengiste, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for her brilliant novel The Shadow King. Set during fascist Italy\u2019s 1935 occupation of Ethiopia, it centres on the lives of women fighters.\n\nHadero\u2019s prize follows that of the Ugandan Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi, who in May won the Jhalak literary prize for British or British resident writers of colour with her novel The First Woman, a coming of age story of a young girl set during the brutal rule of Idi Amin in Uganda.\n\nAnd in 2020, the noted US-based Somali chef Hawa Hassan released a widely acclaimed cookbook In Bibi\u2019s Kitchen that spotlights the cuisine of East Africa, putting the region on the international culinary map.\n\nMeanwhile, the Royal Academy of Arts in London is currently hosting a major exhibition by Kenyan-born figurative painter Michael Armitage.\n\nHis striking, lush and magical exhibition brings together 15 of his large-scale paintings from recent years that unpack the people, stories and landscapes of East Africa.\n\nThis exhibition also includes works by other East African contemporary artists such as Asaph Ng\u2019ethe Macua, Meek Gichugu and Sane Wadu.\n\nDespite these recent successes, East Africa remains underrated for its cultural weight, with much of the media\u2019s attention continuing to focus on war, conflict and displacement.\n\nThis sadly misses the cultural growth taking place in cities across the region, from Addis Ababa, to Khartoum to Mogadishu \u2013 a city, though scarred by war that now hosts a literary festival, a new art museum and theatre.\n\nI travel widely in this region from Dar es Salaam and Mombasa to Hargeisa and I am always struck by how many brilliant artists, writers and musicians there are here, and am also struck by the need for their work to be more widely known and appreciated.\n\nIt is a region fizzing with creative flare, imagination and boldness that deserves to be recognised and celebrated.\n\nIsmail Einashe for BBC",
