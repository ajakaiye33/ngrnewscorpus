She visited a second bus terminal under construction in Lafia.\n\nThe High Commissioner also attended her first Durbar in Nigeria, at the Lafia Stadium where she met with some of Nasarawa\u2019s traditional leaders and thanked the leaders for honouring her and spoke about the need to continually celebrate and uphold history, culture and tradition.\n\nThe visit to Nasarawa State was an opportunity for the High Commissioner to stop over at the Kilema Local Rice Mill.\n\nThe UK has helped develop flood and drought-resilient rice varieties for Nigeria and introduced techniques to reduce the amount of water but also the amount of methane that arises when rice is grown. This is also another element of Nigeria\u2019s climate change commitments \u2013 at least 50% of Nigeria\u2019s rice should be grown this way.\n\nShe also visited a cassava processing centre which she was pleased to see was still continuing after the UK\u2019s support more than 10 years ago.\n\nALSO READ: Yiaga hails INEC\u2019s Bimodal Voter Accreditation System\n\nIn advancing the agricultural sector of the state, the UK Government has previously supported a fertiliser distribution and livestock vaccination system that still exists in Nasarawa State.\n\nOn animal vaccines, the UK leveraged a community-based organisation, FAHCI to establish a vaccinators\u2019 network and to prime the market. FAHCI has continued to stock vaccines in their Lafia office and retail to vaccinators that come from the rural parts of Lafia, Doma and Akwanga LGAs.

          "text": "\u2026urges NASS to accelerate the passage of Electoral Amendment Bill\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu, Abuja\n\nAhead of the Isoko South State Assembly Constituency bye-election in Delta State and the Anambra Governorship election on November 6, 2021, an election observer, Yiaga Africa, Friday, hailed the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for deploying the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, as a way to reduce human interference in the electoral process.\n\nThe commendation was made in a statement signed by the Director of Programme, Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, where it indicated that INEC had in its quarterly Consultative meeting with Civil Society Organisations (CSO\u2019S) shared its plan to deploy the BVAS for accreditation of voters and to enable near real-time viewing of results.\n\nThe statement also added that as presented at the meeting, the all-in-one technology is a multifunctional integrated device that serves multiple purposes for different activities in the value chain of elections in Nigeria.\n\nThis includes: serving as the INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED) during voter registration, serving as the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for voter accreditation on Election Day which replaces the Smart Card Reader, and serving as the INEC Results Viewing Device (IReV Device) to be used for election results upload on Election Day.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cThis recent innovation is worthy of commendation especially because it is designed to ensure full voter authentication on Election Day. This is particularly important because as revealed in previous Yiaga Africa Watching the Vote election observation reports, the Smart Card Reader while achieving an impressive level of functionality had a major challenge with full biometric authentication of voters.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS as presented will address this issue because it is designed as a bimodal biometric authentication device integrating both fingerprint and facial technology. Accordingly, on Election Day, the device will be used to authenticate voters either through fingerprint or facial recognition during accreditation. Where fingerprint authentication fails, facial authentication will be done. Where both fingerprint and facial authentication fails, the voter will not be allowed to vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, Yiaga Africa made it known that during its quarterly meeting with Civil Society Organisations in Abuja, the Commission assured all present that the \u201cnew machine is robust and sufficient to further guarantee the credibility of the voter accreditation and result management process and by extension promote transparent elections.\n\n\u201cThis will significantly reduce or possibly eliminate incidents of multiple voting, PVC buying and selling and PVC theft. We appreciate the commission\u2019s effort and it is our considered opinion that the introduction of new technology will go a long way in guaranteeing the sanctity of the ballot. Thus, we are optimistic that the new BVAS will further boost citizens\u2019 confidence in the process and encourage citizens\u2019 participation.\n\nALSO READ: Breaking: Sanwo-Olu signs VAT Bill into law\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa looks forward to the BVAS pilot exercise in the Isoko South State Assembly Constituency bye-election in Delta State. We urge the Commission to document critical lessons from the deployment and make an effort to bridge any gap identified. We urge the Commission to consistently train its ad-hoc staff to build their capacity on how to use the BVAS to avert any form of capacity gap in the deployment of the system.\n\n\u201cWe also call on the Commission to develop a strategic plan to periodically upgrade its system to enhance its security and a comprehensive voter engagement strategy to educate voters on the new technology.\u201d\n\nHowever, the statement concluded by urging the National Assembly when it resumes on September 14, 2021, to accelerate the passage of the electoral amendment bill that legalises the deployment of technology for accreditation, voting and transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cThis will further support the work of INEC, provide ample time for the familiarization of the improved legislation and build citizens\u2019 confidence in the electoral process\u201d, the statement added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Children, girls and women are more vulnerable at times of attack \u2013 putting them at a higher risk of trauma, fear, gender based violence, physical and sexual abuse.\n\nMany children in such times will have no choice but to discontinue their education and some will never return back to school \u2013 with their childhood dream fading away.\n\n\u201dThe organisation said \u201c in Nigeria, the number of out-of-school children, according to UNICEF, was 10.5million before the effects of the conflict, humanitarian crisis and COVID-19 pandemic were felt.\n\nWith the total or partial closure of schools in Zamfara, Katsina, Adamawa, Kaduna, Niger and other States due to kidnapping and abduction of school children, the number of children that would be prevented from accessing education in Nigeria could be on the increase.\u201d",

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum and a group in the South West, South-West Security Stakeholders Group (SSSG) have carpeted Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abubakar Gumi over what they called his sympathy for bandits.\n\nThe South-West group also warned bandits and other criminal elements to steer clear of the region, or face the wrath of the group.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the Convener of the group and the Aareonakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams and the secretary, Alhaji Owolabi Amusat, the group said there are strong indications that bandits have perfected plans to strike in the South-West.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, bandits have variously attacked the North East, North West and North Central, leaving disturbing scenes of terror, killings and destruction that are capable of destroying the sanctity of Nigeria,\u201d it observed.\n\n\u201cOn this note, the South-West Security Stakeholders Group considered it necessary to beef up the security operations in our region, and we charge the police and other security architectures across the region to remain vigilant in ensuring that the region is safe. Any attempt to invade the region will be resisted by our group.\u201d\n\nThe group dismissed Sheikh Gumi\u2019s visit to Igboho town, adding that it was an attempt to mock and undermine the efforts of the Yoruba activist and freedom fighter. \u201cSheikh Gumi is a Nigerian, he has a right to visit any part of the country,\u201d it noted. \u201cBut it shouldn\u2019t be to the extent of being deliberately attacking Igboho\u2019s ideology in his hometown. Such attempt is provocative, and can lead to crisis. That was why it elicited various reactions. Gumi\u2019s ideas are always at variance with the present realities in the country and it is better for him to desist from fanning the embers of discord in the country and the South-West in particular.\n\n\u201cSSSG is driven by the calls to ensure effective security across the South-West. We are also keen on regionalism where each region will control the security architecture of their respective space. If Nigeria didn\u2019t return to regionalism based on the true Federalism that we have in the past, there may be crisis and nobody should blame those agitating for self-determination.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the National President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, has criticised Gumi for his call for amnesty for the bandits and, for his attempt to compare them with Niger Delta militants.\n\nIt will be recalled that the Islamic cleric had urged the Federal Government to grant the bandits amnesty like it did to the militants that operated in the oil rich Niger Delta region. He also said that use of military force alone cannot subdue them, and warned of the danger of Nigeria turning becoming another Afghanistan.\n\nBut in an interview with Saturday Sun, Dr. Pogu condemned Gumi for his views while stating his reason that no mercy should be shown to them by Nigerian Armed Forces. \u201cWhen these bandits were killing innocent Nigerians, did they show mercy? The answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cThe olive branch was shown to them severally, with negotiations. Some of the governors in the North-West tried to discuss with them and nothing happened. They felt they were stronger than government. So, what the government is doing now is to tell the bandits that they were not stronger in anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe time for that amnesty that Sheikh Gumi was asking for has passed and elapsed. Let the military do the needful, so that they would be rooted out. Anybody who doesn\u2019t want to fight should surrender and face the natural justice of the law of Nigeria.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki and Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha\n\nPeople living in the five states of the South-East are groaning over the frequent sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which they said, has continued to cripple socio-economic activities in the region.\n\nDespite the suspension of the Monday weekly order called by IPOB to push for the release of its leader Nnamdi Kanu, who had been in the custody of the Department of State Service (DSS), South East residents have continued to comply with the weekly sit-at-home order.\n\nIPOB has since after the initial exercise on August 9, said that the order would be observed only on the days its leader is to appear in court.\n\nHowever, the fear of attacks has forced residents of cities, towns and villages in the region to stay at home in the last four Mondays. During the period, banks, markets, shopping malls, eateries and shops remained locked. Schools, mechanic workshops, recreational centres and churches were also under lock and key.\n\nThe whole thing took a new dimension as the pro-Biafra group declared a total lockdown on September 9, in protest of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Imo State.\n\nPeople said the issues of killings, beheading and burning of commercial buses linked to the enforcers of the sit-at-home order were enough reasons for them to stay at home to avoid being attacked.\n\nEvery sector has continued to bear the brunt of the frequent sit-at-home in the South East. The chambers of commerce, business owners and traders are still computing their losses, though they put the cost of every Monday sit-at-home at about N8billion.\n\nFirst Vice President of Nnewi Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NCCIMA), Chief Moses Ezukwo, said the development has robbed the zone over N50 billion so far; adding that the loss in the private sector amounted to over 60 per cent.\n\nOf this amount, unverified statistics said the transport sector loses at least N3billion any day there is lockdown in the region. An average of one million people move around, in and out of South East each day, at N3, 000 per traveller.\n\nA trader in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State lamented that the economy of the region was already collapsing.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are losing customers and businesses are declining. Monday is the first working day of the week. People set goals and hopefully look forward to achieving them. But currently, our hopes are being dashed every Monday. It is terrible. Something needs to be done urgently too.\u201d\n\nTransport companies have continued to suffer deadly blows. The major transport companies in Nigeria are largely owned by Igbo businessmen and women.\n\nAccording to them, they decided to close business every Monday because enforcers of the sit-at-home order allegedly targeted their vehicles, vandalised, and burnt them while also killing some of their passengers.\n\nFor instance, a truck laden with motor spare parts heading to Kogi State but parked at the Eluagu Obukpa area of Nsukka in Enugu State, was set ablaze by persons suspected to be enforcing the sit-at-home order in the early hours of Monday, September 6.\n\nA transport company manager in Owerri who wished not to be named, lamented: \u201cWe lost millions on that day the sit-at-home was first declared and moving into the fifth week, even though they have suspended it but our people are still very much afraid.\n\n\u201cGo around the transport companies and hear from them. Maybe many will not talk because of fear of attack. You talk today and tomorrow they will attack you. There is a need to stop this; our businesses are dying in Igboland.\u201d\n\nPresident General of Anambra State Market Amalgamated Association (ASMATA), Chief Ikechukwu Ekwegbalu alleged that hoodlums have hijacked the exercise.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn Anambra State all the major markets opened for business but we did not see any trader or customer in the market. The entire markets were deserted due to fear of attack or robbery. We want to appeal to traders and customers to be coming to the markets because IPOB has suspended the sit-at-home order.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Safety tips for driving in the rain",
          "text": "By Moses Akaigwe\n\nRainfall is very essential to all, particularly to the farmer and those in hot and dry environment, because apart from being a needed resource, it fills rivers, provides fresh water, cools the weather and sustains the ecosystem.\n\nBut when it is heavier than a drizzle, rainfall is dreaded by every motorist, because it makes driving more tasking, and in some cases, poses a potential threat when excessive downpour leads to flash flooding. That is when motoring is not just risky, but very dangerous!\n\nDriving your vehicle in the rain can be very challenging, which explains why rainy conditions account for very high accident rates in all parts of the world. With this reality in mind, every year, as the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) and the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) issue rain and flood forecasts. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) also makes it a duty to enlighten motorists and other road users with tips on how to stay safe in the rain.\n\nAccording the FRSC, because visibility is reduced and the road wet, motorists must ensure that before even taking their vehicles out in the first place, they should ensure that they are in good motoring condition: That the headlights, wipers, and brake are functional, and the tyres not balding or worn out in order to enable adequate grip during braking (as the road surface is likely to be slippery when wet).\n\nBeyond taking care that all is well mechanically, the human factor should not be taken for granted: Defensive driving is needed in all motoring conditions, but most useful when it is raining. And the first rule for every self-disciplined driver when it starts raining is to avoid excessive speed. The slower the vehicle is, the more likely you are able to be in control.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, confirmed this, advising all motorists to apply \u201ccommon sense speed limit\u201d in a rainy weather.\n\nKazeem, an Assistant Corps Marshal, gave these tips to drivers: \u201cFirst of all, before embarking on a journey during the rainy season, one should ensure that the windows and windshields are clean on the outside and the inside. It is pertinent to routinely check the headlights, brake lights, turn signals and tail lights.\n\n\u201cThe windshield wiper and blades should also be checked for proper functioning. The lights should be on during the day and at night, whenever rain starts dropping. Motorists are also advised to reduce their speed during this time and apply the \u201ccommon sense speed limit\u201d.\n\nThe Corps\u2019 Public Education Officer also spoke on slippery road surface and the need for good tyres: \u201cBecause the road surface is often slippery, drivers are also admonished to ensure that their tyres have adequate traction. The traction is the resistance between the tyre and the ground.\n\n\u201cAs such, it is dangerous to use worn-out tyres during the rainy season because the tread patterns are faded and friction is reduced, thereby leaving the car with less traction. And a car without proper traction is a potential tragedy to the road.\u201d\n\nHe described vehicle tyres as being amongst the most crucial elements, and the only part that touches the road, which is why the tyre traction is the grip of the vehicle on the road and it is very, very essential.\n\nOther essential guides by road safety experts towards safe motoring in the rain include:\n\n\u2022Ensuring that taillights, brake lights and turn signals are properly functioning so other drivers will see your vehicle during downpours.\n\n\u2022If you are not yet out in the rain, wait until the weather improves, if possible If you feel uncomfortable driving in the rain and can postpone your trip or go by public transport service, wait until the weather improves before driving.\n\n\u2022Take a good look at the tread of your vehicle\u2019s tyres. Worn-out tyres can severely reduce traction on wet road. Watch out for obstructions, like broken down vehicles, accident scenes, fallen trees, which you may suddenly come upon, due to (poor visibility).\n\n\u2022You should slow down, avoid hard braking or turning sharply and drive in the tracks of the vehicle ahead of you. This will help to avoid aquaplaning or hydroplaning \u2013 a challenging condition where water causes the vehicle\u2019s tyres to lose contact with the road surface leading to loss of control.\n\nGenerally, the first rule is, always keep your vehicle in good condition. If it is about to rain, but you are still at home or at work, tarry awhile for the weather to get better, if possible. Before driving in the rain, double check the vehicle\u2019s vital equipment to ensure they will still function properly when needed.\n\nThe check list must include headlamps, rear lights, and wipers. And, if all is okay with the vehicle, when you encounter the rain, it behoves you to reduce speed and deploy what the FRSC calls \u201cdefensive driving.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "Some friends and colleagues of Major Christopher Datong, who has spent 17 days in the captivity of the bandits who attacked the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna State, are making frantic efforts to rescue him, including raising a ransom, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Datong\u2019s military friends are keeping their ransom efforts as anonymous as possible in order not to incur punishments from the military authorities which are still bent on an obviously failed option of search-and-rescue.\n\n\n\nA top military source, however, confided in SaharaReporters that a ransom was being prepared among his friends in the Nigerian Army to be paid to the bandits through some religious negotiators.\n\nSaharaReporters had on August 25 reported that the bandits after abducting Datong got across to the military authorities to demand a ransom of N200million to free him.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that troops of the Nigerian Army and military aircraft searching for Major Datong, were having a tough time.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to get Datong out first by all means. I mean; all means. Chris\u2019 friends are not quiet. A lot is going on underground. But you know the nature of the abduction is embarrassing. It involves a military officer; it involves a military establishment. Some of his friends want to pay money to get him out.\n\n\u201cThe names and details with the money are secret. The family members are not involved so as not to implicate any officer. But efforts are on,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters, Abuja, in an initial release by Maj Gen Benjamin Sawyer, the Director, Defence Information, had stated that a board of enquiry was looking at the breach of security at the NDA.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity, to reiterate that the NDA authorities, acting on the directive of the Chief of Defence Staff has constituted a board of enquiry to ascertain the remote and immediate cause(s) of the breach of security with a view to sanction any personnel found culpable and also prevent future occurrence.\n\n\u201cLet me also assure that we shall continue to update the general public as events unfold as we are all aware the search and rescue of the abducted officer is still on. Troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria will continue with its operations to ensure all those involved in the dastardly act are brought to justice,\u201d he had said.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that Datong is still alive, according to a family source.\n\nA family member of the officer had told SaharaReporters on Wednesday that contrary to reports, he had not been killed and he was still alive.\n\nOn September 2, the military high command had during a briefing refused to give details of the condition of the Major.\n\nWhen asked on the whereabouts of the kidnapped Major at a press briefing at the Defence headquarters, Abuja, on Thursday, Brig Gen. Benard Onyeuko, acting director of Defence Media Operations, said the military would keep Nigerians posted.\n\n\u201cThat has been over-flogged; we all know the actions taken so far. We will wait for the outcome of the panel set up and the board of enquiry; we will keep you posted on that,\u201d he had said.",

          "text": "Some friends and colleagues of Major Christopher Datong, who has spent 17 days in the captivity of the bandits who attacked the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna State, are making frantic efforts to rescue him, including raising a ransom, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Datong\u2019s military friends are keeping their ransom efforts as anonymous as possible in order not to incur punishments from the military authorities which are still bent on an obviously failed option of search-and-rescue.\n\n\n\nA top military source, however, confided in SaharaReporters that a ransom was being prepared among his friends in the Nigerian Army to be paid to the bandits through some religious negotiators.\n\nSaharaReporters had on August 25 reported that the bandits after abducting Datong got across to the military authorities to demand a ransom of N200million to free him.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that troops of the Nigerian Army and military aircraft searching for Major Datong, were having a tough time.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to get Datong out first by all means. I mean; all means. Chris\u2019 friends are not quiet. A lot is going on underground. But you know the nature of the abduction is embarrassing. It involves a military officer; it involves a military establishment. Some of his friends want to pay money to get him out.\n\n\u201cThe names and details with the money are secret. The family members are not involved so as not to implicate any officer. But efforts are on,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters, Abuja, in an initial release by Maj Gen Benjamin Sawyer, the Director, Defence Information, had stated that a board of enquiry was looking at the breach of security at the NDA.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity, to reiterate that the NDA authorities, acting on the directive of the Chief of Defence Staff has constituted a board of enquiry to ascertain the remote and immediate cause(s) of the breach of security with a view to sanction any personnel found culpable and also prevent future occurrence.\n\n\u201cLet me also assure that we shall continue to update the general public as events unfold as we are all aware the search and rescue of the abducted officer is still on. Troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria will continue with its operations to ensure all those involved in the dastardly act are brought to justice,\u201d he had said.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported that Datong is still alive, according to a family source.\n\nA family member of the officer had told SaharaReporters on Wednesday that contrary to reports, he had not been killed and he was still alive.\n\nOn September 2, the military high command had during a briefing refused to give details of the condition of the Major.\n\nWhen asked on the whereabouts of the kidnapped Major at a press briefing at the Defence headquarters, Abuja, on Thursday, Brig Gen. Benard Onyeuko, acting director of Defence Media Operations, said the military would keep Nigerians posted.\n\n\u201cThat has been over-flogged; we all know the actions taken so far. We will wait for the outcome of the panel set up and the board of enquiry; we will keep you posted on that,\u201d he had said.",

We moveeee....On your Mandate We Shall Stand,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSaharaReporters had last week reported that Tinubu received at least 23 Nigerian top government officials including President Muhammadu Buhari in his London residence as state officials continue to squander Nigeria\u2019s scarce resources.\n\nThe recent visits have turned the London residence of the APC leader to a Mecca of some sort\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that the health condition of Tinubu raised more concerns among his supporters, as the several surgeries he underwent seemed to have \u201cbadly affected\u201d his hands.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that Tinubu\u2019s condition was presently so critical such that the two hands shake violently and he has to lean on his guests to pose for photographs.\n\nPolitical supporters and godsons of the APC leader had continued to troop to London, UK, on a solidarity visit including the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nA close source to the APC leader told SaharaReporters that Tinubu makes serious frantic efforts to stand as his hands and legs currently fail him.\n\n\u201cTinubu is in intense physiotherapy. The hands shake violently. The two hands are badly affected after several surgeries. You notice that when taking photos, he leans on his guests or gets sandwiched to avoid the embarrassing conditions of the hands,\u201d he had added.\n\nSaharaReporters had on August 12 reported that Buhari visited Tinubu in London after his (Tinubu) second surgery at that time.\n\nTinubu had been seen with a walking stick during Buhari\u2019s visit, confirming SaharaReporters\u2019 story that he underwent a knee surgery at the John Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland, US.\n\nThe APC chieftain, it had been learnt, left the US for the United Kingdom on crutches, a few days after the surgery.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that sources close to Tinubu said he wanted the surgery in Paris, France but changed his plan over rumours of his death.\n\nSaharaReporters had on July 31 reported that Tinubu, who has had several medical trips this year alone, had a surgery about two weeks earlier and could be billed for another one.",

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nTransforming informal recycling in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital. But Arewa has grander plans for the startup, which will require raising significant capital over the next couple of years.\n\nScrapays aims to be in not less than 22 cities in Nigeria over the next 18 months; 10 countries in Africa in 24 months; and five countries in Southeast Asia in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re solving isn\u2019t just a Nigerian or African challenge. The same problem is faced in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the ASEAN region is one of the highest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt scale, our solution cuts across every developing nation and we\u2019re building in a way that it can be implemented everywhere.\u201d\n\nArewa is also looking to promote a recycling culture among Nigerians, which would significantly increase the amount of waste collected, as the current volume recovered falls short of the demand for recyclables. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re not able to meet the demand for recyclables, which is why expanding the collection network and producer sensitisation are extremely important over the next few months.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s population is estimated to double by 2050; that\u2019s most likely to result in more solid waste hanging around and more items for recycling. As Scrapays\u2019 collectors move around streets fulfilling pick-up requests, the startup\u2019s low-tech, high-impact solution is addressing health, poverty, and urban resilience issues in Africa\u2019s largest country, one city at a time.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Street food like no other: The best Suya spots in Lagos\n\nEvery culture has it. Their own special way of grilling meat.\n\nIn East Africa, they call it nyamachoma, in southern Africa, it is called shisanyama, in Senegal, it is called dibbi, in Sudan, it\u2019s agashe and in Nigeria, we call it suya.\n\nFor our non-Nigerian readers, suya is a traditional street food that has been responsible for the cravings of millions of people for decades.\n\nIt is a delicacy that you must try if you ever set foot in the country. Suya is the creation of northern Nigeria. The Hausa, the Tuareg, and the Berber tribes have a similar North African culinary culture, with meat featuring heavily in their cuisines or tsire is a spicy meat skewer that is a popular food in Nigeria.\n\nSuya is generally made with a skewered beef, ram or chicken. Innards such as kidneys, liver, and tripe are also used.\n\nThe thinly sliced meat is marinated in various spices which include peanut cake, salt, vegetable oil, and other flavourings, and then barbecued. Suya is served with extra helpings of dried pepper mixed with spices and sliced onions.\n\nDue to its popularity, you can find a suya spot in Lagos every 4-5 minutes. Suya is not a part of the mainstream restaurant dining experience and I think it\u2019s okay like this, as suya is not just about eating grilled meat, it\u2019s a whole experience on its own.\n\nSome places offer suya on the menu but nothing beats the taste of suya from a Mai Suya (a suya seller). Suya preparation is not for the novice. It is a skill but also an art that must be learned. Suya chefs are those who know how to prepare the spices and skew the meat before placing them on the grill.\n\nRead also: Is Slow the most exclusive restaurant in Lagos?\n\nExperience and expertise are needed in order to bring out the unique taste of suya. It is a wonderful pleasure to experience at least once in a lifetime in Lagos.\n\nSuya can be delicious but can also cause serious indigestion if bought from the wrong place. We have therefore put together a list of places in Lagos we love to get Suya from.\n\nPolo Club Suya\n\nLocated in Ikoyi, the polo club is a members-only club known for polo matches, networking, and socialising.\n\nHowever, Lagosians know that possibly the best thing about the polo club is the suya they offer. I have never had stomach issues from their suya and it is just yummy. Whenever I crave suya, I remember that Yakubu, the main man behind the delicious grills, does house deliveries.\n\nGlover Court Suya\n\nFor 20 years Glover Court has been offering delicious Suya. As the name indicates, Glover Court is located on Glover Court in Ikoyi. In my humble opinion, it\u2019s a close second to polo club Suya, and I also love the fact that they sell Massa and northern Nigerian drinks right in the same complex. The food is delicious and the service excellent. To avoid the lines that can sometimes be long (a great testimony to the delicious nature of the Glover Court Suya), you can also order online via https://www.glovercourtsuya.com.ng/.\n\nSooyah Bistro, Surelere\n\nWith 6 locations across Lagos, Sooyah Bistro is fast becoming a favourite around town. They have also been very creative with their menu and offer a variety of options. Whether you are in Illupeju, Suruelere, Landmark Beach, Lekki, or Ikeja, Sooya bistro has you covered. We tried the one in Surulere. You can order here: https://surulere.sooyahbistro.com/\n\nUniversity of Suya\n\nAs the name suggests the University of Suya is notoriously known as an expert when it comes to grilling suya. Located on Allen Avenue Ikeja, they have a reputation to be one of the best in town.\n\nAkerele Hub\n\nLocated in Suruelere, on the mainland, Akerele Hub boasts some of the freshest suya in Lagos. Make sure to check them out.\n\nThere you have it. A list of the best Suya spots in Lagos for the next time that craving kicks in!",

          "text": "Nigeria might have to develop a stronger strategy to acquire COVID-19 vaccines outside the COVAX as export restrictions in India, scale-up hurdles at manufacturing sites and regulatory bureaucracies have forced the global scheme to cut its 2021 supply forecast by 25 percent.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO), Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance and other co-coordinators had projected that roughly 1.8 billion vaccines would be pooled by the end of 2021 to give up to 30 percent coverage in all lower- and middle-income countries participating in the programme.\n\nBut thanks to supply hiccups, the latest update of COVAX supply forecast indicates that a total of approximately 1.4 billion doses are the most realistic target achievable for 2021.\n\n\u201cCOVAX is making strenuous efforts to address and mitigate these risks. In addition to ongoing dialogue with the Government of India, we are calling on donors and manufacturers to make supply schedules transparent, so that it is not possible for manufacturers to prioritise bilateral customers over COVAX; to give up their place in the queue to COVAX where countries are ahead of COVAX and have enough doses to meet domestic needs, expand, accelerate, and systematise dose donations,\u201d the coordinators urged in the review.\n\nRead Also: COVAX to start sending millions of Covid-19 vaccines to Africa this month\n\nAs of August end, the scheme had delivered 330 million doses, with an additional 1.1 billion expected to be available for delivery between September and the end of 2021.\n\nA threat to the scheme poses a significant challenge to a source that has provided about 70 percent of the vaccines available in Nigeria.\n\nOf the 1.4 billion doses expected under the most likely scenario, 1.2 billion will be available for all participating countries to cover 20 percent of their populations.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has only been able to cover 2.5 percent of its estimated 206 million population fully with 10.4 million doses received from both COVAX and other sources.\n\nFull coverage of 20 percent of the population means an additional 71.9 million doses would be required to augment what is available, which is unlikely to come from COVAX given the uncertainty it faces.\n\nThe major risk to the scheme\u2019s supply is led by the uncertainty around the resumption of exports from the Serum Institute of India (SII) and manufacturing scale-up challenges affecting Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines.\n\nManufacturers\u2019 prioritising bilateral supply arrangements over COVAX agreements is also a driver of uncertainty to the scheme, which also faces delays in regulatory approval of candidates that it has signed deals with, such as Novavax, SII Novavax and Clover.\n\nIf India, for instance, lifts the export ban and J&J returns to its earlier commitments for 2021 supply, major additional doses could become available to COVAX in 2021, the coordinators said.\n\nThis adds to the slew of doubts that Nigeria may never achieve its herd immunity goal of fully vaccinating up to 70 percent of its population against the coronavirus as access to vaccines remains stifled.\n\nAnalysts think Nigerians might have to live with the virus as an endemic disease such as malaria or have it fade away, just as how the Spanish flu of 1918 disappeared after killing an estimated 500,000 Nigerians.",

          "title": "Insecurity, cost of building materials threaten Nigeria\u2019s real estate growth",
          "text": "For two straight quarters after it exited recession in the last quarter of 2020 with 2.81 percent growth, the Nigerian real estate sector has recorded impressive positive growth. The sector expanded by 1.77 percent and 3.85 percent in Q1\u201921 and Q2\u201921, respectively. The latest 3.85 percent growth is its highest in six years.\n\nExperts have attributed this growth to a number of factors. Bismarck Rewane, CEO, Financial Derivatives Company (FDC), links the growth to improvement in economic activities, which is partly driven by increased investment as interest rates declined.\n\nDamola Akindolire, managing director, Alpha Mead Construction Company, says the growth is coming from two major fronts. One is increased investment interest, which the sector is enjoying due to low returns on other instruments such as equities, treasury bills and stocks. The other factor, according to Akindolire, is the exchange rate that gives Diaspora Nigerians more opportunity to invest back home with stronger currency advantage.\n\n\u201cBut it is still early days to clap for the growth the sector has seen,\u201d says Yemi Madamidola, an estate manager, explaining that the growth is still fragile given the many threats to the sector chief among which are rising insecurity and building material prices that have seen 50 percent rise in most cases.\n\nRead Also: Here are reasons real estate was able to crawl out of recession in Q4\u201920\n\nNigerian real estate sector\n\nAt his monthly breakfast meeting (economic briefing) in August, Rewane noted that besides insecurity and building material costs, growth in the real estate sector was also threatened by the planned re-introduction of Lekki toll in Lagos, poor rail networks, virtual work and e-commerce.\n\nThe real threat to the real estate sector growth is building material prices. According to Kunle Adeyemi, CEO, Sterling Homes, the price of cement within the first quarter of this year moved over 70 percent.\n\n\u201cSo, the dream of an average Nigerian to own a home is now very slim. For us as developers, it is a huge challenge; we already have the prices of houses that are still being built. At the current cement price, you cannot deliver at that price,\u201d he says.\n\nKunle Awobodu, national president, Nigerian Institute of Building (NIoB), agrees, stressing that though developers have gone back to site, they are constrained by the sharp rise in the cost of building and finishing materials such as aluminium windows, roofing sheets, iron rods and cement.\n\n\u201cAs the prices of the materials increase, there might be a tendency for intending homeowners to abandon their housing projects for a while until they can afford to continue,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI believe that the rising cost of building materials (especially when it is abnormal) will pull the purchasing power of intending homeowners and could further increase the number of abandoned building projects in the country,\u201d he adds.\n\nA recent survey reveals that the prices of steel, tiles, doors, and Plaster of Paris (PoP) cement, among others, have risen significantly between March 2021 and August 2021. The price of steel, for instance, which was N360,000 per ton in March 2021, increased to N441,000 at the end of August 2021, representing a 22.5 percent increase within the period under review.\n\nFor these and other reasons, the outlook for the sector in the third quarter of the year is not so bright. For instance, rents are climbing in Lagos due to high inflation and the rising cost of building materials.\n\nRewane pointed out that in some market nodes in Lagos, particularly Ikoyi and Lekki, vacancy factors increased significantly. Vacancy factor is defined as the number of empty houses relative to occupied buildings. On a street of 50 houses, if 10 are empty, that means there is a 20 percent vacancy factor there.\n\n\u201cVacancy factor index increased to 33 percent from 32 percent in Q2\u201921 in Ikoyi and that was due to high rents for big corporate buildings, and also because some rents are priced in dollars,\u201d Rewane said.\n\nHe noted further that virtual work was reducing demand for office spaces; vacancy factor index fell to 13 percent from 21 percent in Q2\u201921 due to an increase in demand for commercial real estate and increased supply of short-lets and serviced apartments.\n\nRewane cited a recent housing trend in Lagos that seems to be crowding out self-contained apartments, which is partly due to high default rates among low-income earners, adding that new buildings were mostly 2 and 3 bedrooms, serviced and shared apartments and duplexes.\n\nHe said serviced and shared apartments were mostly on the Island, as investors were delving into commercial real estate in that area. \u201cThere is a new trend of short-lets and Airbnb leading to shortage of residential real estate; this could be a threat to hotels,\u201d he said.\n\nAmid all these, analysts still hope, saying that improved economic activities and low-interest-rate environment would support the real estate sector growth in Q3 \u201921. The demand for commercial real estate, especially office space, will continue to rise as more companies resume physical work.\n\nOn the other hand, the analysts see demand for residential housing falling as consumer disposable income remains squeezed. \u201cLuxury real estate like hotels will keep springing up in highbrow areas,\u201d they said, advising on the need for more government interventions to address housing deficit in the country.",

          "title": "NNPC N287bn Profit: Atedo Peterside Got it wrong \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLike doubting Thomas, Founder of IBTC Stanbic Bank, Atedo Peterside, in a tweet Sunday, 29 August called out the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to clarify a spurious allegation that it dipped its fingers in the federation account in order to announce a profit of N287bn.\n\nHe was reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s public presentation of NNPC\u2019s audit report which posted a profit ofN287bn for the very first time in 44 years of the existence of the corporation. But a couple of questions for Atade Peterside and his ilk: is it possible for an entity, signatories of a corporation to dip their hands into the federation account? Does this make any sense? Obviously, their allegation is a white lie from the pit of hell that should be spurned by well meaning Nigerians.\n\nThe 2020 Audited Financial Statement of the NNPC is on its website for all to see as the current managers believe there is nothing to hide. The highlights of the 2020 AFS revealed that while the corporation\u2019s financial position increased in total current assets by 18.7% compared to that of 2019, its total current liabilities increased by 11.4% within the same period. The group working capital remained below the line at N4.56trillion in 2020 as against N.44trillion in 2019, a decrease that could be attributed to the decline in the production of crude oil due to global impact of Covid-19. It is important to emphasise that this is the third consecutive year, the NNPC under the watch of Mele Kyari is publishing its Audited Financial Statement. Should such a fellow be condemned or praised?\n\nNigerians can readily recall that President Muhammadu Buhari promised to turn around the fortunes of the then ailing national oil corporation and reposition it for profitability. This was the chief reason why he appointed Mallam Mele Kyari as the Group Managing Director of the NNPC in the first place. The strategy for the current handlers was clear: curb wastes, fight corruption, ensure transparency and accountability in line with the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Open Government Partnership (OGP), both multi-stakeholder global initiatives, to which Nigeria is signatory, but more importantly, in keeping with his administration\u2019s electoral promises to Nigerians.\n\nWhen in 2019 Financial Audit Statement, the NNPC age-long losses were reduced from N803bn to N1.7bn, it was obvious that the corporation was heading somewhere pursuant to government\u2019s agenda to turn around the fortunes of the NNPC. It was clear that if the right measures and controls were sustained, the corporation will eventually break the age-long jinx and so many watchers of events at the nation\u2019s oil corporation weren\u2019t too surprised when it eventually declared a net profit of N287billion in year 2020.\n\nThis, in my view, calls for celebration of persons who made it happen because, for the first time in its 44-year history, the bugaboo of NNPC having to make profits has been broken. It is common knowledge that the corporation under previous administrations and GMDs was a cesspool of corruption and notorious for national economic hemorrhage and Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs). But all that is now history and people like Atedo Peterside are stupefied with the reality. They marvel in disbelief that something good is coming out of Nazareth. Peterside and his co-travelers can bear witness to the fact that there was no publication of annual financial statements until 2018 when Malam Kyari released the very first Audited Financial Statement of account of the NNPC. But the question to ask at this point is: where was Atedo Peterside and his breed all those years? He was never known, seen or heard to have asked any sort of question or comment he just made. Was Peterside not alive then? Has he suddenly woken up from slumber or just suddenly arrived from the moon to join the fray in making such unfounded allegation?\n\nNigerians are now home to the delivery of promised transparency and accountability by the current NNPC management. Acrimonious and distractive elements like Atedo Peterside do not need to make spurious, baseless and untenable allegations against the leadership of the NNPC. Apparently, Mele Kyari and his management team, working with the orders of President Muhammadu Buhari, have ensured that the NNPC did not only take steps to end the era of posting losses, but have gone ahead over time to post profit as revealed in the 2020 audit. Methinks they should be commended and not vilified by meddlesome interlopers.\n\nThe argument of Atedo Peterside that the NNPC ought not to post profit in year 2020 that had the covid-19 challenge falls flat on its face because, Atedo\u2019s Peterside\u2019s IBTC Stanbik Bank also posted profit same year of covid-19 devastation. Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc reported a profit after tax (PAT) of N83.211 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, showing an increase of 109 per cent compared to N75.035 billion in 2019.So where lies the argument that the NNPC shouldn\u2019t have posted profit in the year of economic crisis occasioned by covid-19. Why did they not post heavy losses to substantiate the point that no profit can be made in 2020, year of pandemic? It is common knowledge that covid was a global problem- while some oragnisations made profits, others suffered losses. That is business life for you and nobody should deride the other just to score cheap political or sectional point.\n\nIt is instructive to emphasise that Nigerians should not play ethnic or political cards when it comes to national economic issues. Better still, Atedo Peterside can throw his hat into the Nigerian political ring for the 2023 presidency or Governorship of his state so that he would have a first-hand experience in the political crucibles of this nation and for him to properly play politics in the real practical sense of the word instead of hiding under a business name to do so.\n\nNigerians are glad that, the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari who was the target of the media onslaught against the corporation since the release of the 2020 audit report equally came out on TVC News to clarify that the 2020 profit was very low and a very small number. In his words: \u201cThis is potentially a trillion-naira company and of course with all expectation and all resources available to us, we should not be declaring losses at any time.\u201d Impliedly, the 2021 audit will post more profit than the 2020 FAS and the trend will not only continue, but have come to stay to perpetually shame Atade Peterside and his sort.\n\nWhen we use public space, sometimes, we forget that history lay ambush with a note pad. For the avoidance of doubt, Mele Kyari has been part of the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) long before he became the GMD of the NNPC and I have personally met him in a number of NEITI meetings where he liberally canvassed the need for transparency and accountability in the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry. It was therefore not surprising when appointed GMD he has given tacit support to implementation and abided by the general principles of the EITI in all his undertakings.\n\nUnder his watch, the NNPC joined a group of over 65 extractives companies, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), commodity traders, financial institutions and industry partners committed to observing the EITI\u2019s supporting company expectations.\n\nThe NNPC we know before the coming on board of Mele Kyari and his management team operated as an opaque institution. This was pointed by NEITI in the very first forensic audit report which covered 1999-2004. As a matter of fact, since its inception in 2004, the NEITI has conducted eight independent audits in the oil and gas sector (1999\u20132004, 2005, 2006-2008, 2009-2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015) and one in the solid minerals sector (2015). All the reports have always been accompanied with recommendations based on findings relating to violations of stipulated laws and regulations on revenue or tax remittances by companies or receipts by government and its agencies.\n\nRegrettably, as a close stakeholder, majority of these recommendations have always been observed in breach by the companies and the various government agencies, as there are no legal authority to NEITI to enforce compliance or issue sanctions for ignoring them.\n\nConcerned about the recurring disregard to the recommendations in the NEITI audit reports, Mele Kyari, one of the earliest supporters of NEITI in the NNPC and his current management team chose to do things differently by working to bring an end to the era of opacity in the NNPC. Come on, this should be applauded by Nigerians and lovers of democracy anywhere in the world.\n\nTo demonstrate his commitment to taking NNPC to a profit-making corporation, Mele Kyari launched the Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE) programme. The programme ensures elimination of discretions, automation of processes and documents, sustained stakeholders communications, evolvement of a culture of openness and disclosure as well as sharing of knowledge and data with deliberate creation of spaces for feedback and implementation of open contracting processes all geared towards transparency in the NNPC.\n\nIn the area of Accountability, TAPE ensures strict adherence to NNPC\u2019s business ethics, policies and procedures, ensure reliability in financial reporting as well as need to ensure the non-betrayal of the trust of over 200million Nigerians.\n\nTo ensure performance excellence, the Mele Kyari-led management set clear objectives and targets, capacity building and empowerment of staff and creation of value addition to NNPC bottom line, while making operational effectiveness and efficiency the new mantra of the corporation. This never happened in the history of the NNPC.\n\nMuch more, the Oil and Gas industry is now governed by a Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) with couple of sections dedicated to transparency and accountability in line with the current management\u2019s New Way of Working. These are novel and deft moves that the oil industry needed over the years but was deprived by forces of darkness in power that never wished the nation any good.\n\nIt was not therefore not any surprise to industry watchers that the NNPC steadily moved from drastic reduction in losses to posting profit in 2020. Our collective prayer is that this streak should endure so that the fortunes of the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry can continue to flourish before the phase-out of the use of fossil fuel in Nigeria.\n\n______________________\n\nMr. Leo Atakpu, a Civil Society activist writes from Benin City, Edo State.\n\n...",

Today, Thursday 9th September, 2021, a Caretaker Committee of the Council was inaugurated to pilot the affairs of the Council pending when it would be able to bring all parties together for a proper election to usher in a substantive State Working Committee for the Council.\n\nCarrying out the function of the inauguration, a 3- Man Committee made up of the National Trustee of Zone F, Comrade John Angese, Edo Council Chairman, Comrade Roland Osakue and Delta Council Secretary, Comrade Patrick Ochei effected the orders of the National Secretariat by duly constituting the Caretaker Committee with Comrade Amaechi Okonkwo of the Federated Correspondents\u2019 Chapel as Chairman and Comrade Justice Ihunwo of the Rivers State Television Chapel as the Secretary respectively.\n\nIt was a tug of war as the outgone Chairman and Secretary, Stanley Job and Ike Wigodo unleashed thugs from their camp on the delegated officers, whereby Edo Council Chairman was punched severally in an attempt to screen the SEC members who had filed out for inauguration.\n\nHowever, with the assistance of the Police and DSS officers mobilized to provide security based on the urging of Radio Rivers Chapel Chairman (the Chapel of Comrade Stanley Job), we were able to leave the NUJ Press Centre to Radio Rivers where the inauguration took place.\n\nBriefing the newsmen after the inauguration, the leader of the three man delegation, John Angese said there can never be a vacuum in any leadership position of NUJ, adding that the tenure of Stanley Job\u2019s Exco had expired since June and he should constitutionally vacate office rather than putting up a show to remain in office.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has charged the newly recruited personnel into the state\u2019s civil and public service to be dedicated and committed in the discharge of their duties, contributing significantly to the realization of the government\u2019s Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) agenda.\n\nObaseki gave the charge while delivering closing remarks at the closing ceremony for the on-boarding programme for the new workers employed into the Edo State Civil and Public Service, at the John Odigie-Oyegun Training Centre, in Benin City.\n\nThe programme, which lasted for four weeks, was for the on-boarding of the first batch of over 300 new recruits into the state\u2019s workforce.\n\nObaseki noted: \u201cToday, we are completing the on-boarding session for the first set of newly appointed public and civil servants. The 300 of you are the first set because of the limitations of resources. We also want to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in the training.\u201d\n\nThe governor disclosed that the vision of his administration is to ensure that 2,000 persons are employed into the service before the end of his tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe focus and plan of my administration is to recruit 2,000 into the Edo State Civil and Public Service before the end of my term as Governor of Edo State on November 12th, 2024. This will be a major transformation of the civil and public service in the State.\n\n\u201cThe public service is broken both at the state and federal levels, and not providing the services required for the people of this nation. This is why things are not going the way they should. We embarked on rebuilding the service to make things work in Edo State and Nigeria. For things to work the way they should, the civil service should function properly.\u201d\n\nObaseki, who assured the new workers of his administration\u2019s support, stated: \u201cWhatever we have built in this administration will continue by the time we leave office on November 12th, 2024. Until we settle the civil and public service as the engine room of government, government will not work.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cYou are all hired by your efforts and merit as no one had a hand in your employment. I urge you to be fearless in carrying out your responsibilities in your various offices. You owe your employment to nobody as nobody brought you in here; but God made it possible, and the need to deliver services to Edo people.\n\n\u201cYou must be fearless in carrying out your duties and responsibilities. No one can wake up and sack you. Just continue to do the right thing and deliver service to Edo people. The governor didn\u2019t give you the job, nor was it anyone that influenced your recruitment in the service, but your personal efforts and the help of God.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cI am one of those who believe that the remuneration and compensation paid to the public and civil servants are not enough. It is something we need to work on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the end of my tenure, we will break away from the federal remuneration structure and look for a way to pay realistic wages to public and civil servants. If you are hiring the best into the service, as we are doing today, we must compete with other sectors. To do this, good wages must be paid to keep the best in the service.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Edo State Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa said, \u201cthe employment process is based on merit, as no one influenced the employment of those that were employed. The new employees are the best and I see quality in them. The state will benefit from these people.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "It has been 18 years on the throne of your forefathers. We know you have a good reason to celebrate, how do you feel today?\n\nI give all thanks to Almighty Allah, the most merciful and gracious, for giving me life. I also thank Him for giving me the grace to ascend to the throne of our forefathers in the last 18 years. Precisely, on the 11 September, 2003. Before then, I served the Nigerian Army for 30 years. And I thank God for carrying out the duties related to the royalty well. I also thank our people for their love and for accepting us wholeheartedly. In all, our people have been working in love, peace, and harmony with a deliberate effort geared towards improving the living standard of the whole kingdom. So, we have a good and cordial relationship with the people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile growing up, did you at any point imagine yourself assuming this exalted throne?\n\nPeople of royal blood or status cannot shy away or run from royalty. Royalty is inherent. The aspiration of all in the royal family is to become a king. However, while preparing for the task ahead as an heir to the throne, Allah has his plans and has already divinely ordained who will become a king at the appointed time. Hence, if you are born into the royal family, you can only wish that one day you will become a king as a time will come when the seat will be vacant. Also, a time will come for the selection of a new king, and a new king among the people of royal blood will emerge. It is not a thing you plan for, as becoming a king is divinely planned by Almighty Allah.\n\nFrom your ascension to the throne of your forebears to date, Nupe Land, and by extension, the state, has been witnessing remarkable improvements. Your Highness may wish to share with us some of the innovations you have brought to bear since ascending the throne?\n\nWe always strive to promote developmental initiatives. We consider the security, growth as well as well-being of the people first. We follow the footsteps of our forefathers, and we tend to improve on them to improve the social-economic status of the kingdom. For instance, we are blessed with good agricultural soil, and our people engage in subsistence and mechanized farming to earn a living. The women also engage in crafts, and we are encouraging them to boost their morale. These efforts, in turn, lead to development in the kingdom. We always encourage our people to be engaged and not idle.\n\nWe have also created a forum that unites us. Via this effort, a day has been set aside yearly to garner and gather all Nupe speaking tribes together, not just to sit and eat but to reappraise who we are, where we are and where we intend to be in terms of development. We feel it is necessary to do this. Precisely on the 26th of June every year is Nupe Day. The day also creates more awareness of the tribe called Nupe globally.\n\nInsecurity is currently a serious challenge in the country amid rising cases of banditry and kidnapping, although less in your kingdom, how best do you think Nigeria can overcome these challenges?\n\nInsecurity is everywhere even though the Nupe kingdom seems insulated and insecurity is not on a large scale here. However, we still experience security threats such as burglary and stealing most especially motorcycles, sadly, some riders are also killed in the process of stealing their motorcycles. To avert insecurity and the breakdown of all and order, we do alert our people that security is everybody\u2019s business. We do tell our people to be security conscious, and for instance to always properly shut their door before sleeping, and making sure they guard themself properly. We also remind them of the traditional ways of securing their domain. In those days, when traditional institutions were working perfectly, nobody would enter into a community without the king knowing. The king is always briefed, via his ward head or district head, so information flows better during that period. When we see strangers in those days, we know them. But now, a visitor will come into the community, and nobody cares. The visitors will do whatever they want and go either positive or negative no one cares. So, we do encourage our people that when they see something strange, they should speak up. Also, we believe in prayers. We always encourage our people to pray and don\u2019t joke with the five pillars of Islam. You must pray to Almighty Allah for His protection, guidance, and security of the whole community. So, at the moment, our intelligence gathering is very keen to make us respond to threats.\n\nThere has been a deterioration in the level of insecurity in the country with rampant cases of kidnapping for ransom by youths. In your opinion, how did we get to this pitiable state, and what is the solution to this rising insecurity in the north?\n\nNorthern Nigeria is where it is today because of imitation, increase in population, ignorance, poverty, and lack of direction. These factors are the cause and to be blamed for these menaces. If the political leaders are not sensitive to these issues and proffer solutions to tackle them, challenges might not be over as desired. If you travel around Nigeria, you will understand what I am saying. Sometimes, I go around the street, and I see people doing nothing. It is quite alarming. Graduates are churning out high institutions daily, while some people are totally out of school. Those who have jobs are underemployed and eat from hand to mouth. There must be proper planning and programmes to halt all these deficits and checkmate them. The nation\u2019s population and poverty are on the rise. All these challenges must be addressed.\n\nAs the chairman of Niger State Council of Traditional Rulers, the debate about whether or not to allow the traditional rulers some constitutionally guaranteed functions has been raging for long. Do you think there is a need to give the traditional rulers a clearly defined function in the constitution?\n\nTo avert insecurity and ensure peacebuilding, we have been advocating for a constitutional role for traditional rulers. Giving a constitutional role to traditional rulers will allow them to contribute their quota to national development. In the past when traditional rulers had such constitutional empowerment, the polity was peaceful, progressive, decent, and full of beautiful tradition and culture. We achieve this again by giving traditional rulers constitutionally guaranteed functions.\n\nWe must think in this direction, constitutional roles for traditional rulers must be inculcated into the system, and this is because the role of traditional rulers in securing the lives and properties of the people cannot be overemphasised. Traditional rulers are closer to the people. We need to adopt that system to achieve desired growth and progress. In other parts of the world, they do not abolish these practices. The US has its traditional security system, same with other countries. To date, they have a County Security Outfit in the US where a small group of people organise themselves to secure the people. If such a system is adopted in Nigeria, security will improve. Protection of lives and property would start from the family, community, society, state, and the nation as a whole. If this practice is properly harnessed and they work cordially with the security agencies, insecurity will be a thing of the past. We are not talking about establishing a force, we are also not trying to take the duty of the politicians but we will be part of the system, a process where our institutions are recognised, giving us a basic role to play legally and constitutionally. So, at the moment we are still sensitizing our people and ensuring they live in peace and harmony.\n\nIs state policing the way forward, will it address security challenges in Nigeria?\n\nWe have shortcomings in policing Nigeria. The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) lacks the needed training, manpower, and equipment to operate efficiently. At the moment, I can say our police lack the manpower to operate as their numbers fall below the international recommendation of policing. Their equipment is not of international standard too, their training is also poor in response to crime while their responsibilities are enormous. To address the issue of the deficit of manpower in the police, they will need to revert to the community and recruit more men to solve the challenges in terms of training, there is a need to train them in line with globally acceptable standards. It is obvious that most police officers are not properly trained, most of them are also handicapped in terms of the local language of the community they are posted to as they cannot speak the local dialect of the people. To avert this menace, people from the community who can easily understand the people should be employed with proper posting. In terms of equipment, our local equipment can be used to complement other sophisticated ones. The truth is the activities of criminals in the country can\u2019t be solved by the present police force in the country. Community policing will complement the Nigeria Police Force via a deliberate streamlined network where no gap is left, and they work harmoniously.\n\nIt is over a decade since Nigeria\u2019s government began a crackdown on Boko Haram, there is also a growing scourge of banditry and kidnapping, what are your counsels to the federal government on insecurity?\n\nThe fact is our challenges are enormous while our challenges are limited. There is a need for the government at all levels to introduce a new measure to solve the 21st-century crisis bedeviling the nation. The military is under staff. So, more personnel should be recruited into the military. They should also procure more equipment. And when talking about the equipment it should be sophisticated equipment that can complement the shortage of manpower. For instance, if you have equipment that can cover an area of maybe 100 by 100 or 200 by 200 kilometres all you need is a platoon, not a battalion. Sophisticated fighting power and equipment will drastically reduce the shortage of manpower.\n\nAlso, when you cannot deploy a brigade you deploy a battalion that will work perfectly to checkmate criminal activities. The government must address the issue of manpower and equipment and training and other logistics deficits viz a viz current day trend. Criminals are no longer using bows and arrows they are using sophisticated weapons so they will want to increase their mobility to achieve their nefarious aims so as a government you must also address such challenges to be a step further ahead of criminal elements both on ground and air. If you are to follow it, the men are fatigued, the same men you are using to fight bandits are the ones you are using to fight Boko Haram. The fact is equipment can work efficiently without much personnel.\n\nNigeria is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Africa, amid calls for the division of the country, what is your stance on restructuring?\n\nThe issues of restructuring and breaking up the country should not be brought to the fore at the moment, what we should do is to bring up suggestions, solutions, and also conduct a referendum. We should discuss to streamline what we are practicing now to advance. Countries or empires do not develop by balkanization or in one night, they develop by coming together and pursuing a developmental course. If you secede, you are going over 61 years backward as a nation or over 100 years when Nigeria came into existence before independence.\n\nSo, bring ideas that can advance us. America as a country evolved from past mistakes, and they are now where they are. The more you grow the wider your potential. You need to use your knowledge to proceed with positive solutions, but the moment you secede, I assure you that you are starting from the lowest part of the pyramid.\n\nMany illustrious some and daughters of Nupe kingdom have been conferred titles, why do you deem it fit to confer these titles to them?\n\nIt is a two-edged sword. If we see anyone doing outstandingly well in a profession and performing credibly, give them the encouragement needed to do more. Encouraging illustrious sons and daughters of Nupe extraction will allow them to do more and allow others to emulate them. On one edge of the sword, we are promoting and encouraging them to do more and on the other end, we are getting the people behind to learn and emulate. In turn, it would help promote an egalitarian society.",

          "title": "Soldiers\u2019 widows beg Army: We\u2019re suffering, pay us our husbands\u2019 life insurance claims",
          "text": "Some widows of soldiers in the over decade-old insurgency have condemned the proposed reintegration of repentant Boko Haram insurgents into society, describing the move as unjust.\n\nOver 1,000 Boko Haram fighters had handed themselves over to army units in recent weeks in the southern Borno towns of Konduga, Bama, and Mafa. Both the Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed Mohammed, among others had defended the ex-fighters\u2019 decision, noting that calls for the prosecution and killing of the repentant insurgents rather than granting them amnesty was against global best practices.\n\nThe widows, who also decried the non-payment of their husbands\u2019 life insurance claims by the Ministry of Defence years after their demise, spoke to Saturday PUNCH in separate interviews on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of their matter.\n\nSaturday PUNCH in May 2021 exclusively reported on the plights of the widows whose husbands were mostly officers. But the life insurance claims had yet to be paid since then.\n\nOne of the widows, whose husband was killed by Boko Haram insurgents on August 7, 2014 in Borno, said her in-laws thought she had been paid her late husband\u2019s life insurance claim.\n\nShe said, \u201cAfter my husband\u2019s death, I was asked to leave the barracks. I have been paying house rent and other bills outside the barracks for two years which is another difficult thing. This situation makes me shed tears. I feel really sad with this development. Boko Haram made me a widow in my early 30s, because my husband fought for Nigeria. He died and the country abandoned us. Reintegrating repentant Boko Haram fighters into society or granting them amnesty is akin to telling them, \u2018Well done.\u2019\n\n\u201cI hear that in the camp where some of the surrendered insurgents are, they take care for them well yet widows and children of fallen soldiers are not assisted or taken care of. This is not fair to the patriotic zeal of my husband who gave his best to Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnother widow whose husband was killed in December 2014 in Gombe State by insurgents said apart from the non-payment of her husband\u2019s life insurance claim, scholarships promised their children by the army weren\u2019t granted.\n\nShe stated amid tears, \u201cSome of us took our children for documentation since last year and nothing has been heard. An entire session has ended and another starting in September. The scholarship is supposed to be paid to a late officer\u2019s ward from age six. The money (about N70, 000) cannot even pay a term fees in most schools, we still need to add money to it and for those already in the scheme, payment is not consistent. Our husband wasted their lives. It\u2019s not fair to be planning to reintegrate into society those who killed our husband who were loyal to the country in their fight for its peace. We feel cheated. The officers just wasted their lives and diverse thoughts keep coming to my mind. This is too much for us to bear.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso speaking, a widow whose husband was a member of 50th regular course Nigerian Defence Academy said he was killed by insurgents on December 17, 2014 in Adamawa State.\n\nShe stated, \u201cHe was posted to Military Secretary from the war zone but was unable to resume before his demise. My husband was an infantry man to the core. He was a member of the Special Forces unit. He was always ready to serve. He was an outstanding officer. His death is something I have yet to recover from. Together we have three lovely kids. It\u2019s so disappointing that all his benefits have not been paid after serving the army diligently for 11 years.\n\n\u201cThe group life assurance beneficiaries from 2010/2015 have not been paid due to reasons we don\u2019t know. Many of us are not working. We depend on our husband\u2019s benefits to take care of our kids. We\u2019ve had cases of widows committing suicide and doing odd jobs to survive. We don\u2019t want to beg on the street. We are gradually losing our lives and some of us are sinking into depression but yet same people that turned us to widows are being forgiven and added back to society like nothing ever happened. They forget the pains they caused our families. It\u2019s unfair to us.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe urged the army and the defence military to pay their husbands\u2019 life insurance claims to help them forge ahead financially.\n\nAlso, widow of a soldier killed by Boko Haram insurgents during Operation Zama Lafia in Maiduguri, Borno State, on March 7, 2015, said she was always sad whenever she remembered her late husband.\n\nShe said her sorrow was worsened by the consideration given to the fighters who killed her husband by the Federal Government.\n\nThe widow who was visibly sad stated, \u201cWhenever I remember my late husband, I crying hard as there is nobody to help me and the children. My in-laws are not also assisting us. The Federal Government is supposed to take good care of the widows because our husbands fought hard to ensure peace in Nigeria. But their patriotism is being ridiculed by integrating those who killed them into society. I am too unhappy to behold this. I am appealing to them to pay our husbands\u2019 life insurance claims. After six years that my husband died at the battleground, nothing has been done for us. We have nowhere to go and no one to run to.\u2019\u2019\n\nReacting to the development, Mohammed Abdulkadri, media aide to the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.), explained that the Federal Government was still working to facilitate payment of insurance claims to the widows of military men, noting that it would be done as soon as all necessary processes were concluded.\n\n\u201cWe are still working on the insurance claims; everything is being done to fast-track the payment,\u2019\u2019 Abdulkadri stated.\n\nCommenting on the matter, researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, Regional Office for West Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, Abuja, Malik Samuel, stated that people formerly associated with Boko Haram were surrendering to security forces led by the military, both in Nigeria and Cameroon since the death of long-term JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, in May this year.\n\nHe noted that the government saw the action of the repentant insurgents as a vital step to degrade and defeat the group.\n\nAccording to him, the implication of government\u2019s \u201chope\u201d for rehabilitating repentant insurgents on families of slain soldiers, especially widows and victims of the insurgency, should be viewed from the perspective that many of these people, particularly the civilians, were also victims of the violence perpetrated by Boko Haram.\n\nSamuel added, \u201cThis is especially true considering that most of them were abducted and kept against their wish. About fighters\u2019 rehabilitation, there\u2019s the government\u2019s Operation Safe Corridor programme that seeks to deradicalise, rehabilitate and reintegrate low-ranking members of Boko Haram who seek a way out of the group. However, in order to maximise the current disengagement, government needs to really understand the dynamics behind the disengagement, especially the reasons behind fighters\u2019 surrendering. Many of them are surrendering to the military to avoid ISWAP\u2019s attack against them for their refusal to join the faction.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn his part, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Ifedayo Adedipe, described the tardiness in settling the insurance claims and other entitlements to the widows as a disgrace.\n\nHe said the government needed not to be told to fast-track the processing and ensure payment of the life insurance claims in view of the sacrifices made by the fallen soldiers while serving the nation.\n\nAdedipe said, \u201cThe attitude of the government to the plight of widows is a disgrace; the slain soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice for the interest of the country. A government that cares, that should not be open to debate or negotiations; it should be first line charges for them. But in a country where people spray currencies at parties not to be able to pay widows\u2019 entitlements speaks volumes.

          "text": "Some widows of soldiers in the over decade-old insurgency have condemned the proposed reintegration of repentant Boko Haram insurgents into society, describing the move as unjust.\n\nOver 1,000 Boko Haram fighters had handed themselves over to army units in recent weeks in the southern Borno towns of Konduga, Bama, and Mafa. Both the Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed Mohammed, among others had defended the ex-fighters\u2019 decision, noting that calls for the prosecution and killing of the repentant insurgents rather than granting them amnesty was against global best practices.\n\nThe widows, who also decried the non-payment of their husbands\u2019 life insurance claims by the Ministry of Defence years after their demise, spoke to Saturday PUNCH in separate interviews on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of their matter.\n\nSaturday PUNCH in May 2021 exclusively reported on the plights of the widows whose husbands were mostly officers. But the life insurance claims had yet to be paid since then.\n\nOne of the widows, whose husband was killed by Boko Haram insurgents on August 7, 2014 in Borno, said her in-laws thought she had been paid her late husband\u2019s life insurance claim.\n\nShe said, \u201cAfter my husband\u2019s death, I was asked to leave the barracks. I have been paying house rent and other bills outside the barracks for two years which is another difficult thing. This situation makes me shed tears. I feel really sad with this development. Boko Haram made me a widow in my early 30s, because my husband fought for Nigeria. He died and the country abandoned us. Reintegrating repentant Boko Haram fighters into society or granting them amnesty is akin to telling them, \u2018Well done.\u2019\n\n\u201cI hear that in the camp where some of the surrendered insurgents are, they take care for them well yet widows and children of fallen soldiers are not assisted or taken care of. This is not fair to the patriotic zeal of my husband who gave his best to Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnother widow whose husband was killed in December 2014 in Gombe State by insurgents said apart from the non-payment of her husband\u2019s life insurance claim, scholarships promised their children by the army weren\u2019t granted.\n\nShe stated amid tears, \u201cSome of us took our children for documentation since last year and nothing has been heard. An entire session has ended and another starting in September. The scholarship is supposed to be paid to a late officer\u2019s ward from age six. The money (about N70, 000) cannot even pay a term fees in most schools, we still need to add money to it and for those already in the scheme, payment is not consistent. Our husband wasted their lives. It\u2019s not fair to be planning to reintegrate into society those who killed our husband who were loyal to the country in their fight for its peace. We feel cheated. The officers just wasted their lives and diverse thoughts keep coming to my mind. This is too much for us to bear.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso speaking, a widow whose husband was a member of 50th regular course Nigerian Defence Academy said he was killed by insurgents on December 17, 2014 in Adamawa State.\n\nShe stated, \u201cHe was posted to Military Secretary from the war zone but was unable to resume before his demise. My husband was an infantry man to the core. He was a member of the Special Forces unit. He was always ready to serve. He was an outstanding officer. His death is something I have yet to recover from. Together we have three lovely kids. It\u2019s so disappointing that all his benefits have not been paid after serving the army diligently for 11 years.\n\n\u201cThe group life assurance beneficiaries from 2010/2015 have not been paid due to reasons we don\u2019t know. Many of us are not working. We depend on our husband\u2019s benefits to take care of our kids. We\u2019ve had cases of widows committing suicide and doing odd jobs to survive. We don\u2019t want to beg on the street. We are gradually losing our lives and some of us are sinking into depression but yet same people that turned us to widows are being forgiven and added back to society like nothing ever happened. They forget the pains they caused our families. It\u2019s unfair to us.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe urged the army and the defence military to pay their husbands\u2019 life insurance claims to help them forge ahead financially.\n\nAlso, widow of a soldier killed by Boko Haram insurgents during Operation Zama Lafia in Maiduguri, Borno State, on March 7, 2015, said she was always sad whenever she remembered her late husband.\n\nShe said her sorrow was worsened by the consideration given to the fighters who killed her husband by the Federal Government.\n\nThe widow who was visibly sad stated, \u201cWhenever I remember my late husband, I crying hard as there is nobody to help me and the children. My in-laws are not also assisting us. The Federal Government is supposed to take good care of the widows because our husbands fought hard to ensure peace in Nigeria. But their patriotism is being ridiculed by integrating those who killed them into society. I am too unhappy to behold this. I am appealing to them to pay our husbands\u2019 life insurance claims. After six years that my husband died at the battleground, nothing has been done for us. We have nowhere to go and no one to run to.\u2019\u2019\n\nReacting to the development, Mohammed Abdulkadri, media aide to the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi (retd.), explained that the Federal Government was still working to facilitate payment of insurance claims to the widows of military men, noting that it would be done as soon as all necessary processes were concluded.\n\n\u201cWe are still working on the insurance claims; everything is being done to fast-track the payment,\u2019\u2019 Abdulkadri stated.\n\nCommenting on the matter, researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, Regional Office for West Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, Abuja, Malik Samuel, stated that people formerly associated with Boko Haram were surrendering to security forces led by the military, both in Nigeria and Cameroon since the death of long-term JAS leader, Abubakar Shekau, in May this year.\n\nHe noted that the government saw the action of the repentant insurgents as a vital step to degrade and defeat the group.\n\nAccording to him, the implication of government\u2019s \u201chope\u201d for rehabilitating repentant insurgents on families of slain soldiers, especially widows and victims of the insurgency, should be viewed from the perspective that many of these people, particularly the civilians, were also victims of the violence perpetrated by Boko Haram.\n\nSamuel added, \u201cThis is especially true considering that most of them were abducted and kept against their wish. About fighters\u2019 rehabilitation, there\u2019s the government\u2019s Operation Safe Corridor programme that seeks to deradicalise, rehabilitate and reintegrate low-ranking members of Boko Haram who seek a way out of the group. However, in order to maximise the current disengagement, government needs to really understand the dynamics behind the disengagement, especially the reasons behind fighters\u2019 surrendering. Many of them are surrendering to the military to avoid ISWAP\u2019s attack against them for their refusal to join the faction.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn his part, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr Ifedayo Adedipe, described the tardiness in settling the insurance claims and other entitlements to the widows as a disgrace.\n\nHe said the government needed not to be told to fast-track the processing and ensure payment of the life insurance claims in view of the sacrifices made by the fallen soldiers while serving the nation.\n\nAdedipe said, \u201cThe attitude of the government to the plight of widows is a disgrace; the slain soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice for the interest of the country. A government that cares, that should not be open to debate or negotiations; it should be first line charges for them. But in a country where people spray currencies at parties not to be able to pay widows\u2019 entitlements speaks volumes. It is scandalous, to say the least.\u2019\u2019 Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Senator Teslim Kolawole Folarin, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Local Content, has urged for the decentralization of the country\u2019s security architecture.\n\nThis, according to Folarin, is necessary in order to put an end to the country\u2019s escalating cases of kidnapping, banditry, armed robberies, and other criminal activity.\n\nOn Friday, Folarin, who represents Oyo Central senatorial district in the National Assembly, made the revelation while presenting the University of Ibadan Alumni Association, Oyo State branch\u2019s 2021 alumni lecture.\n\nPresent at the lecture entitled \u201cThe challenges of governance and security in Nigeria\u201d were a member of House of Representatives, Akin Alabi, former President, Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII), Chief Adebayo Oyero, Chief Adegboyega Adegoke and Chief Lowo Obisesan among others.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the All Progressives Congress (APC) lawmaker studied political science at the institution.\n\nThe former Senate leader, who admitted that the statistics of insecurity was rising in geometric proportions, advised the present administration to decentralise the security architecture in the country so as to effectively police the country.\n\nHe added that continuous deteriorating security situation had affected the socio-economic and political development of the country.\n\nHe maintained that there was no way security agents can effectively tackle the security challenges in the country if the security architecture was not decentralised.\n\nFolarin insisted that it will be difficult for a police officer from Awka in Anambra State to effectively police Oja Igbo area of Ibadan because he does not know the terrain.\n\nHe spoke further by saying that the social media had compounded security challenges in the country, though it has an advantage of quick and wide dissemination of information.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we should give more thought to the need to decentralise the security architecture of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that the statistics of insecurity is rising in great and geometric proportions. We are all witnessing the negative effects of insecurity in the land.\n\n\u201cThese include incidents and cases of kidnapping, armed robberies, violence and other acts of insurrection.\n\n\u201cThere is no way a police officer from Awka in Ananbra can come to Oja Igbo in Ibadan and effectively police the area. He does not know the terrain. So, there is a need to decentralise the security architecture in the country.\n\n\u201cWe must emphasize the fact that the social media has compounded the challenges of security and governance in the country. What do I mean?\n\n\u201cThe new media has the advantage of quick and wide disemination of information, but the new media is also notorious for the spread of half-truths and fake news which can pose greater in the mind nation,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Katsina Chapter has distanced itself from the recent unguarded outburst credited to its National Scribe, Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe Chairman of the Katsina State, Miyetti Allah, Alh. Hassan Kuraye, condemned the unguided utterances about Governor Masari by their National Secretary, would necessitate the National Chairman and executive members to visit Katsina to seek for Governor\u2019s forgiveness over the derogatory remarks.\n\nAt a press briefing held at the NUJ Secretariat on Friday, the state chairman condemned the unguarded derogatory statement of the National Secretary, saying it does not in any way reflect the view of the association at both the national and state chapter.\n\n\u201cWe request to have your indulgence this morning to make some issues clear as far as the relationship between Miyetti Allah Hore and the Katsina Government is concerned.\n\n\u201cOne of us, the national secretary of Miyetti Allah, cattle Hore, Alhassan Saleh, made some negative utterances against His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, which were found so heavy to the entire Fulani race across the landscape of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe National Secretariat of Miyetti Allah Hore has already distanced itself from those negative utterances made by Alhassan Saleh, and we felt it is imperative for us as the state chapter of the Miyetti Allah Hore to align ourselves with the National Secretariat of our noble union and distance ourselves equally.\n\n\u201cAs such, we felt it will be important for us to make ourselves clear on those utterances. He made the utterances on his own,, and he is standing alone as far as we are concerned.\n\n\u201cHe has shown some signs of remorse when he was contacted by the national chairman,\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with the Executive Governor of Katsina State, Rt. Hon. Aminu Bello Masari, please forgive and forget those utterances because we are law-abiding citizens of this country. Miyetti Allah cattle Hore is a registered and law-abiding association.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman of Miyetti Allah Hore is coming to Katsina personally with his Executives to plead with His Excellency to forgive and forget those negative utterances for us to continue to forge ahead, to continue to make some progress.\n\n\u201cWe cannot complete this press briefing without noticing some contribution made by His Excellency. Already you are aware that there\u2019s a standing committee for the relationship between herders and farmers in Katsina State, which is making a very comprehensive and very successful negotiation with the farmers where we have some cattle routes being encroached, and already they have been demarcated by the standing committee with the support of Katsina State Government.\n\nIn a nutshell, we are here to say that the utterances made by our national secretary are not good.\n\nAt least by the age of His Excellency and the position he is occupying, he deserves some respect so that the successes we have been recording, from the inception of this administration will continue to thrive.\n\nRecalled Alhassan Saleh recently granted an interview to Sahara Reporters to elicit his reactions on a recent interview Governor Masari granted to Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today\u2019 programme where the Governor stated that many of the bandits terrorizing the North are from Fulani extraction involved in cattle rearing,\n\nIn his response, Saleh painted the Katsina Governor in derogatory terms for daring to label the Fulani as being primarily responsible for banditry in the North.\n\nThe National Secretary, while urging Nigerians to ignore Masari\u2019s statement, throwing caution into the air, described Governor Masari as a confused drunkard.\n\n\u201cDid you take that drunkard serious? My governor, do you take him seriously? Can\u2019t you see that he is already tired?

          "text": "Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu has said the comprehensive approach to resolving current Nigeria\u2019s challenges is through confronting adult illiteracy and paying attention to out of school children.\n\nDisclosing this at the 2021 International Literacy Day, ILD, held in Abuja on Tuesday, Adamu said the Nigerian government is determined to confront the adult literacy programmes with the same zeal it is handling out of school children.\n\nHe said developing, sustaining and enhancing literacy skills is a lifelong and community-wide endeavour, requiring a strong commitment from the society as a whole.\n\nThe Minister said Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 calls on countries to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\u2019. Specifically, SDG Target 4.6 requires that by 2030, member states should ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, it is estimated that over 6.9 million children are out of school.\n\nThis is in addition to the estimated 38% of non literate adult Population. Investing in Education of the parents will have ripple effect on the reduction of out of school Children.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that non-literate parents are more likely to breed out of school children, thereby compounding the phenomenon facing our nation today,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile flagging off the national activities to commemorate the 2021\n\nInternational Literacy Day, Adamu urged all stakeholders, including the journalists, to make a difference by complementing government\u2019s efforts in the fight against illiteracy in our various schedules, homes, families and immediate communities.\n\nAdamu commended Director General of United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation,UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay and her staff for their continued support in coordinating wide-ranging technical and financial assistance of the UN system, donor countries and the private sector, in country-level implementation of initiatives and programmes aimed at reducing the scourge of illiteracy worldwide.\n\nAlso, speaking the UNESCO Representative, Mammadou Lamine Sow said the COVID-19 pandemic has been the worst disturbance to education and training systems in a century, with the longest school closures affecting more than 1.6 billion learners at its peak time.\n\nHe quoted the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) by November 2020, which said the average child had lost 54 percent of a year\u2019s contact time, which could be interpreted as the loss of over a year\u2019s learning if the time of forgetting what was previously acquired is counted.\n\nHe said \u201cthe COVID-19 crisis has confirmed the fragility of many youth and adult literacy programmes, systems and policies as represented by the abrupt suspension of numerous programmes. Consequently, we need to reflect on what action can be taken to achieve SDG 4, target 6 by \u201censuring that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy\u201d by 2030.\u201d\n\nSow said the current shift to digital teaching and learning has further widened the inequalities to the detriment of the non-formal education sub-sector.\n\nThis shift, according to him, has also highlighted the persistent digital divide in terms of connectivity, infrastructure, and the ability to engage with technology.",

It\u2019s that at our most vulnerable, in the push and pull of all that makes us human, in the battle for the soul of America, unity is our greatest strength,\u201d Biden said in a six-minute message from the White House.\n\nAt New York\u2019s Ground Zero, where two pools of water now stand where the Twin Towers used to, relatives will read out the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed, in a four-hour-long service starting at 8:30 am (1230 GMT).\n\nSix moments of silence will be observed, corresponding with the times the two World Trade Center towers were struck, and fell, and the moments the Pentagon was attacked and Flight 93 crashed.\n\nMonica Iken-Murphy, who lost her 37-year-old husband Michael Iken in the World Trade Center, says this will be a \u201cheightened\u201d anniversary for many Americans.\n\nBut for her, as for many other survivors, the pain has never wavered.\n\n\u201cI feel like it just happened,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nA whole generation has grown up since the morning of September 11, 2001.\n\nIn the interim, Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden has been hunted down and killed. A towering new skyscraper has risen over Manhattan, replacing the Twin Towers. And less than two weeks ago, the last US soldiers flew from Kabul airport, ending the so-called \u201cforever war.\u201d\n\nBut the Taliban who once sheltered bin Laden are back ruling Afghanistan, the mighty US military humiliated. In Guantanamo Bay, accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men continue to await trial, nine years after charges were filed.\n\nEven the full story of how the attack came to happen remains secret. Only last week did Biden order the release of classified documents from the FBI investigation over the next six months.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Honor and memorialise\u2019 \u2013\n\nAt Ground Zero, 2,753 people, from all over the world, were killed in the initial explosions, jumped to their deaths, or simply vanished in the inferno of the collapsing towers.\n\nAt the Pentagon, an airliner tore a fiery hole in the side of the superpower\u2019s military nerve center, killing 184 people in the plane and on the ground.\n\nAnd in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the third wave of hijackers crashed into a field after passengers fought back, sending United 93 down before reaching its intended target \u2014 likely the US Capitol building in Washington.\n\nBiden and First Lady Jill Biden will stop at each of these places on Saturday to \u201chonor and memorialize the lives lost,\u201d the White House said.\n\nIn his video address Friday night, Biden urged Americans to come together as they reflect on the tragedy.\n\n\u201cUnity doesn\u2019t mean we have to believe the same thing, but we must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other and in this nation,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe president had planned for this to be a pivotal day in his nearly eight-month-old presidency.\n\nHowever, instead of presiding over a moment of unity, Biden will traverse a country angry about the messy Kabul evacuation, which included 13 US soldiers killed by a suicide bomber, and stung by the broader realization of failure and defeat.\n\nFor the relatives of victims, the anniversary, as always, is about keeping the memory of their loved ones alive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Pearl Harbor,\u201d said Frank Siller, whose firefighter brother Stephen died at the World Trade Center.\n\n\u201cPeople who weren\u2019t alive don\u2019t have the same feeling about it as those who were alive.

Let me speak directly to the striking doctors; embarking on industrial action at this time when Nigerians need you most is not the best action to take, no matter the grievances,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President said the outstanding issue of an establishment circular issued by the Head of Service, removing house officers, NYSC doctors from the scheme of service had an addendum circular from the National Salaries and Wages Commission to clarify that they would continue to earn the wages attached to them on their present wage structure.\n\nHe requested that the agreement reached in the meetings held on August 20 and 21 and captured in the MOU which he saw be religiously implemented.\n\n\u2018More Challenges Ahead\u2019\n\nTo further improve the health sector, President Buhari said budgetary allocations had been increased and a Health Sector Reform Committee led by the Vice President had been commissioned to identify and address weaknesses in the health system and align with global best practices that raise public confidence.\n\nAccording to him, the government is also supporting initiatives to expand health insurance coverage and bring more resources to health financing.\n\n\u201cWe have many more challenges ahead and much more to do, for our large population. In this respect, it is important to remind you that, as senior medical personnel and representatives of one of the most respected professional groups in the world, your responsibility for the health and wellbeing of Nigerians is clear,\u201d the President told the NMA leaders.\n\n\u201cIt does not end only with the welfare of your members but continues with a sense of responsibility for the entire country and its socio-political health and national stability. The global economy has been seriously affected by the pandemic, and despite recent pleasing news of more than five per cent economic growth of Nigeria in the last quarter, we are still having fiscal challenges to deal with, like most other countries.\n\n\u201cThe source of revenue that Nigeria has depended on for so long experienced global decline, our population is rising fast and the tension arising from both is fuelling agitation among our youth. Organisations like the NMA could play a very useful moderating role in society.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari commended the positive role of the NMA as the apex professional medical association in Nigeria, especially with regard to the ongoing industrial action.\n\nIn his remarks, NMA President, Professor Innocent Ujah, thanked the President for the appointment of members into strategic positions in government, assent to the Medical Residency Act, and immunisation coverage.\n\nHe said the association was concerned with the strike by doctors and had been doing its best to alleviate the suffering of patients across the country while appealing for an urgent resolution.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, who was also present at the meeting, said the NMA had been playing a critical role in the development of the health sector, particularly in tackling pandemics, participating in policy formulation, and population health.",

          "text": "The Appeal Court sitting in Abuja has ordered all parties to maintain the status quo and refrain from taking action that would give effect to the judgement of a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt that allowed the Rivers State government to collect Value Added Tax (VAT), pending the hearing and determination of the instant suit.\n\nA three-man panel of the appellate court led by Justice Haruna Tsammani gave the order on Friday while ruling on an appeal filed by the Federal Internal Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\nThe order of the appellate court is the latest development in the series of legal tussles over whose responsibility it is to collect VAT.\n\nAlthough the FIRS has taken up the responsibility over the years, the Rivers State government tested the legality recently, and it was worth the move.\n\nREAD ALSO: Lagos Applies To Be Co-Respondent In Appeal Filed By FIRS\n\nOn August 19, Governor Nyesom Wike assented to the Valued Added Tax Law, 2021 along with four others following their passage by the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nHis action was sequel to the judgement delivered by Justice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court in the state capital who held that states should collect VAT, and not the Federal Government.\n\nDispleased with the decision of the court, the FIRS filed a motion on notice to apply for a stay of execution on the earlier judgement delivered by Justice Pam.\n\nBut the court said refused the application, saying the federal agency failed to file an application to set aside the tax law recently enacted by the Rivers State House of Assembly.\n\nJustice Pam, therefore, stated that the state law on VAT was valid and subsisting.\n\nThe FIRS later approached the Court of Appeal in Abuja with a civil motion seeking a stay of the execution of the judgement earlier granted by the court in Rivers pending the determination of the case.\n\nLagos Backs Rivers\n\nAs the legal battle continues, the action of the Rivers State government received the support of some states, especially Lagos where the government is close to making it a law to collect TAX, instead of the FIRS.\n\nOn Thursday, the bill seeking to empower Lagos to collect VAT was read for the third time and passed by lawmakers in the Lagos State House of Assembly. As it awaits the governor\u2019s assent, more states have indicated to follow in the part.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State government has applied to be joined as a co-respondent to the suit filed by the FIRS at the appeal court.\n\nThe Attorney General of the State and Commissioner of Justice, Moyesore Onigbanjo, represented the state government at Friday\u2019s hearing.\n\nHe informed the court that the interest of the state was at stake, stressing that if they were not joined, it would amount to a breach of a fair hearing.\n\nOnigbanjo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), urged the court to take the application for the joinder first before the application for the stay of execution filed by the FIRS.\n\nBut counsel to the federal agency, Mahmud Magaji (SAN), urged the court to hear the main application first, as it was of utmost priority.\n\nThe appellate court, in its ruling, held that the motion of joinder by the Lagos State government be heard and gave the applicants two days to file their written addresses.\n\nSimilarly, the respondents have been given two days to file their response, while the applicants were given a day to reply on the point of law.",

          "text": "At least 20 people have been killed in fighting between militias and Myanmar\u2019s security forces, according to witnesses and Myanmar media, in the worst violence since opponents of the military government called this week for a \u201cpeople\u2019s defensive war\u201d.\n\nThe latest violence comes as activists and anti-military forces urged the international community on Saturday to take action, saying the lack of any \u201cmeaningful outside intervention\u201d has led to the armed resistance.\n\n\u201cThe young people of Myanmar [have] no choice but to fight back with what they have,\u201d the Civil Disobedience Movement said in a statement early on Saturday, as it called on the United Nations and representatives of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to \u201cdirectly engage\u201d with the opposition National Unity Government (NUG).\n\nAhead of a UN General Assembly meeting to decide who represents Myanmar as a special envoy, opposition forces are also launching a campaign this weekend to press for the recognition of the NUG as the legitimate government representative.\n\nThe NUG, formed to resist the army\u2019s February 1 takeover, had earlier called for a revolt against the military rule, in an apparent effort to coordinate groups fighting the army and convince soldiers and state officials to switch sides.\n\nMyanmar has been in turmoil since the overthrow of Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government, which ended a decade of tentative democracy and sparked nationwide anger, strikes and protests, and saw the emergence of militia groups that have attacked security forces.\n\nAccording to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors the human rights situation in Myanmar, at least 1,058 people have already been killed since the uprising against the military began. More than 6,300 others are currently in detention.\n\nMore arrests were reported on Saturday morning across the country, including in the country\u2019s largest city of Yangon and in Sagaing Region.\n\nFighting since Thursday between the military and defence volunteers allied with the unity government in Myin Thar village resulted in casualties among local militias and villagers as troops used heavy artillery, according to media and a witness.\n\n\u201cThey fired artillery, they burned down houses in our village,\u201d said a resident, 42, who added that three children as well as his 17-year-old son, a member of the militia, were among 20 people killed.\n\n\u201cI lost all I have \u2026 I will not forgive them until the end of the world,\u201d he told Reuters news agency by phone, adding he struggled to recognise his son\u2019s body.\n\nSocial media posts on Friday and Saturday also paid tribute to the people killed, including young men who appeared to be minors.\n\nBBC Burmese said on Friday that 10 people were killed in Myin Thar in the Magway Region of central Myanmar, while the Irrawaddy news website reported 17 casualties, among them minors.\n\nMilitary spokesman Zaw Min Tun confirmed fighting took place in Magway, according to Irrawaddy. The spokesman did not answer Reuters calls seeking comment.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s neighbours urged restraint from all sides following Tuesday\u2019s call for nationwide retaliation by the shadow government.\n\nSome analysts have warned the move could backfire and complicate the opposition\u2019s efforts to win international support. But the opposition said the lack of international support has prompted activists and other people to take the matter into their hands.\n\nIrrawaddy also reported the killing of three soldiers in the biggest city, Yangon, on Thursday.\n\nClashes erupted on Thursday and continued late on Friday in Thantlang in Chin State, bordering India, news reports also said.\n\nRadio Free Asia and Mizzima news service said the military conducted air raids. There were no immediate reports of casualties.\n\nThe NUG\u2019s defence minister did not respond to a request for confirmation of the incidents on Thursday and Friday.\n\nReuters could not verify the reports of clashes, which state-run MRTV made no mention of in its nightly news bulletin.\n\nThe military tightly controls information and state media outlets have been selective in reporting unrest.\n\nOn Tuesday, about a dozen military-owned communications towers were destroyed. The same day, a shadow government working to reverse the coup called for a \u201cpeople\u2019s defensive war against the junta\u201d.",

I\u2019m going to put my heart and my soul and my body and my head into that one,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\n\u201cI am going to treat the next match like it is the last match in my career.\u201d\n\nIn fourth seed Zverev, Djokovic came up against a player who six weeks ago ended his hopes of another slice of history, the \u2018Golden Slam\u2019, by beating him at the Olympics.\n\nThe 34-year-old must have feared a repeat when he double-faulted to hand Zverev the chance to serve for the opening set. His opponent obliged despite double-faulting himself on his first set point.\n\nEarly in the second the roles were reversed, Zverev missing a straightforward forehand and following up with a double fault as Djokovic broke and then cantered through the set to level.\n\nZverev was frustrated at not being able to convert a break in the opening game of the third and again missed a chance at 2-2, only to later present Djokovic with three set points.\n\nHe saved two, the second in a remarkable 53-shot rally, but Djokovic smashed away the third at the net to take the lead and celebrated by rousing the crowd with his arms aloft.\n\nZverev again engineered break points at 1-1 in the fourth set and this time zipped a forehand winner beyond his opponent as he held on to that advantage to force a decider.\n\nIt was Djokovic who found the breakthrough in Zverev\u2019s opening service game in the fifth set and the Serb\u2019s enduring class showed through as he raced into a 5-0 lead.\n\nZverev, who at 24 is 10 years Djokovic\u2019s junior, got on the board and then clawed back one break to keep the semi-final alive, much to the New York crowd\u2019s delight.\n\nThe three-time US Open champion hit straight back to bring up match point on Zverev\u2019s serve and sealed his place in the final when his opponent found the net after three hours and 33 minutes of tennis.\n\n\u201cThank you, the atmosphere was amazing \u2013 the best atmosphere of the tournament so far,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\n\u201cThese are the moments we live for, the unique opportunities we dream of every day when we wake up and are trying to find the motivation to go out and do the same things over again.\u201d\n\nThis absorbing match boasted a 53-shot rally and was watched in the Arthur Ashe Stadium by Rod Laver \u2013 the man whose achievement Djokovic will try to emulate on Sunday.\n\nNot always at his best from the baseline, Djokovic qualified for a record-equalling 31st Grand Slam final with exceptional serving and trademark mental resilience.\n\nHe then promised to play Sunday\u2019s final as if it were the final match of his career.\n\nThe world number one has spent five and a half hours longer on court than Medvedev thus far. A hot and humid climax is forecast for Sunday, and with the pressure of chasing history, the 28th and final hurdle could yet be the hardest to clear.\n\nMedvedev will contest his third Grand Slam final on Sunday, having lost the 2019 final at Flushing Meadows to Rafael Nadal and the Australian Open final to Djokovic in February.\n\nThe 25-year-old, who has won titles on the hard courts in Marseille and Toronto this year, conceded his only set of the tournament during his four-set win over Dutch qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in the previous round, during a largely trouble-free run to the final.\n\nMedvedev ominously broke to love in the seventh game of the opening set against Auger-Aliassime, choosing his moment to apply pressure and put his 21-year-old opponent on the back foot.\n\nThe second set proved far trickier for the Russian, as Auger-Aliassime \u2013 contesting his first Grand Slam semi-final \u2013 clinched a second break-point opportunity before holding serve to lead 5-2.\n\nThe set \u2013 and a chance for the Canadian to level the match \u2013 unravelled from there.\n\nTwice unable to convert at set point, Auger-Aliassime was punished by Medvedev, who broke back and rattled through four successive games to abruptly end his opponent\u2019s momentum and take a two-set lead.\n\nAfter an opening hold of serve in the third set, the 12th seed\u2019s challenge capitulated as the world number two claimed another double break to cruise into a 5-1 advantage before wrapping up another commanding victory on serve.",

          "text": "Emma Raducanu will seek to become the first British woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in 44 years when she takes on fellow teenager Leylah Fernandez in an unlikely US Open final between two players who have lit up New York.\n\nA final between the world numbers 150 and 73 was never predicted, nor should it even be as thrilling a prospect as it is, but this US Open \u2013 and these two players \u2013 have defied expectations at every turn.\n\nRaducanu\u2019s story is the stuff of dreams \u2013 ranked too low to make the main draw, the 18-year-old had to come through three rounds of qualifying and has become the first qualifier to reach a major final.\n\nAnd she did all that without dropping a set.\n\nFernandez, 19, has brushed aside a series of leading players \u2013 taking out defending champion Naomi Osaka, fifth seed Elina Svitolina, world number two Aryna Sabalenka and three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber.\n\nTheir different paths and contrasting styles \u2013 but similarly fearless approach \u2013 have set up the first Grand Slam final between teenagers since the 1999 US Open when Serena Williams beat Martina Hingis.\n\nA maiden major beckons for one of them but regardless of whose name is etched onto the trophy, they have both shown there is a bright future for tennis at a time when fans were wondering who might fill the void when the sport\u2019s biggest names eventually retire.\n\nRaducanu\u2019s exploits have drawn praise from royalty, politicians and rock stars, as well as pundits and fans.\n\nIf she finally ends the country\u2019s wait for a first female Grand Slam singles champion since Virginia Wade\u2019s 1977 Wimbledon triumph, someone might have to invent some new superlatives as they have all been used to describe her already.\n\nWhat has been impressive is that not only is she 18, but she has clinically beaten much more experienced players such as Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and 17th seed Maria Sakkari with a fearless game that shows great variety, as well as the intelligence to change tactics on the spot.\n\nAnd then there is that smile.\n\nSo relaxed has she appeared at times that she has managed to beam between points, and the mega-watt grin that has lit up the Arthur Ashe Stadium after converting match points has won over local fans as well as those back home.\n\nShe has already achieved so much in just three months, reaching the last 16 at Wimbledon on her Grand Slam debut, rising from 338 in the rankings to just outside the top 30 when they are next published on Monday, and she will also become British number one.\n\n\u201cWhen you see that kind of talent, that won\u2019t be denied,\u201d 18-time Grand Slam singles champion Martina Navratilova said.\n\n\u201cShe is almost like the finished product, when she is just getting started.\u201d\n\nBritish fans will be relieved the final is at a much more palatable time of 21:00 BST, with many having set their alarms for the middle of the night when she played her semi-final.\n\n\u201cThe whole country will be cheering you on in the final,\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted.\n\nOf course Fernandez, who is just two months older than Raducanu and turned 19 this week, has been living her own dream at Flushing Meadows.\n\nShe, too, has been showered with congratulations, and among the messages from the prime minister and top sports people, there was this bit of advice from Canadian ice hockey captain Marie-Philip Poulin: \u201cMake sure to have that maple syrup before the final!\u201d\n\nFernandez\u2019s matches have been stickier affairs than Raducanu\u2019s, with four of her six matches going to three sets and featuring five tie-breaks. The Briton, by contrast, has not dropped a set or faced even a tie-break.\n\nBut Fernandez\u2019s opponents have been bigger names and her demeanour on court is also different to Raducanu\u2019s.\n\nThe left-handed Canadian loves fist-pumping and revving the crowd up to get behind her, while Raducanu cuts a serene figure.\n\nThe pair, who were both born in Canada to immigrant parents, have grown up playing in the juniors together, facing each other in the second round of junior Wimbledon in 2018.\n\nRaducanu won that match 6-2 6-4. But so much has changed for both players since then that it cannot possibly be a gauge of what Saturday will bring.\n\nSuch is the attention that this match-up is attracting, Novak Djokovic\u2019s quest for a record 21st men\u2019s major and a calendar Grand Slam has been slightly overshadowed.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all just super hungry to make a difference in the tennis world,\u201d said Fernandez. \u201cWe\u2019ve always talked about and joked around that we\u2019re going to be in the WTA Tour and we\u2019re going to be on the big stage together.\n\n\u201cWe want to make a difference. We want to make an impact in tennis.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the result in the final, they have certainly done that already.",

          "title": "Nigeria: After 40-Day Standoff, Buhari Begs Striking Doctors to Return to Work",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday met with leaders of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) at the State House, Abuja, over the 40-day-old industrial action embarked upon by resident doctors in the country, and pleaded with them to return to work, saying the timing of the strike was wrong.\n\nAside from asking the health workers to return to their duty posts, the president urged others contemplating strikes to opt for settlement of issues through negotiation, \u201cno matter how long it takes.\u201d\n\nBuhari said: \u201cThe lives of citizens that could be lost or damaged when doctors withdraw services, are precious enough to worth opting for peaceful resolution of differences.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile hailing the intervention of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) to resolve issues surrounding the strike, the President also called on the resident doctors to see reason and return to work.\n\nThe President assured that all outstanding benefits owed medical doctors would be cleared, after verification, adding that embarking on industrial action at a critical health period for the country and citizens was not a good option.\n\nHe said: \u201cProtecting our citizens is not to be left to government alone, but taken as a collective responsibility, in which especially medical professionals play a critical role. Let me speak directly to the striking doctors. Embarking on industrial action at this time when Nigerians need you most is not the best action to take, no matter the grievances.\n\n\u201cThis Administration has a good track record of paying all debts owed to government workers, pensioners and contractors and we have even revisited debts left by past administrations, once due verification is done. Debts genuinely owed health workers will be settled.\n\n\u201cI learnt that some of the 12-point demands in the ongoing strike were already addressed. Though, the review of a new Hazard Allowance has not been fully negotiated because of the sharp and deep division within the ranks of the striking doctors.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari said the outstanding issue of an Establishment circular issued by the Head of Service, removing House Officers and NYSC doctors from scheme of service had an addendum circular from National Salaries and Wages Commission to clarify that they will continue to earn the wages attached to them on their present wage structure.\n\n\u201cI request that the agreement reached in the meetings of 20th and 21st August captured in the MOU which I have seen be religiously implemented,\u201d he added.\n\nTo further improve the health sector, the President said budgetary allocations had been increased and a Health Sector Reform Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Vice President, had been commissioned to identify and address weaknesses in the Health System and align with global best practices that raise public confidence.\n\n\u201cWe are also supporting initiatives to expand health insurance coverage and bring more resources to health financing. We have many more challenges ahead and much more to do, for our large population.\n\n\u201cIn this respect, it is important to remind you that, as senior medical personnel and representatives of one of the most respected professional groups in the world, your responsibility for the health and wellbeing of Nigerians is clear.\n\n\u201cIt does not end only with the welfare of your members, but continues with a sense of responsibility for the entire country and its sociopolitical health and national stability.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari noted that Nigeria\u2019s source of revenue over many years was dwindling, with a rising population.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe global economy has been seriously affected by the pandemic, and despite recent pleasing news of more than five per cent economic growth of Nigeria in the last quarter, we are still having fiscal challenges to deal with, like most other countries.\n\n\u201cThe source of revenue that Nigeria has depended on for so long experienced global decline, our population is rising fast and the tension arising from both is fueling agitation among our youth. Organisations like the NMA could play a very useful moderating role in society.\u201d\n\nThe President lauded the positive role the Nigeria Medical Association had been playing, as the apex professional medical association in Nigeria, especially with regard to the ongoing industrial action.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis is a befitting role for the NMA, as a mature organisation, led by responsible members with long experience.\n\n\u201cI am proud also to learn of various feats that have been achieved in our hospitals, like the separation of conjoined twins and also the valiant efforts of our health personnel in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, much of which has earned us recognition at home and abroad, and the recent appointment of one of your colleagues as Assistant Director General of the World Health Organisation. We again warmly congratulate Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu for his elevation.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said the NMA had been playing a critical role in the development of the health sector, particularly in tackling pandemics, participating in policy formulation and population health.\n\nEarlier in his speech, the NMA President, Prof. Innocent Ujah, thanked the President for appointment of members into strategic positions in government, assent to the Medical Residency Act and immunisation coverage.\n\nAccording to him, the association \u201cis concerned by the industrial action\u201d embarked upon by doctors, and had been doing its best to alleviate the suffering of patients across the country, while appealing for an urgent resolution.\n\nHe thanked President Buhari for providing takeoff grant for the Federal University of Health Sciences in Otukpo, Benue State, Azare, Bauchi State and Ila Orangun, Osun State while also suggesting an appropriate funding module for the new institutions.\n\nHe assured the President of the continuous support of members of the association to improve health in the country.\n\nThe meeting was also attended by the Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige, and Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora.",

          "text": "Twenty years ago, the 11th of September dawned as just a date. By midnight, it was 9/11, the staggering starting point for a new era of terror, war, politics, patriotism and tragedy.\n\nThe U.S. marks the milestone anniversary Saturday under the pall of a pandemic and in the shadow of a frantic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which fell to the same militant rulers who gave safe haven to the plotters of the 2001 attacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because you hoped that this would just be a different time and a different world. But sometimes history starts to repeat itself and not in the best of ways,\u201d said Thea Trinidad, who lost her father in the attacks and has signed up to read victims\u2019 names at the ceremony at ground zero in New York.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is scheduled to travel to all three attack sites: New York\u2019s World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn a video released Friday night, he mourned the ongoing losses of 9/11.\n\n\u201cChildren have grown up without parents, and parents have suffered without children,\u201d said Biden, a childhood friend of the father of a Sept. 11 victim, Davis Grier Sezna Jr.\n\nBut the president also spotlighted what he called the \u201ccentral lesson\u201d of Sept. 11: \u201cthat at our most vulnerable \u2026 unity is our greatest strength.\u201d\n\nFormer President George W. Bush, the nation\u2019s leader on 9/11, is due at the Pennsylvania memorial and his successor, Barack Obama, at ground zero. The only other post-9/11 U.S. president, Donald Trump, is planning to be in New York, in addition to providing commentary at a boxing match in Florida in the evening.\n\nOther observances \u2014 from a wreath-laying in Portland, Maine, to a fire engine parade in Guam \u2014 are planned across a country now full of 9/11 plaques, statues and commemorative gardens.\n\nUsing hijacked planes as missiles, the assailants inflicted the deadliest terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, taking nearly 3,000 lives, toppling the twin towers and ushering in an age of fear.\n\nSecurity was redefined, with changes to airport checkpoints, police practices and the government\u2019s surveillance powers. In the years that followed, virtually any sizeable explosion, crash or act of violence seemed to raise a dire question: \u201cIs it terrorism?\u201d Some ideological violence and plots did follow, though federal officials and the public have lately become increasingly concerned with threats from domestic extremists after years of focusing on international terror groups in the wake of 9/11.\n\nNew York faced questions early on about whether it could ever recover from the blow to its financial hub and restore a feeling of safety among the crowds and skyscrapers. New Yorkers ultimately rebuilt a more populous and prosperous city but had to reckon with the tactics of an empowered post-9/11 police department and a widened gap between haves and have-nots.\n\nA \u201cwar on terror\u201d led to invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the longest U.S. war ended last month with a hasty, massive airlift punctuated by a suicide bombing that killed 169 Afghans and 13 American service members and was attributed to a branch of the Islamic State extremist group. The U.S. is now concerned that al-Qaida, the terror network behind 9/11, may regroup in Afghanistan.\n\nTwo decades after helping to triage and treat injured colleagues at the Pentagon on Sept. 11, retired Army Col. Malcolm Bruce Westcott is saddened and frustrated by the continued threat of terrorism.\n\n\u201cI always felt that my generation, my military cohort, would take care of it \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t pass it on to anybody else,\u201d said Westcott, of Greensboro, Georgia. \u201cAnd we passed it on.\u201d\n\nFor Angelique Tung, who was at the trade center for a business meeting on 9/11 and escaped down 77 flights of stairs, the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan stirred empathy for troops who served there. Some now wonder whether their efforts and sacrifices made a difference, which makes Tung think of a question she has asked herself since surviving Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cI hope that, after 20 years, other people are asking that question: What good can come from this?\u201d said Tung, of Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\nSept. 11 propelled a surge of shared grief and common purpose, but it soon gave way.\n\nMuslim Americans endured suspicion, surveillance and hate crimes. The quest to understand the catastrophic toll of the terror attacks prompted changes in building design and emergency communications, but it also spurred conspiracy theories that seeded a culture of skepticism. Schisms and resentments grew over immigration, the balance between tolerance and vigilance, the meaning of patriotism, the proper way to honor the dead, and the scope of a promise to \u201cnever forget.\u201d\n\nTrinidad was 10 when she overheard her dad, Michael, saying goodbye to her mother by phone from the burning trade center. She remembers the pain but also the fellowship of the days that followed, when all of New York \u201cfelt like it was family.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, when I feel like the world is so divided, I just wish that we can go back to that,\u201d said Trinidad, of Orlando, Florida. \u201cI feel like it would have been such a different world if we had just been able to hang on to that feeling.\u201d",
