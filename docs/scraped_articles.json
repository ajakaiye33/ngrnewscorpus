          "title": "British PM walks out amid lawmakers\u2019 probe on Roman Abramovich\u2019s \u2018sanction\u2019",
          "text": "Boris Johnson awkwardly walked out of the House of Commons today as he was being asked to correct the record over claims about Roman Abramovich.\n\nThe prime minister had told MPs the Chelsea owner was \u2018already facing sanctions\u2019 as he discussed the financial penalties being imposed on Russia following their invasion of Ukraine.\n\nLabour former minister Chris Bryant later raised a point of order to ask about the accuracy of Mr Johnson\u2019s remarks.\n\nMr Bryant, speaking after the Prime Minister\u2019s statement to announce new sanctions following Russia\u2019s actions against Ukraine, said: \u2018I hope the Prime Minister could just stay for a brief moment. It relates to what he said about Roman Abramovich.\u2019\n\nAs Mr Johnson left the chamber, Mr Bryant said: \u2018I don\u2019t think that is a courtesy to the House when the Prime Minister leaves in that way.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018The Prime Minister said that Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned. As I understand it that has not happened.\n\n\u2018I am sure the Prime Minister was completely inadvertent in giving a false indication. But it would be helpful if the Prime Minister could correct the record\u2026 these are important moments of fact.\u2019\n\nCommons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle replied: \u2018I am not responsible for the answers that ministers give.\n\n\u2018But the Government frontbenches heard his point and if a correction is necessary, I am sure it will be forthcoming ASAP.\u2019\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman later said Mr Johnson \u2018misspoke\u2019 while an official indicted that No 10 is expected to correct the record, with the action being referred to said to have been the visa decision in the past.\n\nMr Abramovich had issues around his entrepreneurial visa in 2018.\n\nIn October 2021, the businessman\u2019s spokesperson confirmed he travelled to London as an Israeli citizen \u2013 therefore entering the United Kingdom without the need for a visa.\n\nLabour\u2019s Margaret Hodge had complained today of \u2018serious flaws\u2019 in the sanctions regime that meant individuals such as Abramovich and former Arsenal shareholder Alisher Usmanov could not be covered.\n\nJohnson was urged to use more \u2018clout\u2019 after announcing sanctions on five Russian banks and three \u2018cronies\u2019 of Vladimir Putin in the \u2018first barrage\u2019 of the Western response.\n\nThe PM lashed out at Mr Putin\u2019s aggression and dismissed his rambling justifications as \u2018absurd and even mystical\u2019 as he unveiled the measures in a statement to the House of Commons.\n\nWarning that Nato and its allies are ready to turn Russia into a \u2018pariah\u2019, he insisted there will be moves to prevent Russian businesses trading in dollars and pounds.\n\n\u2018Today, the UK is sanctioning the following five Russian banks: Rossiya, IS Bank, General Bank, Promsvyazbank, and the Black Sea Bank,\u2019 the premier told the House.\n\n\u2018And we are sanctioning three very high net worth individuals: Gennady Timchenko, Boris Rotenberg, and Igor Rotenberg.\u2019\n\nSuggesting that members of the Russian Duma could be among those to face action next, he added: \u2018Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the individuals concerned will be banned from travelling here and we will prohibit all UK individuals and entities from having any dealings with them.\u2019\n\nMr Johnson \u2018saluted\u2019 German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his \u2018brave\u2019 decision to pull the plug on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, and held out the prospect of sending more weapons to Kiev.\n\nHe also made clear he backs stopping the Champions League football final happening in St Petersburg this year.\n\nBut anti-Kremlin campaigner Bill Browder immediately voiced disappointment at the \u2018pretty tepid\u2019 response, pointing out the named oligarchs have been on the US sanctions list for several years.\n\nKeir Starmer urged the PM to go further, saying Russian businesses should be barred from using the Swift international finance messaging system and Moscow\u2019s RT channel should be prevented from broadcasting.\n\nTories lined up to appeal for Mr Johnson to get \u2018dirty\u2019 money out of the UK \u2018rouble by rouble\u2019, saying the West needs to \u2018hit hard\u2019 straight away. Foreign Affairs committee chair said the approach should be \u2018clout, don\u2019t dribble\u2019.\n\nMr Johnson told MPs: \u2018Now the UK and our allies will begin to impose the sanctions on Russia that we have already prepared using the new and unprecedented powers granted by this House to sanction Russian individuals and entities of strategic importance to the Kremlin.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018This the first tranche, the first barrage of what we are prepared to do and we hold further sanctions at readiness to be deployed.\u2019\n\nBoris Rotenberg is a former judo training partner of Mr Putin, who handed him rich control over gas and electricity concession in post-Communist Russia.\n\nHis nephew Igor became a billionaire after being handed a raft of investments by his father Arkady \u2013 who is currently fighting his ex-wife over ownership of a \u00a327 million mansion in Surrey. Timchenko, meanwhile, is the sixth richest man in Russia and an ice hockey fanatic.\n\nAs the three oligarchs have been on a US sanctions list since 2018, it is unlikely many UK businesses have dealings with them to avoid facing problems with any US interests.\n\nThe five banks named by Mr Johnson only have a small footprint in the UK \u2013 although the largest one, Promsvyazbank, did have ambitions to float on the London Stock Exchange a decade ago.\n\nOutside Parliament, Ms Truss tried to offer more reassurance that the sanctions package is merely the first step \u2013 heralding curbs on use of financial markets and Russian exports.\n\n\u2018We are prepared to go much further if Russia does not pull back from the brink,\u2019 she said. \u2018We will curtail the ability of the Russian state and Russian companies to raise funds in our markets, prohibit a range of high tech exports, and further isolate Russian banks from the global economy.\n\n\u2018These will be surgically targeted sanctions that will hit Russia hard.\u2019",

          "text": "The governor of Imo state, Hope Uzodinma, has accused the immediate past Director General of Progressives Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman of being a mole while he lasted as the DG PGF.\n\nUzodinma\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Oguwike Nwachuku, in a statement in Owerri, the state capital, on Tuesday, said that Lukman was being sponsored by Peoples Democratic Party to discredit the ruling party.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe former Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Mohammed Lukman has demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that he is a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) mole in the midst of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cLukman, who recently hurriedly resigned his appointment as DG of the PGF to avoid a pending sack over unbecoming demeanour has continued to run his mouth in ways that suggest that his sojourn in the midst of progressive politicians in APC was nothing but a design to spy on the Party in the interest of his co-conspirators in the opposition PDP.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, February 21, Lukman was credited by a section of media to have accused some respected APC Leaders, including Governors, of holding the Party captive and working with Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) against the February 26 Convention that has been postponed to March 26.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, we would have ignored Lukman if he did not have the misfortune of bringing the name of Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State into the picture of his thoughtless and careless statement.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, perhaps except for His Excellency Dapo Abiodun, three of them \u2013 His Excellency Mai Mala Buni, His Excellency Yahaya Bello and His Excellency Hope Uzodimma \u2013 are all aspiring to become Presidential or Vice-Presidential candidates,\u201d Lukman reportedly said.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that Lukman had been engaged by enemies of democracy to deliberately discredit respected APC Governors and Leaders like Uzodimma just because their selfish political permutations are not working out.\n\n\u201cEven when Governor Uzodimma, barely two weeks ago, came out to distance himself from any Presidential contest, Lukman would deliberately overlook that to make insinuaions that were borne out of hatred for Governor Uzodimma due to the latter\u2019s rising profile in APC and the trust his colleagues have reposed on him because of his many years of experience in politics and sincerity of purpose.\n\n\u201cOne would have thought that Lukman must have learnt his lesson by now given that he is still being haunted by the illogical spirit that led to his near sack in office recently. But how wrong can we possibly be!\n\n\u201cAs an aide to the body of Governors, Lukman probably saw himself in the mould of His Excellencies and would not humble himself to take directives from his bosses in the interest of their States in particular and the Country at large.\n\n\u201cHe was therefore, in good stead, issuing controversial statements that were not only antagonistic to the leadership of the Party he pretends to be part of but quite anti-thetical to the views of his bosses.\n\n\u201cFew weeks out of office, Lukman is behaving true to type \u2013 a mole planted amidst the APC top echelon to spy on them.\n\n\u201cWhy would Lukman\u2019s feeling about the postponement of the APC Convention be in sync with the feeling of the opposition politicians and the few APC members known for anti-party activities?\n\n\u201cRegardless of those Governors and CECPC Members Lukman was content discrediting, could it have been possible to move the date of the Convention without the buy-in of the leader of the Party, President Muhammadu Buhari?\n\n\u201cThe point is that Lukman deserves our pity. He has lost touch with the current reality in politics and except he retraces his steps by committing whole-heartedly to the supremacy of the Party encapsulated in the power invested in the leadership, it would be difficult for him to deny he is not a mole in APC.\u201d\n\nSeveral calls put to Lukman was unanswered. He had yet to respond to a text message as of the time of filing this report.",

          "text": "\u2026Seeks public apology; says project making steady progress\n\nSoni Daniel, Abuja\n\nThe Department of State Services has punctured allegations by a non-governmental organisations, known as TrackaNG-BudgIT that it diverted huge cash meant for the construction of its Counter Terrorism Centre in Bauchi and merely flaunted a dilapidated nomadic primary school in place of the centre.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement in Abuja, DSS Spokesman, Dr. Peter Afunanya, mocked the NGO for not getting its facts right before rushing to level allegations of fruad against the security agency, pointing out that the money released by the Federal government foe the CTC in Bauchi had been judiciously used to construct appropriate buildings at Gubi Dam, Bauchi State.\n\nThe DSS statement made available to Vanguard on Tuesday night said: \u201cOn 19th February, 2022, Tracka on its social media platforms, particularly Facebook and Twitter, posted that the construction of DSS Counter-Terrorism Training Centre, Gubi Dam, Bauchi State allegedly valued at N1.1 Billion in 2021 FG budget was \u201cnot done\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt added that it \u201cvisited the site and discovered they only renovated a primary school and mosque adjacent to the site\u201d. Tracka made other unsubstantiated and wild claims as part of its findings.\n\n\u201cTo set the records straight, the DSS outrightly dismisses Tracka\u2019s unfounded claims. It further expresses dismay at the shoddy way Tracka embarked on its project verification exercise as well as the manner it drew conclusions without the slightest efforts to be diligent.\n\n\u201cDSS\u2019 findings have shown that the Tracka Field Officer did not visit the project site where about 17 structures are simultaneously being executed by different contractors. It is instructive to note that the projects are at different levels of completion.\n\n\u201cIt may also be noted that the primary school in question was a dilapidated Nomadic Education Centre located at Galga, near Gubi Dam, Firo where the CTC is located. The Service, in conjunction with its Land School (site of the CTC), found the primary school in a bad state and decided to renovate it as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, typical of the Service wherever it has such public facility and cohabits with the community.\n\n\u201cAs evidenced by attached pictures, the said school was rehabilitated and handed over to the appreciative Galga community whose children now use better facilities including desks at the school.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, Tracka only stopped its verification of the budget implementation at the primary school from where it drew hasty conclusions of non-implementation. What a lazy way of discharging a mandate.\n\n\u201cThough not opposed to pursuit of accountability and transparency by NGOs, the Service is averse to resorting to fake news and outright misinformation as a way of enlightening the public. To seek redress, the Service has brought the misinformation carried out by Tracka to its management and in that regard sought a refutal and unreserved apology.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the CTC is open to anyone who may wish to visit it to verify the level of work there. Going forward, the Service will not take lightly attempts by individuals or organisations like Tracka to defame it,\u201d Dr. Afunanya warned.",

          "text": "Ugezu J Ugezu\n\nBy David Royal\n\nNollywood producer, director, and actor, Ugezu J Ugezu, has been chastised by colleagues and social media users for his opposition to the use of DNA tests in Nigeria.\n\nThe legendary actor had on Monday shared a post on his official Instagram page to admonish men who have made it a habit to take a paternity test before claiming a child.\n\nFollowing the trends in Nigeria and as parents realize daily that their children aren\u2019t biologically theirs, many men, particularly in Nigeria, are becoming interested in DNA tests.\n\nUgezu alarmed by the rising popularity of paternity tests believes that African men should not be subjected to them and according to him, any child born to an African man is the man\u2019s child.\n\nHe believes that DNA-related issues are the reasons many families are tearing apart.\n\nHis post below:\n\nReacting to Ugezu\u2019s post on Instagram, Nollywood actor, Ime Bishop Umoh, popularly known as OkonLagos objected, saying that things have changed.\n\nHe said \u201cThings have changed, Globalization has had the better of us as a people. The world including Africa has evolved. In today\u2019s Africa, the values of chastity and fidelity with respect to the married woman has been eroded.\n\n\u201cThose were times where it was actually sacrilegious and very unimaginable for a woman to be married to a man as non-virgin, let alone have extramarital affair(s) to the extent of bearing a child outside her marital home.\n\n\u201cDNA was not needed because infidelity had very grave deterring consequences. This gave room for more paternal certainty than is the case now.\u201d\n\nAlso, Actress, Victoria Inyama Agreed with OkonLagos, pointing out that it\u2019s 2022 and mud houses are not as cooling as they were before.\n\nShe said \u201cD\u00e8de m\u00f9 @ugezujugezu This is 2022\u2026.mud houses are not as cooling as before\u2026..We don\u2019t drink from clay pots\u2026.we are still suffering atrocities that our ancestors committed\u2026DNA is very important just like mm\u00e0y\u00ec \u00e0j\u00f9j\u00f9 in Traditional marriage. Ndewooooo \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u201d\n\nAnother social media user, Prince Paulaj opined that DNA is not what\u2019s tearing home/family/relationship apart, infidelity is the problem.\n\nAccording to him \u201cIf a woman got impregnated by another man, she should be bold enough to tell the husband at home that the child doesn\u2019t belong to him, it will be left for the husband to accept and keep the secret if he truly loves the woman, enough of all these paternity frauds.\u201d\n\nUsing his uncle as an example, Paul said \u201cMy uncle was married to a lady for 25 years, they had 4 Kids. My uncle never suspected his wife for once, he gave her everything, only for my uncle to return from a one week journey one day and found his home empty, with a note:- (summarily) I am sorry, I knew this will break your heart, you are such a nice man you gave us everything. These 4 kids are not your biological kids, we have relocated to another country, find a place in your heart and forgive me\u2026. fortunately for my uncle he already had a son while he was in the university, it\u2019s not as if he can\u2019t impregnate a woman. He has to go and do DNA test on the first child he had when he was in the university and the results came out 99.9% as the biological father. Let\u2019s tackle infidelity but DNA test.\u201d\n\n@ngallalizzyyahoo.co commented \u201cDNA is very important, so many men are spending money on other children while their biological children are suffering somewhere. I support DNA 100%\u201d\n\n@etzpresh \u201cWith all due respect.. I disagree totally with this.. in other words, you are encouraging women to cheat and bring other people\u2019s children home and the man will be silence all in the name of peace of mind..: God forbid make peace nor Dey \u2026 I will not train another mans child..\u201d\n\n@princefranklinnlemchi \u201cSir DNA is important, I disagree you on this because what our girls are doing now is unfair, you will love and marry a man because of his money and still have a man that satisfies you on bad, sir the world have change and things have also change, I always pay that God should give me vagin to marry as my wife that all I have to say \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude4c\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We had to save jobs. So, we think that this relationship will continue to grow,\u201d he said.\n\nNgige also commended the Republic of Korea for offering educational scholarship programmes and manpower trainings to Nigerians and appealed for increase in the number of beneficiaries.\n\nEarlier, Amb.

          "text": "The status of the payment of the N2.6 trillion owed the Federal Government by 77 oil and gas will be unveiled in March 2022.\n\nThe Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) Board-the National Stakeholders Working Group (NSWG) has approved the 2020 Oil and Gas audit report that will show how many firms have paid and how much they have remitted to the Federal Government coffers.\n\nNEITI\u2019s Executive Secretary, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji made this known yesterday in a text message to The Nation .\n\nHis text message to an inquest from our Abuja correspondent reads: \u201cYes, Our 2020 Oil/gas report will be released next month-March, 2022. The report is ready, has just been approved by NEITI Board-the National Stakeholders Working Group (NSWG).\u201d\n\nThe Nation had reported the postponement of the unveiling of the report to first quarter (Q1) of the year.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOur Abuja correspondent had reported that the watchdog organisation deferred the publication that it earlier scheduled to present last November.\n\nBesides, on that, The Nation asked Orji whether NEITI would still unveil the audit report that month, he said the presentation had been postponed to last December.\n\nMeanwhile, the NEITI boss said the organisation had to reschedule the presentation to capture issues emanating from the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nOrji said: \u201cAs a result of reviews in scope and content to enable NEITI respond adequately to unfolding EITI emerging issues, matters arising from the post petroleum industry act, the 2020 oil and gas report will be ready within the first quarter of next year.\u201d\n\nHe also said the NEITI will also commence the 2021 Oil and Gas industry audit next year.\n\nHe added that next year, the organization will commence the Mining Industry audit.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe conduct of 2021 industry reports, oil/gas and mining will also commence next year.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that Orji had September in the press conference in Abuja urged the Federal Government to prevail on the 77 firms to remit their outstanding dues of Value Added Tax, Withholding Income Tax, Education Tax and the others amounting to N2.6 trillion to the government.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow, the 2020 audit report will validate if these payments have been made by the companies. Our audit reports are published annually. Plans are on to release the 2020 report by November this year.\u201d\n\nLast November 12, when Orji was asked reveal how much the 77 companies had paid, he said: \u201cThe ongoing NEITI 2020 oil/gas independent industry audit to be released early next month will confirm the current status. I am in no position to speculate at this moment.\u201d\n\nSome days after the press conference, where he announced the outstanding debts to journalists, President Muhammadu Buhari gave a coalition of anti-graft agencies, including the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), the Independence Corrupt Practices and Other Crimes Commission (ICPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) the approval to recover about N2.65 trillion unremitted funds from the 77 oil companies.\n\nThe NFIU Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Modibbo Tukur, who broke the news when he visited the NEITI secretariat to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two government organisations, said that it was unacceptable that government would be owed such huge funds at a time it was borrowing to fund major projects around the country.\n\nHe said the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, had been directed by the president to oversee the process, including the setting up of a panel of the anti-corruption agencies to recover the unremitted monies.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd that (NEITI\u2019s hard work) has led to some kind of fruition because I briefed him (President Muhammadu Buhari) this morning and you may not be aware of it. This week, Mr President has approved officially all the recoveries to be done in this area. The minister of finance has been directed to set up a recovery panel with the EFCC, NEITI and NFIU in it and even NAPIMS and all the others.\n\n\u201cSo, we are heading to maximum transparency. And there will be consolidation of data coming from NEITI, from NFIU and other agencies and there will be very clear reconciliation with the players and those regulating the sector. So, no more hiding of our national revenues. We all know what we are going through. Nobody wants to see the government borrow.\u201d\n\nHe noted that although he had done some work in the past with the organisation, this time around, the new NEITI management was raising the standards in the execution of EITI principles, traversing the entire country and getting results.\n\n\u201cSo we have the public accounts analysis and reporting. They analyse every government account from local government to federal in this country. So if the oil company has said that we are paying, we will be the one to tell them whether they have paid and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cAnd we have the oil, maritime and petroleum sector analysis we also have the natural environment analysis. So this is also a natural environment issue where people hide and they do illegal mining, they exploit, then they do certain things and they move it out of the country without even the ministry of mining knowing and sometimes they go as far as using this sector to finance terrorism.\n\n\u201cWe ran into so many cases, in this particular area when we\u2019re doing our analysis on terrorism. So, I think is the day to congratulate you because we are taking off and you will see the results because now we have all seen the zeal.\n\n\u201cBecause you are talking about N2.6 trillion, then we reported over $5 billion, not paid in the area where the players are, which is the Niger Delta area. And then over N700 billion naira not paid, and in some cases companies receiving as agents and not even remitting. I think to achieve greater transparency in this area , it is good this time around to work with artificial intelligence, because if you are waiting for somebody to collect money and give you your own share, maybe it\u2019s the day you are standing in front of God that he will pay you.\n\n\u201cVery soon both our teams will move to the ministry of finance, where we are going to sit down, call these companies and talk the real issues. We have walked the walk, so that the results will come in. And from that data you have and the one we have, the alert will start coming in very soon.\n\n\u201cThe essence of this collaboration is to strengthen our partnership to be able to support each other, to ensure that resources available in our country are prudently managed in a manner that benefits all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhen I met you in February this year, I did say that an underlining importance of NFIU and NEITI collaboration in areas of managing information and data at our disposal in the oil, gas and mining sectors because of the strategic importance of the sector to our economy and the extensive work that I am aware the NFIU is doing in that sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey, but I am glad that the documents that are going to underpin our relationship is now ready for signing. This is a very fundamental aspect of our relationship with NFIU. We are very comfortable, very happy and appreciative of the job that agencies like yours are doing in that sector.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t all sit down and watch as a few people want to fritter the resources that are available. This country is in haste to develop and need resources to provide roads, water,electricity, build infrastructure for our people and our teeming youths and make life abundant and to reduce the exodus of our youths to other jurisdictions where they go and even things tougher.\n\n\u201cWhen we travel around the world and we meet Nigerians, I feel pained because some of them are the best talents and brains that can be more useful in our country.\n\nThe essence of this partnership is underpinned by the need for information sharing, joint preventive and remediation action in governance processes, especially in the extractive industry.\n\nAlso, regular capacity building and training, especially in the oil and gas and mining sector, joint stakeholder awareness creation, intelligence sharing, in the extractive industry and investigations. We need to also partner with technical committees that will execute, and provide content for actualisation of this MOU.\n\nHe said that the plan would be enhanced by regular meetings and more importantly supporting in investigating issues bordering on criminality arising from NEITI industry reports in oil, gas and mining sector.\n\nEveryday we get reports of illegal mining, extortion and selling of our mineral in the international market without any consideration, especially in the area that these activities border on our national security and expressed joy that the president has responded to the plea of the organisation.\n\nIn the course of its engagements, Orji explained that NEITI had met with the EFCC, ICPC with the climax being NFIU, which will go beyond signing papers, but ensuring that there\u2019s action in executing the mandate that they got from Buhari.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday in Abuja said if his administration had not prioritized infrastructure projects to ameliorated hardship in some parts of the country, particularly the quick intervention on the Lagos-Ibadan route with completion of road and rail lines, which improved the traffic significantly, people would have reported to trekking.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari said this when he met with the delegation from Kaduna State, led by the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli, and Kaduna State Deputy Governor, Hadiza Sabuwa Balaraba at the State House.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy objective was very clear, despite the dwindling resources, I wanted to deal with infrastructure across the country.\n\n\u201cWe should look at advancement in terms of Infrastructure. No country can advance without infrastructure. There used to be railways, especially people from Southern Kaduna will remember this.\n\n\u201cWhich country can really advance without road, rail and power, that\u2019s why I wanted to sort out infrastructure, knowing that Nigerians are competitive by nature, and they will face their businesses when there\u2019s road, rail and power,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President said the challenge of commuting in the South West had been improved.\n\n\u201cThe people from South West can tell better because between Lagos and Ibadan by now, if we hadn\u2019t done what we did, people would have been trekking because the road was not there, the rail was not there and there was so much insecurity.\n\n\u201cBut we thank the international community. We thank China and Chinese investors, who came along to support the Lagos-Ibadan transport projects,\u201d he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nPresident Buhari assured that the construction and rehabilitation of infrastructure will be sustained, which include the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano express road, being handled by Julius Berger to ensure good, long-term quality.\n\nThe President commended the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai, for the transformation of the state, with growing infrastructure and socio-economic projects, while noting the growing liberality, which welcomes all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cPlease extend my gratitude to the Governor for doing so well. I have been living in Kaduna for many years before I came here, but now I will need a modern compass to go around because of the transformation,\u201d he added.\n\nIn her remarks, the Deputy Governor thanked the President for his working visit to the state, where he commissioned projects in Kaduna, Kafanchan and Zaria.\n\nShe said the Urban Renewal Programme will be sustained and spread across the state for more impact on the lives of the people, with many already near completion, and will be ready by May, 2022.\n\nThe Emir of Zazzau also thanked the President for the visit in January and support to the Government, adding that the memory will be long cherished by all Kaduna State citizens.",

          "text": "\u2022Says 1,130 Benin bronzes due back from Germany this year\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to countries, institutions, and bodies, both private and public, to return Nigeria\u2019s artefacts in their possession. Buhari also disclosed that 1,130 Benin bronzes would be returned to Nigeria by the German government before the end of this year.\n\nReacting to the recent return of two important Nigerian artefacts from Britain, the president, in a statement yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, welcomed the official handover, on Saturday, of the Okwukor and the Head of an Oba of Benin Bronzes, to the Oba of Benin, His Royal Highness, Oba Ewuare II. The artefacts were repatriated from the University of Cambridge and University of Aberdeen, respectively, in the United Kingdom, after 125 years of their leaving the territory of present day Nigeria.\n\nIn a passionate plea for return of the objects, which form a significant part of the country\u2019s rich cultural heritage, Buhari recalled that the artefacts, now returned to the Oba of Benin, were taken away by British soldiers in 1897, when they attacked the ancient Benin Kingdom and took thousands of items away.\n\nAccording to the president, \u201cThese artefacts are part of the records of the history of the Benin people. My directive to return these artefacts to the Oba of Benin marks the beginning of another aspect in the highly valued relationship between the federal government of Nigeria and our traditional institutions who are, indeed, the true custodians of our history, customs, and traditions.\n\n\u201cThis directive is also significant because it will introduce a working relationship between the federal government, as represented by the NCMM, and the traditional institutions whereby this commission negotiates the release of antiquities from foreign museums and institutions on behalf of Nigeria and the traditional institutions that lost the antiquities and jointly they all take steps to ensure the valourisation of Nigerian and Nigerian people through these great arts and cultural emblems.\u201d\n\nWhile urging other countries to take a cue from the institutions, the president vowed that the federal government would pursue the repatriation of Nigerian artefacts vigorously. He pledged that government would ensure that they were put to good and proper use on their return in museums and other facilities in conjunction with the royal families and kingdoms that lost these artefacts.\n\nThe president noted that in line with international law and practice, export, import, and control over antiquities were matters within the purview of national governments, to be exercised on behalf of sub-national authorities, institutions and bodies. He thanked the government of the United Kingdom that facilitated the return of the artefacts by issuing the prerequisite Export Permits to Nigeria at no cost, as well as the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen who agreed to return these artefacts to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese are unprecedented moves worth emulating by others,\u201d he said, adding that the federal government hopes to work hand in hand with the British authorities in the future to encourage the return of more Nigerian artefacts from the United Kingdom.\n\nBuhari also appreciated the Federal Republic of Germany, which was planning the process of repatriating 1,130 Benin bronzes to Nigeria this year from many of Germany\u2019s public museums.\n\nHe also commended the High Commissioner of Nigeria to the United Kingdom, Sarafa Ishola, and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) for their collaborative works that led to the repatriation of the artefacts. According to him, it is noteworthy that several others are currently in the process of being returned while discussions are on-going to repatriate many more.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This was contained in a leaked letter to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/21, which the ruling party said superseded its earlier national convention notice.\n\nThe latest notice also replaced an earlier letter to INEC informing it of APC\u2019s decision to hold its zonal congresses on March 26.\n\nBut the party was silent on the zoning of offices, a major concern for stakeholders, which was believed to have contributed to the seeming dithering over the convention.\n\nA former Director General of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, alleged that the chairman of APC\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni; his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello; Governor of Imo State Hope Uzodinma; and Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State were the ones frustrating the national convention plan.\n\nAPC had in an earlier letter, with reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14, notified INEC of its decision to hold its national convention on February 26. But the party said its latest notice followed an evaluation of its constitution.\n\nIt stated in the leaked letter, \u201cIn furtherance to Article 85 of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) and compliance with Section 12:6 of our party constitution, we hereby write to notify the commission that our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has scheduled to hold its zonal congresses on Saturday, 26th March, 2022.\n\n\u201cKindly arrange for your officials to monitor the exercise accordingly. While hoping to receive your cooperation, please accept the assurances of our highest esteem.\u201d\n\nNational Secretary of APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, told journalists yesterday at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja that the publication of national convention sub-committees would take on Monday, February 28.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, who spoke at the end of a four-hour meeting of the caretaker committee, said, \u201cWe have agreed and approved that activities for the party\u2019s national convention will commence from February 24 and terminate on March 26 at Eagle Square with the national convention. In between the convention, we have agreed to have zonal congresses, and all the activities are hereby given as approved by the CECPC.\u201d\n\nThe schedule of activities released by the party showed that the sale of forms would take place between March 9 and 11, while the screening of aspirants would happen between March 15 and 17. The screening appeal would hold on March 19, while the adoption of the appeal report would be held on Monday, March 21, according to the schedule.\n\nThe party said accreditation for the national convention would be held between March 24 and 25, while the convention would be on Saturday, March 26, and convention appeal would take place on Tuesday, March 29.\n\nThe adoption of appeal report would take place on Wednesday, March 30, while the inauguration of the party executive would hold on Thursday, March 31.\n\nAccording to the schedule of activities for the zonal congresses, the publication of zonal committees would take place on February 24, while a meeting of zonal stakeholders is scheduled for February 26.\n\nThe party added that the sale of forms for zonal positions would commence on February 28 and end on March 3. It scheduled the screening of zonal aspirants for March 5, and screening appeal for March 6.\n\nThe adoption of the screening report is slated for March 8, while zonal congresses would be held on Saturday, March 12, and the zonal congresses appeal would take place on March 14.\n\nThe adoption of appeal report is scheduled for March 16.\n\nHowever, Lukman, in a statement yesterday, titled, \u201cAPC Convention: Mutiny by Yahoo Yahoo Politicians,\u201d alleged that the party was held captive by a small group of dishonest politicians whose only interest was to impose themselves as either presidential or vice-presidential candidates for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former APC governors\u2019 forum director-general said the caretaker committee saddled mainly with the responsibility of organising the national convention to elect new leaders of the party had reduced the majority of its members to mere observers. He said even PGF was being disrespected, as the decisions and leadership of the governor\u2019s body were being snubbed.\n\nLukman said in the statement, \u201cHis Excellency Mai Mala Buni, in flagrant disregard to every known procedure of managing affairs of the party, relate only with His Excellency, Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; His Excellency, Hope Uzodinma of Imo State; and His Excellency, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, based on the plot to retain His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni as Chairman of the party up to the time of conducting the primary that will produce candidates for 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe other person, who is also active in this political ponzi scheme, is the CECPC Secretary, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, who is also aspiring to emerge as the Akwa Ibom governorship candidate of the APC for 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nLukman alleged that Abiodun, Buni, Bello, and Uzodinma were all aspiring to become either presidential or vice-presidential candidates.\n\nHe added, \u201cAlthough His Excellency Mai Mala Buni is not open about his ambition, some of the speculation promoted by people very close to him is that once he is the one to organise the primary to produce candidates for 2023 elections, he stands a good chance to emerge as the vice-presidential candidate, or even the presidential candidate, if the North is to produce the presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Uzodinma, Lukman claimed the governor was alleged to be aspiring to emerge as vice-presidential candidate to a northern candidate, saying Bello has declared his aspiration to emerge as the 2023 presidential candidate of the party.\n\nHe explained that Abiodun was being guaranteed a second term ticket to emerge the Ogun State governorship candidate for the 2023 election, which was to block any potential contestant, given the strong opposition he faced from former Governor Ibikunle Amosun in 2019.\n\nLukman stressed that beyond guaranteeing Abiodun second term ticket, Buni had attempted to make similar offers to all first term governors of APC, adding that some of the stories flying around are true scripts being acted by Buni and his associates.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is clear that Mai Mala Buni is opposed to organising the APC national convention on February 26, 2022 or any time soon. Consequently, he is working with other dishonest leaders, notably, Yahaya Bello, Hope Uzodinma, Dapo Abiodun, and a few others.\n\n\u201cIt is a mutiny against the authority of the party and all its designated leaders, especially, President Buhari, being carried by very dishonest people, who can best be described as Yahoo Yahoo politicians. They are busy recruiting more dishonest and questionable leaders, such as Uzor Kalu, and they are moving to recruit some state party leaders into their fold.\n\n\u201cAs a party, APC is now in a state of emergency. Any slip will destroy the party. This is not the period to allow dishonest political leaders gamble with the survival of the party and by extension weaken the nation\u2019s democracy. Everything must be done to restore some minimum standards of conducts by leaders at all levels.\n\n\u201cEverything must be done to rescue APC from the hands of these Yahoo Yahoo politicians represented by Mai Mala Buni, Yahaya Bello, Hope Uzodinma, Dapo Abiodun, Uzor Kalu, and their associates.\u201d\n\nReacting to the developments, a chairmanship aspirant of the party, Mr. Sunny Monidafe, said he had no choice but to accept the decision of the party. Monidafe said, \u201cSo long as the party leadership carries all the critical stakeholders along, I don\u2019t have any objections.\u201d\n\nBut a group in the party, APC Rebirth group, faulted the decision to conduct the zonal congresses, saying it is alien to the party\u2019s constitution. The group, led Aliyu Audu, said the decision was part of a calculated attempt by the Buni-led caretaker committee to elongate its tenure in office, adding, \u201cIt is a clear case of abuse of power and blatant reign of impunity. Buni will stop at nothing until he ruins the party.\u201d\n\nConvention: We\u2019re Not Talking Till After Meeting With Buhari, Say APC Governors\n\nThe Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), has said that it would not comment on the timetable for the national convention and zonal congresses released by the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) until it had met with President Muhammadu Buhari today.\n\nChairman of the Forum and the Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, stated this while addressing journalists yesterday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cUntil we finish with Mr. President, we would rather not comment on any time table or any logistics,\u201d said Bagudu, when asked about the time-table for the convention and zonal congresses.\n\nAccording to him, the Forum met to discuss developments in the states and review the election that took place in the FCT, Osun primary, the court judgment that dissolved the Kano Congress and the preparation for the national convention, where it received briefing from the Caretaker Chairman, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nspeaking on the allegation that the APC governors were the ones frustrating the convention from holding, the Kebbi governor said, \u201cWe appreciate that Nigerians are interested in what the APC is doing, because Nigerians gave us their mandate by electing us into offices and holding us to a high standard and we are very conscious of that.\n\nHis words: \u201cAll the APC governors have met and as always, appreciated the need to work together with other stakeholders. We have always been humble to acknowledge that we are not only stakeholders of the party. To work with other stakeholders and to ensure we deliver transparent, honest national executives that will have the confidence of all party members.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Returns \u00a3210,000 illegal payment\n\nMichael Olugbode\n\n\n\nThe United Kingdom has injected \u00a310 million into Nigeria\u2019s low carbon energy project. The concessional aid is aimed at reducing the risks, for pension and insurance funds\u2019 to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria\u2019s COP26 commitments.\n\nUK also signed an agreement with the Nigerian government that would enable a compensation of \u00a3210,610 to the country following a successful investigation by the British Serious Fraud Office on the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe governments of Nigeria, United Kingdom of Great Britain, and Northern Ireland, yesterday, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in a joint commitment to continue the fight against corruption.\n\nThe MoU was signed between UK\u2019s Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, and the Attorney General of the Federal and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who was represented by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Umar. It sets out the terms and understanding between the governments of the United Kingdom and Nigeria to make the compensation payment.\n\nDuring the signing of the MoU, Ford said, \u201cThe Security and Defence Dialogue held in February 2022 between our two countries reaffirmed both the UK and Nigeria\u2019s commitment to work together to tackle illicit financial flows, bribery, and corruption.\n\n\u201cThe UK has a zero tolerance policy to corruption and we hope that today\u2019s signing sends a clear statement about our commitment to this.\u201d\n\nShe noted that in a global economy where international trade was vital, it was more important than ever that companies operate with integrity and transparency.\n\nIllicit financial flows, bribery, and corruption have been identified as major hindrances to economic growth, trade, stable governance, and the security of both countries.\n\nThe compensation payment from the UK to Nigeria was secured after a four-year corruption investigation led by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the UK. The money was obtained through a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA), which meant the prosecutor agreed to defer prosecution in exchange for the defendant agreeing to fulfil certain requirements, such as accepting criminal liability for offences and paying the appropriate compensation.\n\nIn this case, the DPA was agreed with Amec Foster Wheeler (AFWEL), in relation to the use of corrupt agents in the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe compensation payment demonstrated that when such crimes were identified, the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) would investigate the companies and, where evidence was found, ensure that they faced appropriate sanctions.\n\nIn March 2021, the UK government returned \u00a34.2 million to Nigeria from funds recovered from associates of former Delta State Governor James Ibori.\n\nHowever, in this case, \u201cThe Government of the United Kingdom will transfer the compensation amount in the sum of \u00a3210,610 (118.4 million Naira) within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of signing this MOU.\n\n\u201cIn both instances, the MoU\u2019s confirm that the Nigerian government has pledged to use the returned funds for projects that will benefit and improve the country.\n\n\u201cThe UK will remain committed to returning all illegal assets, no matter the amount, as per the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).\u201d\n\nUK\u2019s Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Lisa Osofsky said, \u201cWe have a zero tolerance approach to companies who think they can bribe their way to financial success. Bribery and corruption not only stifle real economic growth and free trade, they also damage democracy and, therefore, risk the security of all our countries.\n\n\u201cI am, of course, delighted that the tenacity of my SFO colleagues has resulted in the people of Nigeria being compensated in a way that will truly benefit them.\u201d\n\nMalami, while thanking the UK for the gesture, promised that the repatriated fund would be expended on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja to Kano road, and the Second Niger Bridge.\n\nOn UK\u2019s injection of \u00a310 million of concessional financing alongside InfraCredit to mobilise pension and insurance investments, the statement noted that it would help to reduce the risk for pension and insurance funds to invest in energy access projects, and support Nigeria\u2019s COP26 commitments.\n\nThe financing would also help Nigerian investors focus on low carbon energy, and support off-grid, low-carbon energy projects. Additionally, the \u00a310 million would be blended to de-risk transactions and, therefore, mobilise domestic institutional investment from local pension funds, insurance firms and other local institutional investors. This would help scale up domestic financing for eligible off-grid clean energy infrastructure, such as solar mini-grid and home systems, clean cooking infrastructure and SME cold storage infrastructure in Nigeria.\n\nUK Minister for Africa, Vicky Ford, speaking on the investment, said, \u201cThe UK is committed to increasing both renewable energy and energy access in Nigeria, driving clean, sustainable and resilient growth.\n\n\u201cAs the world looks to transition to clean growth, we are witnessing an era-defining opportunity for the private sector. This transaction is particularly exciting as it brings together UK government support with the institutional capital, which is essential to grow the sector at scale.\n\n\u201cThis innovative blended finance initiative will provide affordable long-term financing from local investors for the low carbon energy sector to support scaling up of off-grid low carbon energy projects in unserved and underserved communities.\n\n\u201cThis initiative will support the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions plan, which Nigeria submitted to the UNFCCC before COP26, its Energy Transition Plan, which was presented by the Nigerian government at COP26, and Nigeria\u2019s plans to increase energy access, including the Solar Naija programme.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the MD/CEO, Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), and Chairman of InfraCredit, Uche Orji said:\n\n\u201cInfraCredit is pleased to be working with FCDO to mobilise private investment from domestic pension funds and other institutional investors into such an important developmental area as low carbon energy access.\n\n\u201cThis programme is aligned with NSIA\u2019s other clean energy initiatives which aims to deliver up to 250-500MW of renewable energy capacity in Nigeria that will reduce annual CO2 emissions, alleviate poverty, create jobs and support local economic growth.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the announcement, the Minister of State for Power, Mr. Godwin Jedy-Agba, said with the support from the UK Government\u2019s Energy Transition Council showed the pathway to an energised economy and carbon neutrality by 2060. The assistance also highlighted the need for additional investments of $410 billion above business as usual over the next 40 years.\n\nJedy-Agba stated, \u201cWhereas all efforts have been geared towards unlocking private sector activity in the clean energy transition, one major challenge continues to be private sector access to local currency financing. This is where local institutions such as pension and insurance funds have a key role to play, as only these institutions possess the scale of local currency liquidity required to accelerate the transition.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, at a meeting with Ford said the federal government looked forward to cooperate with the United Kingdom (UK) in the security of the West African sub-region.\n\nOnyeama received, in audience, the United Kingdom Minister for Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. He expressed gratitude to the government of the United Kingdom for its extensive and significant support in diverse areas, stating that the West African sub-region is facing huge security challenges, including governance challenges.\n\nHe noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had a big hit on the economies of the world and also expressed gratitude to the United Kingdom for support during the period, particularly with vaccines and other support in the area of health.\n\nOnyeama added that the United Kingdom had been involved in the security of the West African sub-region, saying a lot is going on in the sub-region, particularly in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso with the support of the United Nations.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cSo, we look forward to continue to cooperate with you in this area because we feel that it is not something that we can do alone in the sub-region.\n\n\u201cWe need the United Nations\u2019 support and also the support of European countries. We have been engaged and in the framework of the G5 Sahel and other initiatives.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the specific assistance the United Kingdom planned to render Nigeria, Ford said the UK would be discussing with the Nigerian government how to help in community policing, training and improving the police.\n\nFord, however, emphasised that the move was a partnership and not the United Kingdom telling Nigeria what to do.\n\nShe added, \u201cThis was us listening, sharing experiences, especially from the national security areas which we may have seen and experienced both in our country, but also, from what we are seeing across the world and bringing our experiences together.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Pro 28:1 (BBE):\n\n\"The evil man goes running away when no man is after him, but the upright are without fear, like the lion.\"\n\n\n\nThose were the words of the richest, yet wisest man in human existence, Solomon the son of David, a king under whose reign every man of Israel became employer of labour.\n\nIt is no longer news that light has shone upon the deeds of Abdufatai Femi Fani Kayode. It is unbelievable that a man who made name and fame in freedom of speech saying whatever he likes about others will be afraid of the Right of a woman to speak at the Apostolic Round Table \u2013 ART \u2013 Conference!\n\nWhat FFK fails to realize is that he is inconsequential to the discourse on the Nigerian state!\n\nART is a convergence of Leaders After God's Own Spirit Initiating A New State, The LAGOSIANS!We are too concerned about a better state to be bothered about a man who is as unstable as water!\n\nFFK should accept the heroine that Precious Chikwendu has become, a woman whose travails represent the oppressed people of Nigeria who in their oppression are forbidden from opening their mouths!\n\nThis timely timidity from a flip of both side of our coin of political misery, head or tail equal same thing; oppression, is for us a proof that we indeed represent a generation without greed. Minds with ideas whose time is now.\n\nWhat is FFK afraid of? Is he afraid of the man whose pen tore the garment of deception with which he garbed himself pretending who he wasn't until it was heard that a spy fooled us? Femi must come to terms with the fact that he cannot live the rest of his life hopping from court to court seeking injunctions to stop the truth from being spoken! \"Ti \u00ecr\u00f3 b\u00e1 l\u1ecd n\u00ed og\u00fan \u1ecdd\u00fan, \u1ecdj\u1ecd\u0301 kan ni \u00f2\u00f3t\u1ecd\u0301 m\u00e1 baa!\" If a lie has travelled for 20 years, it is the day that the truth sets out that it will overtake it. Truth has set out and it is understandable for lies and its merchants to seek for covering from facing the truth!\n\nA man who the other Femi at the Presidency reminded us said unforgivable and unpardonable things against President Muhammadu Buhari prior to his inglorious defection to the ruling party!\n\nWhat is it that FFK has not spoken with his mouth? He once wished Yusuf Buhari dead when he had a motor bike accident according to reports monitored in the news. To see the same man all dressed up and gallivanting among guests at Yusuf's traditional wedding in Kano is only a revelation of his state of mind. It is about time that persons approaching the court should be subjected to mental health examination!\n\nOne who like a dog is quick to chase back to its vomit doesn't constitute any distraction whatsoever to our well laid out plans to shift Nigeria away from his likes.\n\nWhat is it that must not be heard from Snow White? For which injunction should be purchased if the need so warrants it. Could the mouth of this oppressed mother of four stripped of her sons and denied access to them be the gate of hell that must not be opened to Femi Fani Kayode?\n\nWhat will make an obviously terrified man run to court like a dog with his tail between his legs to get an injunction restraining Snow White from speaking at Green Shift; Apostolic Round Table?\n\nIf silence is golden, then FFK better be ready for the deafening sound of truth unspoken when it should be upon the conscience of the wicked.\n\nWill Snow White speak on Thursday in Lagos at the Apostolic Round Table? We have to wait to find out!",

          "text": "As digital financial services providers penetrate the African market at large, there is a need to ensure that fintech startups lay a strong foundation for a robust risk, fraud, anti-money laundering (AML)/combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), and compliance framework.\n\nThis is to ensure that they have a system that promptly detects fraud, and their platforms are not used as a conduit for money laundering, cybercrime, and other related crimes.\n\nIn Nigeria, the use of ATM card details and mobile banking PINs for fraudulent transactions is commonplace. Per the Nigeria Electronic Fraud Forum (NeFF), cases of electronic bank fraud cost lenders $14.2 million between 2016 and 2018.\n\nA robust risk and compliance framework entail having inter alia an effective and efficient Know Your Customer (KYC) program in line with regulatory requirements; fraud prevention, detection, and prevention monitoring program; transaction monitoring process for prompt detection and reporting of suspicious activities and transactions as well as risk assessment and sanction screening programme.\n\nThis article focuses on Know Your Customer compliance and fraud.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cKYC simply means processes banks and other financial institutions use to ensure that customers are who they claim to be,\u201d Mobolaji Bammeke, Chief Compliance Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal. \u201cIt\u2019s at the heart of fraud prevention processes, as required by laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nEssentially, KYC involves fintech companies and other institutions with financial duties collecting specific information (including but not limited to full name, phone numbers, national ID numbers, utility bills, international passport, etc.) from potential customers\u2014whether individual or corporate entities.\n\nThis is often done at the time of onboarding and where relevant, identity documents are validated before customers are approved.\n\nJumps to the next platform.\n\n\n\nRinse, Repeat.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s high time we came together to build an open source fraud database to curb this & create more trust in the ecosystem. \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/SdmCgXgmEU \u2014 GB \ud83e\udd8b (@TechProd_Arch) May 9, 2020\n\nWhy\u2019s this important? These measures serve as a line of defence against financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing. KYC tests are typically very simple and easy to implement but when executed well, can be highly effective in preventing fraud.\n\n\u201cCompliance with KYC requirements prevents money launderers from using your platform as a conduit for fraud or other illicit financial activity,\u201d Bammeke notes. \u201cIt\u2019s in line with AML and CFT regulations. Typically, access is restricted for users that do not fulfil KYC requirements.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that KYC is a continuous process. That is, after the initial onboarding is concluded, a financial company is required to regularly monitor client accounts to detect suspicious activity that indicates fraud or relates to financial crimes. If such unusual activities occur, a new KYC evaluation process is necessary.\n\nBeyond identity checks, KYC policies ensure sound business practices and offer insightful data on customers. For instance, they can help companies evaluate the financial status of clients and determine creditworthiness where relevant.\n\nHow can fintechs get compliance right?\n\nFintech companies may not necessarily be financial institutions (that hold funds), but their transactions mostly flow through traditional banks.\n\nAs an extension of doing business with lenders that are subject to the KYC regulations, they must comply with the same to manage money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk.\n\nWhat are the key considerations players should be aware of?\n\nThe KYC process is a critical step in customer acquisition, and whatever policies are implemented should ideally have little impact on the onboarding experience of prospective customers.\n\n\u201cWhen drafting KYC compliance strategy, fintechs need to balance customer needs with risk management,\u201d Bammeke says. \u201cIt\u2019s vital to not miss out on lawful customers due to overly exhaustive processes. But that does not mean skipping necessary steps to ensure regulatory compliance. There just has to be a balance.\u201d This balance is to ensure a smooth customer experience for customers.\n\nMore so, as the company expands, it should continuously improve the KYC process in line with new risks.\n\nInnovation in KYC: A peek into the future\n\nCompared to legacy institutions known for slower, more nuanced KYC compliance procedures, fintechs are nimble and have quicker, more accessible processes as their services are fully digital. The latter is thus more positioned to unlock innovative approaches to regulatory requirements like KYC.\n\nAlready, modern technologies like biometrics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain give companies new ways to achieve compliance with KYC requirements while enhancing user onboarding experience, limiting human interference, enabling greater access to financial services.\n\n\u201cIn addition, fintechs can try other ways of identity verification such as video KYC and semantic analytics,\u201d Bammeke says. \u201cLegacy systems still largely dominate the space, but we\u2019re seeing increasing KYC and AML innovations driven by modern technologies. They make the processes a lot faster, more accurate, and transparent.\u201d\n\nThe link between KYC and fraud mitigation is a compelling reason for fintechs to establish adequate authentication and verification processes.\n\nCompliance failure not only makes the company vulnerable to financial crimes but could also attract significant regulatory fines depending on the jurisdiction. An instance is the $100 million fine crypto exchange BitMex had to pay last year to settle claims of illegal trading and AML violations.\n\n\u201cUltimately, KYC is an ongoing process, it involves achieving a balance of identifying and verifying your customer\u2019s identity as well as minimizing risk in order to offer your customer base access to services without compromising on a great customer experience,\u201d adds Bammeke.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The air changes the moment you step into AfricanWorks\u2019 compound in Victoria Island, one of the highbrow areas in Lagos, Nigeria. The first thing you see are the greeneries all over the compound, the atmosphere is calm and quiet. It feels like you\u2019ve just escaped the hustle and bustle of Lagos.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, the outdoor experience is a hint of what goes on in the interior.\n\nThe main door is see-through so you can tell of the comfort that awaits inside. After a minute in the lobby, Gregoire Schwebig, founder and CEO of AfricaWorks came out to meet me. He\u2019s of average height and moderately built. His energy, however, didn\u2019t feel like that of a man who had just completed a trip from Paris to Lagos that morning. As we exchanged pleasantries, one question lingered; why is this French man building a home-grown business in Africa?\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSchwebig was born and grew up in Paris with a close tie to Francophone Africa. His mother was born in Senegal, so he visited Senegal, Ivory Coast, Mali and Togo while growing up. After graduating from ESSEC Business School, one of the best business schools in Europe, he went on to work at Lehman Brothers in London as a financial analyst. After Lehman Brothers liquidated, he joined Societe Generale in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2011, Schwebig joined Fanasi Capital, a venture capital fund focused on high-growth startups in East Africa, as a senior associate, and then moved to Kenya and remained there for 8 years. He was elected as a consular adviser to the French government on the affairs of 7 countries in East and South Africa. In 2016, he became the president of the Kenya chapter of the French Chamber of Commerce, a dedicated body that helps French companies and entrepreneurs set up in Kenya.\n\nSchwebig wore many hats during his time in Kenya; in 2014, he started Haussmann Africa, a corporate real estate company that built and designed custom offices for companies. The company, which he still runs till date, has designed offices for Uber, L\u2019oreal and Total.\n\nAfter designing offices for a while, he realised there were gaps he wanted to fill, so in 2019, he started AfricaWorks.\n\nAfricaWorks in Abidjan\n\nBuilding AfricaWorks\n\nThe way people work had already started shifting before the pandemic hit in 2020. The pandemic only expedited the shift and forced businesses to restructure work to fit the new normal which is hybrid.\n\nWhile there was already full-blown support for the future of work in the West, there was little or no solution in Africa to support the growing business ecosystem\u2014there was no real pan-African flexible workplace solution that could power the future of work across the continent. And here is where AfricaWorks, a pan-African flexible workspace provider chain, plugs itself.\n\nThe idea was simple: build a world-class workspace that brings together the best businesses under one roof in one city. Then scale and replicate the process in another. AfricaWorks launched its first space in Abidjan, the capital city of Ivory Coast, and now operates in 9 cities\u2014Abidjan, Accra, Cairo, Cape Town, Dakar, Dar Es Salaam, Jo\u2019burg, Lagos, and Nairobi\u2014across 8 countries and counting.\n\nAfricaWorks in Cape Town\n\nThe company lists top multinationals like Glovo, Universal Music, L\u2019oreal, Total and more as part of companies working out of its spaces.\n\n\u201cWe currently have over 150 businesses and over 2,000 individuals working from our spaces. We are also opening more spaces in the coming months,\u201d Schwebig told TechCabal.\n\nMore than just a coworking space\n\nFor AfricaWorks, as the African tech and business ecosystem grows, it will continue to grow to support them across the continent. Beyond being a pan-African coworking space, it now wants to do more as it slowly transitions into a tech company. It has started building a business-to-business (B2B) product that will provide full-on operation support for its clients.\n\n\u201cOur B2B service marketplace will be called AfricaWorks Services, which will help us connect our clients to partnered services providers like recruiting, marketing, finance, expansion, and everything else they need to grow their businesses,\u201d said Schwebig, who also co-founded French-African Foundation, an organisation that contributes to the emergence of a Franco-African succession.\n\nSchwebig with the Afriworks Lagos team\n\nThe play here is to reduce third party friction and be the only direct partner their members need. AfricaWorks Services will partner with talent companies like OfferZen and Andela to bring qualified talent to its member companies; partner with marketing and financial firms to bring quality marketing and financial services to its community; and African tradetech like Norebase to help in expansion and manage trade across Africa.\n\nSchwebig believes that Africa will play a pivotal role in the future of work and they [AfricanWorks] are positioning to be a crucial part of that movement. He believes this is becoming evident in the way the African tech ecosystem is booming and the surge in talent exodus. AfricaWorks wants to play in the talent services but first for its members and then\u2014maybe in the future\u2014expanding the services to the public.\n\nAfricaWorks operates in 9 cities and counting and these countries, though they may have similar problems, have a peculiar business landscape that requires a bespoke solution. Schwebig confirmed that, while Ivory Coast remains AfricaWorks\u2019 biggest market in terms of patronage and revenue, it has invested more in Nigeria due to the size of the market and the prospect of the tech ecosystem, especially.\n\nAfricaWorks in Nairobi\n\nAmong other places, the company is also planning to open new space at the Kotoka international airport in Accra, Ghana.\n\nAccording to Goldie Iyamu, the marketing head at AfricaWorks, by the time all the pending projects are completed, the company should push into 500 businesses and over 3,000 people working across their spaces.\n\nAfter 2 years and 6 months, AfricaWorks has experienced astronomical growth and now it\u2019s positioning itself as the partner for businesses with pan-African growth ambitions.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "A virtual art gallery in DRC connects local artists with global clients",
          "text": "The destruction of patronage networks and the subsequent isolation of African art and artists during colonialism and early independence are things of the past for a group of artists who have leapfrogged their way into living rooms and boardrooms across the world.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Patrick Nelle of bird Story Agency\n\nHuddled in a tiny office, young workers are neatly wrapping up canvases, ready for shipment. The silence in the room is loud \u2014 only interrupted by an occasional sigh, heavy breathing, or a cough. At the far end of the room, a young man is multitasking\u2014 his fingers hammering at the buttons of a laptop, while he chats on a smartphone. An air of urgency hangs in the room and he, like the rest of the team, seems pressed for time.\n\nIn an age that welcomes and pays for digitally-signed images of all types, and in which vast volumes of clothing chosen from digital catalogues traverse the world, it is perhaps not surprising that digital manifestations of art are giving artists ready markets all over the world. What might surprise many is that this system of digitally marketed, paid-for, and delivered artworks is flourishing here in Kinshasa.\n\nWelcome to the engine room of Bandombe Galerie, a virtual art gallery that is the brainchild of Sisqo Ndombe. Bandombe showcases and connects contemporary African artists with potential clients, globally.\n\n\u201cA majority of African artists do not manage to make a living from their creations because there are not enough channels dedicated to their promotion,\u201d Ndombe explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThat\u2019s where Bandombe comes in, attracting potential buyers, connecting them with artists, and then providing the platform for negotiation, payment, and delivery of the creative works.\n\n\u201cAs an artist, if you don\u2019t have a place where you can show your work to an audience, you shall never succeed,\u201d Ndombe added.\n\nWhere traditional art galleries prefer working with acclaimed artists and often shun aspiring and unknown creators \u2013 often simply because a gallery only has so much space \u2013 Ndombe felt he could solve this problem on a digital level. As the idea began to crystallise, his \u201ceureka\u201d moment struck\u2026 he could leverage the internet to not only showcase unknown talent \u2013 including his own \u2013 but also to market and sell top African art, globally.\n\n\u201cI remember the time when I had to reach out to galleries, walking long distances carrying my canvases, trying to find some buyers. I couldn\u2019t afford to do things that way anymore,\u201d he says as he recalls his journey as an artist.\n\nThe power of the internet has been a game-changer not just for him, but many more artists, who have signed up to his network across Africa.\n\nWith limited finances, the start was going to be a struggle. However, from his wages as a graphic designer in a local company, he managed to save some money and through constant sacrifice, his dream began to unfold.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, Bandombe Galerie, website: bandombe.com, went up online,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the idea to sell more than just his own art evolved, he onboarded other artists. Some were reluctant but Ndombe is nothing if not persuasive and he managed to convince enough of his fellow artists to sign on with the platform. Where there was reluctance at home, artists from other African countries jumped at the opportunity.\n\n\u201cI thought my fellow Congolese would be the first to jump in, but that didn\u2019t happen. However, when they saw that artists from other countries were packing the platform, they started to join in,\u201d he said.\n\nAt first, it was not easy to get buyers to trust the concept or the platform, but Ndombe\u2019s never-say-die spirit kept the project focused on his goal \u2014 to attract buyers with unique artworks.\n\n\u201cWhat is instrumental to attract art lovers and buyers on our platform is to have a good selection of displayed works,\u201d he explained.\n\nIt took the team eight months of anxiety, patience, and sacrifice before selling their first piece.\n\n\u201cOur first client was a European woman. She had been working in Congo for a couple of years, and now she was leaving the country. She wanted to take some art piece from Congo with her as a souvenir,\u201d Ndombe recalled.\n\nIn the four years since, the Kinshasa-based virtual gallery Bandombe Galerie has grown in leaps and bounds across Africa making it one of, if not, the, most popular virtual galleries for patrons of African art launched on the continent. Currently, it has 800 registered artists from 30 African countries and more than 3,000 artworks in its catalogue.\n\nLooking back at its journey of the gallery, Ndombe said that what started as a small idea to address his dilemma is now helping some aspiring artists to emerge and gain visibility among art collectors far beyond the borders of their countries and continent.\n\n\u201cIt has given access to many African artists and their works to a wider audience and market,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of those who bought up into Ndombe\u2019s virtual gallery initiative is Rwanda-based painter, Izere Antoine.\n\n\u201cBandombe is very supportive of the up-and-coming talents and African art in general,\u201d said Izere.\n\nIzere said through the virtual gallery, he has found buyers for three of his paintings. And above all, beyond the visitations and inquiries, Bandombe has transformed his life and equipped him with tech skills to digitally market his works and brand himself.\n\n\u201cMostly it also encouraged me to be more in online marketing like websites and more,\u201d he said.\n\nNigerian artist Onofua Dennis, who has also signed on with Bandombe talks glowingly of the virtual gallery.\n\n\u201cTheir marketing competency, their capacity in dispensing durable relationships between artists, collectors, and as well as the gallery team through communication, packaging, and delivery of artworks are great,\u201d he said.\n\nParticularly, Onofua praises Bandombe\u2019s payments policy and logistics management which he says have been key in building that durable relationship between all artists and clients.\n\n\u201cPercentage of payment due to the artist is being attended to within a short period of time. More so, I have seen fantastic reports of buyers \u2013 delivered publicly \u2013 about the receiving of their package,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked if Bandombe has been helpful in helping him obtain more artistic recognition, he quickly cuts in: \u201cWell, yes\u201d, adding that; \u201cTo date, we have sold more than 214 pieces\u2026 and that is remarkable\u201d.\n\nFor Ndombe, the growth and future success of Bandombe Galerie mean more work and a commitment to growing his client base.\n\nHe is also determined to end the current trend in which the global emergence of contemporary African art is being driven mainly by non-African buyers, instead of by a local market.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to sensitise our people to consume more art. We envisage the opening of a showroom and the organisation of art fairs across the continent.\n\n\u201cThe potential is huge for Africa arts, and a bright future is beckoning those with the courage to embrace the infinite opportunities offered by technology to shine on the global stage,\u201d he concluded, signing off on another deal with a remote patron.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-fungible token (NFT) was one of the most popular buzzwords in the crypto community in 2021, with many news headlines talking about NFT artists and traders making a killing with NFTs.\n\nSource: Intelligence by Techpoint\n\nHowever, the much-praised blockchain is fast becoming the subject of some bad press in 2022 because of scams, which are not uncommon in investment-related activities.\n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US, investment fraud \u2014 involving stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies \u2014 accounted for $285 million of all social media scams in 2021.\n\nGoing by the trend of investment style fraud so far in 2022, NFT scams should be added to the list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chainalysis\u2019 2022 Crypto Crime Report, a significant amount of criminal activity was associated with NFTs in 2021. The two illicit activities related to NFTs include wsh trading \u2014 artificially increasing the value of an NFT \u2014 and money laundering through the purchase of NFTs.\n\nWhat is NFT wash trading?\n\nWash trading, also known as round-tripping, is a form of market manipulation done when an investor buys a financial instrument and sells it back to himself many times. This increases the instrument\u2019s trade volume, creating the illusion that the asset is worth more than it actually is. Consequently, unsuspecting investors buy such assets only to realise they are not worth as much as they thought.\n\nWhile wash trading is done by an individual, round-tripping can be done by one person buying and selling the same security within the same trading day or by two companies selling securities to themselves and agreeing to repurchase them at about the same price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chainalysis\n\nIs wash trading illegal with NFTs?\n\nIn traditional finance, wash trading is illegal. The US was the first country to declare it unlawful in the 1936 Commodity Exchange Act, and now, the practice is against the law in almost every part of the world.\n\nHowever, in the decentralised world of NFTs, the legality of wash trading is yet to be clearly spelt out. While it is deceptive, there\u2019s no legislation anywhere in the world detailing what is right and what isn\u2019t in NFT trading as its asset class hasn\u2019t been identified.\n\nDespite this marked absence of NFT regulation and class determination, some countries have taken a stand on the practice. For example, Bithumb, a South Korean crypto exchange, was accused of allowing wash trading worth over $250 million in fake volume in 2018.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency wash trading might be illegal in some countries, it is still hard to identify the perpetrators because of the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional financial instruments \u2014 stocks and securities \u2014 with verifiable know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, blockchain-powered assets can be exchanged without revealing identities.\n\nHow to spot NFT wash trading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherscan screenshot that shows a completed wash trade. Source: Chainalysis\n\nKnowing how blockchain works is required to spot or track NFT wash trading. However, the simplest way to avoid buying NFTs with an artificial value is to purchase them from a reputable person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Chainalysis tracked wash trading activities with blockchain analysis, which revealed how sellers go about their wash trading activities.\n\nThe blockchain transactions on Etherscan showed NFTs successfully sold from one Ethereum address to another. While the transaction appeared normal, a closer look revealed that wash trading had occurred. The address that sold the NFT also sent the ETH to the buyer\u2019s address shortly before the sale. The seller financed the address used to purchase the NFT before the sale.\n\nNFT wash trading is sort of like a WhatsApp vendor sending you money to buy their products to make it seem like they\u2019re making sales. In the case of NFTs, however, one person can easily finance multiple wallets they own to purchase their listed NFTs.\n\nTo check the transactions an NFT has gone through on a marketplace like OpenSea, go to the item activity tab below the NFT, and you\u2019ll see the details of how the NFT has been bought and sold from several addresses. For more information on the NFT, click the diagonal arrow under the date column, and it takes you directly to the blockchain on which that NFT exists. You can go further by looking into the individual activity of each address associated with the NFT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSea: NFT marketplace\n\nThis is like checking the account history of someone who has sent you money; you see where their money goes and where it comes from. However, going through all these transactions is a gruelling task that should be left to experts.\n\nThe best way to avoid wash trading is to buy NFTs created by a known artist.\n\nFor example, you can decide to buy the works of an artist you\u2019ve seen, read about, or follow on social media. That way, you are sure of the value of the NFT you\u2019ve purchased based on the owner and not on trading volume.\n\nWhat does wash trading mean for the NFT market?\n\nWash trading with NFTs doesn\u2019t seem to have affected the NFT market so far. If anything, the market is doing better than ever.\n\nOpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace in the world, surpassed $3.5 billion monthly trading volume in January 2022. While NFT trade volumes continue to grow despite the scams, Chainalysis\u2019 report reveals that most wash trades didn\u2019t yield as much as the work that went into them.\n\nMost NFT wash trades have been unprofitable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWash trading profits. Source: Chainalysis\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, selling an NFT to a self-financed account does not make it a wash trade; however, if it happens more than 25 times, the probability that it falls into that category is high. The research firm arrived at this conclusion after analysing the transactions of 262 sellers who sold NFTs to a self-financed account at least 25 times.\n\nInterestingly, while only 110 of the 262 sellers made more than $8 million from their wash trades, 152 incurred losses of over $400,000 from the deceptive trade. It is important to note that only NFTs bought and sold on the Ethereum network were analysed by Chainalysis; the story could very well be different on other chains such as Solana.\n\nAccording to the analysis, wash trading isn\u2019t a dominant phenomenon yet. However, if it becomes more prominent, it could encourage regulators to define NFT\u2019s asset class.\n\nWash trading isn\u2019t the only crime-related activity that can attract the attention of regulators. NFTs are gradually becoming a suitable option for money laundering. The Chainalysis Report also identified an increase in the value of NFTs purchased by illicit addresses totalling $1.4 million in Q4 2021.\n\nNFTs are not the only cryptocurrency used to carry out crimes. And according to Chainalysis, $8.6 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have so far been used in money laundering schemes in 2022.\n\nEvery form of economic value transfer can be a tool for committing crimes, and NFTs are no different. The fact that NFTs are being used for criminal activities does not impede its potential to become a tool for creators to get appreciation for their works or solve other economic problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

A school of thought has it that Tuesdays are the most productive days of the week. Do you plan to make it so?\n\nBut again, why should I tell you what to do with your day? For me, while I work, I\u2019ll probably think about legal ways to have fun on my birthday (tomorrow) without leaving the house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore then, these are what I\u2019m discussing today:\n\nCredit facility for African women entrepreneurs\n\n716,000 African developers and counting\n\nWhat\u2019s up with the new features on your favourite apps?\n\nA quick one. In the late hours of yesterday, a Bloomberg article headlined, \u201cNigerian fintech company Tingo is seeking $500 million to expand across Africa\u201d threw the Nigerian tech Twitter into an uproar. Some concerns were raised concerning the numbers claimed by the company.\n\nThere\u2019s the question of how a Nigerian-founded fintech company with millions of users, founded over two decades ago, recorded $594 million in revenue plus $212 million EBITDA in 2020, and valued at $6.3 billion barely made the news? Well, the company got a feature on Techpoint in 2019. Still, trust us to do some more digging.\n\nUK\u2019s CDC X FirstBank for women entrepreneurs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA couple of African startups and venture capital firms are in the United Kingdom\u2019s development finance arm, CDC Group\u2019s portfolio. Recall Ghana\u2019s mPharma and TLcom\u2019s raises. A few months back, the institution also committed $50.9 million to support Africa\u2019s digital infrastructure. There\u2019s a new development.\n\nYesterday, it announced backing Nigeria\u2019s first commercial bank, First Bank of Nigeria Ltd, with a $100 million credit facility to support women entrepreneurs and SMEs in the country. Of this amount, a minimum of $30 million will go into credit lines for women-owned and led businesses.\n\nThe Group\u2019s intention with this deal is to empower women in business, promote social and financial inclusion, and alleviate poverty. The credit facility will be disbursed through the bank\u2019s over 700 branches and 150,000 agents across the country.\n\nLearn more about this here\n\nHow will FirstBank leverage this deal? Ordinarily, SMEs are less likely to get bank loans like large firms, but there\u2019s been a paradigm shift with the onset of digital banks and lending platforms. Traditional banks are also not left behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile FirstBank is yet to issue an official comment on how to disburse the funds, there\u2019s a possibility of it going into existing SME-focused product financing options accessible to FirstSME account holders and other users. Want to be a part of this? Maybe this could help.\n\n716,000 African developers and counting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Google has published the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, based on a study conducted across 16 sub-Saharan African markets \u2014 including Nigeria, Rwanda, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda \u2014 surveying software developers and local tech experts.\n\nThe findings show an all-time increase in demand for African developers globally and over 2.5x growth in VC funding, all of which happened despite the challenge that came with the pandemic.\n\nThe report also highlighted the role of Nigeria in this growth, evidenced by how Nigeria\u2019s developer ecosystem alone added about 5,000 new professional developers to its pool in 2021.\n\nIn the coming days, look out for informed articles drawn from these findings and more on Techpoint Africa.\n\nHow kindly do you take to these features?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2021, Twitter introduced Tip Jar to the app to allow people to get paid for tweeting through third-party payment services. The feature was rolled out to more users in September. Given the feature\u2019s initial use case, we were quite optimistic about how it could encourage everyday bitcoin transactions.\n\nTwitter\u2019s new tipping feature could make spending Bitcoin attractive\n\nSubsequently, the microblogging platform allowed users to add their Ethereum wallets to receive tips.

          "title": "GDP growth fails to lift job-creating sectors",
          "text": "The Nigerian economy recorded 3.4 percent growth in 2021, the highest since 2014. But growth has been sluggish in sectors that have the capacity to create jobs and lift many people out of poverty.\n\nManufacturing, agriculture and construction have the capacity to absorb Nigeria\u2019s growing unemployed population but have been unable to reach their 2014 growth levels.\n\nAccording to a full-year 2021 report from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), agriculture, manufacturing, construction, which recorded growth of 4.3 percent, 14.7 percent and 13.03 percent, respectively, in 2014, plummeted to 2.13 percent, 3.35 percent and 3 percent in 2021.\n\nWhile sectors like metal ores, electricity, gas, steam and conditioning supply and coal mining reported some of the highest growth in 2021 with an expansion of 34 percent, 27 percent and 20 percent, respectively. These sectors do not need as much labour as manufacturing, agriculture or construction.\n\nHowever, sectors like trade and transport have seen their growth rate rise from 5.88 percent and 7.5 percent in 2014 to 8.6 percent and 16.26 percent, respectively, in 2021.\n\nIn terms of value, the performance of these sectors has also been underwhelming without significant growth compared with 2014.\n\nThe manufacturing sector, which grew by N6.7 trillion in 2014, plunged to N6.5 trillion in 2021. Trade grew marginally to N11.4 trillion in 2021 compared with N11 trillion in 2014, while the agriculture sector expanded to N18.7 trillion in 2021 compared with N15.4 trillion in 2014.\n\nThis means there is no relief in sight for unemployed Nigerians.\n\n\u201cChallenges such as high inflation, unemployment, and underemployment have persisted in Nigeria as a result of a skewed growth performance, with growth concentrated in a few sectors which do not have the capacity to create jobs with decent incomes,\u201d a 2022 outlook report by Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) states.\n\nSimilarly, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, tells BusinessDay that the job-creating sectors are still not out of the woods even with the purported recovery, noting, \u201cA lot still needs to be done by policymakers to help these sectors unleash their growth potentials.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s unemployment rate surged to 33.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with 6.4 percent as at 2014. The rate was projected to hit 40 percent at the end of 2021, according to the Presidential Economic Advisory Committee (PEAC).\n\nSince oil-dependent Nigeria recovered from the 2016 recession, the growth of the sectors has been stifled by various challenges.\n\nThe agricultural sector, a major employer of labour, has been plagued by low productivity and rising insecurity ranging from terrorism, banditry to herdsmen attacks that put farmers and their investments in peril.\n\nInflation rate was 15.60 percent in January 2022, still far from the ideal single-digit inflation rate. The country\u2019s surging inflation rate has also increased the number of poor people to 90.1 million and that number is expected to increase by 11 million by 2022, the World Bank states.\n\nThe manufacturing sector has also continuously faced several structural challenges leading to low productivity, which has caused manufacturing shutting down, limiting growth and investment inflow into the sector.\n\nRead also: EXPLAINER: Why Nigeria\u2019s GDP has been unsustainable in the last 6 years\n\n\u201cThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the policies taken by the Federal Government are still affecting businesses. A lot of manufacturing companies are leaving the country for Ghana and other neighbouring African countries to survive,\u201d Abidemi Ajai, HR manager at Nosak Farm Produce Limited, says.\n\nAjai adds, \u201cThe survival rate for manufacturing in Nigeria is something else and that also will have an effect on the rate manufacturing helps the unemployment situation in the country.\u201d\n\nLikewise, sectors with the capacity to drive growth through human development, health and education have also not seen any significant growth.\n\nThe education sector contracted 0.75 percent in 2021 compared with a growth of 8.8 percent in 2014 while the health sector also grew 4.93 percent in 2021 compared with 10.5 percent in 2014.\n\nThe Nigerian education sector has received poor budgetary allocations to run the system. For instance, in the 2022 budget, the education sector got an allocation of N1.29 trillion (7.9%) out of N16.39 trillion, in the 2021 budget it got N 771.5 billion (5.68%) out of N13.58 trillion.\n\n\u201cThe last few years were characterised by worsening poverty, high inflationary pressures, and massive erosion of purchasing power, high energy prices, escalating production cost, sharp currency depreciation and many more,\u201d Muda Yusuf, CEO at Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, says.\n\n\u201cTherefore, going forward, policymakers should prioritise these key development indicators. Citizen\u2019s welfare and investment productivity in the economy matter even more than the GDP numbers,\u201d he states.",

          "title": "Why Nigeria needs robust credit assessment infrastructure",
          "text": "Tunji is a 25-year-old gainfully employed Nigerian who wants to buy a car. He earns N250,000 per month, and the car he wants to buy is N3.5million.\n\nHe lives in Nigeria where the inflation rate is double-digit, so he has to save a chunk of his salary every month for two years to buy his first car.\n\nNow, he is ready to buy the car. But it is now N4.5m as a result of inflation and foreign exchange fluctuations. He borrows from his friends to cover up the difference. Even though Tunji eventually buys his car after two years, and can claim to own it, he has also tied down a huge chunk of his two-year salary and has a loan to pay off.\n\nUnlike Tunji, Peter is a 20-year-old gainfully employed British and desires to have a car. He approaches a bank, submits his national insurance number, and gets a car finance loan. Every month, He uses a fraction of his salary to service his car finance loan and uses the rest to pursue other financial desires.\n\nStrong economies are built on credit, weak economies are built on cash. The Nigerian economy is largely cash-driven, and credit averse. Credit is access to money, goods, and services that an individual or company cannot pay for in the present but will ultimately pay for.\n\nIt is cash in liquid form, flowing to resources when needed, unhindered. It is a contractual agreement in which a borrower receives a sum of money or an equivalent in value and repays the lender at a later date, usually with interest.\n\nIn Nigeria, all-inclusive access to affordable finance and credit is a challenge. According to a survey by BusinessDay, seven in 10 customers of Nigerian banks do not have access to credit as only 1.89 million of the total 47.66 million Bank Verification Number holders got loans in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nThe small and Medium-Sized enterprises which contribute 48 percent to GDP and account for 96 percent of businesses and 84 percent of employment in Nigeria are the most affected. While they play a crucial role in the health and development of the economy, only 49.5 percent of them have access to bank credit.\n\n48 percent of these businesses rely on family and friends for credit. The World Bank defines financial inclusion to mean individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs \u2014 transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance.\n\nAccording to the global bank, the high financial exclusion rate in Nigeria means more people will be trapped in the poverty net as a lack of access to credit and insurance puts individuals at an economic disadvantage.\n\nAs of 2020, 38 million Nigerian adults were still financially excluded. These individuals lack access to financial services such as credit for themselves and businesses. Without access to affordable credit, an individual is constantly on the cusp of financial disaster as one emergency can send them and their family into a debt trap that can take years to emerge from.\n\nMost people in developing economies cannot access credit because of a lack of credit infrastructure in these economies. These economies lack proper systems to determine if an individual is creditworthy, disenfranchising them from access to credit.\n\nRead also: Banks to benefit as insurers mull export credit guarantee policy, others\n\nCredit infrastructure involves a set of laws and institutions that facilities efficient and effective access to finance, financial stability, and socially responsible economic growth through credit reporting, secured transactions and collateral registries; and insolvency and debt resolution.\n\nCredit infrastructure is an enabler of financial services and lending, the building blocks of the modern economy. Without this infrastructure, banks and lending institutions are largely constrained when assessing credit applications, as they are unable to effectively consider all the risk factors involved. Meaning access to credit for individuals and businesses in developing economies will continue to be limited.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in emerging economies are suffering the consequence of a frail legal and institutional framework for lending and debt resolution because of the lack of predictability for lenders, the inability to leverage productive assets, and the absence of credit information.\n\nThese constraints ensure that businesses will struggle to scale, and individuals will remain susceptible to debt traps. Access to credit for individuals and SMEs is imperative if they are to scale and grow and improve the economic status of the nation. But a functional credit infrastructure system is needed to access credit, especially in its affordable form.\n\nTo compensate for a lack of credit infrastructure, banks and lending facilities resort to high-interest rates, to deter borrowing, and stall growth. Small businesses in Nigeria complain that they eventually turn down bank loans over high interest. Less than 5 percent of small businesses have used credit to stimulate business growth as interest rates of upwards of 20 percent continue to deter the rest.\n\nThis inevitably makes it hard for them to meet immediate demand, let alone future demand, constricting their growth. This financial exclusion has significant outcomes for the real sector as lack of access to credit can be a disincentive to entrepreneurship, investment, and economic growth.\n\nCompanies like Periculum, a Canadian fintech startup and credit assessment company, are addressing the challenge of domestic credit to the underserved markets.\n\nFocused on improving financial inclusion in emerging markets through automated credit assessment tools that close the consumer credit gap and help financial institutions provide credit facilities to the financially excluded while making smarter decisions, Periculum helps financial services operators identify fraud risk, assess creditworthiness, and analyze existing data.\n\nPericulum offers real-time decision-making, analysis, and credit underwriting solutions to financial institutions including banks, non-banking financial companies, and fintech companies.\n\nBy providing information on the financial worthiness of customers and automating the loan decision process, Periculum\u2019s customers can gather and analyze borrower information and assign a credit score faster, with real outcomes on financial inclusion in Nigeria and other markets.\u201d\n\nCorroborating the need for credit infrastructure, Michael Temitope Collins, Periculum\u2019s founder and chief executive officer, said \u201cAfrica needs domestic credit to stimulate real economic growth. And this is not only bank-to-business credit; it can also be digital lending for short-term credit as well as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d schemes. The absence of tech-enabled credit assessment infrastructure has limited the quality and quantity of lending and may be behind the risk premiums borrowers have to pay, and the harassment practised by predatory lenders in countries like Nigeria. Periculum will change that.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe are a top provider of data analytics and credit assessment services targeted explicitly to underserved markets. We help our customers to reduce their lengthy loan application processing times and loan default rates and offer loans to the underbanked and unbanked consumers as well as micro, small and medium-scale enterprises. With reliable, tech-enabled, credit assessment services, financial institutions can increase lending to those that need credit.\u201d\n\nThe International Finance Corporation says about 40 percent of formal MSMEs in developing countries, have a finance shortage of $5.2trillion every year. In Nigeria, small businesses have a funding gap of N617billion.\n\nIt is necessary for developing economies to adopt proper credit policies to address credit infrastructure gaps and kickstart economic growth. In 2019, the CBN mandated all deposit money banks to maintain a loan to deposit ratio of 65 percent, in an attempt to improve lending to the real sector of the economy.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the policy has resulted in loans and advances rising by over N1.1tn between June to October 2019, and a 4 percent drop in interest rates. In a five year-strategy document (2019-2024), the CBN prioritized access to finance and financial inclusion as the main thrust of its activities over the next five years.\n\nIndustry experts believe credit bureaus have a significant role to play in improving credit infrastructure in Nigeria as they provide support to banks in terms of providing information and assessment of the creditworthiness of SMEs for loan applications and disbursement.\n\nA World Bank finding revealed that the introduction of credit bureaus reduces financing constraints for small businesses from 49 percent to 27 percent, and the probability of obtaining a bank loan from 28 percent to 40 percent.\n\nThe finding added that there was a 1,098 percent (60,000 to 719,000) loan access increase in five years for SMEs in Ecuador. With only three licensed national credit bureaus in Nigeria, there is still a huge gap for SMEs and individuals.\n\nThe availability of domestic credit is a key requirement for consistent economic growth in developing countries. The vitality of financial services such as banking, savings, debt and equity financing, investment management, and point-of-sale lending is largely dependent on the maturity of its domestic credit industry.\n\nNigeria\u2019s domestic credit market pales in comparison to similar countries of the same size. For instance, credit to the private sector in Nigeria is about 12 percent of GDP, lower than South Africa\u2019s 129 percent and Malaysia\u2019s 134 percent. High ratios of credit to the private sector in these countries have helped to ramp up real sector growth, create innovative innovation possibilities for technology-enabled businesses, accelerate financial development, ensure the efficient functioning of the economy and guarantee the prosperity of the private sector.\n\nRecently, many lending applications have sprouted to fill the credit access gap for individuals and SMEs in the nation. While they promise easy access to finance, they also come bearing new problems such as unreasonably interest rates and crude loan retrieval methods.\n\nStrong infrastructures allow for economic growth. When a new road is built in a community, more homes will sprout. As more homes sprout, there will be demand for increased production, driving the establishment of new businesses. Infrastructures are bridges; they open up new frontiers for development, expansion, and possibility.\n\nBuilding a robust credit infrastructure in Nigeria is the bridge to creating new financial and scale possibilities (option) for businesses, and individuals.",

I want you to work together as a team. We will not accept you playing politics. You are not the political heads of these agencies and ministries; leave politics for politicians and do your jobs as professionals.\n\n\u201cNote that a lot of work has been done. We expect you to key into our Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda and adjust whatever we have done that you think is not adequate. You are not coming to reinvent the will and start the process; no you are not. There is a MEGA Agenda and we all have to key into that agenda so that we can reach our destination much quicker than we have planned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese appointments are not made on the basis of political affiliation; they were made principally on track records,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor, who warned detractors to desist from propagating disunity and disharmony among the people, said his administration will no longer tolerate the antics of political detractors who benefit from stirring controversies and divisions where none exist.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe will not allow ourselves to be divided again.

So, the initiative of the CBN is to leverage on our non-oil products especially in agriculture like hibiscus flower, cashew nut sesame and many other products for exports.\n\n\u201cNow, Fidelity Bank wants to remain the exporters\u2019 bank of choice not only by providing finance but by helping exporters in bridging the knowledge gap in exporting their commodities. We are committed to this initiative to improve our economy, reduce pressure on local currency and provide an enabling environment to grow the non-oil sector to also create massive job opportunities\u201d, Ringim explained.\n\nSpeaking on the need for strategic planning in the non-oil sector, Head of Export and Agric Businesses at Fidelity Bank, Isaiah Ndukwe said the bank is well positioned to advance the CBN policy thrust to reduce our over-dependence on oil revenue in the country.\n\nHe stated that the bank is committed to improving the banking system\u2019s competitiveness while focusing on developing exporters\u2019 capability in the fundamentals of local commodity exportation. Isaiah emphasized that the new policy will not only reshape exporters\u2019 mindsets, but will also infuse value addition on their commodities, allowing them to earn more forex.\n\nAccording to him, the workshop tagged, Harnessing Export Business Opportunities, CBN RT200 FX Programme: current issues, non-oil exports and implications to business; drew inspiration on the policy\u2019s guidelines.\n\nThe guidelines involve the provision of a single digit credit facility to exporters, provision of rebates on foreign currency, funding of commodity production and value-addition processes, building terminals and the convening of a biannual summit for the review of the implementation of the policy.\n\nExporters at the sensitization event expressed satisfaction on the capacity-building initiative as it enabled them to get acquainted with the CBN policy and opportunities in export business.\n\nFidelity Bank is a full-fledged commercial bank operating in Nigeria with over 6million customers who are serviced across its 250 business offices and digital banking channels.",

In the 21st century the minimums are competency and capacity, and not exclusion. Zoning is exclusion not inclusion.

          "text": "The Nigerian Young Professionals Forum (NYPF), has lauded the enviable strides of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, towards supporting the development of human capacity, especially among young people in the Niger Delta region.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the 2nd Niger Delta MSME Summit held in Asaba, Delta State over the weekend, chairman of the NYPF and convener of the Summit, Mr Moses Siloko Siasia, appreciated the support to ensure the success of the Summit by Emefiele, stressing that the CBN Governor who is from Delta State, has been relentless in promoting human capacity building and creating purposeful opportunities for young people in the Niger Delta and Nigeria at large.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele is one of the most diligent and determined public servants in Nigeria whose track record in human capacity building and creating purposeful opportunities for young people is unparalleled.\n\n2023: CSOs Debunk Fake News Against Emefiele\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNotable among numerous interventions initiated by the CBN under Emefiele\u2019s leadership to productively engage youths and promote the spirit of entrepreneurship is the National Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) which saw the apex bank released N3.0 billion to 7,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,411 were individuals and 2,646 SMEs.\n\n\u201cEmefiele\u2019s presence is also felt in Nigeria\u2019s youth-dominant creative industry where N3.22 billion was disbursed to 356 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, software development, fashion, and IT verticals, under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI).\n\n\u201cIt also worthy to note that the Emefiele-led CBN in collaboration with Heritage Bank, inaugurated the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Programme (YEDP) in March 2016 and has through the programme developed the entrepreneurial capacity of the youths as well as provided them with funds up to N3m each.\n\n\u201cCharity as they say, begins at home. It is for that reason Mr Emefiele has thrown his weight towards redirecting the kidnapping, militancy and destructive tendencies of youths in the Niger Delta region by supporting thousands several MSME programmes including the the 2022 Niger Delta MSME Summit.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe young professionals also commended the Nigerian Content and Development Board (NCDMB) led by Engr. Simbi Wabote, as well as the Heritage Bank led Ifie Sekibo, both of whom are from the Niger Delta.\n\nSo far, millions of business owners around the country have benefitted from the CBN Covid-19 Intervention Fund since the outbreak of the pandemic, to mitigate the impact on households and their businesses.\n\nHigh point of the event was the sharing of heart-touching stories by some successful business owners in the Niger Delta. They appreciated stakeholders for the platform, stressing that they have grown successful businesses with youths under their employment, thereby creating jobs.\n\nFive young entrepreneurs with standout businesses, got a grant of N500,000 each to expand their businesses. Also, an engineering firm, BlueCamel Energy Limited, owned by Mr Suleiman Yusuf, set aside another N25m to support five start-up engineers. Another N10m was set aside by the NYPF to support prospective businesses.\n\nThe Saturday\u2019s event saw the convergence of over one thousand participants from the nine Niger Delta states who gathered to build on the success of the inaugural Summit held last year, where over 300 Niger Deltans benefited from the NIRSAL intervention loan for small business owners in the area of Agriculture.\n\nThe 2022 Niger Delta MSME Summit which is the 48th event to be organised by the NYPF, was jointly organised by the Niger Delta Young Professionals (NYDP).

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the inability of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to conduct a routine national convention as planned further explained why all sectors of national life in Nigeria have been in shambolic state under the APC administration.\n\nThe opposition party said APC\u2019s postponement of its national convention yet again validates its stance that the APC is not a political party but a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of strange bed fellows, \u201cpolitical buccaneers\u201d and ferocious power mongers on a mission to wreck the nation.\n\nThe PDP in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, on Tuesday, said the APC which cannot conduct its own internal affairs could not be expected to successfully manage the affairs of a nation like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe APC is a perfect example of failure both as a party and government unable to conduct a simple National Convention in two years. It has become a Russian Roulette with unending request for extension of time to undertake a routine statutory political activity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOur Party is not surprised that the APC, a party of backstabbers, again postponed its National Convention already scheduled for February 26, 2022. It is rather saddening how a set of confused, greedy, deceitful, hard-heartened and self-centered individuals who cannot run a creditable organization foisted themselves in power and plunged our nation into the economic, security and social mess that we face today.\n\n\u201cAs a vacuous political contraption without a soul, peopled by \u201cpolitical warlords\u201d without conscience and operating without rules, the APC is a bunch of inchoate sailors clobbered together for remote personal gain; operating without a Board of Trustees (BoT) and a National Working Committee (NWC); exists in violation of rules while constituting itself to a threat to our national unity and corporate existence as a nation.\n\n\u201cAPC\u2019s postponement of its National Conventions had always been a fallout of the horrible infighting, backbiting and gang war by \u201cpolitical bandits\u201d who are desperate for power and access to our national treasury. That explains why their congresses and other activities are always marred by violence, bloodletting and killings.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the APC is not capable of holding a National Convention having become defunct since December 8, 2020 when it dissolved all its states, zonal and national party structures and set up an illegal contrivance called the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State,\u201d it said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPDP added that activities of the Mai Mala Buni-led Committee remain invalid and unconstitutional by virtue of Section 183 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) which bars a sitting governor from holding \u201cany other executive office\u201d in any capacity whatsoever while serving as a state governor.\n\nThe party stressed that the failure of the APC to hold a National Convention is, therefore, a clear warning to those aspiring for various positions in the 2023 elections on its platform to note that with the APC, they are on a journey to nowhere.\n\n\u201cThe only way the APC can legitimately participate in the 2023 general is to re-apply to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for fresh registration as a political party.\n\n\u201cIn any case, Nigerians are hopeful for a better future because the PDP is back and repositioned to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the stranglehold of the APC in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigerians are yearning for the return of good governance with the PDP so that they can again be secure, enjoy economic prosperity, infrastructural development, employment, food security and national cohesion which they experienced in the 16 years of the PDP in power,\u201d the opposition party added.",

          "text": "The United States and its European allies are set to announce fresh sanctions against Russia on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, deepening Western fears of a new war in Europe.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said two soldiers were killed and 12 wounded in shelling by pro-Russian separatists in the east in the past 24 hours, the most casualties this year, as ceasefire violations increased.\n\nPutin\u2019s announcement on Monday, and his signing of a decree on the deployment of Russian troops to the two breakaway regions, drew international condemnation and immediate U.S. sanctions, with President Joe Biden signing an executive order to halt U.S. business activity in the breakaway regions.\n\nRising fears of war pushed oil prices to a seven-year high on Tuesday, while safe-havens currencies including the yen rallied and global stocks tumbled.\n\n\u201cThe United States will impose sanctions on Russia for this clear violation of international law and Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d Linda Thomas-Greenfield, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters after an emergency meeting of the Security Council late on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe can, will, and must stand united in our calls for Russia to withdraw its forces, return to the diplomatic table and work toward peace.\u201d read more\n\nBut a senior U.S. official said the deployment of Russian troops to the breakaway regions did not merit the harshest sanctions the United States and its allies had prepared in the event of a full-scale invasion, as Russia already had troops there.\n\nA senior British government minister said it was clear Putin had chosen confrontation over dialogue and Britain would respond with sanctions.\n\n\u201cYou can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun,\u201d Health Secretary Sajid Javid said.\n\nHe said the situation was as grave as the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nRussia has denied planning to attack its neighbour but it has massed troops on Ukraine\u2019s borders and threatened \u201cmilitary-technical\u201d action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including that Ukraine will never join NATO.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the recognition of the two regions did not affect Russia\u2019s readiness for talks with the United States, the Tass news agency reported.\n\nAn EU diplomat said separately the meeting would consider how to act on a statement made by EU leaders on Monday that the bloc would \u201creact with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act\u201d.\n\nChina said it was concerned about the worsening situation and called for all parties to exercise restraint while Japan said it was ready to join international sanctions on Moscow in the event of a full-scale invasion.\n\nVassily Nebenzia, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, warned Western powers to \u201cthink twice\u201d and not worsen the situation.\n\nA Reuters witness saw tanks and other military hardware moving through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk. No insignia were visible on the vehicles.\n\nWEST CONSIDERS HOW TO ACT\n\nBritain said it had drawn up sanctions to target those complicit in the violation of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity, and those measures would come into force on Tuesday.\n\nEuropean Union member states\u2019 ambassadors will meet to discuss possible sanctions with limited sanctions a possible option, an EU official said. read moreAn EU diplomat said separately the meeting would consider how to act on a statement made by EU leaders on Monday that the bloc would \u201creact with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act\u201d.\n\nChina said it was concerned about the worsening situation and called for all parties to exercise restraint while Japan said it was ready to join international sanctions on Moscow in the event of a full-scale invasion.\n\nVassily Nebenzia, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, warned Western powers to \u201cthink twice\u201d and not worsen the situation.\n\nA Reuters witness saw tanks and other military hardware moving through the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk. No insignia were visible on the vehicles.\n\nRussia needed to ratify its friendship treaties with the regions before it could discuss matters like the exact borders of the territories, RIA news agency reported, citing the foreign ministry. Russia\u2019s parliament is expected to review friendship treaties on Tuesday.\n\nIn a lengthy televised address on Monday packed with grievances against the West, a visibly angry Putin said eastern Ukraine was ancient Russian land.\n\nPutin delved into history as far back as the Ottoman empire and expressed frustration that Russia\u2019s demands for a rewriting of Europe\u2019s security arrangements had been repeatedly rebuffed.\n\n\u201cI deem it necessary to make a decision that should have been made a long time ago \u2013 to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d Putin said.\n\nPutin has for years worked to restore Russia\u2019s influence over nations that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union, with Ukraine holding an important place in his ambitions. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, and Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe rouble extended its losses as Putin spoke, at one point sliding beyond 80 per dollar.\n\nA French presidential official said the speech \u201cmixed various considerations of a rigid and paranoid nature\u201d.",
