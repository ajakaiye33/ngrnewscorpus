          "title": "Despite denial, FG earmarks N20bn for COVID-19 vaccine distribution",
          "text": "The Federal Government has set aside N20bn for the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines three months after denying a report by The PUNCH that N10.6bn had been set aside for distribution of vaccines across the country.\n\nCiting a proposal presented to governors by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, this newspaper had reported on March 6, 2021 that N10.6bn would be spent on transportation of COVID-19 vaccines to the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nThe budget attracted condemnation online with many wondering why such an amount of money would be spent on distributing vaccines across the country.\n\nIn his response, the Executive Director of the NPHCDA , Faisal Shuaib, dismissed the report, claiming that the private sector-led Coalition Against COVID-19 would handle transportation.\n\nShuaib said, \u201cI mean, I\u2019m hearing this from you for the first time. It doesn\u2019t make any sense that on the one hand, we\u2019ve communicated very clearly to Nigerians that CACOVID, a private sector initiative, has provided a cargo plane that will help deliver the vaccines from Abuja to all states that have functional airports.\n\n\u201cFor those that do not have functional airports, there is a delivery van that will convey the vaccines from those airports to the states without functionality. I do not see how that is going to cost N10bn. So there is no truth in that information.\n\n\u201cThe only cost we\u2019re going to incur is the cost of delivering the vaccines from any airport to nearby states that don\u2019t have functional airports. Clearly that cannot be N10.6bn. So it is not correct to say that the Federal Government is going to be expending N10.6bn to transport vaccines to the state. That is incredulous.\u201d\n\nHowever, a copy of the supplementary budget proposal which has been passed by the Senate shows that the budget for delivery of vaccines has increased to N20bn.\n\nThe line item reads in part, \u201cVaccines delivery cost to every ward (operational cost): Federal Government of Nigeria funding (100 per cent of the NEEDS). Ensuring availability of PHCs (Primary Healthcare Centres) and health workers to deliver vaccines- N20, 627, 323, 202.\u201d\n\nThe executive had while submitting the budget to the lawmakers had said that it was for security and COVID-19.\n\nSources within the National Assembly told The PUNCH that some of the money had already been disbursed through the service wide vote.\n\nThe CACOVID initiative led by billionaire businessman, Aliko Dangote, and the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, had revealed last April that the private sector had raised N27bn for the COVID-19 response.\n\nThe United Bank for Africa Plc donated N3bn through the UBA Foundation to support the fight against coronavirus in Nigeria. Billionaire, Mike Adenuga, donated N1.5bn to the Federal Government and Lagos State Government\n\nOther wealthy members of the private sector including Femi Otedola, Abdulsamad Rabiu, Herbert Wigwe, Segun Agbaje and Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man, all contributed N1bn each.\n\nFirst Bank and Keystone Bank donated N1bn each while Modupe and Folorunsho Alakija, Nigerian industrialists, announced a donation of N1bn to support the fight against coronavirus.\n\nAll Progressives Congress stalwart, Bola Tinubu, contributed N200m to the cause while lotto boss, Mr. Kessington Adebutu, donated N300m.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and its partners in the private sector announced a donation of $30m (N11bn) last week to help combat the coronavirus pandemic and its attendant impact on the Nigerian economy.\n\nHowever, some of the food items donated by CACOVID were hoarded and rebranded by several politicians across the country which was discovered during the #EndSARS protests of October 2020.\n\nAttempts to get a response from the NPHCDA boss proved abortive as he neither responded to calls nor a WhatsApp message on Wednesday.\n\nSimilarly, the Chief Executive Officer of the Aliko Dangote Foundation, Zouera Youssoufou, who speaks on behalf of CACOVID, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.\n\nDelta variant: NCDC tasks states on contact tracing, others.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control has advised state ministries of health to step up contact tracing and follow up cases of COVID-19 cases.\n\nDirector General of the NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, said this in an interview with The PUNCH, in Abuja, on Wednesday.\n\nHe noted that each state ministry of health had a responsibility to reach out and keep a tap on the number of infected persons to ensure they receive the necessary care to prevent further spread.\n\nIhekweazu who was responding to questions on the subject of contract tracing, said \u201cWhen a case is detected, irrespective of the variant, the responsibility of contact tracing and follow up lies on the state ministries of health.\n\n\u201cFor us at the NCDC, we will continue to carry out sequencing to detect variants, and use this data to guide our public health action.\n\n\u201cWe will also continue to ensure daily review of data and use them for decision making.\n\n\u201cTo prepare for a possible surge in cases, we have ensured regular supplies to all laboratories and treatment centres for rapid detection of cases and case management, risk communications among other response activities.\n\n\u201cWe also advise states to ensure that sample collection and testing are accessible so that people who have symptoms or have been exposed to a positive case get tested quickly.\u201d\n\nAsked how many cases of Delta variant of COVID-19 had so far been identified in Nigeria, he said the states were in a better position to give such details.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The Agency was granted access to the dossiers and prior assessment reports of Moderna and AstraZeneca from the WHO website at different times over the past two months.\n\n\u201cThe Agency did a thorough assessment of each vaccine and were found to have the quality, safety and efficacy attributes, with the benefits far outweighing the risks.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye also added that two other vaccines, Moderna and AstraZeneca of SK bioscience Co limited, Republic of Korea had been approved.\n\nShe said, \u201cModerna and AstraZeneca AZD1222 vaccines have received WHO EUL listing and were given expedited approvals.\u201d",

          "title": "Delta virus variant slams Asia as vaccine deliveries rise",
          "text": "As many Asian countries battle their worst surge of COVID-19 infections, the slow flow of vaccine doses from around the world is finally picking up speed, giving hope that low inoculation rates can increase and help blunt the effect of the rapidly spreading delta variant.\n\nWith many vaccine pledges still unfulfilled and rates of infection spiking across multiple countries, however, experts say more needs to be done to help nations struggling with the overflow of patients and shortages of oxygen and other critical supplies.\n\nSome 1.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine arrived Thursday afternoon in Indonesia, which has become a dominant hot spot with record-high infections and deaths.\n\nThe U.S. shipment follows 3 million other American doses that arrived Sunday, and 11.7 million doses of AstraZeneca that have come in batches since March through the U.N.-backed COVAX mechanism, the last earlier this week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite encouraging,\u201d said Sowmya Kadandale, health chief in Indonesia of UNICEF, which is in charge of the distribution of vaccines provided through COVAX. \u201cIt seems now to be, and not just in Indonesia, a race between the vaccines and the variants, and I hope we win that race.\u201d\n\nMany, including the World Health Organization, have been critical of the vaccine inequalities in the world, pointing out that many wealthy nations have more than half of their populations at least partially vaccinated, while the vast majority of people in lower-income countries are still waiting on a first dose.\n\nThe International Red Cross warned this week of a \u201cwidening global vaccine divide\u201d and said wealthy countries needed to increase the pace of following through on their pledges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame it didn\u2019t happen earlier and can\u2019t happen faster,\u201d Alexander Matheou, the Asia-Pacific director of the Red Cross, said of the recent uptick in deliveries. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as too late \u2014 vaccinating people is always worth doing \u2014 but the later the vaccines come, the more people will die.\u201d\n\nVietnam, Thailand and South Korea have all imposed new lockdown restrictions over the past week as they struggle to contain rapidly rising infections amid sluggish vaccination campaigns.\n\nIn South Korea \u2014 widely praised for its initial response to the pandemic that included extensive testing and contact tracing \u2014 a shortage in vaccines has left 70% of the population still waiting for their first shot. Thailand, which only started its mass vaccination in early June, is seeing skyrocketing cases and record deaths, and only about 15% of people have had at least one shot. In Vietnam, only about 4% have.\n\n\u201cParts of the world \u2026 are talking about reclaiming lost freedoms such as going back to work, opening the cinemas and restaurants,\u201d Matheou told The Associated Press. \u201cThis part of the world is far away from that.\u201d\n\nIndonesia started aggressively vaccinating earlier than many in the region, negotiating bilaterally with China for the Sinovac jabs. Now about 14% of its population \u2014 the fourth largest in the world \u2014 has at least one dose of a vaccine, primarily Sinovac. Several countries also have their own production capabilities, including South Korea, Japan and Thailand, but still need more doses to fill the needs of the region\u2019s huge population.\n\n\u201cBoth Moderna and AstraZeneca have been really critical in ramping up these numbers and ensuring that the supplies are available,\u201d said UNICEF\u2019s Kadandale, noting that Indonesia plans to have some additional 208.2 million people vaccinated by year\u2019s end and is giving 1 million shots daily. \u201cEvery single dose does make a huge difference.\u201d\n\nMany other countries in the region have vaccination rates far below Indonesia\u2019s for a variety of reasons, including production and distribution issues as well as an initial wait-and-see attitude from many early on when numbers were low and there was less of a sense of urgency.\n\nSome were shocked into action after witnessing the devastation in India in April and May as the country\u2019s health system collapsed under a severe spike in cases that caught the government unprepared and led to mass fatalities.\n\nAt the same time, India \u2014 a major regional producer of vaccines \u2014 stopped exporting doses so that it could focus on its own suffering population.\n\nThe U.S. has sent tens of millions of vaccine doses to multiple countries in Asia recently, part of President Joe Biden\u2019s pledge to provide 80 million doses, including Vietnam, Laos, South Korea and Bangladesh. The U.S. plans to donate an additional 500 million vaccines globally in the next year, and 200 million by the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cIndonesia is a critical partner for U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia and the vaccines come without strings attached,\u201d said Scott Hartmann, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this with the object of saving lives and ending the global pandemic, and equitable global access to safe and effective vaccines is essential.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, whose country is one of the largest financial backers of COVAX, accused Russia and China of using their delivery of vaccines for policy leverage.\n\n\u201cWe note, in particular with China, that the supply of vaccines was also used to make very clear political demands of various countries,\u201d he said, without providing specific examples.\n\nThere are also growing questions about the effectiveness of China\u2019s Sinovac vaccine against the delta variant of the virus.\n\nThai officials said that booster doses of AstraZeneca would be given to front-line medical personnel who earlier received two doses of Sinovac, after a nurse who received two doses of Sinovac died Saturday after contracting COVID-19.\n\nSinovac has been authorized by WHO for emergency use but Indonesia also said it was planning boosters for health workers, using some of the newly delivered Moderna doses, after reports that some of the health workers who had died since June had been fully vaccinated with the Chinese shot.\n\n\u201cWe have still found people getting severe symptoms or dying even when they are vaccinated,\u201d Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist with the University of Indonesia, said about the Sinovac shot. \u201cIt\u2019s only proven that some vaccines are strong enough to face the delta variant \u2014 AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer seem capable.\u201d\n\nWhile the majority of recent deliveries have been American, Japan was sending 1 million doses of AstraZeneca on Thursday each to Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam as part of bilateral deals, and Vietnam said it was receiving 1.5 million more AstraZeneca doses from Australia.\n\nThe Philippines is expecting a total of 16 million doses in July, including 3.2 million from the U.S. later this week, 1.1 million from Japan, 132,000 of Sputnik V from Russia, as well as others through COVAX.\n\nJapan is also is sending 11 million through COVAX this month to Bangladesh, Cambodia, Iran, Laos, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and others.\n\nCanada this week committed an additional 17.7 million surplus doses to the 100 million already pledged through COVAX, which is coordinated by Gavi, a vaccine alliance. France delivered 1.7 million doses worldwide through June with COVAX and is sending millions more this summer.\n\nIn addition to distributing some donated vaccines, financial contributions to COVAX also help fund the purchase of doses to distribute for free to 92 low or moderate income nations.\n\nEarlier this month, it took blistering criticism from the African Union for how long it was taking for vaccines to reach the continent, noting that just 1% of Africans are fully vaccinated.\n\nGavi said the vaccine shortfall so far this year is because the major COVAX supplier, the Serum Institute of India, diverted production to domestic use.\n\nIn its latest supply forecast, however, Gavi shows deliveries just beginning a sharp uptick and still on track to meet the goal of about 1.5 billion doses by year\u2019s end, representing 23% coverage in lower and middle income nations, and more than 5 billion doses by the end of 2022.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to focus on vaccinating the world and to avoid hoarding doses,\u201d said Matheou of the Red Cross. \u201cSharing vaccines makes everyone safer.\u201d\n\nAP\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "File image of Nnamdi Kanu when he was first brought to court on Tuesday, June 29, two days after his extradition to Nigeria from Kenya.\n\nBy Dennis Agbo\n\nThe leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, who is in the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, has said the people that abducted him in Kenya were told that he had links to the Islamists terrorists in that country.\n\nAccording to the Biafra state advocate, his kidnappers chained him to the floor and tortured him, but started to treat him well when they got to know his true identity.\n\nThese were revealed by Mr. Aloy Ejimakor, a special counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, who also disclosed that the detained IPOB leader was in high spirits at the DSS detention facility.\n\n\u201cHe was held in a nondescript private facility and chained to a bare floor but despite what he has passed through, he was in high spirits and looked forward to overcoming the extraordinary rendition that brought him to Nigeria,\u201d Ejimakor said.\n\nThe lawyer also stated that before any court could subject Kanu to trial, it would first conduct a trial-within-trial on the grievous incident that forced Kanu to leave Nigeria and the grievous incident that forced him back to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Ejimakor, \u201cNo court of law, conscience and equity will overlook those two incidents and proceed to trial.\u201d\n\nHe made the disclosures, on Wednesday, after he visited Kanu at the DSS detention camp in Abuja.\n\nEjimakor stated that at the DSS, \u201cKanu was interviewed for the first time in my presence by three DSS officers.\n\n\u201cThe interview was revealing as it contained certain new allegations that were never heard of before. But they all relate to his status as the leader of IPOB,\u201d Ejimakor said.\n\nHe further revealed that Kanu was flown alone from Kenya to Nigeria in a private jet on Sunday, June 27, from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi, and that he was the lone passenger.\n\nEjimakor said Kanu was blindfolded and driven to the tarmac very close to the plane without passing through Immigration, adding that the plane departed Nairobi at about 12pm and arrived Abuja in the evening.\n\nRevealing more details on the abduction, Ejimakor said: \u201cKanu was in point of fact tortured and subjected to untold inhuman treatment in Kenya.\n\n\u201cHe said his abductors disclosed to him that they abducted him at the behest of Nigerian government.\u201d\n\nOn whether Kanu had a hint of why he was abducted, the lawyer said that the IPOB leader told him that the people never said much on that except that they were told he was a Nigerian terrorist linked to the Islamic terrorists in Kenya.\n\n\u201cBut that after several days, when they discovered his true identity, they tended to treat him less badly,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing, Ejimakor said that no warrant of arrest was shown to Kanu or even mentioned to him, and that for the eight days he was held incommunicado, nothing of presenting him before a court or transferring him to an official detention facility was ever mentioned.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nTwo weeks after both chambers of the National Assembly passed different versions of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), northern lawmakers, yesterday, won at a joint sitting as they voted to peg the contentious Host Communities fund at three per cent instead of the five per cent demanded by their southern counterparts.\n\nThe Senate, during the consideration of the Bill, crashed the five per cent funds earmarked for host communities to three per cent with the push for the reduction spearheaded by northern senators.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, lawmakers passed five per cent as recommended by the Joint Committee on Petroleum.\n\nBased on parliamentary principle, a Conference Committee was constituted by Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila to reconcile the two positions.\n\nDaily Sun, however, learnt that the Conference Committee hit a cul de sac as lawmakers who voted during the Committee meeting did so along regional interests. While southern lawmakers voted in favour of five per cent to meet the aspirations of the Niger Delta people and in line with demands of Southern Governors Forum, their northern counterparts voted for the retention of three per cent as recommended by the Senate.\n\nIt was learnt that lawmakers who are members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but hail from the North also voted in support of three per cent.\n\nWith the deadlock, Daily Sun gathered that the report ought to have been returned to the floor of the Senate and House of Representatives for a vote after the annual vacation.\n\nIf the Senate had failed in breaking the deadlock, the Chamber would have been forced to opt for a division, where senators would have voted across regional lines.\n\nWorried by the development, southern senators planned a meeting to strategise on how to ensure the five per cent fund sailed through.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that in a last minute move, principal officers of both Chambers said they should be allowed to vote to break the tie. It was a decision that was bound to favour northern lawmakers who knew they had more principal officers from both Chambers.\n\nA source privy to the meeting said after the vote, the scores stood at 8-6 in favour of the northern position. With the development, the new funds for host communities would be passed at three per cent. However, Frontier Basins funds was retained at 30 per cent to the delight of northern senators.\n\nA member of the Conference Committee who spoke with Daily Sun in confidence, said the development amounted to a betrayal of what southern and northern lawmakers agreed on before the Bill was considered and passed.\n\nHe said lawmakers from both regions had settled for 30 per cent funding for Frontier Basins while host communities in the Niger Delta was expected to get their five per cent.\n\nThe senator said northern senators deceived them when Kaita Ahmed, who represents President Muhammadu Buhari constituency led an offensive against five per cent . He said they were further shocked when the Senate President , Ahmad Lawan, tactically took sides with his northern colleagues.\n\nHe said if the Lawan-led National Assembly failed to secure the needed five per cent for host communities, oil facilities in the Niger Delta region may be attacked by militants and oil revenue will dwindle.\n\nHe, however, blamed the development on Southern governors, who he said did not meet with their lawmakers to push for a common front.\n\nHe said while Northern governors reached out to their lawmakers, issuing threats and insisting that the five per cent canvassed by southern governors and senators must be resisted, Southern governors, instead, resorted to media propaganda and refused to meet or speak with their representatives.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022 Senate begins clause-by-clause consideration of Electoral Act Amendment Bill today\n\n\u2022 Lawan admits pressure, gets 900 text messages\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe controversial clause on the electronic transmission of election results as contained in the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, may sail through without much furore as the National Assembly considers today the draft legislation, THISDAY gathered yesterday.\n\nThe committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives in charge of the bill yesterday submitted their reports during the plenary of each chamber, setting the stage for the passage of the bill.\n\nTHISDAY had on Monday exclusively reported of plots by All Progressives Congress (APC) senators to delegitimise future elections and undermine the nation\u2019s democracy with their insistence on prohibiting electronic transmission of results.\n\nTheir moves had raised mounting concerns over what social critics called attempts by federal legislators to rig the 2023 general election ahead of time through the manipulation of the amendment bill.\n\nBut to counter their moves, opposition senators, especially from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had mobilised to ensure not only the return of the controversial clause to the bill but that there would be no subterfuge in deciding on electronic transmission of election results when the bill is up for debate in the Senate.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt that with the mounting clamour by the public for electronic transmission of election results, the opposition to it has begun to fizzle out as the federal lawmakers were said to have ended their weeks of partisan bickering to endorse the electronic transmission of results.\n\nAhead of the consideration of the bill today, THISDAY gathered that caucuses of the Senate met yesterday to agree on what their position should be.\n\nThe report on the bill was submitted at yesterday\u2019s plenary by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Senator Kabiru Gaya.\n\nShortly after the upper chamber rose from plenary, a meeting of the South-south caucus was held at Senate Committee Room 001 where senators across party divide agreed that the clause for the electronic transmission of election results as stipulated in the report should be sustained.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the caucus resolved to push for the retention of Clause 52(1-3), which makes provision for electronic transmission of election results as contained in the report submitted to the Senate.\n\nThe South-east, North-central and North-east caucuses were said to be meeting at different venues to also take a position on the amendment bill.\n\nFeelers from their meetings, however, showed that senators from the areas were not planning to upset the applecart on the endorsement of electronic transmission of results, despite the initial opposition of some of them.\n\nClause 52 of the bill, which was submitted to Senate and sighted by THISDAY, states: \u201c52(1) Voting at an election under this bill shall be by open secret ballot.\n\n\u201c(2) Voting at an election under this bill shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the commission, which may include electronic voting.\n\n(3) The commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable.\u201d\n\nAt the submission of the report to the Senate yesterday by Gaya, President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, accused Nigerians of embarking on \u2018calculated blackmail\u2019 against the leadership of the National Assembly over the bill.\n\nHe said he received in one day 900 text messages accusing him of manipulating the report of the committee.\n\nHe, however, advised Nigerians to lobby their senators on whatever input they have on the bill, which is to be considered and possibly passed today.\n\nLawan accused those he called mischief-makers bent on blackmailing the leadership of the National Assembly of sponsoring the allegation that the leadership of the National Assembly manipulated the contents of the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, there are various accusations, insinuations that the leadership of the Senate, some time, the leadership of the National Assembly had tampered with the report of the committee on INEC of both chambers.\n\n\u201cSome of those accusing the leadership of the National Assembly and misinforming innocent people are simply mischievous and rabble-rousers.\u201d\n\nLawan urged Nigerians to lobby lawmakers on any aspect of the bill they feel strongly about, insisting that the National Assembly would do only what is right when it eventually considers the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf anybody feels very strongly about anything, lobby distinguished senators to canvass your position, rather than blackmail our leadership.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the attempts by some people to blackmail the leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives resulted in the publication of his phone number and that of the House Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, on various online platforms.\n\nThis, he added, resulted in the invasion of his privacy with him receiving over 900 messages accusing him of manipulating the contents of the amendment bill.\n\n\u201cMy telephone line and that of the honourable speaker were published. In one day, I received over 900 messages saying we have manipulated this, we didn\u2019t. We will do what is right, we have our procedures and lobbying is part of democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the National Assembly can only consider aspects of the amendment bill contained in the committee\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time this report is laid here. This is the decision of the Committee on INEC and, therefore, whatever will be discussed or considered about the Electoral Act Amendment Bill will be on the basis of what has been presented to the Senate here,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe House of Representatives also received the report on the electoral bill.\n\nThe report was laid by the Chairman of the Committee on Electoral Matters, Hon. Aisha Dukku (APC Gombe).\n\nPresenting the report, she said: \u201cThat the House do receive the report of the Committee on Electoral Matters on a Bill for an Act to Repeal the Electoral Act No. 6, 2010 and Enact the Electoral Act 2021, to regulate the conduct of federal, state and area councils in the Federal Capital Territory elections; and for Related Matters.\u201d\n\nThe House is expected to consider the clauses of the bill today for possible passage, before lawmakers vacate for their summer holiday.\n\nGbajabiamila had promised during the consideration of the report on the Petroleum Industry Bill, the penultimate week that the lawmakers would pass the electoral bill into law before proceeding on their annual vacation.\n\nPDP Urges N\u2019Assembly to Vote in National Interest\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday called on senators and members of the House of Representatives to shun partisanship and vote in the national interest on Section 50 (2) of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, to legalise electronic transmission of results.\n\nThe party said it had learnt of plots by certain interests to reject the electronic transfer of results by both chambers of the National Assembly today.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement yesterday by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said every Nigerian, particularly the federal lawmakers, should work on improving the electoral process in order to engender free, fair, transparent and credible elections.\n\nAccording to it, there is no part of Nigeria or any local government headquarters that communication network does not exist and function, to warrant the exclusion of electronic transmission of election results from the law.\n\nIt said: \u201cIt is imperative to add that with the technology proposed by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), even where the network is slow, it does not stop the transmission process from arriving at the collation centre.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged the lawmakers not to allow themselves to be swayed by anyone or any interest bent on conducting the election in the manipulative manner as desired by undemocratic elements.\n\nThe party called on all Nigerians to remain at alert and be ready to use every legitimate means to resist the plot to strangulate the electoral process.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe N15 trillion Infrastructure Company Limited (InfraCo), created by the federal government to bridge the nation\u2019s huge infrastructure gap is to take off in the third quarter of the year, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said.\n\nEmefiele spoke yesterday at an investors\u2019 webinar designed to showcase the investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s privatisation and economic reforms programmes, organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in collaboration with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX).\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo also said at the event that although the government\u2019s economic reforms had paid off in telecommunications, pension and maritime sectors, the current administration was making efforts to address the challenges in the power sector privatisation.\n\nInvestors in the N15 trillion InfraCo include the CBN, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Africa Finance Corporation (AFC).\n\nIn his goodwill message at the webinar, Emefiele said the federal government had approved KPMG as the financial adviser to InfraCo, adding that the firm is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to attain meaningful growth, there must be huge investments in key sectors of the economy, including infrastructure such as rail and power, among others.\n\nAccording to him, InfraCo has generated huge interest in deploying private capital to for infrastructure, adding that the approval of the vice president has been secured to appoint KPMG as transaction advisers.\n\nEmefiele stated that over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic and developments in the global crude oil market had created negatively affected not only the global economy but also the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor Nigeria, we witnessed a drop in foreign exchange earnings, government revenues along with supply chain disruptions which ultimately led to the economy falling into a recession during the third quarter of 2020. Significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities in key sectors of our economy such as in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors eventually helped and led to the rebound of growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 as gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe sustenance of these measures have also helped to support growth of 0.51 per cent during the first quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, we consider this growth as fragile and therefore seek the support of those of us here at this webinar to continue to work with us to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that in June 2021, investments in the Importers and Exporters (I&E) window stood at over N3 trillion at an average rate of N412 to the dollar, adding that this meant that on an average working day of 20 working days, close to $150 million was posted in that market.\n\nIn their goodwill messages, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said Nigeria had huge gas investment potential waiting to be exploited.\n\nShe stated that despite the numerous challenges confronting the country, it still remains the premium investment destination in Africa.\n\nAhmed said the COVID-19 pandemic had provided greater need for the federal government to forge a more robust partnership with the private sector.\n\nIn his keynote address, Osinbajo said the investors\u2019 webinar was organised to showcase investment opportunities arising from Nigerians economic reforms and privatisation activities.\n\nHe said: \u201d I think that many who have observed the current Nigerian government would agree with me that an article of faith for this government is the importance of mobilising private capital and participation for improving efficiency and driving economic growth and this really explains why we have this collaboration today between the Bureau of Public Enterprises (which you know is in charge of our sectoral reform programme) with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) to host this seminar as an important platform drawing attention to investment opportunities to both our local and foreign friends and collaborators.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, privatising utilities of the size of the former PHCN simply calls for deeper intentional consideration of the right models and the right type of investors and also looking at funding for these investors over an extended period of time.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the challenges that we have seen, but I think that it\u2019s an excellent lesson and there is so much that we are learning in approaching privatisation, especially our utilities, going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome, address, the BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, said the BPE had listed over 36 assets for sale and giving them out to concessionaires under its 2021 work plan.\n\nHe stated that about N500 billion is expected to be contributed into the federal government coffers from the privatisation proceeds this year.\n\nAccording to him, 234 public assets have been sold in the last 32 years while N1 trillion was generated by the agency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The third category is elderly persons aged between 50 and 69 years of which 44,896 Nigerians have registered. Interestingly, some 6,184 senior citizens (aged 70 years and above) have taken advantage of the new online opportunity to register,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the occupational distribution of registrants, the INEC chairman said: \u201c156,446 are students; 38,217 artisans; 24,421 farmers and fishermen; 150,145 businessmen and traders; 35,831 employed as civil and public servants and 8,334 housewives.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 129,182 registrants did not specify their occupations. On gender, 321,781 are males while 220,795 are females. In our effort to serve all Nigerians better, the commission has requested registrants to indicate their disability (if any).\u201d\n\nHe explained that the essence of this will enable INEC to efficiently deploy assistive voting devices such as Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses for persons with special needs at polling units on election day.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have data for 6,558 registrants who have clearly indicated their type of disability.\u201d\n\nYakubu said a detailed information, including state and occupational distribution, had been uploaded on the commission\u2019s website and social media platforms, while the commission shall also continue to provide the weekly updates throughout the duration of the CVR exercise.\n\nAccording to him, the commission is aware that not all Nigerians have access to computers, smart phones or internet connectivity to register online.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly assured every eligible registrant that there will also be an opportunity for physical or in-person registration at designated centres. Even the online registrants will have to complete their registration physically at those centres.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to activate some 2,673 centres to which we intend to deploy 5,346 officials for in-person registration,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By John Shiklam\n\nA total of 222 people have been killed while 774 others have been kidnapped by bandits in Kaduna state in the past three months.\n\nThis was contained in the second quarter security report, presented to Governor Nasir El-Rufai by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan on Tuesday at the Government House Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the report covers the period between April 1 to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe report showed a slide reduction in the number of deaths and the number of people abducted.\n\nIn the first quarter report, present in April, a total of 323 persons were killed while 949 others were kidnapped by bandits across Kaduna State.\n\nAruwan also disclosed that a total of 8,553 heads of cattle were rustled in the period under review with most stolen from the Kaduna Central Senatorial District, which accounted for around\n\n5,715 stolen cattle.\n\nAruwan said the 222 deaths were caused by banditry attacks, communal clashes and reprisals across the state.\n\nAccording to him, 159 of the deaths, were recorded in Kaduna Central Senatorial District while Southern Kaduna Senatorial District and Northern Senatorial District recorded 54 and nine deaths respectively.\n\nThe commissioner said of the 774 people kidnapped, Kaduna Central Senatorial\n\nDistrict topped the list with 555 people abducted.\n\nBirnin Gwari, Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa and Igabi LGAs, where there are rampant cases of killings and kidnappings are in the Kaduna Central senatorial zone.\n\nHe said, \u201cSouthern Kaduna Senatorial District recorded 164 kidnapped persons, with Kachia LGA reporting the highest number of 111.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Senatorial District recorded 55 kidnapped persons, with 37 of these from Zaria LGA.\n\n\u201cIn total, 239 women, and 32 minors were kidnapped in the second quarter across the state\u201d.\n\nThe commissioner also disclosed that 20 persons were reported to have been raped across the state during the period, adding that a total of 266 were injured as a result of banditry, violent attacks, reprisals and communal clashes.\n\nAruwan also raised the alarm over looming food insecurity, threat to education and attack on health facilities in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cBanditry has hampered farming activities in the frontline areas of the state.\n\n\u201cBandits attack and abduct farmers working on or on their way to their fields. Several farmers have similarly been killed.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits have begun to extract protection levies from some communities in return for permission to cultivate their fields.\n\n\u201cMany farmers in these areas, fearing for their lives and safety, have abandoned their\n\nfields altogether.\n\n\u201cThis has already begun to affect crop yields, and the threat of food insecurity looms large.\u201d\n\nHe said the most affected communities are in the frontline Local Government\n\nAreas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia,\n\nKagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga.\u201d\n\nAruwan said attacks on some schools and mass abduction of students portends dire consequences for education in the state.\n\nHe said hospitals and other health facilities in frontline locations are equally under grave threat by armed bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBanditry has led to the near-total collapse of the local economy in frontline areas, which is mainly sustained by crop and livestock farming. \u201cThe activities of bandits in these areas have dispossessed residents of their foremost means of sustenance and disrupted the\n\noperation of the usually dynamic weekly markets.\n\n\u201cBesides the rustling of cattle, the previously highlighted targeting of farmers by armed bandits has generally eroded the economic viability of rural communities, in addition to precipitating a food crisis.\n\n\u201cThis has translated to losses running into billions of naira from the rural economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the State government\u2019s strategies to address the security challenges were being sustained.\n\nThe commissioner decried the politicization of insecurity saying \u201cpolitical mappings and strategies are now frequently being built around the unfortunate scenarios of insecurity, while real people and real communities suffer\n\ndevastation at the hands of sheer criminals.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cEthnic and religious narratives are also being built around banditry, to the further complication of security management.\n\n\u201cToo often, attacks by bandits are portrayed to the public by some quarters as ethnically or religiously motivated.\n\nSuch groups manipulate religious, ethnic and political sensitivities for their own advantage, simply to advance a cause inimical to peace and stability of the state.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks after receiving the reports, Governor Nasir El-Rufai said an unconventional approach is required to enable the state government protect its citizens.\n\nA Government House statement issued after the presentation of the report, quoted the governor as\n\ncalling on the federal government to empower the state government to make up for the manpower deficit in the security sector.\n\n\u201cThe state government must be empowered and supported by the federal government to make up the manpower deficit in the security sector\u201d, the statement quoted the governor.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccitizens who have been affected by crime and insecurity are not interested in the distinctions between the federal and state governments in terms of their powers over security.\n\n\u2018\u2019As a state government, we have also seen at close quarters how the federal security agencies are limited by manpower deficits.\n\n\u201cThere are simply not enough boots on the ground to have credible deployments in most places to protect communities, deter crime and enforce law and order.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019an unconventional approach is required to enable us better to protect our communities and we are engaging with the federal government and the leadership of the security agencies on this.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Westa.Solar sets its sights on West Africa after debut in Nigeria",
          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletter in your inbox daily\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Visa has partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks. That goes to demonstrate the appetite that is there.\u201d Mohamed added.\n\nAccording to Somalia\u2019s Central Bank Governor, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, the Visa partnership will connect Somalia to the global financial system and show the growing confidence in the country\u2019s banking and finance sector.\n\nThe presence of both Mastercard and Visa in Somalia will help position its market as arable land ready to receive seed and produce a bounty harvest.\n\n\u201cWe plan to install an electronic verification system that will ease biometric identification of customers opening bank accounts or transacting in Somalia. We believe this will help to build international trust and confidence in transactions originating from Somalia to other financial markets,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nWith more partnerships like this, popular conversations around Somalia can increasingly focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Central bank digital currencies differ from crypto. Here\u2019s how they work",
          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Flutterwave has appointed Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nIn a statement, the company said Falade\u2019s role will be to provide \u201cstrategic oversight and government relation strategies, while ensuring that the interest and needs of the business are aligned with that of the regulators.\u201d\n\nFalade joins Flutterwave from a similar role at IHS Towers, the Nigerian company that owns 29,700 telecom towers across nine countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Sub Saharan Africa.\n\nBefore IHS, he spent 10 years at MTN in various government and regulatory advisory roles, and four years representing VISA in conversations with West African regulators.\n\nIn appointing a regulatory lead with broad industry experience, Flutterwave expresses an enthusiasm for deeper engagement with African governments. Like other private organisations, tech companies have to answer to the constituted authorities wherever they operate.\n\nThe duty is arguably more pressing and sensitive if the company operates in the financial services industry, where consumer protection and fraud prevention are government priorities.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s payments processing business is live in 33 African countries. That spread commands a regulatory burden similar to what multinational financial services companies and telecommunications networks have to contend with. It may have figured in their selection process for a regulatory lead, choosing someone with experience spanning these sectors.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s CEO, Olugbenga Agboola, has high hopes for Falade\u2019s impact on the company: \u201c[He is] well placed to strengthen our existing relationships as well as support us create new relationships.\u201d\n\nAgboola has been intentional about praising regulators publicly.\n\nWhen the company announced its $170m Series C in March, he cheered the Central Bank of Nigeria for being \u201cat the forefront of the significant efforts that are currently being made by African governments to create the enabling environment for technology, innovation and financial inclusion.\u201d\n\nHe described the regulator as being part of the \u201cbackbone upon which companies like Flutterwave have been able to thrive\u201d in addition to employees, customers and investors.\n\nNo surprises then that Flutterwave would seek to strengthen its relationship with regulators like the CBN in Nigeria and those in the other countries the company operates in.\n\nFalade, in Flutterwave\u2019s statement announcing his appointment, said he believes companies and regulators share the same goal of growing businesses and economies through technology and is relishing his new opportunity to make that happen.\n\nShare this article",

But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "There are various paths for those looking to get into venture capital, and for regions like Africa where the concept is only just catching on, you are sure to find people with various backgrounds in the field.\n\nFor Dayo Koleowo \u2014 partner at early-stage venture capital firm, Microtraction \u2014 his journey to becoming a venture capitalist was unplanned.\n\nIn 2015, he started ChowHub, a meal discovery and delivery startup, in Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital city. Over two years, he experienced all the emotions that an entrepreneur can go through \u2014 from the joy of getting paying customers to frustration with the antics of the logistics services which the business depended on.\n\nLike so many other entrepreneurs, he also faced the challenge of raising money to sustain the business\u2019 operations. With little knowledge of how fundraising worked, the writings of Paul Graham, Founder of Y Combinator (YC), and Justin Kan, a former partner at YC and Co-founder of Twitch, became his bible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs his company died a slow death, Microtraction was getting started. After meeting Yele Bademosi through his co-founder at ChowHub, he jumped at the opportunity to learn on the job. Three weeks after the VC\u2019s official launch, he joined the team on August 10, 2017.\n\nToday, the knowledge he gained from Graham and Kan comes in handy as he runs the day-to-day operations at Microtraction with Chidinma Iwueke, another partner at the firm.\n\nWhat industries are most attractive to Microtraction?\n\nKoleowo reveals that Microtraction has always been sector-agnostic with the focus on finding founders who are solving problems. However, the firm has a bias for software startups as they believe that software can solve problems across various sectors.\n\nA look at Microtraction\u2019s portfolio reveals a good number of fintech startups; Koleowo explains why.\n\n\u201cThere were just a lot of problems around financial services on the continent, and specifically in Nigeria. And thanks to companies like Paystack and Flutterwave, a lot of people built on top of that. And so, you find different founders trying to solve specific niches of the financial services, which I believe will continue because there are still aspects of financial services that need solutions.\u201d\n\nAway from fintech, he reveals that the firm is considering investments in other sectors, including agritech, the gig economy, cryptocurrency, and blockchain.\n\n\u201cWe have been thinking of agritech for a while now, but we haven\u2019t made any investments there. It\u2019s definitely on our radar, and we\u2019re beginning to teach ourselves about the industry. I think cryptocurrency and Blockchain are very interesting as well, and I believe it is one of the solutions to the problems that we have in the continent and specifically in Nigeria as well,\u201d he comments.\n\nOn failed investments and missed opportunities\n\nWith startups popping up faster than investors can write cheques, I asked Koleowo about opportunities Microtraction has missed. His response was interesting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs an investor, you can\u2019t invest in everything, and that\u2019s very important to know. Also, there will be misalignment at different times as you speak to different founders. And it is okay to walk away.\u201d\n\nHe remarks that while they have not had companies that shut down, they support companies that are going through a hard time.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, your job is to be there for the founders every step of the way. When things are rough, that\u2019s when you should be there the most, trying to figure out how to solve the problem. We basically just jump on calls, break down the problem, introduce solutions, and give some advice here and there.\u201d\n\nConsiderations when investing in startups\n\nL-R, Dayo Koleowo and Chidinma Iwueke, Partners at Microtraction. Image Source: Supplied\n\nAs early-stage investors, funding startups carries considerable risks, mainly because of the scarcity of data from which they can make investment decisions. Still, the firm has some criteria that they watch out for before investing in startups.\n\nFor Microtraction, the first quality is how big the addressable market is.\n\n\u201cAs VCs, we\u2019re always thinking about scalability, always thinking about how big this opportunity can become. And so when we see companies, we quickly think about the scale at which this company can grow, how big this can become,\u201d he notes.\n\nA second criterion they consider is the founding team. Koleowo reveals that Microtraction likes \u201cteams that are technical because you\u2019re building a technology product. One of the mistakes I made as an entrepreneur was not having a very technical co-founder. That meant we had to outsource most of our technology development and wasted a lot of money and time, and it was difficult to push out something tangible.\u201d\n\nTraction is another thing Microtraction considers. However, it does not mean the startup must have started making revenue.\n\n\u201cWe want to see that you are moving things fast. I don\u2019t want to be a partner to someone slow or working part-time,\u201d he adds.\n\nIn addition to these, he says that capital-efficient teams are attractive to Microtraction as the firm writes small cheques of about $25,000.\n\nMistakes founders make\n\nAfter reviewing hundreds of pitches from founders, Koleowo is uniquely positioned to identify some mistakes that founders make.\n\nWith venture capital firms having a specific profile of startups that they invest in, he advises that startups research the VCs they wish to receive investments from to ensure their priorities are aligned.\n\nKeeping investors and shareholders in the loop is something he advises. This ensures that they can help when necessary and guards against creating a false impression that everything is okay with investors.\n\nAlthough raising funds is vital to keeping a business alive, he points out that it is not the business\u2019 main purpose.\n\n\u201cFundraising is very distracting, especially when you\u2019re raising large cheques. I think it\u2019s important that if you have two co-founders, for instance, one of them is focused on operations while the other person is handling the fundraising.\u201dFounders looking to get Microtraction on board as investors can visit the firm\u2019s website at www.microtraction.com, where they can apply, with a response coming within seven days. The firm also maintains a presence on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Dark summer for cryptocurrencies",
          "text": "Good day,\n\nA string of negative events: Cryptocurrencies are having a bad summer. While the year might have started with bullish trends such as Bitcoin\u2019s $63,000 all-time high in April, the market is now seeing a trend of diminishing value.\n\nMore woes: Since April, not only has the top crypto by market capitalisation, Bitcoin, lost about half its value, CNBC reveals that 24-hour trade volume went down. Between June 22 and June 30, 2021, it had reduced by 40.3% \u2014 from $138 billion to $80 billion.\n\nA clearer picture: 24-hour trade volumes refer to the number of cryptocurrencies that have exchanged hands in day. Between May 11, 2021, and July 8, 2021, charts on crypto data website CoinMarketCap, show a 268% \u2014 $233 billion to $80 billion \u2014 drop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean? According to initial coin offering (ICO) discovery platform, Coinist, a drop in trade volume means crypto prices are not likely to rise soon. However, cryptocurrencies are notoriously unpredictable.\n\nThe blame game: The first signs of a downward trend came when on Wednesday, May 12, 2021, when Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, revealed in a tweet that his company was suspending Bitcoin as a means of payment for Tesla cars.\n\nHowever, the actual value drop began when a clampdown on crypto mining began in China. According to the University of Cambridge, the country is home to 65% of the world\u2019s mining activity. With the world\u2019s mining powerhouse on hold, the price of Bitcoin plummeted.\n\nWhy? In April 2021, China started testing its Digital Yuan, a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Hindu explains that the crackdown is a way to strengthen the hold of the new digital currency.\n\nMore crypto crackdown: On Friday, February 5, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) released a circular restricting financial institutions from facilitating any form of crypto-related transactions. In classic Chinese style, the CBN has also announced plans to issue a digital currency.\n\nIt\u2019s been five months since the circular was released, and despite the ban, Nigeria has seen an increase in peer-to-peer trading. Some crypto exchanges such as Bundle created peer-to-peer platforms for traders to exchange cryptocurrencies safely.\n\nA trend? Nigeria and China aren\u2019t the only countries nursing the idea of a CBDC. On April 19, 2021, BBC revealed that the Bank of England is setting up a task force to look into the possibility of a central bank digital currency.\n\nThe US is also not taking a back seat on the issue. Business Insider highlights Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa as some African countries leading the CBDC charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo what happens to regular cryptocurrencies? Following China\u2019s crackdown on digital currencies to strengthen its Digital Yuan, we might see more countries move to create digital versions of their money. A global crackdown on cryptocurrencies might not be too far away as well.\n\nThere might be dark days ahead for crypto traders and enthusiasts. However, this pushback by governments could provoke more technological advancements in the blockchain and crypto space.\n\nAlso, government-issued digital currencies do not come with the same benefits as regular cryptocurrencies.\n\nWhile they could ease cross border transactions and control volatility, they do not provide the same level of transparency and anonymity because they\u2019re created on a private blockchain ledger controlled by the government.\n\nAs the crypto downtrend continues with Bitcoin now at $32,825, the rallying cry among enthusiasts is HODL.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSpazio Ideale designs iconic workspaces for tech companies like Paystack, uLesson, others.

          "text": "Several studies have confirmed the correlation between how a space looks and how a person lives or works. With changes in how we view our environment, there is now an increasing demand to put much thought into space designs. But this has not always been the case.\n\nPitching space designs, in Africa for instance, is more commonplace today than it was a decade ago, with more people now interested in how their spaces look. Interestingly, we are talking about a $115 billion industry projected to hit $121 billion by the end of 2021. And it gets more exciting with the various options available with innovation.\n\nThe acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\n\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers. She studied computer science for her first degree, with a masters in interior design coming after as she followed her love for designing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nIn what started as a passion, she soon decided to turn interior designing into a business. Her entrepreneurship journey started by chance.\n\nThe rise of Spazio Ideale\n\nAfter her postgraduate studies in Italy in 2014 and a stint in Ghana, she couldn\u2019t find any suitable design company to join when she returned to Nigeria. They all didn\u2019t fit into the designs she liked, among other concerns. So she started telling people about what she does.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you go to a design school, you have to create a design portfolio of your work. And when I got back, I distributed it to a few people to see. They got to see what I love to do and how I love to create.\u201d\n\nAnd she eventually convinced some of the people in her circle to patronise her.\n\nIn June 2015, she did her first project, a living space, for a friend. The startup has since grown in its scope of coverage and is currently more of a commercial space design company.\n\nProud of the progress the company has made so far, Bamgbelu reveals that it has done more than 50 projects cutting across residential, commercial, hospitality, and school facilities.\n\nHowever, most of them are in commercial spaces \u2014 over 30 clients \u2014 particularly the tech space. With most projects gotten from referrals, the startup touts itself as the first in the tech space, boasting of designing office spaces for popular startups in Nigeria.\n\nNotable mentions include Kuda Bank, Softcom, Heritage Bank, Paystack, Reliance HMO, uLesson, Techpoint Africa, and Max.ng.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterior photos of ISN Medicals at Ilupeju, Lagos. Designed by Spazio Ideale. Source: Supplied\n\nBamgbelu relives with fondness how the team came up with Paystack\u2019s iconic workspace design.\n\n\u201cIn our initial conversation with Paystack, we tried to understand how they are and what they do, and we realised that they have a friendly organisation, although small then, but they were like a family and a fun environment to work in. And we designed the space to reflect this.\u201d\n\nA customer-centric approach\n\nBetween initial contact to delivery, there are five steps the team goes through to satisfy a client \u2014 this is called the Spazio Way. First, a 60-minute meeting, then a conceptual design, detail, execution, and after-sales care.\n\nHowever, the delivery time depends on the scope of the project.\n\nAlthough Bamgbelu personally handled the startup\u2019s first set of projects, the founder\u2019s current responsibility is to provide overall creative direction from design to execution.\n\nThis is easy because she has a reliable team of 14 highly skilled individuals consisting of interior designers, architects, civil engineers, and building technologists. This fills her with confidence as they all work together to deliver on every project.\n\nSpazio Ideale team. Source: Supplied\n\nThe startup also engages partners like muralists, furniture makers, and plumbers, among others. In essence, Spazio Ideale\u2019s work can sometimes require completely changing the entire structure of a space, from ceiling to floor.\n\nBamgbelu highlights how the team comes up with the design for any project.\n\n\u201cIt depends on a few things; we design based on what the client is trying to achieve. The first thing we ask is, why aren\u2019t you doing this yourself? Why do you need an interior designer to do it for you? That\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201d\n\nBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s in trying to save cost because they don\u2019t know where to get the things they want. Others are looking for expertise because they have this idea in mind but don\u2019t know how to go about it. Some others are looking to improve employee experience or brand association.\n\n\u201cSo, every design is usually different, although they might have the same elements. Sometimes, it depends on the company\u2019s culture \u2014 fun or reserved, or the functional and aesthetic needs of the organisation.\u201d\n\nThe founder believes that the most challenging project in the past six months was creating uLesson\u2019s Abuja office with less than two months given for the design and implementation.\n\n\u201cWe did deliver it within two months. So, it was challenging to make sure that happened because of the size of the project, which is 1,000 square metres, and there were so many unique pieces.\u201d\n\nCost depends on a client\u2019s budget; however, quality is not compromised in the process. Bamgbelu is often encouraged because customers are satisfied that the projects are completed without them needing to step in after the initial discussions. And this makes the startup have repeat clients seeking a redesign or who\u2019ve either moved offices or opened new ones.\n\nIf anything, this has helped the company grow. Before 2019, the startup experienced a 50-70% revenue growth. Between 2019 and 2020, the revenue increased by 150% while working towards an equally successful 2021.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nIn a space with other interior designing businesses like Space Finish, the founder believes Spazio Ideale stands out as it doesn\u2019t set out just to make a space look good.\n\nBesides excellent execution, there is conceptualising and designing. The team comes up with unique designs that blend perfectly into the client\u2019s company structure and aid proper communication and interaction while creating an unforgettable impression on visitors.\n\nTo explain Spazio Ideale\u2019s competitive edge, Bamgbelu speaks of how Spazio Ideale got the job to design Paystack\u2019s first office in 2016, a year after the payments company launched in 2015.\n\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.\n\n\u201cWhat you usually expect in a reception is to see the company logo, lights, probably made of acrylic or glass. Understanding Paystack\u2019s culture, we saw that these guys aren\u2019t rigid. So, their first point of contact, as people enter into the reception, should reflect them. And that is why we came up with that \u2018Welcome\u2019 wall where we wrote welcome in different languages.\u201d\n\nPaystack \u2018Welcome Wall\u2019. Designed by Spazio Ideale\n\nThis decision would create an unforgettable story in Paystack\u2019s history and influence the decision to invite Spazio Ideale to design its second office.\n\nBamgbelu relates how the wall made some foreigners who visited the office see them as welcoming and heartwarming people because they felt at home after seeing \u2018Welcome\u2019 in their languages.\n\nDespite similar success stories, the startup has had its challenges, many of which are peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nBamgbelu looks forward to a time when electricity and Internet, inflation, and talent development will no longer be a clog in the wheel of creative businesses seeking to remain competitive.\n\nOther problems that come with playing in the creative industry \u201cinclude access to good quality partners that help us achieve our projects. For example, it\u2019s difficult to access very good artisans and workmen. And because we pride ourselves on excellence, we sometimes have to redo things until they are right. But regardless of all these, we\u2019re clear on what we want to deliver to our clients.\u201d\n\nChanging seasons and what the future\u2019s like\n\nWhen campaigns for social distancing and working from home (WFH) became pronounced at the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 \u2014 with the idea of having a physical office often debated \u2014 Spazio Ideale had a relatively good run, although it lost a few clients.\n\nBamgbelu reiterated how the startup experienced a 150% revenue growth. One wonders what was there to do during a lockdown and office closures.\n\n\u201cAll the time we were working from home, we had designs to churn out. And the design phase takes time,\u201d she clarifies.\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nEssentially, interior designing is a highly creative business that is yet to be fully appreciated in this part of the world because of how little people know about its influence on living and working.\n\nBamgbelu explains it this way.\n\n\u201cOrganisations provide tools, and people tend to have tools that make them productive. The space where people work is a tool to make sure the organisation achieves its objectives. So, if the staff is happy with the space, it helps them make profit.\u201d\n\nHence, she recommends educating people and organisations to see its importance. Still, only interested people approach interior designers for consultation or design and execution.\n\nBamgbelu states that the concept of remote work does not threaten the growth of the business, especially in Nigeria, pointing out that the particular challenges associated with WFH \u2014 electricity and Internet \u2014 would only encourage companies to run a hybrid model.\n\nInterestingly, Spazio Ideale\u2019s client base is still made up of mostly commercial spaces.\n\n\u201cThe truth is organisations want to get their spaces up and running. Everybody is thinking past COVID-19. Yes, there\u2019s the work from home strategy, which we recommend. But we believe the office is not going away,\u201d she submits.\n\nThe startup plans to reach more African and international markets by Q4 2021. Even though there\u2019ve been projects from foreign organisations with offices in Nigeria, getting jobs from these companies for their offices outside Nigeria would be a major step forward.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",
          "summary": "The acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers.\nSpazio Ideale team.\nThat\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201dBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nI am afraid of military-police formation in Kaduna that cannot protect our school children and allowed bandits to control the forests. Kaduna State is the most terrorize state by bandits and other criminals despite the presence of military-police formation. I must express my concern over the level of insecurity in the country and Kaduna in particular. Kaduna State has the highest number of military and police formation yet they could not flush out bandits hiding in forests. I have watched helplessly in Kaduna State where the President\u2019s efforts are not being replicated. Rather, we have a situation whereby deliberate acts of commission or omission and anarchy have taken over. The people of Kaduna State today are no longer feeling the impact of several military and police formation around them. I cannot explain the level of high insecurity in relation to several military-police formation in Kaduna State. There is several military-police formation yet there is no peace in Kaduna State. I am worried over what will happen if states without military-police formation have similar security challenge like the one in Kaduna. Nigerians need an explanation about insecurity in Kaduna with several military-police formation.\n\nThe following are List of Military and Police Formation in Kaduna State:\n\n* 1Division Nigerian Army Barracks.\n\n* Nigerian Army Depot, Zaria\n\n* Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji\n\n* Nigerian Defense Industry (NDI) Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Airforce Training School, Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Police College, Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Navy School of Armament, Kachia Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Army School of Legal Services, Bassawa Zaria\n\n* Nigerian Defense Academy (NDA) Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Army School of Artillery, Kachia Kaduna\n\n* Nigerian Army School of Military Police, Bassawa Zaria\n\nI am worried that bandits and kidnappers operate freely without any challenge from the military and police formation located in Kaduna State. Mr. President is no doubt aware that no single day passes without massive killings, kidnappings, arson and wanton destruction of property in Kaduna State. The citizens and residents of Kaduna are becoming numb to serial publications of death and destruction every day.\n\nI must lament that \u201cfarming activities are being negatively impacted on a scale that will herald famine throughout the state. Trading and other normal activities of life are equally affected. Even performing religious obligations is becoming difficult as places of worship are routinely targeted, burnt and destroyed with attendant loss of lives and the military-police formation is helpless in Kaduna.\n\nThe Kaduna\u2013Abuja Road, Kaduna\u2013Kachia Road, Kaduna\u2013Zaria Road, Kaduna\u2013BirninGwari Road are all under siege of bandits and kidnappers yet the military-police formation is helpless in Kaduna. Businesses are daily relocating from Kaduna. Residents are helpless and go about their lives with trepidation. The military and police formation are helpless in the war against kidnappers and bandits in Kaduna State. What is wrong with Kaduna the only state in Nigeria with the highest number of military and police formation?\n\nThere is the virtual absence of governance as the whole Government in the State is a one-man affair. \u201cRegrettably, the Governor who carries himself like an Emperor and has stiffed normal discourse that can lead to constructive ideas and suggestions to tackle the myriad of security issues bedevilling the state. People have been threatened, arrested, prosecuted and targeted simply for raising their voices against the wanton destruction of lives and property.\n\nThere is today in Kaduna State such break down of public order and public safety to such extent that requires extraordinary measures to restore peace and security. There is, in addition, a clear and present danger of further and total breakdown of public safety in the state, which requires extraordinary measures to prevent such eventuality.\n\nI want to condemn the activities of insurgents, kidnappers and bandits in the North that their activities are killing the peace and progress for which the north was noted for when the founders of the region were in power. Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State recently said the menace of banditry is beyond the capacity of the Nigeria Police Force, and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC. El-Rufai made the remark while stressing that the Army, Nigerian Air Force, NAF, and Nigerian Navy should be deployed to effectively tackle banditry.\n\nDEATHS from insecurity in Kaduna State in 2020 were three times higher than those recorded in five states in the North-East within the same year, The ICIR came up with a report. On Wednesday, March 10, the Kaduna State government released the state security report for the year 2020, which shows that 937 persons were killed by bandits and other criminals in the state within the year. According to data obtained from the Nigerian Security Tracker, the figure is much higher than what was recorded within the year in five North-East states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe. Nigeria Security Tracker, sponsored by the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, said there were 288 deaths due to insecurity in the five states within the period. Nigeria\u2019s Kaduna State has been embroiled in conflict for decades. The violence has its roots in ethnic tensions between the state\u2019s Muslim and non-Muslim populations.\n\nKaduna state is located in Northcentral Nigeria. It has a population of approximately 6.1 million people. The majority Hausa-Fulani tribe are predominantly Muslim and herders of cattle and the non-Muslim minority are mainly farmers. The conflict between these two groups most recently flared up in October 2018 when communal clashes left at least 55 people dead. The resurgence of violence provided a convenient talking point for President Muhammadu Buhari on his campaign trail. The president has made the fight against insecurity a big component of his campaign. But while he has talked tough about the violence he hasn\u2019t acted accordingly to ensure that peace prevails in Kaduna.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Kaduna\n\n...",

          "text": "Governors of the 36 states of the federation under the aegis of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) on Wednesday unanimously approved a common template for the implementation of the Memorandum of Action signed with the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASUN) on the implementation of financial autonomy for the State legislature and judiciary.\n\nThe resolution was passed during the NGF\u2019s 32nd teleconference meeting chaired by its chairman, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State.\n\nA communique issued at the end of the meeting said the template was developed following a meeting of the State Attorneys General and Commissioners of Finance which held on June 25, 2021 at the directive of the Forum.\n\nRegarding the issue of Nigerian Postal Service Bill, 2021 & Stamp Duties Collection, the Forum however expressed concern with certain proposed amendments to the Principal Stamp Duties Act by the Senate which seeks to remove the powers to administer and collect stamp duties from the relevant tax authorities (Federal Inland Revenue Service or State Internal Revenue Service, depending on the nature of the transaction) to the Nigeria Postal Service.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of Section 163 of the 1999 Constitution requires that Stamp Duties on transactions between a company and an individual should be paid to the FIRS and returned to the State of derivation. The Forum resolved to engage with the National Assembly on the matter.\n\nOn the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), 2021 passed by the National Assembly, the Governors unanimously expressed \u201cfull support of the unbundling and commercialization of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) but concerned with the proposed ownership structure of the NNPC which places ownership on the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nTo this end, the Forum recommended that \u201cgiven that the corporation is owned by the three tiers of government, the new incorporated entity (NNPC Limited) should be owned by a vehicle that holds the interest of the three tiers of government \u2013 for now, the institution that is positioned to carry out this mandate is the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\u201d\n\nAccording to the Governors, the amendment as well as the proposed 3% share of oil revenue to host communities and 30% share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins will be responded to at relevant channels including the National Assembly and the National Economic Council (NEC).\n\nOn the proposed sale of Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) Assets, the Forum resolved to take a position on the planned privatization of assets of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) which were listed by the Bureau for Public Enterprise (BPE) without due consultation with State governments who are shareholders of the company. NDPHC is incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act as a private limited liability company with shareholding fully subscribed to by the Federal, State and Local Governments with a mandate to manage National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP) in the country.\n\nOn insecurity challenges ravaging the country, the Forum put its weight behind the launch of its Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative (PISI) set up to tackle insecurity, conflicts and violence in the country. The launch of PISI which took place on 8th July 2021 heralded an important milestone for NGF as it seeks to build a more inclusive and collaborative platform to drive an urgent country-wide response to security challenges in the country.\n\nThe NGF Chairman also informed members of the inauguration of the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (NPRGS) chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo with a mandate to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years. State Governors have been enjoined to nominate focal persons who will consolidate policy strategies put in place by State governments to end poverty in the country. The focal persons will be inducted into a technical working group chaired by the Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule and co-chaired by the Minister of State for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.\n\nThe Forum received an update from the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on the recent rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases and call for consensual action to prevent a third wave in the country.\n\n\u201cFollowing the update, the Forum called on all State Governors to revive their COVID protocols and collaborate with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to take appropriate and immediate actions to flatten the transmission curve. The Forum will interface with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 to accelerate processes required to fast track the delivery of additional vaccines for the country.\n\n\u201cAn update on the States Fiscal Transparency, Accountability, and Sustainability \u2013 Program-for-Results (PforR) was made by Mr. Olanrewaju Ajogbasile, the NGF SFTAS Programme Manager, who informed State Governors of the ongoing verification exercise for the SFTAS disbursement linked indicators and debt reconciliation exercise carried out with the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning (FMBNP), the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Debt Management Office (DMO). The Forum commended the SFTAS programme office and welcomed the reconciliation exercise which will be seen through by the State Commissioners of Finance.\n\n\u201cFollowing an update on the Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus \u2013 Programme for Results (Nigeria CARES), from Mrs. Firo Elhassan, NGF Programme Manager, the Forum resolved to interface with the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning (FMBNP) and the Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to ensure speedy approval and commencement of the programme in line with the 2021 budgets of states.\n\n\u201cSequel to a presentation by Rt. Hon. Princess Miriam Onuoha, Chairman, House of Representatives, Committee on Disabilities on the adoption of the Discrimination against Person with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act (2018), the Forum committed to actively support, through the NGF Secretariat, the domestication of the disability law in States where it has not already been passed. Since 2018, at least 12 States have passed disability laws, including Ekiti, Lagos, Kwara, Kogi, Plateau, Jigawa, Ondo, Bauchi, Anambra, Niger and River State.\n\n\u201cThe Forum received a presentation on the Roadmap for Successful Digital Transformation Execution in States from the Chief Executive Officer of Suburban Fiber Company, Mr Bruce Ayonote. The proposal which sought to build both hard and soft digital infrastructure for State governments was welcomed by State Governors. The Forum mandated its Secretariat to facilitate the planning and partnership process with interested State governments.\n\n\u201cLastly, the Forum received a report on the Diversification and Non-oil Export Opportunities for States Post-COVID-19 from the Policy Development Facility (PDF) Bridge Programme.\n\n\u201cThe Forum welcomed the study and noted that findings of the report will help strengthen the diversification agenda of States.\u201d",

          "title": "A-Z of Delta variant, why nations are scared",
          "text": "By Abankula with Cecilia Ologunagba in New York\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) said the Delta variant of COVID-19, which triggered UNILAG shutdown Wednesday is now in 111 countries of the world.\n\nThis was up from 104 countries reported on Monday.\n\nWHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said the spread of the variant, along with increased social mobility and the inconsistent use of proven public health measures was driving increases in both case numbers and deaths.\n\nHe spoke Wednesday in remarks to the 8th meeting of the Emergency Committee on COVID-19, established under International Health Regulations (IHR), a treaty that guides global response to public health risks.\n\nTedros recalled the sustained decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths in recent months, driven largely by increasing vaccination rates in Europe and North America, but sounded alarms over the fresh reversal of that positive trend.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately\u2026we are now in the early stages of a third wave,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week marked the fourth consecutive week of rising cases of COVID-19 globally, with increases recorded in all but one of WHO\u2019s six regions. Deaths are also rising again, after 10 weeks of steady decline.\n\n\u201cThe Delta variant is now in more than 111 countries and we expect it to soon be the dominant COVID-19 strain circulating worldwide, if it isn\u2019t already,\u201d Tedros said.\n\nWhat is the Delta variant? P.M.News shares the insight by Webmd.com:\n\nThe Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, can spread more easily, according to the U.S. CDC. The strain has mutations on the spike protein that make it easier for it to infect human cells. That means people may be more contagious if they contract the virus and more easily spread it to others. It is now the dominant strain in the U.S.\n\nIn fact, researchers have said that the Delta variant is about 50% more contagious than the Alpha variant, which was first identified in the U.K., according to The Washington Post.\n\nAlpha, also known as B.1.1.7, was already 50% more contagious than the original coronavirus first identified in China in 2019.\n\nPublic health experts estimate that the average person who gets infected with Delta spreads it to three or four other people, as compared with one or two other people through the original coronavirus strain, according to Yale Medicine.\n\nThe Delta variant may also be able to escape protection from vaccines and some COVID-19 treatments, though studies are still ongoing.\n\nWhat is the Delta Plus variant?\n\nThe Delta Plus variant, also known as B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1, is considered a \u201csubvariant\u201d of the Delta version, according to CBS News. It has a mutation that allows the virus to better attack lung cells and potentially escape vaccines.\n\nFirst identified in India, Delta Plus has now been found in the U.S., U.K., and nearly a dozen other countries. India has labeled it a variant of concern, but the CDC and WHO haven\u2019t.\n\nWhere did the Delta variant come from?\n\nThe Delta variant was first identified in India in December 2020 and led to major outbreaks in the country. It then spread rapidly and is now reported in 111 countries, according to WHO director-general.\n\nAs of early July, Delta has become the dominant form of the coronavirus in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and other countries. In the U.K., for instance, the Delta variant now makes up more than 97% of new COVID-19 cases, according to Public Health England.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of the Delta variant?\n\nThe symptoms are similar to those seen with the original coronavirus strain and other variants, including a persistent cough, headache, fever, and sore throat.\n\nAt the same time, COVID-19 patients in the U.K. have reported that some symptoms are slightly different for Delta, according to data from the ZOE COVID Symptom Study. Cough and loss of smell seem to be less common. Headache, sore throat, runny nose, and fever seem to be more common.\n\nIs the Delta variant more deadly?\n\nScientists are still tracking the data to determine how deadly it is. Based on hospitalizations in the U.K., the Delta variant does seem to be more likely to lead to hospitalization and death, particularly among unvaccinated people, according to a recent study published in The Lancet.\n\nWhat does the Delta variant mean for the unvaccinated?\n\nPeople who haven\u2019t been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are most at risk, Yale Medicine reported. In the U.S., communities with low vaccination rates have seen a jump in cases, particularly in Midwest and Southern states such as Missouri and Arkansas. Outbreaks have also been found in Mountain states, such as Wyoming.\n\nKids and younger adults who haven\u2019t been vaccinated may be susceptible as well. In the U.K., children and unvaccinated adults under age 50 were 2.5 times more likely to become infected with Delta, according to a recent study published by Imperial College London.\n\nWhat does the Delta variant mean for the vaccinated?\n\nScientists are looking at how the Delta variant can cause breakthrough cases, or infections among people who are fully vaccinated. So far, they seem to be rare.\n\nIn a preliminary analysis, two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine appeared to be about 88% effective against disease and 96% effective against hospitalization with the Delta variant, according to Public Health England. The AstraZeneca vaccine, which has not been authorized for use in the U.S., was about 60% effective against disease and 93% effective against hospitalization. Johnson & Johnson has also reported efficacy from its one-shot vaccine against the Delta variant, which researchers estimate to be similar to the AstraZeneca results.\n\nNow vaccine makers are testing booster shots to find out if they can better protect against the Delta variant and other variants that emerge in coming months. Pfizer announced that it will seek FDA authorization for a booster dose in August, according to CNN.",

          "title": "EFCC Warns Hoteliers Allowing Yahoo Boys Check Into Their Hotels",

Even then, hoteliers would have to establish that every customer provided true information about themselves at check-in for them to avoid EFCC\u2019s threat of prosecution.",

          "text": "The Senate Wednesday faulted the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for under remitting the sum of N3, 878, 955, 039, 855.73 trillion revenues from domestic crude oil sales to the Federation Account for the period of January to December 2015.\n\nAccordingly, the upper chamber called on the Corporation to desist from further deductions at source as this contravenes Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nIt also mandated the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) or any other approving authority to, as a matter of urgency, approve agreed percentage which should be allocated to NNPC monthly as operational cost to ensure their operations were not adversely affected.\n\nThis formed part of the 59 recommendations adopted by the Senate and contained in the report of the Committee on Public Accounts on the Annual report of the Auditor-General for the Federation on the Accounts of the Federation for the years ended 31st December, 2015.\n\nIn one of its adopted recommendations to the Executive arm of government, the Senate noted that the outstanding collection from Solid Minerals (N12,137,140,361.58) not remitted to the Federation Account, but kept in an account maintained by the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) contravenes the provisions of Section 162(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nThe chamber, therefore, charged the FAAC to fix a percentage to be allocated to Mining and Cadastral Office as cost of collection as is currently applicable to NCS (7 percent), DPR (4 percent) and FIRS (4 percent) of non-oil revenue.\n\nErring MDAs for sanction\n\nOn Unretired Advances involving 39 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to the tune of N2, 296,567,084.37 billion, the red chamber demanded the sanctioning of accounting officers of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in accordance with the provision of Rule 3124 of Financial Regulations.\n\nIt also issued the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris a deadline of 60 days to identify and sanction officers responsible for mismanagement of public funds to the tune of N54,151,360,000 billion ($274,280,000.00) as exchange loss on External Loans.\n\nThe Accountant General is expected to report back to the Senate Committee on Public Accounts within ninety days.\n\nIn addition, the Senate gave another 60-day timeline for the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation to set in motion the process of recovery of Internal Loans made from other Funds which stand at N390,288,085,668.92 billion and to be paid back into the Special Funds Accounts.\n\nThe source of the loans are from the Development of Natural Resources Account, Stabilisation Fund Account, 25 percent Husked Brown Rice Levy, One percent Comprehensive Supervision Scheme (CISS) Pool Levy, 15 percent Wheat Grain Levy, and 10 percent Rice Levy.\n\nIn another vein, the upper chamber directed the Accountant-General of the Federation to recover the sum of N378, 879, 674.99 tax revenue from Webb Fontaine Ltd and remit same to the Federal Inland Revenue Service within six (6) months.\n\nIt also called for a review of all companies that were paid from the outflow of one percent CISS Account which amounted to N39, 557, 671,843.97.\n\nNPA over lack of diligence\n\nThe upper chamber also directed the Nigerian Ports Authority to refund the sum of $37,627,939.75million (USD) to the federal government coffers due to lack of diligence in the review of NPA\u2019s charges on a contract of towage services.\n\nThe lawmakers also mandated the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), to subject the Accounting Officer to investigation in accordance with Rule 3112 (I and II) of the Financial Regulations.\n\nThey further demanded that the Director-General who authorised the disbursement of contingency provision on the contract for the rehabilitation of Lagos Habour moles to the tune of N417,099,309.06billion without Federal Executive Council approval, should be reported to President Muhammadu Buhari in accordance with Rule 3103 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nOn other funds diverted by the NPA, the Senate demanded a refund of various sums in local and foreign currencies, consisting of N1, 075, 266,599.06, $2,301,329.54 (USD), and \u20ac196,257.42 (Euros) meant for the Presidential Implementation Committee on Marine Safety and Security (PICOMSS) to the account of the National Security Adviser to the o President, contrary to a directive approved by the Federal Executive Council on February 21, 2007.\n\nIt added that the non-remittance of another N67, 508, 041,250.00 for 2013 and 2014 into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), being 25 percent of its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) contravened the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\nThe Senate also noted that the failure to remit capitalized interest to the Consolidated Revenue Fund totaling N99, 712, 464.24 between 2013 and 2014 contravened Rule 236 of the Financial Regulations.\n\nInfractions at FMPR\n\nOn financial infractions by the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Senate called for the sanction of the Permanent Secretary in accordance with Rule 3129 of the Financial Regulations and Public Service Rules 030402 over the diversion of N23,642,000.00 from the Capital Projects Funds for Sallah/Christians\u2019 welfare package to staff of the Ministry.\n\nThe upper chamber queried the sums of N46, 645, 000.00 and N56, 418,135.00 for the printing of the Ministry\u2019s letter-headed paper, and demanded that the sum be recovered and paid back to the treasury.\n\nIt also called for the identification of the Project Accountant who authorised the diversion of N32, 783, 052.00 meant for IPPIS training and other programmes to bank accounts of staff of Finance and Accounts Department, instead of paying the approved amounts to beneficiaries.\n\nThey demanded the refund of the amount to government coffers, including the sum of N718, 911,848.00 made in the cashbook as payments to eleven corporate bodies without documentation.\n\nIn addition, the chamber called on the ministry to identify and present for disciplinary action, the officers behind the authorisation of N98, 400, 000.00 in favour of a company for printing of leaflets for the Petroleum Industry Bill awareness campaign programme; N54, 000, 000.00 to a company for assessment and documentation of Oil Spill sites in ten (10) states of the Niger Delta; and N25, 000,000.00 for actualising e-governance procedure.\n\nThe infractions, the Senate noted, were in violation of Rule 3117.\n\nWants NSC sanctioned\n\nThe body therefore called on the EFCC to prosecute within 30 days, the officers in the Ministry of Youths and Sports (National Sports Commission) who certified the payment of N37, 185, 000.00 from the Capital Vote allocation.\n\nIt also directed that N2, 695, 985.00 be recovered from the emolument of the Director-General of the Small Medium Enterprises Development Agency (SMEDAN), who authorised that the sum be paid to individuals instead of a company\u2019s account.\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, also demanded the prosecution of the Accounting Officer with SMEDAN who approved the sum of N38, 038,238.14 without relevant and supporting documents in contravention to extant laws.\n\nIn meting further disciplinary actions, the chamber called on the EFCC to prosecute within thirty days, officers of the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading PLC (NBET) who were behind the non-remittance of accrued interest on investment in Nigeria Treasury Bills.\n\nHospitals also\n\nIt also sought the prosecution of officers of the National Hospital, Abuja, and the Rural Electrification Agency within the same time frame, who were involved in the diversion of N20, 915, 998.00 and N14, 086,246.00, respectively.\n\nIt requested the Medical Director of the Jos University Teaching Hospital to refund the sum of N26,321,041.01; and the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Aro, Abeokuta to pay back N19,382,047.50 to the Treasury and the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), Abuja, to remit the sums of N3,716,805,388.00, N100,958,369.61, N374,734,768.46 and N161,336,427.80 to the CRF and Treasury.",

          "text": "Support group under the auspices of APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption campaign is built on establishing preventive systems and mechanisms that promote lasting accountability rather than the conventional arrest and prosecution method.\n\nIn a statement issued Wednesday and signed by four prominent members of the party: Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi, Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, the legacy group cited the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), the Treasury Single Account (TSA), the Personnel Information System (IPPIS), and the whistleblowing policy as some of the mechanisms instituted by the Buhari administration to prevent corruption from taken place in the system.\n\nThe APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign, which is a voluntary think-tank group of the governing party, further maintained that the Buhari Administration also established the Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit (PICA) to strengthen controls over Government finances through a continuous internal audit process across all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), particularly in respect of payroll, noting that PICA has helped to identify and remove more than 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries, amounting to savings of N200 billion per annum.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn the life of the administration, the President established the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), to sign-post to the world the significance of the fight against corruption to his administration. It was the very first committee the President set up after he was sworn into office.\n\n\u201cSince inception PACAC has helped produce manuals, protocols and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to assist Anti-Corruption Agencies (ACAs) in their work, including a Corruption Case Management Manual; Plea Bargaining Manual; Sentencing Guidelines in High Profile Cases; a Framework for the Management of Recovered Stolen Assets, Asset Recovery Strategy Document, among others.\n\n\u201cAlso in August 2015, President Buhari issued his first major Presidential Order, directing all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to close their accounts with Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and transfer their balances to the Treasury Single Account (TSA) system under the oversight of the Central Bank of Nigeria, on or before 15th September 2015. The TSA system, launched in 2012, had struggled to gain traction until President Buhari\u2019s executive order. More than 17,000 commercial bank accounts have since been closed down, resulting in savings of an average of N4 billion monthly, in banking charges; apart from the increased transparency and accountability that comes from the new system.\n\n\u201cSimilar to the TSA is the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), through which the Federal Government pays its staff. Like the TSA it was inherited from previous administrations, but with limited coverage. Since 2015 President Buhari has mandated expansion of coverage, in spite of great opposition, so that today it now covers virtually all of the Federal Government, including the Armed Forces, as well as Federal Universities and other academic institutions.\n\n\u201cThe Whistleblowing Policy introduced by the Government in December 2016 was the first of its kind in the country. Since then it has yielded several billions of Naira in recoveries from tax evaders and public officials.\n\n\u201cThe increased oversight of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and their finances under this Administration has since started yielding results, through increased remittance of operating surpluses by MDAs. For example, from remitting only N51 million between 2010 and 2016, JAMB has gone on to remit more than 20 billion Naira to the Federal Government since 2017. This same scenario is being replicated across several MDAs.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari Administration also established the Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit (PICA) to strengthen controls over Government finances through a continuous internal audit process across all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), particularly in respect of payroll. PICA helped identify and remove more than 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries, amounting to savings of N200 billion per annum.\n\n\u201cIn July 2016, Nigeria became the 70th country in the world to join the Open Government Partnership (OGP), as part of efforts to globally mainstream Nigeria\u2019s public transparency efforts.\n\n\u201cOther transparency and anti-corruption initiatives of the Buhari Administration include Project Lighthouse, launched in 2018 to integrate multiple tax and revenue data sources from across the government and third parties (land records, CAC records, REMITA platform, Private Jet Ownership data, FIRS database, etc) and thus help ensure accurate income and tax assessment for individual and corporate taxpayers.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026Considers amending Act to limit age writing UTME\n\nAgainst the backdrop that the general performance of 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME, was poor due to the use of the wrong syllabus by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, the Senate Committee on Basic Education Senate and Secondary Education have expressed satisfaction over the transparent of the conduct of the examination.\n\nThe Committee members made this disclosure after the JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ish-aq Oloyede clarified them on the alleged poor performance of the 2021 UTME during their oversight visit to JAMB on Monday.\n\nVice Chairman of the committee, Senator Akon Eyakenyi, commended board for the smooth conduct of the 2021 UTME, stating that the exercise was free from malpractice as each candidate had different questions to answer, while describing JAMB Registrar, Prof Ishaq Oloyede, as a round peg in a round hole, who knows his job.\n\nEyakenyi also said the committee will pursue the amendment of the law establishing the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, to enable it limit the age of candidates writing the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME to 16 years and above.\n\nHe said the committee had identified two major areas to be addressed in the proposed amendment for the exam body to function better.\n\n\u201cOur own work is that of making laws, to legislate; we have identified two major areas that we need to go into the process of amending the act establishing JAMB. That\u2019s the area of support we will give.\n\n\u201cOther than that, we also intend to pass on what we have seen today to the appropriate MDAs, the Federal Ministry of Education to ensure the support that JAMB needs is given to them.\u201d\n\nThe committee noted that candidates should not be admitted into the university below the age of 18 as age has a lot to do with his learning ability.\n\nThe senator, who stressed the importance of education to the development and future of Nigeria, said the sector deserves maximum attention as good quality education can only be achieved through funding and commitment of teachers and students.\n\nWhile describing JAMB as a bridge between the secondary and the university, she said the agency was a necessary vehicle for the delivery of quality and standard education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf the products from the secondary schools are not properly catered for to be assessed before turning them into the university definitely you will have a problem,\u201d she said.\n\nThe committee however queried why JAMB had almost 100% performance of its 2020 budget and over N500 million devoted to staff welfare apart from their regular salaries.\n\nResponding to the alleged poor performance, Oloyede who spoke earlier said\n\nUTME is not a certification exam; hence, there cannot be an issue of mass failure. He maintained that the introduction of National Identity Number, NIN helped curb examination malpractice.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t know that in the ranking exam there is no pass or fail. You can\u2019t fail it, you are just ranking them because what qualify candidates for university education is not UTME, what qualifies you is five O level credits so, it is assumed all of them have five O level credits.\n\nHe further said that \u201cWhen we released the last results those who are making noise are the proprietors of schools and tutorial masters because of the money they have collected from the parents and their ability in the past to cut corners and get inflated results for people.\n\nOloyede explained that the budget of the board was only 75 per cent implemented as the government issued a directive that 25 per cent of funds budgeted should be returned to the federation account.",
          "summary": "The Committee members made this disclosure after the JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ish-aq Oloyede clarified them on the alleged poor performance of the 2021 UTME during their oversight visit to JAMB on Monday.\nEyakenyi also said the committee will pursue the amendment of the law establishing the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, to enable it limit the age of candidates writing the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME to 16 years and above.\nHe said the committee had identified two major areas to be addressed in the proposed amendment for the exam body to function better.\nThe committee however queried why JAMB had almost 100% performance of its 2020 budget and over N500 million devoted to staff welfare apart from their regular salaries.\nResponding to the alleged poor performance, Oloyede who spoke earlier saidUTME is not a certification exam; hence, there cannot be an issue of mass failure.",

          "text": "Nigerian governors have faulted the ownership structure of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation proposed in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB).\n\nThey made their position known in a communique issued at the end of the 32nd Teleconference meeting of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, which was held on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Forum is in full support of the unbundling and commercialisation of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) but concerned with the proposed ownership structure of the NNPC which places ownership on the Federal Government,\u201d the communique read in part.\n\nThis proposal, the governors argued ignores the fact that the NNPC is owned by the three tiers of government.\n\nRather than place the ownership of the NNPC on the Federal Government, the Governors\u2019 forum recommended that the new entity (NNPC Limited) proposed in the PIB should be owned by a vehicle that holds the interest of the three tiers of government.\n\n\u201cFor now, the institution that is positioned to carry out this mandate is the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA),\u201d the NGF said.\n\nThey plan to take up the requested amendment to the PIB as well as the proposed three percent share of oil revenue to host communities and 30 percent share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins with the relevant channels including the National Assembly and the National Economic Council (NEC) subsequently.\n\nApart from the PIB, the NGF also discussed several other issues including the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, financial autonomy for state judiciary and legislature.\n\nRead the full communique below:\n\nCOMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT THE END OF THE 32ND TELECONFERENCE MEETING (9TH IN 2021) OF THE NIGERIA GOVERNORS\u2019 FORUM HELD ON WEDNESDAY, 14TH JULY 2021\n\nWe, members of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), at our meeting held today, deliberated on issues of national importance and resolved as follows:\n\n1. Executive Order #10 and Financial Autonomy for the State Legislature and Judiciary\n\nThe Forum has approved a common template for the implementation of the Memorandum of Action signed with the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASUN) on the implementation of financial autonomy for the State legislature and judiciary. The template was developed following a meeting of the State Attorneys General and Commissioners of Finance which held on the 25th of June 2021 at the directive of the Forum.\n\n2. Nigerian Postal Service Bill, 2021 & Stamp Duties Collection\n\nThe Forum expressed concern with certain proposed amendments to the Principal Stamp Duties Act by the Nigerian Senate which seeks to remove the powers to administer and collect stamp duties from the relevant tax authorities (Federal Inland Revenue Service or State Internal Revenue Service, depending on the nature of the transaction) to the Nigeria Postal Service. The provisions of Section 163 of the 1999 Constitution requires that Stamp Duties on transactions between a company and an individual should be paid to the FIRS and returned to the State of derivation. The Forum resolved to engage with the National\n\nAssembly on the matter.\n\n3. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB)\n\nThe Forum is in full support of the unbundling and commercialization of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) but concerned with the proposed ownership structure of the NNPC which places ownership on the Federal Government. The NGF recommends that given that the corporation is owned by the three tiers of government, the new incorporated entity (NNPC Limited) should be owned by a vehicle that holds the interest of the three tiers of government \u2013 for now, the institution that is positioned to carry out this mandate is the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA). This amendment as well as the proposed 3% share of oil revenue to host communities and 30% share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins will be responded to at relevant channels including the National Assembly and the National Economic Council (NEC).\n\n4. Sale of Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) Assets\n\nThe Forum will take a position on the planned privatisation of assets of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) which were listed by the Bureau for Public Enterprise (BPE) without due consultation with State governments who are shareholders of the company. NDPHC is incorporated under the\n\nCompanies and Allied Matters Act as a private limited liability company with shareholding fully subscribed to by the Federal, State and Local Governments with a mandate to manage National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP) in the country.\n\n5. Launch of the NGF Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative\n\nThe Forum put its weight behind the launch of its Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative (PISI) set up to tackle insecurity, conflicts and violence in the country. The launch of PISI which took place on 8th July 2021 heralded an important milestone for NGF as it seeks to build a more inclusive and collaborative platform to drive an urgent country-wide response to security challenges in the country.\n\nUPDATES & PRESENTATIONS\n\n6. The Chairman of the Forum, Governor Kayode Fayemi informed members of the inauguration of the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (NPRGS) chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo with a mandate to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years. State Governors have been enjoined to nominate focal persons who will consolidate policy strategies put in place by State governments to end poverty in the country. The focal persons will be inducted into a technical working group chaired by the Governor of Nasarawa State, H.E Abdullahi Sule and co-chaired by the Honourable Minister of State for Finance, Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Ikanade Agba.\n\n7. The Forum received an update from the Governor of Lagos State H.E Babajide Sanwo-Olu on the recent rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases and call for consensual action to prevent a third wave in the country. Following the update, the Forum called on all State Governors to revive their COVID\n\nprotocols and collaborate with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to take appropriate and immediate actions to flatten the transmission curve. The Forum will interface with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 to accelerate processes required to fast track the delivery of additional vaccines for the country.\n\n8. An update on the States Fiscal Transparency, Accountability, and Sustainability \u2013 Program-for-Results (PforR) was made by Mr. Olanrewaju Ajogbasile, the NGF SFTAS Programme Manager, who informed State Governors of the ongoing verification exercise for the SFTAS disbursement linked indicators and debt reconciliation exercise carried out with the Federal Ministry of Finance,\n\nBudget and National Planning (FMBNP), the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Debt Management Office (DMO). The Forum commended the SFTAS programme office and welcomed the reconciliation exercise which will be seen through by the State Commissioners of Finance.\n\n9. Following an update on the Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus \u2013 Programme for Results (Nigeria CARES), from Mrs. Firo Elhassan, NGF Programme Manager, the Forum resolved to interface with the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning (FMBNP) and the Federal Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to ensure speedy approval and commencement of the programme in line with the 2021 budgets of States.\n\n10. Sequel to a presentation by Rt. Hon. Princess Miriam Onuoha, Chairman, House of Representatives, Committee on Disabilities on the adoption of the Discrimination against Person with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act (2018), the Forum committed to actively support, through the NGF Secretariat, the domestication of the disability law in States where it has not already been passed. Since 2018, at least twelve (12) States have passed disability laws, including Ekiti, Lagos, Kwara, Kogi, Plateau, Jigawa, Ondo, Bauchi, Anambra, Niger and River State.\n\n11. The Forum received a presentation on the Roadmap for Successful Digital Transformation Execution in States from the Chief Executive Officer of Suburban Fiber Company, Mr Bruce Ayonote. The proposal which sought to build both hard and soft digital infrastructure for State governments was welcomed by State Governors. The Forum mandated its Secretariat to facilitate the planning and partnership process with interested State governments.\n\n12. Lastly, the Forum received a report on the Diversification and Non-oil Export Opportunities for States Post-COVID-19 from the Policy Development Facility (PDF) Bridge Programme. The Forum welcomed the study and noted that findings of the report will help strengthen the diversification agenda of States.\n\nGovernor Kayode Fayemi\n\nChairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum\n\n14th July, 2021",

          "text": "A Los Angeles judge has said US pop star Britney Spears can choose her own lawyer in the fight to end her controversial conservatorship.\n\nThe ruling came on Wednesday as Spears addressed court for the second time in less than a month.\n\nSpears demanded once again that her father, Jamie Spears, be removed from the legal agreement that has controlled her affairs for years.\n\nIn court last month, she made a dramatic plea to end the agreement.\n\nOn Wednesday she repeated that appeal in an emotional statement in which she called for her father to be charged with \u201cconservatorship abuse\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to press charges. I\u2019m angry and I will go there,\u201d Spears said, speaking to the court over a lawyer\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowing my dad to ruin my life. I have to get rid of my dad and charge him with conservatorship abuse,\u201d she said.\n\nThe singer\u2019s supporters rallied outside the court, and also gathered on the other side of the country in central Washington DC as the hearing was being held.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Spears posted an Instagram video of herself doing cartwheels in celebration with a caption thanking her fans and adding \u201c#FreeBritney\u201d.\n\nSpears, 39, has been under the conservatorship since 2008, when concerns over her mental health prompted her father to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter\u2019s life.\n\nLast month a judge denied the pop star\u2019s request to remove her father from his role overseeing her conservatorship. Judge Brenda Penny said she could not make a ruling until the singer files a formal petition to terminate the arrangement.\n\nWednesday\u2019s court ruling paves the way for Spears\u2019 lawyer of choice, former federal prosecutor Mathew Rosengart, to take charge of the complex legal battle.\n\nHe will replace Samuel Ingham, the court-appointed lawyer who had been representing Spears since 2008 before stepping down last week.\n\nDuring the hearing, Mr Ingham interrupted the court to say Spears was texting him. The singer wanted to address the court again, he said.\n\nThe judge officially accepted Mr Ingham\u2019s resignation before inviting Spears to speak.\n\nMr Rosengart, the high-powered Hollywood lawyer who has previously represented Steven Spielberg and Sean Penn, was also in court.\n\nA tearful Spears told the court that under the conservatorship, her hair vitamins and coffee had been confiscated.\n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, that\u2019s not abuse, that\u2019s just [expletive] cruelty,\u201d she told Judge Penny. \u201cExcuse my language, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nThe singer said her top priority was removing her father from his role in the legal arrangement that governs her personal and financial affairs.\n\nShe said she did not wish to submit to a \u201cstupid\u201d medical assessment and would be \u201chappy\u201d for co-conservator Jodi Montgomery to remain.\n\nSpears continued: \u201cI just want you to understand how much of my time they have taken by forcing me to do these psyche tests and nothing comes of it.\u201d\n\nShe said she has \u201cextreme abandonment issues\u201d because of her father.\n\nThe singer also told the court she was \u201cextremely scared of my dad\u201d, who is a recovering alcoholic, and feared he was always going to \u201cshow up drunk somewhere and embarrass me\u201d.\n\nJamie Spears is currently the sole person in charge of his daughter\u2019 $60m (\u00a343m) estate.\n\nBut his lawyers have previously denied he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter\u2019s private life.\n\nThe singer, a mother of two, said at last month\u2019s hearing that she wanted to marry her boyfriend and have another baby, but the conservatorship would not allow her to do so.\n\nShe claimed she was prevented from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed, to make sure that she didn\u2019t get pregnant.\n\nWhile her father has overseen her estate for 13 years, his legal team say he has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health.\n\nHe was replaced on a temporary basis by Ms Montgomery, the co-conservator and care-giver of the singer.\n\nHis lawyers have requested an inquiry to establish the veracity of his daughter\u2019s testimony.\n\nThe attorneys said the father was \u201cconcerned \u201d about his daughter\u2019s well-being.",
