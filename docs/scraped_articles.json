We are not surprised at their claim because we know their antics.\n\n\n\n\u201cGoing by the result so far declared, there was no way PDP could lay claim to any victory. This is more so that in one of the Local Governments where the PDP candidate hails voting is still going on as we speak.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, the PDP\u2019s claim is tantamount to standing logic on its head. We appeal to our supporters and sympathisers in Osun and across the country to remain calm in the face of this obvious provocation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile we won\u2019t do what the desperate people in the opposition PDP did by usurping the powers of INEC, we are however confident that with the positive results from the field at our disposal, the people\u2019s support for Gov Oyetola will ultimately give him victory when the authority legally empowered to announce election results does so and he is declared Governor-elect.\u201d\n\nPDP warns against manipulation\n\n\n\nEarlier, the PDP had claimed victory in the ongoing governorship election, affirming that collated results from the polling units confirms PDP\u2019s emerging victory at the poll.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Caretaker Chairman of the party in the state, Dr Akindele Adekunle declared that the party has secured majority as well as more than two third spread across the 30 local governments and area office.\n\n\n\nThe party said: \u201cWe want to assert that Ademola Adeleke has won this election overwhelmingly going by results at our disposal. We warn against any plot by some agents of chaos to doctor the results.\n\nWe specifically call on the Electoral commission to watch fifth columnists within its fold who may have been contracted for hatchet job. Osun people have decided and their votes must be respected.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe party specifically called attention of the commission to a paid agent of the state government who is presently working round the clock to tamper with the results, vowing that any attempt to subvert the will of Osun people will be strongly resisted.",

          "text": "The terrorists who carried out the July 5 attack on the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre, Abuja launched the invasion from Karishi, a hilly community on the outskirts of the city, The Nation can now confirm.\n\nThe terrorists had converged on a mountain in the area for about two weeks, perfecting their strategy for the attack, security sources said yesterday.\n\nKarishi is about 65.6 kilometres away from the prisons.\n\nOver 600 inmates of the custodial centre, including 64 high profile Boko Haram members, were set free by the gunmen, who also killed several people.\n\nSources said farmers around the hills had tipped off security agencies about strange movement involving an unusually large number of people suspected to be terrorists in the area.\n\nIt was gathered that the tip-off was not immediately followed up on account of what was described as previous false alarms raised by villagers in some of the communities around the FCT.\n\nIt was after the attack that it became clear that the bandits launched the attack from the Karishi Mountain.\n\nA military source denied suggestions that the military got intelligence from the Department of State Services (DSS) on plot to attack the prison.\n\n\u201cWhat people should know is that the military is currently stretched thin and cannot solely undertake the responsibility of tackling the security situation in the country,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor instance, there is nowhere in the world that it is the duty of the military to guard prisons.\n\n\u201cSince the attack of the prisons, we have heard all manner of conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cSome group alleged that the Military withdrew soldiers from their duty post at Kuje to pave the way for the bandits to attack the prison. That is absolute nonsense.\n\n\u201cOthers have also claimed that the DSS gave the military intelligence before the attack, but that is also not true.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that looked like intelligence was the reports from some farmers in Karishi about the convergence of a large number of bandits on a mountain in Karishi.\n\n\u201cBut we were keeping surveillance and analysing the report when they attacked the prison.\n\n\u201cIt was after the attack that it became clear what their mission was.\n\n\u201cLike I said, the military is doing everything possible to secure the country and protect the FCT from further attack.\u201d\n\nThe military authorities have already set up a board of inquiry to ascertain what happened on that day and to know how it was possible for the terrorists to operate at the Kuje prison for several hours without any form of resistance.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Guards Brigade and Assistant Director, Army Public Relations, Captain Godfrey Abakpa, confirmed the setting up of the board.\n\nThe panel, according to him, will identify \u201cthe root cause of the attack.\u201d\n\nBut he added: \u201cNobody is being detained. Investigation is ongoing. Everybody is telling his own side of the story. It is not our job to guard prisons but we respond in support of civil authority.\n\n\u201cThe board was set up because it happened within our area of responsibility. Checkpoints and patrols were ordered because some of the escapees are believed to be still around like the one arrested in (Garki) Area 1 Park.\n\n\u201cThere should be no panic. There is the tendency that no such further attack will be possible with the arrangements in place\u201d.\n\nThe Director Defence Information, Major General Jimmy Akpor, said the security agencies would not leave anything to chance.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies are not sleeping. They are doing what needs to be done to keep the place safe. A lot of things are being done. Measures have been put in place.\n\n\u201cOf all the security agencies, none is sleeping,\u201d he said.\n\nSome of the fleeing prisons inmates have been arrested.",

          "title": "How Tinubu emerged APC presidential candidate, by Buhari The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, said yesterday that the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was a true reflection of the will of the members of the party.\n\nTinubu, the President said, emerged from a purely democratic process.\n\nBuhari spoke when he paid Sallah homage to the Emir of Katsina, Abdulmumini Kabir Usman.\n\nAccompanied on the homage by Katsina State governor, Bello Masari, the president also urged all Nigerians to show understanding with government as it continues to tackle the challenges facing the country.\n\nRecalling the events leading to Tinubu\u2019s victory at the APC June primary, Buhari said: \u201cWhen the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) signaled parties to elect their presidential candidates, we had 30 aspirants, mostly ministers in my cabinet and governors.\n\n\u201cI told each of the aspirants to go and do their best. One particular governor, in his wisdom, came to meet me and asked who they should vote for at the party convention, checking if I had a preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cThere was no need for interference, knowing the competence of all the aspirants. They went and elected Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and he picked his running mate, Sen. Kashim Shettima. I am praying that we will have peaceful and successful elections.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari, who thanked Nigerians for their support for the APC in 2015, and 2019, said he had a rich experience in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 presidential elections, travelling to all the 774 local councils in the country, and in 2019 visiting 36 states.\n\nHe said since Nigerians elected him in 2015, his administration has been doing everything to fix the country.\n\nHe asked all citizens to do their best to protect the country, saying if Nigerians know how difficult it has been for other African countries, they will thank God for their country.\n\n\u201cThey say he who wants to serve should be ready for the responsibility of leadership. Three times I wanted this position and three times I ended up at the Supreme Court. For that reason, in terms of experience, I have gathered a lot. I visited 774 local councils in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015,\u201d his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari quoted him as saying.\n\n\u201cI feel privileged that Nigerians elected me in 2015. Since then, we have been doing our best to tackle the challenges, with God helping us. We are not alone. If only we know what other countries in Africa are passing through, we will be grateful to God, and protect our country. Other African countries are passing through a lot.\n\n\u201cAs leaders, we are doing our best, and will keep doing our best to improve the situation. I am praying that the Almighty God will give us more strength and wisdom to protect our people, and fulfill our promises of ensuring wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe President said his administration would keep doing its best to address the concerns on security, which the Emir of Katsina and Governor Aminu Bello Masari highlighted in their remarks.\n\n\u201cI have heard all that the governor and emir have to say on what people expect from government. I will not add anything. I am the one receiving the orders. I will continue to do my best,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remark, the Governor of Katsina State thanked the President for his foresight in closing the borders across the country to promote local production of food, which led to self-sufficiency.\n\nHe said the lockdown during COVID-19 epidemic would have been more devastating if Nigeria was depending on other countries for food, noting that many countries and their citizens suffered more.\n\nBefore departing Katsina for Abuja, Buhari donated four bulls, two to the army and two to the airforce, bags of rice and some money to those fighting banditry and terrorism in the state for their Sallah celebration.\n\nTinubu-Shettima ticket Nigeria\u2019s best bet, says Adeyeye\n\nThe Bola Tinubu-Kashim Shettima ticket is Nigeria\u2019s best bet for the 2023 presidential election, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Dayo Adeyeye has said.\n\nAdeyeye, who spoke to journalists in Abuja said there was nothing to fear about the choice of a Muslim as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, saying: \u201cThose raising fears about possible Islamisation agenda under Tinubu-Shettima presidency should free themselves from such fears.\n\n\u201cIf Tinubu, a practicing Muslim did not Islamise his own wife who is a pastor all these years, then what would make him attempt to Islamise Nigeria?\n\n\u201cThose opposing the Tinubu-Shettima pair are doing so because they know clearly that it\u2019s a winning ticket that Nigerian voters are willing to bank on. They only want to distract the APC presidential candidate and his running mate.\n\nAdeyeye, who is the chairman of the South West Agenda (SWAGA), a pro-Tinubu political group, also reminded critics of Tinubu\u2019s benevolence towards the Christian faith when he was the governor of Lagos State from 1999 to 2007.\n\n\u201cI can recall that it was Tinubu that returned all Missionary schools in Lagos to the Christian Missions. These schools had been taken over by previous administrations in Lagos before Tinubu became governor in 1999.\n\n\u201cHe took the decision and he stood by it, despite the fact that there was stiff opposition to his action. Tinubu is a Muslim but the missionary schools he returned belonged to the Christians and he even released grants to them for their take off.\n\n\u201cTinubu fought for freedom of thought and association of Nigerian citizens for a better part of his life. Is it now that he would want to stand in the way of the religious beliefs of other Nigerians? It\u2019s just bad politics.\n\n\u201cIn politics, the most important thing for the candidate of a political party is to win the election using the right running mate who would complement his efforts by assisting him to achieve his aim.\n\n\u201cUnlike in the other parts of the country, religion and politics mix together in the northern part of Nigeria where there is a large voter population, who believe that politics is part of their religion. It will therefore be suicidal for any politician to disregard that obvious fact, and act based on sentiments.\n\n\u201cIf any political party must win from the North, there must be a Muslim from the area on the ballot; either as number one or number two. That was the reality that dictated the choice of Kashim Shettima.\n\nStory By\n\nBolaji Ogundele/ Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja/ Augustine Okezie, Katsina",

          "title": "ASUU strike: frustration, Anger as September new academic session approaches",
          "text": "By Enyeribe Ejiogu, Olakunle Olafioye, Agatha Emeadi (Lagos) and Fred Ezeh, Adanna Nnamani, Jude Idu (Abuja)\n\nIn the over five months that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has been on strike, frustration, anger and psychological agony have been the lot of millions of students, their parents and guardians.\n\nAs the face-off between the Federal Government and ASUU lingers, the ambition of these students to earn university degrees in various fileds has been on what seems indefinite suspension. In fact, truncated.\n\nStrewn across the country are despondent young people, the future of the Nigerian nation, who are worried about what the future holds for them.\n\nTens of thousands of them are fast losing hope and questioning the value of the sacrifices and deprivations they endured to study and secure good grades in the West African Secondary School Certificate Examination, pass the competitive Universal Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and the post-UTME, which allowed them secure admission into the limited opportunities in the more affordable public universities, to begin the next phase of the struggle for academic success and a better life.\n\nSad and angry over the prolonged strike, parents have been bemoaning the fact that the future of their children, for who they endured sacrifices to pay their fees, now hangs in the balance because of what several commentators have characterised as manifest leadership failure of the present Federal Government which has continued to treat with cavalier arrogance the 2009 agreement signed with ASUU, and which it has failed to honour.\n\nAs ASUU leaders claim, the government has not shown good faith in the effort being made to arrive at a fair and just re-negotiated agreement. They are quick to attribute the seeming insensitive attitude of the government to the fact that children of most top functionaries of the government as well as the political personalities involved are not affected by the strike given that their children are in private universities or studying abroad.\n\n\u201cUntil the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, alledged that the erstwhile Accountant General of the Federation, Mr Idris Ahmed, the very person supervising the contentious Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) platform, misappropriated over N174 billion, I was having the view that ASUU was not realistic in its demands.\n\n\u201cThat humongous sum would have been more than enough to cover the arrears that ASUU has been demanding. Whenever I hear the huge, astounding amounts approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) for various projects which are clearly over-estimated, even some of the projects are somewhat questionable in terms of the real need of the nation at this time, I draw the conclusion that the Federal Government simply does not care about the education of our children and their future.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s contention that it lacks the funds to meet the demands of ASUU is clearly hollow. If not so, where did the former Accountant General of the Federation find the N174 billion he was alleged to have misappropriated? My humble view is that it does not matter to the people in government today that what they are doing is definitely pushing our children to a blighted future. I cannot see it any other way,\u201d Joseph Johnson, a senior logistics manager in a popular e-commerce company with headquarters in Lekki, Lagos State, and whose brilliant son is studying Electronics and Electrical Engineering in a federal university in the Southeast part of the country, said.\n\nJohnson\u2019s pain is understable and relatable too. The classmate of his son, Olufemi (surname withheld), from Ogun State, who went to Canada to join his uncle in 2018 is about to graduate as an Electonics Engineer, while Johnson\u2019s son, Michael, was setback by the 2020 ASUU strike, which dovetailed into the COVID-19 lockdown, and lasted eight months.\n\nNow, the current strike has already lasted four months with no end in sight. These days, Michael spends part of his time giving free tutorial lessons in physics and chemistry to SS1 and SS2 students in the school where his maternal aunt is the principal.\n\nHe is fortunate to have a father who is sponsoring him for various online courses, to keep himself and mind busy doing productive things.\n\nWhen Mrs Rose Adegoke, a teacher, read a newspaper report where President Muhammadu Buhari urged ASUU leadership to call off the strike and then continue negotiation with the government while students are in school, she made this revelation in a brief chat with Sunday Sun: \u201cHonestly, I wanted to curse the government and all the people who are responsible for the pain I am going through. Can you imagine that my daughter was given admission in late January this year. As she was going through the registration process, ASUU went on strike. By then, we had paid the acceptance fee (N57,000), paid N110,000 for off-campus accommodation for one year, bought camping gas (N18,000), mattress and pillow (N18,000) and other necessary cooking utensils. What of the money we spent travelling from Lagos to Awka (N23,000) and spending five days in a hotel (almost N70,000) while she was doing the registration before moving into the private hostel where she is sharing a room with another student? After strike started, my daughter stayed for a while because we thought it would not last long. By the time members of the Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU) and Senior Staff Association of Universities (SSANU) joined the strike and the registration was suspended, my daughter came back to Lagos and has been at home since then.\n\n\u201cThe rent on her accommodation is running out, and there is uncertainty over the fate of these children. President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration is dragging its feet over this issue. Meanwhile, the wife of the President revels in the lap of luxury in Dubai? As a mother, why won\u2019t I be angry?\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President of NECA\u2019s Network of Entreprenuerial Women, NNEW, Fayo Williams, a pharmacist, is disturbed by the impasse over the negotiations between the government and ASUU.\n\nShe argued that the government from every indication has been unfair to the university lecturers.\n\nIn a phone interview with Sunday Sun, she said: \u201cThe ASUU strike does not portend good situation for this country. The solution is for us to have the political will to step into this impasse so that we bring the government and ASUU to a roundtable with an arbitrator of sort. We can find such a body such as the Institute of Mediators and Arbitrators in Nigeria. We can find such bodies or individuals who can help to bring this impasse to an end.\n\n\u201cFrom the point of view of ASUU, I know it can be very painful to have developed a payment system, these are Nigerian brains that often shine outside our shores, but somehow their solution is not being used in the country and this can be very painful because I know how the tech world feels when our homegrown solutions are not being adopted. But I want the government to look into the issue of the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) again to see whether it can be adopted in a way so that the dons are even encouraged to do more in terms of development and deployment.\n\n\u201cAgain, the alleged inconsistencies in the Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System, IPPIS, should also be looked at even for the wider civil service, where it is continually being deployed. The biggest room in the world is the room for improvement. So, there is always room for improvement in any venture. I believe the solution to this impasse is to identify a body or set of individuals who are equipped with the right professional skills to mediate in conflicts. We are not bereft of human resources in this country; we have them and they should be called upon to mediate between the government and the university unions, look at the facts and come up with a lasting solution to end the strike.\u201d\n\nWithout a doubt, the ASUU strike is \u201cimpacting negatively on the entire society because the tertiary institutions are the beehive of the young people where they stay to interact and learn and to aspire on how to build this nation,\u201d the Executive Director, Civil Liberties Organisation, Comrade Ibuchukwu Ezike, said, adding that \u201cthe youths are the engine room of every society, but when this engine room is being threatened, when it is not being nourished then there is a problem for the society. It even gives the immediate crisis we are looking at more impetus.\n\n\u201cOne of the implications of this crisis is that in the near future there may not be enough capable hands to take over from those that are here today in terms of filling the gaps in the civil service and the private sector; these are people who have been at home for a long time. There are those who are supposed to have graduated, but who could not because of the strike. What is going to happen to the new intakes? So, it is a very big unwholesome practice and it shows that the government has failed totally. The government has failed in all sectors including security, education etc. There is nothing wrong with Nigeria; our problem is bad leadership and mismanagement. We are really in big trouble. I don\u2019t think there is anything that can be done in the immediate time except to vote out the bad government of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and vote in a foresighted, energetic, patriotic and forward-looking Nigerian as the president of this nation in 2023. This problem has become intractable.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Mr Shadamoro Caleb, dismissed the government\u2019s arguments against UTAS, insisting that the 2009 agreement should be honoured.\n\n\u201cThe strike has been very devastating on the agile youths who are almost losing hope in the society and wondering what the society has in stock for them if they could be left at home for this long.\n\n\u201cMany of them have gone into practices that may be inimical to their future because idle hands are willing tools for various uncomplimentary practices. As much as the parents are willing to keep these youths at home and guide them the need for parents to provide their daily bread comes to play. They are probably despondent at the situation; they could probably be suffering from low self-esteem when they compare themselves to the youths in other countries. They could feel left out and unattended to so this can scar their psyche even for a lifetime because if you feel that your country didn\u2019t do much for you, I wonder how we can ask them to do more for the country. In this regard many youths often use this to relocate immediately after their studies and this is a huge economic drain. It is very unfortunate that Nigeria has turned into a country for training manpower for other countries. It is a despicable huge challenge.\u201d\n\nThe recent call by President Buhari, urging the leadership of ASUU to call off its strike for students to resume studies while negotiations with the governmnent continue appears to have struck the right chord in Prof. Sarah Oloko, who retired from the Department of Educational Foundation and Distant Learning Institute (DLI), University of Lagos.\n\nProf Oloko believes that ASUU has significantly made a point and should heed the president\u2019s appeal.\n\nHer position is hinged on the high probality that many students will begin to feel that their four-year programmes that now run for five to six years as a waste of time that could be used to find alternative ways of making money and achieving success.\n\n\u201cMy candid view is that the lecturers should end the strike and let students go back to the classroom because students are already weary. If not, they might lose interest in education. Becuase once they touch a few naira notes, some of them would terminate their education and waste all the time and resources their parents have put in. The next irresponsible question they would ask is \u2018who education help? Part of the effects of the industrial action is that the calendar has been abrogated. It is not fair that parents paid school fees, some even paid house rents, and all those resources went into the drains because of ASUU strike,\u201d she said.\n\nOn his part, Deputy National Vice President, Parents Teachers Association, Chief Adeolu Ogunbanjo, agreed with Prof Oloko, saying that \u201cin all, ASUU should please understand that the children have been home for the greater part of last year and this year. A four-year course is now becoming a seven-year course because of ASUU strike. They should also understand that children of many of the government officials are not in our local universities. For this reason ASUU should temper justice with mercy. They should please help parents, guardians and students because even some ASUU members have their children abroad or in private universities where there are no strikes. So, the common man is the one suffering as the two elephants are fighting. We want to plead with ASUU to agree for fresh negotiation as government has suggested and do the needful, so that schools will resume. Nonetheless, we must appreciate the fact that it is a total loss for parents who paid school fees and rented hostels for their children. Many students, both boys and girls, have gone into obnoxious things like coded prostitution even as the devil finds work in the mind of an idle man. They have gone into big time cyber crime to make money. Let them resume immediately without further delay.\u201d\n\nImmediate past president of the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, Dr Wasiu Adumadeyin, noted that \u201cASUU should resume immediately because every day the strike continues costs the students, parents and society a whole lot. Let ASUU please resume immediately and all the negative effects of the strike would stop as well.\u201d\n\nBut to Consultant Pediatrician at Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Dr (Mrs) Onyinye Anyanwu, the only way forward is for the government to honour the agreement it signed, to show good faith and that it can be trusted to keep its word.\n\nHer words: \u201cInasmuch as I want a complete end to ASUU strike in Nigeria, I think ASUU\u2019s demand in the agreement should be met. I have also heard that the Federal Government said they were not in power during that negotiation, but then government to me is a continuum. Let the government listen to them fast, so they can go back to the classrooms because the students who are tomorrow\u2019s leaders are losing, even parents and the entire society.\u201d\n\nBut, the students, who are at the receiving end of the industrial dispute, have continued to lament and complain about the negative impact of the prolonged strike on their academic destinies and future life.\n\nSome of them who spoke to Sunday Sun lamented that their ambition to graduate, secure gainful employment and help alleviate their parents from the shackles of poverty seem to have been dashed by the unending ASUU strike that had delayed their graduation and possible participation in the mandatory NYSC.\n\nOne of them, Uzoma Anenechukwu, said that she has spent six years in the university of Abuja for a four-year degree programme now with no graduation time in sight. \u201cIf I had chosen to learn trade like my friends, I could have achieved something. I shouldn\u2019t have lost both money, number of years with no hope of the certificate in sight. Can\u2019t you see my own predicament? And I guess many Nigerian students who are from poor background feel the same way.\n\n\u201cIt has become good economic survival strategy in the Southeast that young men and women who learn trade before education make fortunes quicker than those who possibly took the way of education, and it ought not to be so.\u201d\n\nSome other UniAbuja students that spoke to the school\u2019s in-house media, that was shared on Facebook appealed to all stakeholders involved in handling the strike to reach a compromise and resolve the problem permanently.\n\nIgwe Chukwuemeka Cyprian, a 400-level student from Sociology department, said, \u201cit\u2019s sad, painful. This strike affects me psychologically and emotionally. Having to stay at home this long and yet unsure when we will resume, is highly dispiriting. I fear that even when we resume, the calendar would have been considerably disrupted.\n\n\u201cMany lecturers will not cover the course outline, some will rush you madly, and these might affect both my academic and social life on campus. Government should do something, please. If government can allocate billions of Naira for projects every month, I believe they can meet up with the demands of ASUU and other unions.\u201d\n\nMsuega Daniel Terkuma, a 300-level student from the department of Economics, said: \u201cI must say that the strike has really affected me. I see myself as an excellent student and I pursue academic excellence with everything it takes.\n\n\u201cHowever, with this current strike coupled with the obvious disrespect for education in the country, I decided to let go this pursuit of academic excellence and rather focus on learning skills that can give me the future I deserve.\n\n\u201cMy dad called me some weeks ago, and asked if my last semester result was out as usual. This time my response was that he should not be expecting me to send a first class result again because I am giving more to acquiring skills rather than education. This explains just how much I have lost enthusiasm in pursuing academic excellence, and it is a consequence of this prolonged strike.\u201d\n\nHe called on the Federal government to give attention to the education sector and try as much as possible to meet the demands of ASUU. \u201cEducation is the best heritage they can give to the youth who will pilot the affairs of this country in the near future,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Isiaka Zainab Olanshile, a 400-level student of Statistics, said that the strike is not fresh to her. \u201cIt\u2019s been gathering up, as far as I can remember, for many decades. Actually, I think it smacks of insensitivity on the part of both the government and ASUU to have allowed this situation to drag us to this sorry level of our educational development.\n\n\u201cThe strike has affected me in two ways. First is that it has discouraged me from reading my books because I am uncertain about the date of resumption. The second is that my small business in school which I was using to sustain myself selling is almost dead.\u201d\n\nShe appealed to ASUU to understand that the government won\u2019t be able to meet up with all their demands, hence they should try and consider any amount given to them.\n\nAbba Victoria Ojochegbe, a 300-level biological sciences, said that the stike is a bad omen for the education sector, insisting that there is no gainsaying that education forms the bedrock of the development of any country.\n\n\u201cSo whatever reasons government may give, it cannot be justified for not meeting the demands of workers. And if the government thinks that funding education is expensive they should try ignorance. I am disturbed that I\u2019m going to have to spend more number of years in school, and I can\u2019t plan because I don\u2019t know when strike will crumble the system and how long it will last. The effect of strike on students is very negative. And that\u2019s quite frustrating.\u201d\n\nValentine Kingsley, a 400-level student of the Department of Political Science and International Relations, said that the current crisis between the government and ASUU is a catastrophic quagmire that has been legalised overtime.\n\n\u201cThe two parties have both failed the Nigerian students and the entire nation at large, since they have not been able to proffer a permanent solution to this crisis and have allowed it to fester and linger. The two parties involved need to find a neutral ground and put their differences aside so as to amicably and permanently solve the problem and allow sanity return to our various campuses,\u201d he suggested.\n\nAlso, Khadija Muhammad Ya\u2019aqub of the Department of Science and Environmental Education said that the industrial dispute shows a complete disregard for the development of our youths and the country.\n\n\u201cAs a final year student, yet to have a project topic/supervisor, the strike makes me feel so bad. My appeal to both parties is to sit down sincerely together and work things out in favour of everyone. If it continues like this, you can predict doom for this nation.\u201d\n\nAhmad Muhammad Bahar, a 600-level student from the department of Veterinary Medicine, said the crisis between ASUU and Federal Government exposes some facts, notably, government\u2019s neglect of the education sector, selfish interest on the side of ASUU, and general lack of concern for the plights of Nigerian students.\n\n\u201cAs a final year student, the strike has affected me negatively, because I have plans to graduate at certain time. My appeal to the two parties is that they should both shift ground. The Federal Government should honour part of the agreement, while ASUU should as well call off the strike for students to resume immediately.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that generally, this strike has many implications. It has caused idleness among some of our mates who are not business-oriented and also have no skills, it has exposed them to all sort of crimes and social evils that will haunt our country more.\n\n\u201cThough I spend my time researching and improving my Islamic knowledge and also participating in IT (Industrial training) at Veterinary area clinics, Gwagwalada, Abuja, I still feel nothing compares to getting back to school to finish on time.\u201d\n\nHowever, Sunday Sun, gathered that the reconstituted Federal Government/ASUU renegotiation team led by Prof Nimi Briggs, has submitted the draft copy of its report to the Federal Ministry of Education for review and suggestions before onward submission to President Buhari for action.\n\nSunday Sun could not get a snippet of the content of the report, but there are indications that the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, has taken the renegotiation meeting with ASUU in line with the directives from the president.\n\nWhen contacted, ASUU President, Prof Emmanuel Osodeke, said that decision has not been taken regarding the ongoing nationwide strike, adding that the strike is still on and its members are also feeling the heat because they have not been paid for months.\n\nHe challenged the students and parents to hold government responsible for the continuous closure of schools for months.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe strike is still on simply because the government has not met our requirements, and from all indications, they are not ready to attend to us.\n\n\u201cSeptember which is supposed to mark the beginning of new session is fast approaching. On our own side, we have finished all we need to do as a team and had shifted our decision to the government representatives to act on. We have discussed and agreed, it\u2019s left for them to sign the agreement. That\u2019s the problem we have now. If they sign the agreement we will call off the strike immediately. Nigerians should put pressure on them to sign the reversed document.\n\n\u201cLack of interest and prioritisation for education is simply responsible for the delay in signing the document. Besides, their children and wards are schooling abroad, so they can afford to abandon the Nigeria school system as long as they like.\n\n\u201cThe draft copy of the agreement is with the government and we are always available should they need us to speak on any area that requires explanation or clarification. If they have any grey area(s), they should call our attention to it.\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government has not yet reached any agreement with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), contrary to claims by the union.\n\nThis clarification was made yesterday in a statement released by the Media Office of the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige.\n\nThe statement signed by the Minister\u2019s media aide, Emmanuel Nzomiwu, also debunked the claim by ASUU that the minister was misinforming President Muhammadu Buhari on the ongoing strike.\n\nThe minister, therefore, advised the union to perish the thought of meeting with the president on the strike, but to go through the relevant authorities empowered by the law to handle industrial disputes in the country.\n\nThe statement maintained that the Federal Government has committed enormous resources towards addressing the demands of the university lecturers, but the union had failed o reciprocate the gesture by calling off its protracted strike.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThis government has been paying their allowances since last year. The government released N40 billion to ASUU and other university workers in the first quarter of last year for Earned Academic Allowances/Earned Allowances, N22.27 billion to them in August 2021 for the same EAA/EA and N30 billion for revitalisation fund, not minding the N304 billion expended by TETFund. By December last year, they had received N92.27 billion as agreed in our 2020 Memorandum of Action (MOA) and just two months after, on February 14, 2022, they went on strike.\n\n\u201cWith the minimum wage increase, there was 10 per cent increase in the salaries of workers in the university system and N35 billion was paid to them as minimum wage consequential adjustment arrears in May 2022. I appealed to the president to pay them their withheld salaries for the seven months they were on strike in 2020 and the president granted it on compassionate grounds.\n\n\u201cThe visitation panel set up late last year has finished its work and the president has signed its outcome waiting for it to be gazetted. The UTAS, ASUU\u2019s developed payment platform is being tested by NITDA. NASU and SSANU have also developed their own called U3PS. They are insisting that even if UTAS is 100 per cent perfect, their members will not be part of it. What should the government do in this situation?\n\n\u201cSo, it is not true that the minister is misinforming the president. It is ASUU that wants to circumvent the relevant government authority in charge of fixing wages and get the government to sign an agreement like the one they reached with the previous government, which offered them N1.3 trillion, which the current government found difficult to implement because of the declining revenue of the country. They didn\u2019t get the N220 billion in six years as contained in the agreement with the previous government. This time, the Federal Government wants to sign an agreement and implement it religiously. This is what ASUU does not want. They should perish the idea of meeting with the president on strike. There are relevant authorities for handling strike. They kept the children at home and are accusing the president of being uncompassionate.\n\n\u201cSince one month, they refused to translate the proposal of the Prof. Nimi Briggs Committee on the Renegotiation of their Conditions of Service to the Presidential Committee on Salaries and Wages, which is the final committee on wage increase. There is an embargo on increase in wages since 2019, following COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere is a provision in the proposal that if they go on sabbatical, the Federal Government and the universities should pay. They elongated the wage structure from Grade level 6 and 7 step 10 to step 13.The proposal from Briggs gave them 109 to 180 per cent increase in salaries.\n\n\u201cThe Trade Dispute Act says that if there is any complaint emanating from a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), such should be domiciled in the Federal Ministry of Labour for seven days. If there is going to be a wage increase, then such CBA should be domiciled with the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC), the government authority on wage fixing mechanism in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammdu Buhari yesterday in Daura, Katsina State, said that the process that led to election of former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was purely democratic, and a reflection of the will of the party members.\n\nBuhari, who spoke through a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said that during Sallah homage to the Emir of Katsina, Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, \u201cwhen the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) signaled parties to elect their presidential candidates, we had 30 aspirants, mostly ministers in my cabinet and governors.\n\n\u201cI told each of the aspirants to go and do their best. One particular governor, in his wisdom, came to meet me and asked who they should vote for at the party convention, checking if I had a preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cThere was no need for interference, knowing the competence of all the aspirants. They went and elected Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and he picked his running mate, Senator Kashim Ibrahim. I am praying that we will have a peaceful and successful elections.\u201d\n\nThe president, who thanked Nigerians for their support for the APC in 2015 and 2019, said that he had a rich experience in the presidential elections in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015, travelling to all the 774 local councils in the country and visiting 36 states in 2019.\n\nHis words; \u201cThey say he who wants to serve should be ready for the responsibility of leadership. Three times I wanted this position and three times I ended up at the Supreme Court. For that reason, in terms of experience, I have gathered a lot. I visited 774 local councils in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI feel privileged that Nigerians elected me in 2015. Since then, we have been doing our best to tackle the challenges, with God helping us. We are not alone. If only we know what other countries in Africa are passing through, we will be grateful to God, and protect our country. Other African countries are passing through a lot.\n\n\u201cAs leaders, we are doing our best, and will keep doing our best to improve the situation. I am praying that the Almighty God will give us more strength and wisdom to protect our people, and fulfill our promises of ensuring wellbeing.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said that his administration would keep doing its best to address the concerns on security, which the Emir of Katsina and Governor Aminu Bello Masari highlighted in their remarks.\n\n\u201cI have heard all that the governor and emir have to say on what people expect from government. I will not add anything. I am the one receiving the orders. I will continue to do my best,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president returned appreciation to God that the seasons had been favourable for farming and food production.\n\n\u201cAs I was going to Daura from Katsina, we had to use choppers, so I had a good view of some farms. May God continue to bless our efforts in farming.\n\n\u201cWe are still craving the understanding of all citizens. We are doing our best. We are praying that our efforts will translate into more good results. Nothing surpasses living in peace. We are praying that God will give us the advantage of dealing with all those that trouble the country. We don\u2019t know why they are doing what they are doing. We pray our people show more understanding,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, the governor of Katsina State, Masari, thanked the president for his foresight in closing the borders across the country to promote local production of food, which led to self-sufficiency.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: What God told me about Obi, Atiku \u2013Primate Ayodele",
          "text": "By Olakunle Olafioye\n\nThe man of God in-charge of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Babatunde Ayodele, has warned that except the Igbo put their house in order ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election, the prospect of leading the country would again elude their zone.\n\nPrimate Ayodele, who noted that it is the turn of the Southeast geopolitical zone to rule the country said that the zone would rue the missed opportunity and will face the wrath of future generations should the zone fail to get its acts together ahead of the election.\n\nThe popular cleric made this known in Lagos during the launch of the 2022/2023 edition of the \u201cWarning to the Nations\u201d a compendium of prophecies for countries of the world.\n\nIn his prediction for 2023 presidential election, the popular seer said that the contest will be a straight battle between the candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi and the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar whom he tipped to emerge victorious and ruled out the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu from the contest.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe Muslim-Muslim ticket will fail Tinubu and the APC totally. The APC will sink Nigeria if it attempts to impose its candidate on the country. Obi needs to re-strategize and do all the needful to be able to win the contest. In fact, Obi is going to get the backing of international community, but that won\u2019t secure his victory at the poll. But as it stands Atiku will still emerge, not Tinubu. At the end of the day, Nigeria will still vote a failed government because no change of government will make Nigeria move forward, only Obi can try it. The best of the worse will become the president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUnless Nigerians shun money for votes in 2023, Nigeria will not get the right president because of the level of poverty. Nigeria will still be backward until Nigerians reject voting for the sake of money and in 2023 there will be many special fraudulent acts by both parties, card readers problems and apart from this let us rebuke violence in election 2023. Neither PDP nor APC will make Nigeria better. Unless we get the right people the outcome of the coming election 2023 will surprise so many people and if Tinubu forces himself to be president Nigeria will collapse and he will not be able to manage the country as expected and set the country on a better pedestal. Tinubu and Atiku cannot take Nigeria to a glorious land as revealed by the spirit of the Lord.\u201d\n\nPrimate Ayodele also said that neither Atiku nor Tinubu can restructure Nigeria. \u201cNeither of these candidates can restructure Nigeria. Peter Obi can try, but the rest cannot. Restructuring will calm down issues (in the country).\u201d\n\nHe berated the government for the separate attack on the president\u2019s convoy and the attack on Kuje Prison , saying that \u201cthe government refused to listen to us because they consider us as an enemy. The attack on the president\u2019s convoy and the one at Kuje Prison were captured in my last predictions, but the government failed to yield because they see us as enemy.\n\n\u201cThe assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister; the death of the Angolan President; the uproar in Sri Lanka, the coup in Burkina Faso, Mali and many others, were some of my predictions that have come to fulfillment recently. Nigerian government and the governments all over the world must cultivate the habit of paying serious attention to prophecies in the interest of their people.\n\n\u201cNigeria as a country needs prayers for peace. Let us pray for unity of the country. Let us pray against political, communal, economic, religious and security troubles. Only God will save the country to go beyond 2035 except right steps are taken to right the wrongs.\n\n\u201cNigerians in 2023 need a lot of prayers to avert doom in our country. We need to pray against political tension. We should pray against cases of collapsed bridges, unusual tension and against unexpected explosions that will take lives.\u201d\n\nOn APC\u2018s decision to settle for Muslim-Muslim ticket, Primate Ayodele said: \u201cAPC wants to islamise Nigeria. That Muslim-Muslim ticket cannot work in Nigeria. It will only earn the party failure. APC cannot win, Tinubu cannot win except they rig the election. Mind you it is the cabal that wants to install him because the cabal is very much interested in this election. If APC wins, Nigeria will sink. Atiku will only do little. The people who can do it were not given the tickets.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in trouble. Security-wise we are in trouble, economically we are in trouble. Herdsmen are still going to cause trouble in the nation\u2019s agricultural sector.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos-based cleric also predicted confrontation between the adherents of the IMN and the nation\u2019s security operatives, saying that \u201cthe Islamic Movement in Nigeria founded by El Zak-Zaky will still cause problems and Nigeria needs to be careful because they will be killing police operatives.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on terrorism in Nigeria, Primate Ayodele said: \u201cI foresee that a lot of facts will emerge on the names of top people in the country who are sponsoring these terrorist groups: ISWAP, Boko Hara and Islamic Movement in Nigeria. Their sponsors will be exposed.\n\n\u201cThe country needs prayers against insecurity. I foresee that in Africa herdsmen will become more rampant in killings and kidnappings. The spirit of God says apart from the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) terror gang, there will be new terrorist groups. I foresee that there will be ethnic and tribal problems. There is need to pray to survive all these.\n\n\u201cFarm produce will be expensive and the economy will not be stable. There will be political tension and let us pray for unity in this country. I foresee that some political heads will be involved in terrorism even as members of the cabal will be working in order to cause problem. The country will experience religious crises as churches will be attacked. There will be fight between the Igbo and the Hausa, on one hand, and the Hausa and the Yoruba, on the other hand.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s rebuke the death of a one time Minister, Vice President, President, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Deputy Inspector General of Police and a Senator. ASUU will still go on strike. Nigeria needs lots of prayer to be successful as a nation. I foresee changes in Nigeria even as I foresee new things in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, not all deputy governors and speakers will finish their terms. Some governors will be indicted and EFCC will run after them. Some aides of Buhari and some federal permanent secretaries need to be careful and watchful to avert problems.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, let us pray so that there will be no case of contaminated oil products and for any vessel not to sink that will affect the economy of the country. Let us pray not to have issues as regards any of our oil storage facilities.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, states that will have crisis are: Kano, Kaduna, Nassarawa, Borno, Kogi, Imo, Anambra, Ondo, Ekiti, partly Kwara and Plateau. The government should work on these states.\n\n\u201cLet us rebuke attacks on morgues and stealing of corpses. Let us rebuke attacks on hospitals and the kidnapping of Chief Medical Directors and Professor.\u201d",

They promised that this election is going to be transparent, peaceful, free and fair.\u201d\n\nDespite silent strategy of vote buying, he expressed confidence that he will emerge the winner of the election.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cI am not afraid, I am confident of winning the election.\u201d\n\n11:39 am\n\nGovernor Isiaka Gboyega Oyetola of Osun state voting at his ward L A Primary School Oloiyi Popo, ward 1 polling unit 002, Iragbiji in Boripe Local Government Area during Osun state Governorship election Saturday 16 July 2021\n\n11:17 am\n\nOyetola Votes, Commends INEC for Peaceful Poll\n\nDeji Elumoye in Osogbo\n\nGovernor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the peaceful conduct of the state gubernatorial poll.\n\nOyetola, who is seeking re-election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) cas his vote at 10.55 am after being accredited at polling unit 01ward one at Local Authority primary school in Popo area of Iragbiji, Boripe local government area of the state of the living spring.\n\nThe governor who spoke with newsmen after casting his vote said reports reaching him had it that the governorship poll is peaceful across the state.\n\n11:14 am\n\nThe Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola arrived with his wife at about 10.45am\n\nAccord Party Candidate, Akin Ogunbiyi, voted at Ward5, unit 3, Methodist Pry.

Voters conducted themselves well.\n\n09:04am\n\nVoters at their polling units\n\n07:10am\n\nOyetola, Adeleke Go Head to Head as Osun State Votes\n\n*PDP claims APC planning to rig election\n\n*INEC promises free, fair poll\n\n*Police deploy 21,000; NSCDC positions 11,226 men\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nAfter weeks of acrimonious campaigns, the people of Osun State will today decide whether Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) should continue for another four years or elect a new man to succeed him.\n\nFifteen political parties are fielding candidates for today\u2019s election, but it is evidently a straight fight between Oyetola and Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThis would be the second time the two candidates would be meeting. Both Oyetola and Adeleke contested for the Osun governorship position in 2018, which Oyetola won after a rerun.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured the people of a free and fair poll and spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the 332 registration areas across the 30 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe election umpire restated its readiness to announce the result in less than 12 hours after the poll.\n\nThe two leading political parties are desperate to win today\u2019s contest to signpost readiness to dominate the 2023 elections.\n\nTo underpin the importance of the poll, the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu led a final campaign for Oyetola last Tuesday. He was accompanied by party chieftains like the party\u2019s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima and several APC governors.\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar also led a powerful campaign team to the state on Thursday assuring the people that Adeleke is sure of victory in the poll, and that \u201can end has come to the reign of the ruling APC\u201d in the country.\n\nAtiku was accompanied by the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; Vice-presidential candidate of the party and Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and some governors of the PDP.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across Osun State, with voters bitterly divided among the two leading candidates.\n\nFear of violence was palpable, considering the rancorous campaigns before the poll.\n\nThe allegations by the PDP that the APC was working to rig the poll dominated discussion across the state.\n\nPolice Deploy 21,000 Operatives\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba has assured Nigerians that today\u2019s poll would be violence-free.\n\nBaba, who spoke last Tuesday, said to accomplish the task, no fewer than 21,000 operatives would be deployed across the state.\n\nBaba warned that the police would not allow any person or group of persons, no matter how highly and lowly placed in the society to derail the electoral process, and vowed that \u201cvote-buying or any form of inducement would not be allowed as they remained serious offences.\u201d\n\nThe IG adds: \u201cThe police will be deployed to protect the facilities of INEC and its personnel. This deployment is not meant to intimidate any law-abiding citizens; rather it is to deter misguided elements that may threaten the conduct of the election and violate the electoral act. It also serves as a strong warning that government is determined to protect the citizens.\u201d\n\nThe IG has also deployed the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department, DIG Johnson Kokumo, for the governorship election.\n\nAlso deployed to the state are four Assistant Inspectors-General of Police, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police.\n\nBaba also moved the Osun State Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode (temporarily) to the Force Headquarters until the conclusion of the election.\n\nNSCDC deploys 11,226\n\nSimilarly, the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi, has deployed 11,226 officers and men to cover the 3,763 polling units, collation centres, flash points, as well as critical national assets and infrastructure during today\u2019s poll.\n\nThe deployed personnel were drawn from the national headquarters and nine state commands; Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Oyo, Ogun, Lagos, Kwara, Kogi and Edo to supply manpower for the election.\n\nThe NSCDC said the objectives of the corps in the election were to create a secured environment for its successful conduct and enhance the general security in the state before, during and after the election.\n\nOyetola and Adeleke\n\nThe leading candidates for today\u2019s poll remain Oyetola and Adeleke.\n\nOyetola, who is seeking reelection for a second term, enjoys the privileges that come with being incumbent. He is also enjoying the perks of \u2018federal might\u2019 and the backing of Tinubu.\n\nHis chances in today\u2019s poll has been brightened by his good relationship with Osun civil servants. Unlike his predecessor who owed salaries for months, Oyetola has been consistent with salary payment and also improved the welfare of the civil servants. All of these, pundits argue, will work in his favour.\n\nHowever, the cold war between Oyetola and Rauf Aregbesola, his predecessor, may reduce the former\u2019s votes in LGAs controlled by the latter.\n\nThe disharmony within the party left it with factions \u2013 the Ileri Oluwa group is loyal to Oyetola while TOP pledges allegiance to Aregbesola.\n\nNotwithstanding, Oyetola stands a very good chance of getting a second term today.\n\nAdeleke, the \u201cdancing senator\u201d, says he is determined to recover his \u201cstolen mandate\u201d from the APC. He is in the race with a big war chest. He also has a broad support base.\n\nA lot of people from Adeleke\u2019s Osun West Senatorial District, which is yet to produce a governor since the fourth republic, are agitated. Adeleke will gain from this, but may not be enough to make him governor.\n\nThe crisis in Osun PDP may also affect Adeleke\u2019s chances. The party is also divided into factions. One is recognised by the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) while the other is backed by Olagunsoye Oyinlola, a former governor of the state, whose political sway in the state cannot be overlooked.\n\nStrengths on Senatorial Basis\n\nOyetola looks good to win Osun Central where he is from. Besides, many prominent Osun political stakeholders are from this senatorial zone, and they belong to the APC. They include former governor, Chief Bisi Akande and the current Senator, Ajibola Basiru, who is also the Oyetola campaign chairman. Osun Central is good-to-go for Oyetola.\n\nAdeleke is from Osun West, with Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party. Here, Adeleke will have an upper hand, but not enough to make him governor. Oyetola will still get substantial votes here.\n\nIn Osun East, Adeleke will benefit greatly from the influence of Francis Fadahunsi, the Senator representing the area, who is a PDP member. Oyetola\u2019s good performance during his first term will give him victory in Osun East.\n\nINEC Chairman Charges Staff on Good Conduct\n\nThe Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu yesterday charged the staff of the Commission to remain neutral and repeat the transparent conduct exhibited in Ekiti State governorship election four weeks ago.\n\nIn a statement he signed, the INEC chairman, said: \u201cExactly 27 days ago, we conducted and concluded the Ekiti Governorship Election that was widely adjudged to be free, fair, credible, and inclusive.\n\n\u201cThe feat was happily an elongation of the earlier successes recorded in Edo and Ondo states on 15th September and 10th October 2020, and in Anambra State on 6th November 2021. The sheer determination, resilience, and competence displayed by all of you, our members of staff, made it possible for the Commission to achieve these lofty goals.\u201d\n\nHe reminded the staff of the commission of the need to maintain the same impartial conduct exhibited in the other states.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cI have assured our stakeholders and the people of Osun State that the Commission will not do anything to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate. We have made adequate arrangements for the election. We have promised a level playing field for all. The security agencies have assured us of safety.\n\n\u201cThe people of Osun State and Nigerians will understandably hold us to our promise on election day. They will observe our attitude and behaviour from the opening to the closing of polls. They will particularly observe our management of the election results and measure the extent of our adherence to the extant laws through every stage of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of commitment and professionalism, remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour. You must also stick to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed. I have the confidence in your ability to consolidate on our recent successes.\u201d\n\nPDP Claims APC Planning to Rig Election\n\nThe PDP yesterday alleged an orchestrated plot by the APC \u201cto derail the nascent democratic process by compromising the integrity and sabotaging the will and desire of the people for a free, fair, transparent and credible electoral process\u201d in today\u2019s election in Osun State.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba alleged that the APC had accentuated its rigging programme by deploying billions of naira to compromise some security and electoral officers to intimidate voters, manipulate electoral process and inordinately favour Oyetola, against the will of the people.\n\nThe PDP alleged that huge money had been funneled to certain compromised security and INEC officials \u201cto execute this ignoble scheme.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cthe said INEC and security officials are reported to have been bought over to, among other things, criminally assist and provide cover for APC agents to prosecute a well-oiled vote buying and violence-triggering scheme.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba adds. \u201cOur Party has information on how two prominent APC governors from the South-west, a former APC National Chairman from the South-south, certain federal minister and a particular member of the House of Assembly from Lagos State are coordinating the release of billions of naira to bribe electoral and security officials, as well as fund heavily armed thugs imported from Lagos, Ondo, Ogun and other South-west states to unleash violence and help the APC to rig the election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said that it had however been made aware that some patriotic INEC and Police officials vehemently rejected the poisonous offer by the APC.\n\nThe PDP called on the IG and Yakubu \u201cto take immediate decisive steps to check the activities of police and INEC officials deployed to Osun State so as to avert a breakdown of Law and Order, especially given the manifest determination of the people of Osun State to resist the APC on its evil scheme.\u201d",

          "text": "CONVERSATION WITH MY BILLIONAIRE FRIEND\n\n(SESSION 24)\n\nA few days before our usual meeting day, my Billionaire Friend called me to hint that he would like to share a thought that could be the subject of our next discussion if it was okay with me. I was all ears. He started with a question: Have you heard of the expression \u201chealth is wealth\u201d? I answered in the affirmative and he then asked further: Do you know what it means?\n\nMy reply: \u201cThat is obvious enough. It means when you take care of your health, you are putting yourself in a position to build wealth\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I want to stretch it a bit further, and if it is alright by you, we shall dwell more on it during our next meeting. I gave him my nod on the subject.\n\nOnce we settled down for the session, my Billionaire Friend took off from where we stopped our telephone conversation:\n\nHEALTH IS WEALTH\n\n\u201cMy boss, health is wealth is not just a clich\u00e9; it is at the core of wealth building, but unfortunately, many people trying to build wealth are not conscious of this reality. I have observed individuals who run around, especially during their youth, trying by all means to make a name, fame and wealth but totally neglecting to take care of their health, erroneously thinking that once the money is made, they would take care of their health. They ultimately find this to be a disastrous assumption.\n\n\u201cHere is the reality, from personal observations, experience and what I have also read: once your health is fundamentally assaulted, everything may come to a halt and worse, it could get to a point where you will not be able to just throw money at it. Once your health is affected, lofty dreams can vanish; great visions can perish, and the wealth you have spent your vigour to build may become meaningless. I was once told of a wealthy man who sold all his property worth quite a lot at a fraction of the value, just to get cash, yet he could still not make it\u201d.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerian wealth owners and builders have died for not paying attention to and investing in their health while being fixed and busy only stashing wealth in vaults. Some of my close friends have died from lacking investment in regular medical checks and attention to their health\u201d.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, my boss; ill health can still come to anyone for a variety of reasons; what I want us to focus on in this subject is why wealth builders should be intentional about taking care of their health if they truly want to build enduring wealth\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn building wealth, wealth builders must take cognisance of the importance of their health. Otherwise, the whole effort of wealth building would end up worthless for their lives. Wealth builders must therefore be conscious of the need to regularly monitor and take care of their health, to ensure that they live and work with a sound mind, body, energy, good health, and the right mind to build their wealth\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe common health issues that generally occur with wealth builders, in their usually concentrated, focused and very busy search for wealth, are health problems arising from; overweight, or or mental health, workplace injury, violence, environmental quality, etc. These problematic health issues globally affect wealth builders. It is therefore important for wealth builders to always remain conscious that man must first be alive and well before he can ably build and enjoy wealth. Otherwise, wealth building would not be worth its effort\u201d.\n\n\u201cWealth builders must pay attention to the need for regular and continuous monitoring of their health by medical doctors, particularly their heart. Health problems of the heart cover many heart conditions, including heart disease, infection, congenital heart defects and coronary heart disease. These heart problems can usually easily be detected from simple blood analysis in medical laboratories for the detection and treatment by medical doctors. But wealth builders must first submit themselves for such analysis, detection and treatment of their heart conditions to save them from developing serious heart conditions or sudden deaths. It is generally common to find wealth builders pursuing wealth without investing in their health. Hence, in many cases, fatal health injuries occur due to wealth builders not undergoing regular medical checkups.\u201d\n\nFAMILY HEALTH\n\n\u201cBeing mindful of wealth builders\u2019 family health history is also important. In that wise, wealth builders should find out and be fully aware of their family health histories for good health investment. For instance, such knowledge of family health history is necessary for the early detection of hypertension and diabetes, which are the most recurrent health problems with wealth builders and owners as they age. Generally, parents\u2019 health history has some relevance and correlation with the health of their offspring. Most times, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes can be traced to people\u2019s parents. However, if wealth builders have taken the trouble to be aware of the likely development of such genetically occurring health issues, investing by wealth builders to prevent, detect or better manage such health issues would be better achievable. Early detection of diabetes and hypertension would allow wealth builders to take good pre-emptive actions, in consulting their medical doctors, usually long before these health problems rear their heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cWealth builders should also invest in creating the right environment around them to avoid the possible development of chronic respiratory diseases and avoid smoking and smokers. Smoking is medically known to be carcinogenic. Wealth builders must avoid smoking since it is known to damage the lungs and lead to chronic respiratory diseases in the long run. Therefore, it is strongly-recommended for wealth builders to invest in their health via regular checkups, using their recommended drugs appropriately and ensure that their medical doctors properly monitor their health performance.\u201d\n\nDISEASES: LITTLE FOXES THAT SPOIL THE VINE\n\n\u201cMany chronic respiratory diseases usually start gradually. Hence, generally, investment in the early detection of pulmonary diseases and chronic bronchitis are very vital to the health and sustenance of the pursuit of wealth by wealth builders working in susceptible environments. Wealth builders with asthma and occupational lung diseases also need to regularly invest in closely monitoring their health to look out for any possible early development.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne area of human health which wealth builders need to pay close attention to, is the early detection of cancer. The symptoms of cancer for early detection include lumps or thickening of the skin, fatigue, skin changes, unexplained bleedings, etc. Once these begin to rear their heads, wealth builders must take prompt measures to invest in a thorough investigation before such early symptoms of cancer development to advanced stages. We can go on and on about the health issues usually occurring during wealth builders\u2019 earnest pursuit of wealth. However, the whole essence of this conversation is the need for wealth builders to invest in and pay due attention to their health while seeking wealth. Wealth without health has no value and significance because man needs a healthy life to enjoy wealth. Wealth builders\u2019 benefits of investing in health are enormous because they need to take care of their survival, energetic body, stable health and flexible body to build wealth and make significant contributions to societal, national and human development.\u201d\n\n\u201cWealth builders who do not invest in resting, recreating, engaging in pleasurable leisure activities and some simple exercises only end up with cerebrovascular diseases. These occur more regularly with ageing wealth builders who ignore their health but spend their time solely pursuing and accumulating wealth.\u201c\n\n\u201cStroke is most common with this class of wealth builders, as their blood supply to the brain is cut off, depriving their brain\u2019s delicate tissue of oxygen and its necessary nutrients. To avoid the occurrence of stroke, wealth builders need to consult their doctors regularly, carry out regular check-ups of their oxygen levels and systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels and also regularly monitor their blood sugar levels to avoid stroke, which is common with wealth builders that jettison their health for pursuing wealth only\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs earlier mentioned, many wealth builders suffer from stroke, particularly those wealth builders who, as a result of the abundance of their financial endowments, end up not caring about what they ingest as food and drinks and thus develop obesity without caring about investing in their health or exercising regularly. Diabetes can be genetic, but its occurrence can be minimised by those wealth builders who watch their food and alcoholic drink intake to prevent it. In such cases where the health problems of diabetes have already occurred, then such wealth builders who have invested in managing such problems would, of course, be saved from the resulting complications. The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely they will suffer long-term health complications. Therefore, wealth builders need to invest and pay particular attention to regularly monitoring the sugar levels in their blood. The health complications that can arise from long-term diabetes include kidney failure, nerve damage, eye damage, cardiovascular diseases, etc.\u201d\n\nINVESTMENT IN HEALTH INSURANCE\n\n\u201cWe must realise that medical insurance companies that provide this health insurance policy coverage run for profitable goals and that they do make profits. Therefore wealth builders are encouraged to establish health insurance and health gym firms as viable opportunities for building wealth. Since health insurance is vital in the management of people\u2019s health, then Nigerian with very poor public health facilities, over 200 million population and with only 3% of its population, investing in the provision of health insurance coverage offers wealth builders a great opportunity to wealth builders to grow their wealth in such an environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI started by investing in foreign health insurance outside Nigeria, long before the emergence of good health insurance companies in Nigeria. I had to be coughing out some $15,000 per annum for myself and my spouse, on medical insurance coverage, including medical evacuation out of Nigeria, in the absence of good local health facilities and health insurance companies. However, since the emergence of good health insurance companies in Nigeria, I have stopped procuring foreign health insurance policies for some years. I pay for my Nigerian health insurance policy in naira. It covers up to N50 000,000 naira health coverage and business class evacuation to the nearest centre of medical excellence outside Nigeria, with me as the patient and one person accompanying me and full treatment in private wards outside Nigeria. Wealth builders should take advantage of the National Health Insurance Scheme Act for themselves and their organisations. It has worked very well for me, my family and personnel. Nigeria\u2019s health insurance coverage is good, working, covers all classes of the economic strata and therefore comes highly recommended. It is generally known that good health is directly related to a productive life. Owning all the wealth in this world without good health is foolishness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI enjoin you to be familiar with the last words of the world\u2019s famous billionaire \u2013 Steve Jobs, to further appreciate this my position. The functionality of the human body is interconnected between various organs of the human body. Therefore, keeping wealth builders healthy is essential for their proper functioning towards their devoted pursuit of wealth. Hence, wealth builders must regularly monitor and take good care of their physical, mental health and social well-being, to ensure that their pursuit of wealth ends up meaningful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile covering this subject, one is tempted to ask how best can one ensure that wealth builders save themselves the huge expense of maintaining good health at all times. The answer to this is obvious with the National Health Insurance Scheme Act, which enabled many health insurance firms to emerge and thrive for the benefit of wealth builders and others in Nigeria. Wealth builders should procure health insurance for their health and their personnel. In doing this, they will save themselves the expense and trouble of coughing out unplanned and unbudgeted funds for providing health facilities for their personnel. Health insurance generally minimises the overall cost of providing health facilities for families and the personnel of wealth builders. There are many health insurance companies currently operating in Nigeria, and the cost in Nigeria, for procuring health insurance coverage is not as exorbitant as it is generally perceived here by Nigerians. Indeed one reason for this discussion is to make Nigerians aware that the procurement of health insurance in Nigeria is not out of the reach of ordinary Nigerians. This conversation is thus aimed at simplifying the myth around medical insurance coverage and providing some basic information and knowledge about this very important medical protective care need at the most minimal cost to Nigerians. Indeed, health insurance covers all different economic strata. There are, thus, levels for the poor, the average class, and the wealthy. The levels for the poor could be as low as N42, 000 naira per annum while for others, it ranges from N80, 000 \u2013 N600 000 per annum\u201d. Health insurance policies extend from providing essential medical maintenance coverage in hospitals to providing surgeries for the poor while providing for the wealthy in medical evacuations out of Nigeria, in cases where required medical facilities are not available in Nigeria. This information is also for wealth builders, towards investing in not only providing good health coverage for their personnel and staff but in the process, motivating the productivity and optimisation of their personnel outputs, towards greater wealth builders profitability and business survival.\n\n\u201cEfforts should therefore be made by wealth builders to procure good health insurance policies for their personnel, for coverage in hospitals closest to their homes as arranged under their different insurance policies, towards reducing staff medical cost of accessing and receiving health coverage. This conversation became necessary from a recent experience of a close friend, who, out of lack of health insurance coverage, caused some embarrassment. This very committed and hardworking but uninformed sick friend is currently experiencing a major unexpected medical condition because of being without subsisting health insurance coverage. He has had to have cause to resort to friends and associates for assistance. His subsequent unexpected major surgeries, lengthy hospitalisation, and now evacuation would have been well covered under a good medical insurance policy in Nigeria and Naira, including his resulting evacuation. All that good medical insurance coverage would have taken from him on regular payment of his insurance premiums would have only been appending his signature to the medical invoice covering the total cost of his treatment, surgeries, and medical maintenance costs.\n\nRemember: health is wealth. Invest in your health while pursuing wealth\u201d\n\nThus far\u2026\n\nI can\u2019t wait to catch up with you next week.\n\nEmail:ayo.arowolo@thisdaylive.com\n\nQUOTE 1\n\nHere is the reality, both from personal observations, experience and what I have also read: once your health is fundamentally assaulted, everything may come to a halt and worse, it could get to a point where you could not be able to just throw money at it. Once your health is affected, lofty dreams can vanish; great visions can perish, and the wealth you have spent your vigour to build may become meaningless.\n\nQUOTE 2\n\nThis conversation became necessary from a recent experience of a close friend, who, out of lack of health insurance coverage, caused some embarrassment.

          "title": "The curious case of northern Christians",
          "text": "The rumpus over the Muslim-Muslim presidential pairing of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was, I have to say, inevitable. I would be lying to say I was surprised. Since Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu announced the choice of Alhaji Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno state, as his running mate, the outrage has been deafening. First, I expected northern Christians to kick against it. I also expected the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Conference of Catholic Bishops and Pentecostal pastors to oppose it vehemently. I expected the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), its allies and other opposition figures to jump on it. So far, my predictions have been fairly accurate.\n\nMany things divide us sharply in Nigeria depending on the situation at hand. It could be religion today and region tomorrow. It could be ethnicity or sub-ethnicity. It could be senatorial district or local government. Politics at state level often escapes national attention, but it is a microcosm of the macrocosm. What Tinubu\u2019s candidacy has brought out clearly is the delicate balancing act in the macrocosm. We traditionally think Nigeria is north and south. A southerner has picked a northerner as his running mate. That is balancing, no? It solves one puzzle and creates another: a Muslim choosing another Muslim. It is not enough to balance the region \u2014 you must also balance religion.\n\nNorthern Christians saw Tinubu\u2019s candidacy as a rare opportunity for one of them to be the vice-presidential candidate. But in the cold calculations of electoral dynamics, the question Tinubu and his strategists would have asked themselves is: how many northern Christian politicians carry enough weight to rally the critical mass of northern voters? To the best of my knowledge, there are no Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri Christians who are political heavyweights. More so, the major identity marker in the north is religion. You typically identify first as a Muslim or Christian before your ethnic stock. That is why politically, the north is analysed along religious rather than ethnic classification.\n\nConversely, religion is not the major identity marker in the south. Political classification is usually ethnic: Igbo, Yoruba and \u201csouthern minorities\u201d. Even in the south-west, which is mainly a mixture of Christians and Muslims, religion is peripheral to politics, and that should explain why a predominantly Muslim state will elect a Christian as governor, sometimes along with Christian deputies. In Ogun, the baton is regularly passed between Muslims and Christians, even though it is not planned. In political fights, you will have Christians backing Muslims and vice versa. Religion is hardly on the front burner, although there are ongoing efforts to damage that admirable culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn view of the Tinubu situation, one question that is being asked again and again is why he was reluctant to pick a Christian from the north. One pastor even said there are more Christians than Muslims in the north, a claim that cannot be backed by evidence. Of the 19 northern states, only three are governed by Christians: Benue, Plateau and Taraba. Two other states that have produced Christian governors in this dispensation are Adamawa and Kaduna \u2014 both by default, after the governor or governor-elect resigned, died or was impeached. Why, then, are northern Christians not using their \u201cmajority\u201d to vote Christians as governors if the pastor\u2019s claim is the gospel truth?\n\nBut that begs the question. Must a northerner be a Muslim before he or she can enjoy the support of northern Muslim voters? That is the question at the heart of this debate which we are hardly addressing. Pray, what is wrong with northern Muslims voting for a northern Christian? Why can\u2019t northerners support fellow northerners no matter the religion? If Yoruba Muslims willingly vote for Yoruba Christians without frontloading religion, why shouldn\u2019t northern Muslims also back northern Christians and put region above religion? Do northern Muslims truly have an agenda against their Christian counterparts, to keep them perpetually subdued through the use of political power?\n\nWhen you talk to northern Christians, especially those in the core north, they believe there is a plot to keep them down. They complain about being denied equal opportunities with their Muslim counterparts in areas such as allocation of land to build churches and state sponsorship of pilgrimage. They complain of being incessantly denied federal appointments and deputy governorship slots in states like Niger. Increasingly in recent times, they allege \u201cgenocide\u201d by \u201cFulani jihadists\u201d and allege that the security agencies are colluding with them, and that there is a plot to wipe out Christians from the north. This thinking has reinforced the northern Christian solidarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA closer look at the facts, though, will reveal that the animosity is limited to a few states. In fact, Kaduna is the \u201cepicentre\u201d. The governor and deputy are Muslims and all ministerial appointments since 2015 have gone to Muslims. Things were more balanced in the past, but it still has to be said that even when there were Christian deputy governors and Christian ministers, Kaduna was still prone to ethno-religious bloodshed. Thousands were killed in upheavals between 2000 and 2002. It is, therefore, difficult to blame the perennial animosity on political appointments. Gombe\u2019s religious composition is similar to Kaduna\u2019s but there is peace and harmony. Something should explain that.\n\nFrom what I have observed so far, Christians in Kwara, Kogi, Adamawa, Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Borno and Nasarawa states appear to get along with their Muslim compatriots, at least generally speaking. There will be little tensions here and there but it is very rare to hear of religious upheavals and killings in those states. Perhaps they have devised a way of managing their differences. In Plateau, Benue and Taraba, Muslims often complain of being pushed to the margins. Jos, in particular, has been a basket case in the last 22 years and something tells you another bloodshed is just a snap-of-the-finger away. Some of these things are deeply rooted in history and sustained through politics.\n\nThe irony of it all, if it can be so described, is that Christians used to play prominent roles in northern Nigeria, notably from the 1950s when Sir Ahmadu Bello was the premier of the Northern Region. He ran a system that accommodated not just Christians but ethnic minorities. The case of Chief Sunday Awoniyi, a Yoruba Christian who served as executive secretary of the Northern Regional Government in the 1960s, is often cited, but there were many similar stories. Bello shared scholarships and economic opportunities equitably to hold the north together. Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, whom he anointed as the prime minister in 1960, was of the minority Gere ethnicity in today\u2019s Bauchi state.\n\nWhen the January 1966 coup wiped out many northern military officers, it was Gen Yakubu Gowon, a northern Christian, that the north made head of state after the July 1966 counter-coup. His two deputies \u2014 military and civilian \u2014 were Christians. He ruled for nine years. In the military, which held power for decades, northern Christians were key players. Gen TY Danjuma, former army chief, was respected by both northern Muslims and Christians. In the 1980s, there was the \u201cLangtang Mafia\u201d, made of influential military officers from Plateau state. They were all Christians. Brig David Mark and Brig Tunde Ogbeha were at the centre of action and defended the \u201cnorthern interest\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to getting key military positions, northern Christians used to head at least one federal para-military institution \u2014 customs, immigrations, prisons and fire service \u2014 until 2015. Clearly, the Christian north used to have its pride of place. They were no pushovers. So, what changed? What happened to the bloc that was \u201cpolitically strategic\u201d to the core north and that used to provide the balancing factor in the socio-political configuration of Nigeria? Why is the Christian north no longer producing personalities like Gowon, Awoniyi and Danjuma who had cross-ethnic and cross-religious appeal? That is the burning question. The bigger question is how this old glory can be restored.\n\nI wish I had the answer. A northern Muslim, who often shares his thoughts with me without filter, sent me this chat in reaction to my article, \u201cThe Awkward Muslim-Muslim Ticket\u201d (THISDAY, June 19, 2022): \u201cThis unfortunate situation started with the formation of CAN. Our Christian brothers were told, taught and blackmailed to stop playing politics with mainstream northern political bloc. Very hostile southern press are at the centre of all this, and [northern Christians] boxed themselves into a corner which will NEVER protect their political interest.\u201d I would add that southern politicians also played up the religious differences up north in order to get the votes of the minorities.\n\nBut northern Christians will say something else: that they are only resisting an Islamisation and domination agenda by the Hausa-Fulani. What I can say with certainty is that since the 1980s, there has been a rise in religious extremism on both sides of the divide, and ethnic nationalism is getting stronger. There is mutual distrust, even hate. In short, the northern Nigeria of today is not the same northern Nigeria of the 50s, 60s and 70s. I suspect things started changing in the mid-80s, particularly with the storm over Nigeria\u2019s involvement with the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC). Today, a northern Christian feels more like a southerner and aligns with the south.\n\nMeanwhile, if I were to advise Christians on the Tinubu-Shettima ticket, I would suggest that they play politics with wisdom. They must be strategic and less emotional. Since Muslims will hold the No 1 and No 2 positions if Tinubu wins, Christians should play for the No 3 and No 4 slots for \u201cbalancing\u201d. Otherwise, they should vote for Abukakar Atiku/Ifeanyi or Peter Obi/Datti Baba-Ahmed. They definitely have plenty options. But, really, what do vice-presidents do? The senate president and speaker are more influential. More importantly, being vigilant over religious equity will be more useful for Christians than having a VP who is largely a space filler \u2014 like a redundant semi-colon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nOBI-DIENT AFENIFERE\n\nChief Ayo Adebanjo, the leader of Afenifere, the Yoruba socio-cultural pressure group, has endorsed Mr Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party. This gesture should not be overlooked: the Yoruba and Igbo are political rivals. There is thus a \u201cnational unity\u201d value in the endorsement by Adebanjo, who fell out with Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate, over 20 years ago. The Afenifere endorsement may not carry much electoral value \u2014 they endorsed President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in 2019 to no avail \u2014 but it is something that can be built upon as we continue to seek handshakes across the divides in our politics. Positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSPY CATCHER\n\nMr Usman Alkali Baba, the inspector-general of police, on Wednesday ordered a ban on the use of police SPY vehicle number plates \u201cirrespective of whether it is authorised or not\u201d. He said the order is necessary to forestall the \u201ccontinuous disregard for traffic rules and regulations\u201d by motorists \u201chiding under the privileges of SPY police number plates\u201d. One of the things that will shock you about Nigeria is the way people of means get special treatment. I used to think SPY was reserved for the police, only to learn that Nigerians with good balances in their bank accounts can get it too. Criminals could pay for it to get privileged treatment on the roads by security agents. Nigeria!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPARADOX OF PLENTY\n\nIn the good old days \u2014 I mean not so long ago \u2014 Nigeria used to grow its foreign reserves and build up its excess crude account anytime crude prices went up. For the first time in our history, oil prices are going up and the naira is falling. It is now N620/$ in the open market. Why? Because we are earning virtually nothing from oil exports. We are not exporting much. Oil production is low, our share of production is low, NNPC is using most of our share to exchange for imported, subsidised petroleum products under the direct sale direct purchase (DSDP) arrangement. In 2014, NNPC brought in over $98 billion in oil sales. In 2021, the total from the same NNPC was $92 million.

          "text": "The rumpus over the Muslim-Muslim presidential pairing of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was, I have to say, inevitable. I would be lying to say I was surprised. Since Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu announced the choice of Alhaji Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno state, as his running mate, the outrage has been deafening. First, I expected northern Christians to kick against it. I also expected the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Conference of Catholic Bishops and Pentecostal pastors to oppose it vehemently. I expected the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), its allies and other opposition figures to jump on it. So far, my predictions have been fairly accurate.\n\nMany things divide us sharply in Nigeria depending on the situation at hand. It could be religion today and region tomorrow. It could be ethnicity or sub-ethnicity. It could be senatorial district or local government. Politics at state level often escapes national attention, but it is a microcosm of the macrocosm. What Tinubu\u2019s candidacy has brought out clearly is the delicate balancing act in the macrocosm. We traditionally think Nigeria is north and south. A southerner has picked a northerner as his running mate. That is balancing, no? It solves one puzzle and creates another: a Muslim choosing another Muslim. It is not enough to balance the region \u2014 you must also balance religion.\n\nNorthern Christians saw Tinubu\u2019s candidacy as a rare opportunity for one of them to be the vice-presidential candidate. But in the cold calculations of electoral dynamics, the question Tinubu and his strategists would have asked themselves is: how many northern Christian politicians carry enough weight to rally the critical mass of northern voters? To the best of my knowledge, there are no Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri Christians who are political heavyweights. More so, the major identity marker in the north is religion. You typically identify first as a Muslim or Christian before your ethnic stock. That is why politically, the north is analysed along religious rather than ethnic classification.\n\nConversely, religion is not the major identity marker in the south. Political classification is usually ethnic: Igbo, Yoruba and \u201csouthern minorities\u201d. Even in the south-west, which is mainly a mixture of Christians and Muslims, religion is peripheral to politics, and that should explain why a predominantly Muslim state will elect a Christian as governor, sometimes along with Christian deputies. In Ogun, the baton is regularly passed between Muslims and Christians, even though it is not planned. In political fights, you will have Christians backing Muslims and vice versa. Religion is hardly on the front burner, although there are ongoing efforts to damage that admirable culture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn view of the Tinubu situation, one question that is being asked again and again is why he was reluctant to pick a Christian from the north. One pastor even said there are more Christians than Muslims in the north, a claim that cannot be backed by evidence. Of the 19 northern states, only three are governed by Christians: Benue, Plateau and Taraba. Two other states that have produced Christian governors in this dispensation are Adamawa and Kaduna \u2014 both by default, after the governor or governor-elect resigned, died or was impeached. Why, then, are northern Christians not using their \u201cmajority\u201d to vote Christians as governors if the pastor\u2019s claim is the gospel truth?\n\nBut that begs the question. Must a northerner be a Muslim before he or she can enjoy the support of northern Muslim voters? That is the question at the heart of this debate which we are hardly addressing. Pray, what is wrong with northern Muslims voting for a northern Christian? Why can\u2019t northerners support fellow northerners no matter the religion? If Yoruba Muslims willingly vote for Yoruba Christians without frontloading religion, why shouldn\u2019t northern Muslims also back northern Christians and put region above religion? Do northern Muslims truly have an agenda against their Christian counterparts, to keep them perpetually subdued through the use of political power?\n\nWhen you talk to northern Christians, especially those in the core north, they believe there is a plot to keep them down. They complain about being denied equal opportunities with their Muslim counterparts in areas such as allocation of land to build churches and state sponsorship of pilgrimage. They complain of being incessantly denied federal appointments and deputy governorship slots in states like Niger. Increasingly in recent times, they allege \u201cgenocide\u201d by \u201cFulani jihadists\u201d and allege that the security agencies are colluding with them, and that there is a plot to wipe out Christians from the north. This thinking has reinforced the northern Christian solidarity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA closer look at the facts, though, will reveal that the animosity is limited to a few states. In fact, Kaduna is the \u201cepicentre\u201d. The governor and deputy are Muslims and all ministerial appointments since 2015 have gone to Muslims. Things were more balanced in the past, but it still has to be said that even when there were Christian deputy governors and Christian ministers, Kaduna was still prone to ethno-religious bloodshed. Thousands were killed in upheavals between 2000 and 2002. It is, therefore, difficult to blame the perennial animosity on political appointments. Gombe\u2019s religious composition is similar to Kaduna\u2019s but there is peace and harmony. Something should explain that.\n\nFrom what I have observed so far, Christians in Kwara, Kogi, Adamawa, Bauchi, Kebbi, Niger, Borno and Nasarawa states appear to get along with their Muslim compatriots, at least generally speaking. There will be little tensions here and there but it is very rare to hear of religious upheavals and killings in those states. Perhaps they have devised a way of managing their differences. In Plateau, Benue and Taraba, Muslims often complain of being pushed to the margins. Jos, in particular, has been a basket case in the last 22 years and something tells you another bloodshed is just a snap-of-the-finger away. Some of these things are deeply rooted in history and sustained through politics.\n\nThe irony of it all, if it can be so described, is that Christians used to play prominent roles in northern Nigeria, notably from the 1950s when Sir Ahmadu Bello was the premier of the Northern Region. He ran a system that accommodated not just Christians but ethnic minorities. The case of Chief Sunday Awoniyi, a Yoruba Christian who served as executive secretary of the Northern Regional Government in the 1960s, is often cited, but there were many similar stories. Bello shared scholarships and economic opportunities equitably to hold the north together. Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, whom he anointed as the prime minister in 1960, was of the minority Gere ethnicity in today\u2019s Bauchi state.\n\nWhen the January 1966 coup wiped out many northern military officers, it was Gen Yakubu Gowon, a northern Christian, that the north made head of state after the July 1966 counter-coup. His two deputies \u2014 military and civilian \u2014 were Christians. He ruled for nine years. In the military, which held power for decades, northern Christians were key players. Gen TY Danjuma, former army chief, was respected by both northern Muslims and Christians. In the 1980s, there was the \u201cLangtang Mafia\u201d, made of influential military officers from Plateau state. They were all Christians. Brig David Mark and Brig Tunde Ogbeha were at the centre of action and defended the \u201cnorthern interest\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to getting key military positions, northern Christians used to head at least one federal para-military institution \u2014 customs, immigrations, prisons and fire service \u2014 until 2015. Clearly, the Christian north used to have its pride of place. They were no pushovers. So, what changed? What happened to the bloc that was \u201cpolitically strategic\u201d to the core north and that used to provide the balancing factor in the socio-political configuration of Nigeria?

Three times I wanted this position (presidency) and three times I ended up at the supreme court. For that reason, in terms of experience, I have gathered a lot. I visited 774 local councils in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015,\u201d the president was quoted as saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI feel privileged that Nigerians elected me in 2015. Since then, we have been doing our best to tackle the challenges, with God helping us. We are not alone. If only we knew what other countries in Africa are passing through, we will be grateful to God, and protect our country. Other African countries are passing through a lot.\n\n\u201cAs leaders, we are doing our best, and will keep doing our best to improve the situation. I am praying that the almighty God will give us more strength and wisdom to protect our people, and fulfil our promises of ensuring wellbeing.\n\n\u201cI have heard all that the governor and emir have to say on what people expect from government. I will not add anything. I am the one receiving the orders. I will continue to do my best.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs I was going to Daura from Katsina, we had to use choppers, so I had a good view of some farms. May God continue to bless our efforts in farming.\n\n\u201cWe are still craving the understanding of all citizens. We are doing our best. We are praying that our efforts will translate into more good results. Nothing surpasses living in peace.\n\n\u201cWe are praying that God will give us the advantage of dealing with all those that trouble the country. We don\u2019t know why they are doing what they are doing. We pray our people to show more understanding.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the politics in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Buhari said he refrained from interfering with the process that produced Bola Tinubu as the presidential candidate because all hopefuls in the contest were competent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) signalled parties to elect their presidential candidates, we had 30 aspirants, mostly ministers in my cabinet and governors,\u2019\u2019 Buhari said.\n\n\u201cI told each of the aspirants to go and do their best. One particular governor, in his wisdom, came to meet me and asked who they should vote for at the party convention, checking if I had a preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cThere was no need for interference, knowing the competence of all the aspirants. They went and elected Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and he picked his running mate, Sen. Kashim Ibrahim, for the 2023 elections. I am praying that we will have peaceful and successful elections.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the emir asked the president to focus on tackling the nation\u2019s insecurity and improving on infrastructure.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Earlier on Friday, many African fintech startups offering virtual dollar card services sent emails to their customers stating that their virtual card service will be unavailable indefinitely starting Saturday, July 16, 2022. Virtual cards are digital replicas of physical bank cards. They are created and stored within digital virtual wallets.\n\nAn email sent to Barter customers by Nigerian-born unicorn Flutterwave read, \u201c\u2026effective Sunday, 17th July 2022, all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases.\u201d The payments giant attributed the reason for this suspension to \u201can update from the company\u2019s card partner\u201d. Barter is a Flutterwave consumer-facing virtual card platform that launched in early 2017.\n\nThis announcement by Flutterwave is bound to affect many other startups who use the company\u2019s white-labeled virtual card service to issue virtual cards to their customers.\n\nOther fintech startups including crypto exchange Busha, Rwanda-headquartered Payday, and Ugandan Eversend also issued similar notices.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which \u201ccard partner\u201d Flutterwave and the other fintech startups are referring to, but these platforms have issued virtual cards powered by MasterCard and Visa\u2014two leading global card issuers. TechCabal is yet to confirm what exactly happened that led the \u201ccard partner\u201d to take this decision.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem affected by the unexpected notifications went on social media to complain about the widespread suspension of virtual card services.\n\n\u201cIt affects us in a big way because all our Facebook ads are connected to our Barter virtual card,\u201d Douglas Kenydson CEO Selar said. \u201cOur Amazon web services (AWS) plan is also connected, and you can\u2019t even afford to miss one payment, or else they\u2019ll take you off.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his other options, Kendyson expressed uncertainty about switching to existing virtual cards by Nigerian banks. He complained about the hassle of changing dollars and potentially dealing with failed card payments.\n\nKendyson\u2019s best alternative is to turn to the virtual card services of Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, that had restricted tens of African startups\u2019 accounts in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this happened in the middle of the month so that whatever payment you need to make, make it,\u201d Kendyson said.\n\nIn the midst of the widespread announcement, startups like Bitmama and Mono took the opportunity to announce that their virtual card services are still up, a reminder that not all fintech startups were affected.\n\nBest in email from @bitmamaexchange \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Everybody was interested in sitting on the console, but I was interested in knowing the whole craft.\n\nOn the 20th day [of the Calabar festival], we were doing a sound check in the stadium for the band, and my boss was not on the stage.\n\nSo he said, \u201cPrecious, please go to the console in front and mute the whole Front of House.\u201d\n\nFront of House is basically the mix the engineer mixes for the audience. So I ran there and quickly muted it. And he was shocked. Because he knew that at this point, he had not shown me anything that concerned the board.\n\n\u201cHow did you know how to mute the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou this boy! You are a Puma!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how they say it in Yoruba, but he called me Puma because he says I jump. At the end of the festival, I became the first trainee to join the main crew in less than three weeks. I was paid \u20a6230,000 ($1,403)*, which was the highest [amount of] money I had ever received.\n\nPrecious Tawo\u2019s journey into sound engineering\n\nPrecious Tawo\n\nI didn\u2019t choose the path; the path chose me. So sometime after I finished secondary school, I wanted to study marine engineering real bad because I had friends in the marine space.\n\nI even had to wait one year at home for the entrance exam period. And I even went as far as Ibadan [Oyo State, Nigeria] to write for Polaris Marine Academy entrance exam. Then I went to the Maritime Academy in Oron to write the exam.\n\nFortunately, I got admission into the Maritime Academy, Oron, but before it came out, I was already working as a facility manager in a hotel in Calabar [Cross River State, Nigeria] because I just wanted to while away time.\n\nI\u2019m not an idle person. And then I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s been independent, and I wanted my little stipend. I got to work in a hotel thanks to my dad\u2019s South African friend \u2014 the manager \u2014 who gave me a job as one of the facility guys.\n\nBecause of how fast I was and everything, I was transferred from the hotel to the event centre, where I worked for over six months. And this was when I wrote the Polaris entrance exam. As at November, I knew full well that my time there was done because I know when it\u2019s time for me to leave somewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t need to pray about it; I feel it in my tummy that it\u2019s time to go, and I leave without a plan, but I always have something all worked out later on. So I felt it was time to leave.\n\nAnd in 2013, the Calabar Festival was very popular. This was something that we normally went to the stadium to watch every December and wish that we were on stage or part of the crew.\n\nAt this point, I had no audio background. The only knowledge I had about audio came in November [2013] when we had the Beer Festival in 520 [Hotel, Calabar], and they wanted to rent equipment worth about \u20a65,000,000 ($31,645)**.\n\nI made the company give me \u20a6700,000 ($4,430)** to buy some equipment, and I was like, \u201cI am gonna make this work.\u201d\n\nAnd I did DJ for the Beer Festival with Virtual DJ on my laptop and saved them over \u20a63,000,000 ($18,987)**. That\u2019s the only thing I knew about audio, which was basically from YouTube; plug this here, plug this there, turn this here, turn this there.\n\nWorking at The Voice in 2021\n\nSo on November 25, 2013, I resigned and told my dad that I would like to work with the crew for the Calabar Festival because he had his friend there.\n\nMy dad was an immigration officer in the Tourism Bureau, so he sorted out the passports for most foreigners working in Calabar. So he had relationships with these guys.\n\nThe production manager then was one of his friends, and he told him his son was interested in working with the guys for the December festival.\n\nI heard they were paying them \u20a6200,000 ($1,255)***. And how much was I earning at my place of work? It was just \u20a618,000 ($113)*** initially, then it went up to \u20a625,000 ($156)***. If I could make \u20a6200,000 a month, it\u2019d actually be better than what I was making in a year or close to what I made in a year if I stayed at the event centre.\n\nI planned to join them only for that month and then use the \u20a6200,000 to start school when results come out in January or February.\n\nOn the first day, I was told to go to the Governor\u2019s office for the interview. I dressed in my nicely starched shirt and trousers, and a nice pair of shoes.\n\nOnly for me to walk into the office and they were like, \u201cOh, you are the Precious. Okay, no problem. Hop into the Hilux; let\u2019s go to the warehouse and show you around.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to change?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Just come.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived, they were loading trucks to move the equipment to the studio. This was the 28th of November. And when I got there, I had this whole \u201cbig boy\u201d thingy going on, so seeing boys loading trucks, I was like, \u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I came for; I came for the cool stuff.\u201d\n\nSo they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said, \u201cThe sound department,\u201d because I really loved the whole sound thing. When you went to the Festival, you could hear the speakers pumping from miles away, and I really wanted to be a part of that.\n\nPlus, I had just finished the Beer Festival and wanted something higher than I\u2019d experienced. They introduced me to Aigbovosa Giwa-Osagie, my boss. They took me around and showed me speakers I\u2019d never seen before up close.\n\nThen they introduced me to another person who would be my head.\n\nI was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I\u2019ll resume tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d\n\nNext thing, \u201cNo o!. You are resuming now and joining them to load that truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no problem. Easy thing,\u201d I told him.\n\nLuckily, I had a singlet and a pair of jeans in my bag because I was supposed to go somewhere from there. Nice pair of jeans o!\n\nWizkid\u2019s concert\n\nSo, I started loading with the guys. The equipment was very heavy, and there I was, not used to carrying heavy things, seeing young people like me doing it, and told myself I could too.\n\nWe finished loading four trucks after almost four hours and headed to the venue for the Festival\u2019s first event. And I was told to jump into the back of the truck because the Hilux was full.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: senior crew sits in the Hilux, junior crew at the back, and trainees like me sit on the equipment inside the 40-foot truck like the one used to convey cows.\n\nAt first, I was like no way, especially since Calabar is such a small place, but I eventually jumped in. Part of the price you have to pay, you know. At this point, my jeans were gone, and my singlet was like rags.\n\nWe got there, and my boss walked up to me and asked me what audio background I had. And I told him I had none, but the only thing I knew was the entry stuff, but I was willing to learn.\n\nSo when we started setting up, he asked me to go and get the 10 mm ep5 cable. In my head, I was supposed to go and see a cable labelled 10mm ep5.\n\nHe pointed in a direction of over 65 open cases, so I went there straight, and for like 40 minutes, I was searching for the ep5 cable, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for. And then I couldn\u2019t even ask because the way he said it, it was like I was supposed to know the cable.\n\nSo I did not ask, and I didn\u2019t want to look small. After 40 minutes, I went back to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find the cable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I see it, what should I do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do, but I can\u2019t find the cable in the box.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked another guy that had been there for like four years to get the cable for him and take me and show me the cable.\n\nThis guy just opened the case, stretched his hand, and picked up the cable.\n\nMixing in a studio.\n\nYo! It was super embarrassing. And I didn\u2019t like the way everyone was laughing and everything. So I told myself that I was going to know everything in the company, how it works, and I was going to know all their needs.\n\nSo that night, I started downloading the PDF files for the equipment manuals and spent another hour downloading more when I got home at 3:00 a.m. before I slept.\n\nThe next night, since I was just a trainee, I sat in one corner with all the loud music and was just reading stuff, checking stuff, and going behind the Front of House to peep and see what they were doing even though it looked like they were running a spaceship.\n\nAfter the Festival, my boss gave me the opportunity to go to an event in Lagos for IBM computers. Then I also did Love Like a Movie by Darey Art Alade in February 2014, the outdoor version with Kelly Rowland.\n\nLong story short, I kept on growing, going from event to event. I\u2019m a sucker for information, always trying to keep myself updated. People were recommending me because no matter how good you are, you need people to recommend you.\n\nOn February 20 [2014], my mom called me to tell me that the result for the Academy was out, and I passed. My name was announced on NTA [a state-owned broadcasting station]. But, I had no plans to go to school anymore.\n\nThat February, I was also offered a position with the company, but my boss advised me not to take it.\n\nHe said, \u201cEvery week and every day, experts fly in from South Africa and the United States or wherever to come and work in Nigeria. And if you are good at what you do, they\u2019ll fly you from whatever hole you are in to come and do an event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve worked with different companies and been exposed to various equipment and clients.\n\nAnd I will not put this achievement on one company. If I was working with one company, I\u2019d be stuck with their clients and the kind of events they do. I learn from everybody, and I also like the way I\u2019m being treated like the golden egg.\n\nI love my job. I\u2019ve done stuff for Google, Amazon, IBM, Airtel, MTN, MultiChoice, and The Voice. Presently I\u2019m Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer and Fireboy\u2019s Front of House engineer. I\u2019ve mixed for Wizkid\u2019s December concerts, Cardi B, and Davido; any big artiste really.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nMixing at Burna Boy\u2019s Dakar concert in 2022\n\nSometime in 2015, we had an event in Eko Atlantic; it was supposed to be the launch for Majestic Voyage and ten minutes before the show, we did the sound check. Everything was sounding all right and I was mixing monitors.\n\nFive minutes to the show, I tapped my screen and it was frozen. I tried restarting the console, but nothing. That meant every artiste who climbed that stage was not going to hear jack!\n\nI felt like the ground should open for me to enter. We tried everything and eventually had to plug my monitors into my boss\u2019 equipment. By this time, the first artiste, Yemi Sax, was already on stage. I had already explained to him and everything but the first three minutes of the show were hell.\n\nI somehow survived the performance and my boss stabilised everything and that\u2019s how we ran the show. Another moment was when I was doing a show at Calabar Cultural Centre, and then we had power issues in the middle of the show and the console went off.\n\nThe show was cancelled and they had to fix another date. I spent four years trying to correct that mistake. I was hard on myself for four years. I\u2019m a perfectionist so I like to give 110%. Eventually, I had to accept that every engineer has bad days.\n\nGiving back\n\nIn line with what I\u2019ve learnt over the years, I decided to try and pass on this knowledge because I found out that, at the end of the day, we have to leave a legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about money to me, my job is like my life right now. And I\u2019ve seen that many engineers have come and gone but there\u2019s nothing anybody can point to that they made. And so I started sharing knowledge at every opportunity I got. If I went to an event, I\u2019d teach the in-house engineer things I knew they would need if they asked politely, of course.\n\nI run a clinic for engineers, although I haven\u2019t done it since 2019. I also have some people I mentor, all so I can give back.\n\n*Average dollar to naira to rates in February 2014.\n\n**Dollar to naira rate in November 2013.\n\n***Average dollar to naira rates in 2013.",

Comrade Philip Shaibu, has urged Nigerians to ensure that only credible and competent leaders emerge in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nShaibu gave the charge during the 17th convocation ceremony of Benson Idahosa University (BIU), in Benin City, Edo State.\n\nThe acting governor, who was a special guest of honour at the convocation ceremony, urged citizens to pray for the country, noting that only competent leaders can help the nation overcome its many socio-economic challenges.\n\nHe said, \u201cLet\u2019s pray for a greater Nigeria of our dreams. We must also pray for the coming election. As a government, we will do our best to make life better for our people.\u201d\n\nShaibu noted, \u201cWe have not been lucky with leaders but must pray and do the needful to get competent leaders with the fear of God to move the nation forward.\n\n\u201cGovernor Godwin Obaseki is doing his best to turn Edo State into the economic hub of the nation.

We are working to ensure that the state is peaceful by making the state uncomfortable for criminal elements.\u201d\n\nWelcoming guests and students to the convocation ceremony, the Chancellor of the University, Arch. Bishop Margaret Benson Idahosa, said the institution has in the last 17 years churned out leaders with excellence in character and learning.\n\nTo the graduating students, she said, \u201cWe are releasing you into the world as change agents and pacesetters that you have become as you go. The world will put you to test to know the stuff you are made of; this requires resilience and tenacity from you.\u201d\n\nOne of the Master\u2019s graduands, Okeimute Enajiterin, said she had an excellent education at the institution, which has prepared her to face the challenges of life, lauding her lecturers for instilling in her a sound mind to question life\u2019s problems and proffer solutions to make society better.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

So, we need the cooperation, collaboration, support and the buy in of everybody.\n\n\u201cGovernment cannot do it alone. So, we need everybody, I want you to know that government is committed to bringing everybody on board.\n\n\u201cSo, people are welcome to blow the whistle, to make sure that we destroy and tackle corruption,\u2019\u2019 said the minister.\n\nProf. Bolaji Owasanoye, the Chairman, Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), represented by Mrs Anne Odey, a member of the ICPC board, welcomed the initiative.\n\nOwasanoye, who said it would greatly help in the fight against corruption, advised that the platform be made easily accessible, as well create secured and confidential hotlines for informants and the information received.\n\nThis, he said, was necessary to strengthen an ethical environment devoid of victimisation and reprisals.\n\nHe also called for a continuous public enlightenment to ensure sustainability and avoid false and mischievous complaints and reports.\n\nDr Garba Abari, Director-General, National Orientation Agency (NOA), represented by the Director of Press, Mr Paul Odenyi, called on AFRICMIL and Yar\u2019Adua Foundation to extend the whistleblowing platform to election matters.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for us to raise the issue of transactional politics that is denting our elections, people are buying and selling votes as if it is a market place.\n\n\u201cSo if the platform can be used to blow whistle on those who try to corrupt our electoral system like we witnessed during the party primaries and in elections, it will help,\u2019\u2019 Abari said.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Director-General of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Mr Joseph Ari says institutionalising apprenticeship and traineeship will address the high rate of poverty and unemployment.\n\nAri said this on Thursday in Abuja at the Second National Skills programme with the theme, \u201cInstitutionalising Apprecenticiship and Traineeship for National Development\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the increasing rate of unemployment and poverty is a wakeup call for all including ITF, which core mandate is skills development to seek lasting solution.\n\nHe said the choice of this theme was deliberate because of soaring unemployment and poverty in Nigeria and how we can apply apprenticeship in resolving it.\n\n\u201cThis is bearing in mind how well it worked miracles for countries that took that route when they contended with issues such as we are facing now.\u201d\n\nAri said repositioning apprenticeship would help tackle increasing poverty and unemployment as indicated by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nThe NBS in its Labour Force Statistics, Unemployment and Underemployment Report of Q4 2020, unemployed persons in the economically active or working age, 15 to 65 was 122,049,400.\n\n\u201cOf this number, 69, 675,468 were willing to work, but only 46,488,079 were in paid employment.\n\n\u201cWhat could be inferred from the survey is that more than 23 million Nigerians that were perhaps qualified and willing to work were without jobs.\n\n\u201cIt also shows that the unemployment rate among the youth, 15 to 35 years, was up by eight per cent.\n\n\u201cIt rose from 34.9 per cent to 42.5 per cent, which is the highest among other age groupings within the period under review,\u201d he said.\n\nAri expressed concern that in spite of the high unemployment rate, rather than absence of jobs, vacancies still existed in several sectors.\n\nHe said that a Skills Gap Assessment of six priority sectors revealed that some vacancies could not be filled by Nigerians because of lack of requisite skills.\n\n\u201cThe question that arises from this paradox is, how can we plug these gaps using apprenticeship?\n\n\u201cThe answer to this question can be found in countries such as Germany, China, Australia, USA and others.\n\n\u201cThese countries at various times faced similar challenges such as we are contending with.\n\n\u201cWhat they did was to pour greater investments in skills acquisition and apprenticeship training,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile citing instances of how countries like Germany scaled the hurdle, the director-general said they saw potential in apprenticeship and took advantage of it.\n\n\u201cIn Germany, about two decades ago, there was mass unemployment with roughly five million unemployed people and low employment rates.\n\n\u201cToday, nearly two-thirds of young Germans are enrolled in apprenticeships once they leave full-time education using the German Dual Vocational and educational training (DVT),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEngland in 2009 made concerted efforts to increase the number of apprenticeships to combat youth unemployment by creating National Apprenticeship Service.\n\n\u201cBetween 2009 and 2014, the number of active apprentices in the country doubled from 444,800 to 851,500.\n\n\u201cWhile France in 2020 alone spent more than a billion Euros to boost its apprenticeship programmes.\u201d\n\nAri explained that apprenticeship had been an age-long tradition and an institution in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that it was a common feature in the traditional setting to see people engage in vocations like farming, carving, carpentry, catering, and building among others.\n\nHe, however, expressed concern that the potential of apprenticeship in tackling unemployment and poverty had not been fully actualised in Nigeria.\n\nThe director-general said the traditional apprenticeship, which was still being practised in Nigeria was not viable enough to curb issues of unemployment and other societal problems.\n\nAri said it was in the realisation of the numerous benefits of apprenticeship that ITF took the lead in collaboration with critical stakeholders to ensure its institutionalisation.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for establishing ITF to help harness potential in vocational skills to effect the needed change.\n\nAri said in its fifty years of existence, ITF had pursued its mandate with single-mindedness and vigour.\n\nHe said that ITF had trained more than 22 million Nigerians whose contributions to the growth of the various sectors of the economy could not be quantified.\n\nAccording to him, ITF liaised with a total of 1,353 companies for promotion of in-company apprenticeship activities\n\nbetween 2010 and 2019 alone.\n\nHe stressed that the fund \u201cvisited and appraised 1,146 companies to determine their potential to conduct apprentice training in identified trade areas.\n\n\u201cIn addition, it harmonised 444 existing In-company apprenticeship schemes of companies in line with the ITF National Apprenticeship scheme.\n\n\u201cIt also installed the scheme in 286 companies as well as monitored 831 companies, leading to the training of 36,397 most of whom are gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nThe ITF boss disclosed that the fund was currently working on bringing in skills intervention programmes like National Industrial Skills Development Programme (NISDP).\n\nHe said that Women Skills Empowerment Programme (WOSEP) and Passion to Profession Programme (P2PP) were being considered among others.\n\nAri called on curriculum planners and employers\u2019 associations to design youth apprenticeship programmes among other suggestions.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the programme would provide the platform to articulate strategies for a robust apprenticeship scheme in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, commended ITF\u2019s commitment to creating avenues for dialogue on ways of enhancing skills acquisition.\n\nHe lauded the convening of the programme, saying its theme aligned with efforts by the Federal Government to resolve challenges linked with rising unemployment and poverty.\n\nAdebayo, who was represented by the Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Maryam Katagum, commended ITF for being one of the foremost agencies under the ministry.\n\n\u201cYou may be aware that the Federal Government has through its Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) initiated and implemented a number of programmes.\n\n\u201cProgrammes that have recorded positive results, especially in terms of uplifting the living standards of Nigerians as well as developing national economy.\n\n\u201cWhat government, however, finds worrisome is that although most of our programmes get expected outcomes in terms of jobs created, Nigerians with the requisite skills are lacking,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister assured of the ministry\u2019s commitment to implementing resolutions that would emerge from the summit.\n\nThe Chairman, Oil and Gas Free Zone, Dr Chris Asoluka, said the move toward institutionalising apprecenticiship and traineeship for national development was achievable.\n\nAsoluka, who was the theme paper presenter, urged the director-general of ITF to assemble the best brains and people who shared in his vision, to come up with workable framework.\n\nHe said that a properly planned framework would engender better policy or law that would drive the idea and ensure effective implementation.\n\nMeanwhile, goodwill messages were delivered by the Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development Pauline Tallen and Mr Olawale Fasanya, Director-General, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN).\n\nOther critical stakeholders including the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) and the British High Commission to Nigeria also delivered their goodwill messages.\n\nThey all expressed commitment to working with ITF to upscale job creation while drastically reducing poverty in Nigeria.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the programme which had two plenary sessions had discussants, who spoke on developing functional framework for national apprenticeship and traineeship scheme.\n\nThe discussants also spoke on the issues and prospects of apprenticeship and traineeship scheme in Nigeria.\n\nThe ITF was established by the Federal Government to set and regulate training standards and offer direct training intervention among others (NAN)\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "From an objective prism, the highly competitive event planning and management business in Nigeria somewhat looks impossible for anyone to stand out from the crowd. But this is certainly not the situation for Omolaraeni Olaosebikan, the Group Chief Executive Officer of McEnies Global Communications.\n\nOmolaraeni who is an event planning consultant and PR expert for nearly two decades has truly carved a niche for her business in Nigeria\u2019s event industry. She has successfully planned many social and corporate events at home and abroad over the years.\n\nSpeaking of sterling qualities that made her get the recognition, the event expert says professionalism, commitment, consistency, creativity, integrity, sincerity of purpose among others are what have brought her several feats in the industry.\n\nShe made these remarks on recently while fielding questions from senior entertainment correspondents at an event she successfully managed at the Marriott Hotel in GRA, Ikeja axis of Lagos state.\n\nThe event was the well publicized high-profile wedding of Adebola Daniel, son of Gbenga Daniel, former Governor Ogun state, and his heartthrob, Morenikeji Ademiju.\n\nSharing lessons life has taught her as a committed entrepreneur, Omolaraeni says a balance must be created amongst the competing demands.\n\nThe cerebral entrepreneur maintained that she derives pleasure in meeting the demands of her clients in line with the dictates of their choices, adding that sometimes she takes up courses in event planning outside Nigeria to broaden her skills so as to meet the contemporary industry standards in tandem with best global practice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in disappointment in life, I was determined to succeed and do everything possible to learn the ropes and winning battles and breaking barriers. Today, the result positively speaks and very profoundly,\u201d she disclosed.\n\nOmolaraeni further stated that she started her business small and the business has continued to grow in leaps and bounds with clients that cut across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\nShe noted that despite the fact that the industry is highly competitive and saturated, clients prefer her brand over others due to her ability to effectively and efficiently manage budget and timelines alongside premium delivery.\n\n\u201cThe event planning business is probably not for the faint of heart. This business requires the ability to perform well under stress, to balance multiple demands, to be creative and flexible in stressful situations, and to network extensively. Event planning will also likely involve long and irregular hours. However, event planning can be a profitable and fun home-based business for the right person. Thankfully, McEnies Global Events is always equal to the task.\u201d She said\n\nOmolaraeni who is known for her diligence as well as for creating memorable and seamless events also stated:\n\n\u201cOur businesses are grouped into 6 categories, one of them is McEnies Global Communications, this involves Public Relations, Corporate Communications, Sale promotions, media management, Advertising and Media Consultants.\n\n\u201cThe second category is McEnies Global Events, it involves Event Planning and Management, Destination event, Hall scouting and negotiation, event consultancy, event productions, security and corporate pickup.\n\n\u201cThe third category is McEnies Events and Protocols, which are, Ushering services, bouncer services, stage designs and decorations, event coordination\n\n\u201cThe fourth category is a McEnies Management Consultancy this is solely about Human Resources and Management consultancy.\n\n\u201cThe fifth category is the Perfect Clicks Signature, this involves Event coverage e.g. Photography, Videography, drone flying, live streaming, etc., others in this category are post event productions which include Royal frames, synthetic Photobook, acrylic frames etc.\n\n\u201cAnd lastly, is the Ruby Models Company, this involves Children Modelling agency, children voice over artist management, talent hunt and management etc. We honestly have a lot in our portfolio to thank God for, and I must say we are doing well in deepening our policy thrust by satisfying our clients.\u201d Omolaraeni said\n\nSpeaking on the major encumbrance limiting businesses in Nigeria, she identified inadequate finance as a major problem confronting women-led businesses. She as well used the opportunity to appeal to the government and other relevant stakeholders to do more for women entrepreneurs, knowing full well that their impact today is undeniable with the capacity to influence the society socio-economically.\n\n\u201cThere are still more women like me who would love to tow the path of entrepreneurship if only the enabling environment offer them the needed support. Remember the saying that if you empower a woman, you have empowered a nation,\u201d she said\n\n\u201cTo the glory of God in this event planning business, I have over the years helped various clients most of whom are dignitaries to plan and coordinate their events. These events range from weddings, family gatherings to corporate events, retreats or seminars. I devote time and expertise to manage the details in such a way that clients do not need to bother themselves but to go to sleep.\n\nWhen asked about her advise for some Nigerians who may want to go into the event planning business the Group CEO of McEnies Global Communications said:\n\n\u201cThe best way to promote your new business is by word of mouth, publicity. Get your clients to refer their friends to you. Also encourage your event service provider partners to recommend you to their clients. However, this will happen only when your work is excellent. You can also advertise by sharing flyers and business cards or open a website. You equally need to be mentored and engage in requisite training and courses. You can also put an ad in your local newspaper, radio and TV. Try social networking too. Meanwhile, hard work, patience and integrity are also key in making the business successful and fruitful,\u201d She said.",

          "summary": "President Muhammdu Buhari Saturday in Daura, Katsina State, said the process that led to election of former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was purely democratic, and a reflection of the will of party members.\nSince then, we have been doing our best to tackle the challenges, with God helping us.\n\u201cAs leaders, we are doing our best, and will keep doing our best to improve the situation.\n\u201cI have heard all that the governor and emir have to say on what people expect from government.\nPresident Buhari returned appreciation to God that the seasons had been favorable for farming and food production.",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nIn Nigeria today, when agents of transformations in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari are being counted, the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda will definitely standout, if the numerous reforms he has introduced is anything to go by.\n\nIn less than two years after assuming office the SEC management under Mr. Yuguda has not only set strategic goals but also continued to expand the frontiers of investment space thereby attracting improved local and foreign direct investment, FDIs into the economy through innovative regulatory guidelines and collaboration with other relevant institutions.\n\nFor instance, on market-wide issues, the Commission has drafted and presented an amendment to ISA Bill to the National Assembly as part of its efforts to enhance the regulatory framework of the Nigerian capital market, lead to the introduction of new products into the market, and increase the effectiveness of the Investments and Securities Tribunal, amongst other benefits to ensure that the provisions of the Bill represent realities in the nation\u2019s investment climate.\n\nAlso, the Commission is collaborating with National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable NASSBER to prepare a roadmap towards passage of the Bill within the shortest time frame.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nTo resolve legacy issues of Identity Management which is a crucial driver in improving market participation and solving unclaimed dividends and related problems, the management also inaugurated a market-wide Identity Management Committee with mandate to harmonize the various databases of investors in Nigerian capital market, facilitate data accuracy in the market, mitigate fraud, improve KYC requirements and manage AML/CFT risks, among others.\n\nThe report of the committee is expected to resolve issues that have hindered growth of the Market, hampered investor confidence, and matters that serve as barriers to entry for potential investors, amongst other benefits.\n\nOn primary market activities, the Yuguda-led executive management of the SEC has also in the past two years approved 41 new equities issues valued at N656.9 billion, 37 bonds valued at N776.2 billion, 28 applications for shelf programmes valued at N2.5 trillion and 21 Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts.\n\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period. It also ensured that over N11 billions of untraceable shareholders\u2019 funds from Schemes of Arrangement in the custody of Registrars were transferred to the National Investor Protection Fund NIPF.\n\nAs part of the process of improving time to market of transactions and fast tracking the review process, the Commission conducted training for issuing houses to help improve the quality of applications submitted.\n\nSimilarly, Commission also recorded a landmark achievement on the first electronic offering with combined feature of book building to Qualified Institutions and use of the price discovered from book-build for sales to Retail Investors. It also granted approval for the first 21 derivatives contracts which had seven and 14 different contracts from both the NGX and FMDQ Exchanges respectively in the past two years.\n\nOn Collective Investment Scheme CIS, the Yuguda-led management has also, following completion of series of monitoring and evaluation processes, commenced implementation of 100 per cent custody requirement in the CIS sector to protect investors. As a result, all clients\u2019 assets currently managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates are to be held under independent custodial agreements in custodial banks.\n\nThe Commission has also recorded remarkable milestones in its secondary market activities in the past years with successful demutualization of the Nigerian Exchange Limited NGX which investment analysts see as milestone in the development of Nigerian capital market.\n\nThis is even as the management collaborated with University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance, UK for the training of its select employees on a certified course on Fintech & Regulatory Innovation, to enhance the Commission\u2019s capacity in regulating Fintech.\n\nAlso, it collaborated with the World Bank to commission a Fintech Scoping project and held collaborative engagements with 15 International and local Fintech stakeholders to guide the Commission on its Fintech policies.\n\nThe Regulatory Incubation Guidelines to operationalize provisional regulation for aspiring Fintech firms were released within the period. In furtherance of its market regulation roles, management of the Commission was able to ascertain the quantum of unclaimed dividends of publicly traded companies that fall within the categories eligible to be borrowed by the Federal Government.\n\nThis amounted to N56, 584,795,648.71 and $8,153,118.41 respectively. In addition, it also facilitated the transfer into the SEC/CNB NIPF Account of N2.3 billion in excess of return monies and N11.4 billion in Schemes consideration money, both of which had previously been held in the custody of the Registrars.\n\nOn the pesky issue of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing Of Terrorism AML/CFT, following the GIABA Mutual Evaluation of Nigeria, the Yuguda-led executive management had made concerted efforts in the capital market to meet both the GIABA Mutual Evaluation Report MER Follow-Up Process and the FATF International Cooperation Review Group ICRG requirements in order to avoid Nigeria being placed on the FATF public grey list at the Plenary when the grace period expires in October, 2022.\n\nFor instance, following the MER findings that Nigeria had several important deficiencies in its AML/CFT/CPF system in relation to Technical Compliance, and that its effectiveness controls were insufficient to mitigate its high ML/TF/PF risks, the Commission championed the amendments of Rules and Regulations of the Virtual Asset Service providers; the sector specific regulations to repeal the 2013 SEC AML/CFT Regulations and enactment of the 2022 AML/CFT Regulations; the SEC AML/CFT RBS Framework.\n\nThese new rules and amendments were done in order to address Nigeria\u2019s MER deficiencies and broaden the scope of preventive measures available to VASPs. In furtherance of its regulatory mandate, the Commission conducted investigations into complaints by investors and out of the 250 complaints brought forward into the period, 182 were resolved.\n\nAlso, out of the 58 complaints in relation to Ponzi schemes received, 45 were resolved. The Commission was able to recover 10,659,168 units of various companies\u2019 shares as well as the sum of N1, 384,255,526.73 recovered for investors during the period under review.\n\nIt issued New Rules on Robo-Advisory Services to guide the regulatory requirements and expectations for providing automated advisory services in the market and released the Rules on Trade Repositories during the period under review.\n\nSimilarly, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission also introduced new rules on Crowd Funding, Social bonds, Digital Assets Exchange DAX, Digital Assets Custodians DACs, Issuance of Digital Assets as Securities and Requirements for registration of Digital Assets Offering Platforms as part of its efforts to guarantee security of investments in the capital market.\n\nOn Corporate Governance measures, the Commission also released guidelines on the Implementation of Sections 60-63 of Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and in order to strengthen the disclosure regime in capital market, the Commission in a circular dated January 19, 2022 provided public companies a fast track option for filing Audited Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, the Commission also developed the SEC Corporate Governance Guidelines SCGG to address corporate governance issues not considered in the NCCG, and released same in October 2020. As part of its efforts to harmonise the reporting timeline of the SEC Corporate Governance Guideline SCGG with that of the National Code of Corporate Governance NCCG, it also in year 2021 exposed to the public for comments an amendment to Rules 42(2).\n\nThe Commission has also as part of its regulatory interventions to amicably resolve disputes between the board and shareholders of listed companies resolved the disputes between Alhaji Muneer Alade Bankole (the Chief Executive Officer and Sheikh Abdulmohsen A. Al-Thunayan Chairman of the Board, of Medview Airlines, resolved those between major shareholders of Ikeja Hotels Plc and returned the company to profitability and also reached a settlement with Oando Plc in 2021 after concluding investigation of Corporate Governance allegations levelled against the company.\n\nIn regard to its market development mandate, the Commission has continued its Investor Education and Public enlightenment programmes by organizing workshops on infusion of Capital Market Studies into the curricula of Basic and Secondary Schools in Nigeria and also collaborated with the Standards Organization of Nigeria SON and other partners to organize Stakeholders\u2019 Sensitization Workshops on Commodities Standards in Lagos and Kano during the period under review.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission held webinars on Non-Interest Capital Market Products, Financial Inclusion, Ponzi Schemes and Solid Minerals targeted at the pension industry, investor protection, women, Youth/millennial and the commodities segment of the market.\n\nAlso in pursuit of non-interest market education and enlightenment programmes, the Commission collaborated with Islamic Financial Services Board IFSB and the Auditing and Accounting Organisation of Islamic Financial Institutions AAOIFI to organize Non-Interest Capital Market training for over 1000 participants.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission has led the team to improve the capacity of the Nigerian Capital Market Institute NCMI by providing it with necessary tools to train Capital Market Operators CMO in different fields.\n\nOn international engagements, Mr Yuguda is now saddled with leadership of West African Securities Regulators Association WASRA. Under his leadership, rules for the integrated West African Capital Market were developed and reviewed.\n\nOn human capital development, the Commission had in 2019 conducted an internal capacity assessment that outlined staffing deficits and needs.\n\nAlso, in furtherance of its drive to leverage its operations by deploying innovative technologies and solutions to its departments and units, the Commission conducted a review of its IT infrastructure and determined that it was in a poor state.\n\nThe investigations focused on the internal and external perceptions of the Commission with the conclusion that the IT infrastructure was out dated and needed to be upgraded to international standards of securities regulators.\n\nAlso, on its Risk-Based Supervision Framework Implementation and Capacity Building Project the Commission secured a $400,000 grant from the African Development Bank AfDB to support capacity building projects in the areas of RBS, Derivatives and Green Bonds.\n\nThe Commission has also secured counterpart funding of $450,000 from AfDB on its Nigeria Securities Market Surveillance System Project to support the deployment of a real-time market surveillance system for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nIn addition, it has also secured from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN the sum of N3.5 billion for Information Technology transformation project. Given the unparalleled achievements recorded so far, it has been argued by some financial experts that there is nexus between Yuguda\u2019s reforms and investors\u2019 making Nigeria a preferred destination in recent times.",
