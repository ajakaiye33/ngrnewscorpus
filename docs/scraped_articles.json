          "title": "Eucharia Anunobi: For Gospel & Screen",
          "text": "Eucharia Anunobi is a veteran Nollywood actress who came into limelight after featuring in multiple, award-winning movie, Glamour Girls 2 (1996). The charismatic actress whose conversion to Christ took the industry by storm some years ago, has been in the business of making movies and winning souls for Christ.\n\nEucharia Anunobi who holds a Postgraduate Diploma in Pastoral Leadership from Redeemer\u2019s International Leadership Academy, last Sunday, added a feather to her already decorated hat, when she bagged a PhD in Christian Education and Ministerial Art from Kingdom Life Bible College International, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nIn this interview, Dr. Eucharia Anunobi, Filmmaker, actress and Minister of God, takes us through her world, touching on challenging moments as a Minister of God.\n\nExcerpts;\n\nWhat inspired you to broaden your knowledge in bible school?\n\nI was inspired by the fact that, in life, you need to keep honing your skills, improving yourself and evolving so you can remain relevant and be able to weather the storm, and whatever life throws at you. If life throws you lime, you\u2019ll make lemonade, if it throws you orange, you make orange juice.\n\nNow, a PhD holder, what is expected of you?\n\nI am expected to do more, educating my generation, to see things better, upgrade themselves, and to ensure that I contribute my quota in the educational system. I can become a visiting lecturer or a full-time lecturer in any University of my choice, within or outside Nigeria.\n\nMany people believe filmmaking is worldly and Ministers of God should not be involved in it. How do you balance the two?\n\nWell, it is an unfortunate thing that a lot of people believe filmmaking is worldly and Ministers of God should not be involved. I want to say, first and foremost, everything about the world we live in is worldly! Everything that we see upon the face of the earth came from God. But people began to digress and to do things that do not glorify God. Be that as it may, filmmaking is a mighty platform through which the gospel can be preached. So, I think it\u2019s a wrong notion for people to think and believe that filmmaking is worldly.\n\nIn the book of Genesis chapter one, in the beginning, \u201cthe earth was without form and void.\u201d So, out of all these things that didn\u2019t make sense, that were unbefitting, that had darkness, that ordinarily didn\u2019t look like you\u2019d see something good out of it, God\u2019s spirit, intellect, essence, moved over these things and began to make something out of it. So, invariably, some part of the film industry may be worldly as it were, but that is not a reason why Ministers of God should not be involved. Filmmaking can be used mightily to propagate the gospel of God so that those who cannot read the Bible, can watch it and understand it.\n\nMisconceptions about the Holy Bible can be cleared when the word of God is translated and put in film format. So, filmmaking is a medium that Ministers of God should embrace, to propagate the gospel, so that the layman can understand by just watching it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the Ministers of God, Pastors, Bishops, Apostles like myself, Doctors like myself getting involved in acting or making films. film making. Let us not forget, God makes something out of the seemingly unbefitting things. So, while others may be worldly in whatever they are doing, as Ministers of the gospel, let\u2019s distinguish ourselves and be different.\n\nA movie set is often a complicated setting where clashes of egos, anger and other excesses by cast and crew are likely to happen. In the light of your new reality as an Evangelist, how do you now handle such excesses from others compared to how you handled such in the past?\n\nWell, to the glory of God, it\u2019s been 10 years since I was ordained. So, it is not a new reality anymore. But I have the spirit of truth, the spirit of love, which comes from having our minds renewed. So, in such cases, no matter what is happening, we are meant to exhibit the fruit of the spirit and try to broker peace.\n\nHow have you been using films as a tool for evangelism?\n\nProducers who write scripts that are faith-based call me to act in most of them. That has been a means of propagating the gospel. That way, people can watch the movie and have the gospel broken down for them in pictures. Apart from that, our daily lifestyle, my daily lifestyle of showing love, of forgiving quickly, of trying to make amends, of trying to be more understanding, of apologizing quickly when you have done wrong; all these are ways of evangelizing.\n\nWhat have been some of your challenging moments as a Minister of God, actress and filmmaker?\n\nOne such challenge is when people assume that as an actress or filmmaker, you cannot also be a prophet or a vessel for God to use to bless people. I want to say to the glory of God, I\u2019m bringing a change in the narrative. I am becoming a trailblazer to changing the dynamics of how people see artistes, actresses or filmmakers. I am changing the narrative for them to see that yes, one can be an actress or a filmmaker, and can also be a great vessel of honour. If you studiously fine tune yourself and lay yourself at the feet of God, hear from Him, live according to His principles, be a great minister of the gospel, over time, people will now learn to know and see that there is no area of life in terms of career or profession that God cannot use. There are doctors, teachers, engineers who are Pastors. So, who said and who is saying that an actress, actor or filmmaker cannot also be a pastor? Be that as it may, if that has been the mindset of people, well, God is saying that I\u2019m changing the dynamics and narrative through my daughter, Apostle-Doctor Eucharia Anunobi.\n\nAs an actress, you are expected to be able to interpret any role. What are the roles you would rather not take now because of your status as a Minister in the church?\n\nWell, as an actress, I\u2019m supposed to interpret every role that is assigned to me because if one decides not to do the job, some other actor will take on the job. However, as an Apostle, even others who don\u2019t have that title or status, there are some roles they would not take. So, as much as I would act in every role as long as it\u2019s going to give out a message of reconciliation and informing the people, roles that have to do with me drinking alcohol, I may not take. Also, any other role that would require undue exposure of the body, I would not want to partake of it because even prior to when I became born again, and before I got ordained, I also didn\u2019t take on roles where there was an unnecessary exposure of the body.\n\nWhat guides the type of roles you accept?\n\nI must ensure it has a good storyline and that the story and the roles have a message to pass to the audience because two major things expected of any movie is that it should be entertaining and it should be educating. So, these are the things I watch out for before I accept any role.\n\nSince being ordained as an Evangelist, are there new insights you have gained about life and your profession?\n\nWell, before and after ordination, to the glory of God, I\u2019ve always had a very intimate relationship with God. It is through this intimate relationship that I understand that in life, for you to make it, for you to rise, for you to know what you want, you need to be close to God and have fellowship with Him. It is in the closeness and fellowship with God that I got to understand that whatever you do and do very well, it will bring you before kings.\n\nGenerally, when a person gives his or her life to God, the eyes of wisdom opens unto you, and it helps you to know how to talk and make right career decisions. It helps you in practically every area of your life.\n\nYou are one of the veterans of Nollywood that is still active in the industry today. What are the changes you would like to see?\n\nI\u2019d like to see us paid better. I also would want more financiers to come into the industry because; this is an industry that needs money for it to operate. Sponsors should come in, the government should enact laws to protect the literary contents of producers and the writers. Government should put structures in place that would give us an enabling environment to function, to produce the movies and above all, to ensure that persons who have laboured ceaselessly in the industry are truly honoured.\n\nWill you consider giving marriage another shot?\n\nSure. I would like to get married. I\u2019m looking forward to getting married. I believe it will happen in the fullness of time because God has already said that it is not good for a man to be alone. I\u2019m single and looking. So, if you have anybody who loves or likes me, and feels that I\u2019m the woman of his dreams, please bring him.\n\nWhat do you look out for in a potential suitor?\n\nThe Bible says, \u201cdo not be unequally yoked with the unbelievers\u201d, darkness cannot mix with light. You cannot be someone who likes music and want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t like music, it will not work. You have to complement each other. As an academician, I would also want someone educated and enlightened. Someone who has an open mindset, someone who loves education and knowledge as much as I do, and who is romantic. He should have the fear of God, and hold the things of God sacred, has the consciousness of heaven and lastly, someone who has a mind of his own, who would respect me and who loves humanity like I do.\n\nYou have held your own as a fashionable actress. How would you describe your style?\n\nThank you for the compliment. Well, my style is about class and elegance. I love my clothes to be fitting, nice, comfortable and classy. I do not wear things because people are wearing them. I create my style to suit my personality. Let me give an insight; because I am a preacher who is always on the go, if I have to be on the altar, I will not want to have hairstyles that have strands flying all over the places. So, I\u2019ve created the unique afro hair style that everybody now knows as my style.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s convenient and it doesn\u2019t get in the way. My style doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be what\u2019s in vogue because what is in vogue today, may not be in vogue tomorrow. My style is about wearing what flatters my body.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI relax by reading, dancing. I also relax by doing exercises, watching people, and meditating.\n\nWhere is your favourite relaxation location?\n\nMy favourite relaxation location is America; on the beach and walking through the parks.",

So, if you have anybody who loves or likes me, and feels that I\u2019m the woman of his dreams, please bring him.\n\nWhat do you look out for in a potential suitor?\n\nThe Bible says, \u201cdo not be unequally yoked with the unbelievers\u201d, darkness cannot mix with light. You cannot be someone who likes music and want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t like music, it will not work. You have to complement each other. As an academician, I would also want someone educated and enlightened. Someone who has an open mindset, someone who loves education and knowledge as much as I do, and who is romantic. He should have the fear of God, and hold the things of God sacred, has the consciousness of heaven and lastly, someone who has a mind of his own, who would respect me and who loves humanity like I do.\n\nYou have held your own as a fashionable actress. How would you describe your style?\n\nThank you for the compliment. Well, my style is about class and elegance. I love my clothes to be fitting, nice, comfortable and classy. I do not wear things because people are wearing them. I create my style to suit my personality. Let me give an insight; because I am a preacher who is always on the go, if I have to be on the altar, I will not want to have hairstyles that have strands flying all over the places. So, I\u2019ve created the unique afro hair style that everybody now knows as my style.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s convenient and it doesn\u2019t get in the way. My style doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be what\u2019s in vogue because what is in vogue today, may not be in vogue tomorrow. My style is about wearing what flatters my body.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI relax by reading, dancing. I also relax by doing exercises, watching people, and meditating.\n\nWhere is your favourite relaxation location?\n\nMy favourite relaxation location is America; on the beach and walking through the parks.",

          "text": "While we are still in the euphoria of children\u2019s day celebration, it\u2019s important to take a shot at teaching these treasures how to take care of themselves against sexual molesters.\n\nIt\u2019s true most parents often teach their children all sorts of ways to keep themselves safe- ranging from telling not take what does not belong to them, making them to watch the hot gas cooker, to look both ways before crossing the roads, the list is endless; but most times, never about the child\u2019s body safety. Teachings on this always come much later when they are older which sometimes comes too late.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it estimated that approximately 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 4 girls are sexually abused before the age of 18, and almost all of them knew their perpetrators.\n\nNo one particular race, culture, religion or socio-economic group is spared when it has to do with child sexual abuse. Although there\u2019s no foolproof way of protecting them from sexual abuse, but there are actually steps you can take to reduce the risk. As it\u2019s very glaring these days, sexual molesters are everywhere, they can strike at any time, and they come in different shapes/sizes/friendly/unfriendly.\n\nMost parents often say it cannot happen to their children because they will never expose them to strangers. Here are a few questions for you- Do you have friends or family come over to your house? Do they play at the neighbour\u2019s house? Do your children go to sleep over? Are they in day care/pre- school?\n\nThe simple truth is that you cannot fully prevent the risk of your child being sexually abused but you can teach them what to do to prevent them being victimized when they go out or interact with those around them. Below are some likely precautions you can take to gauge the situation/putting an end to the abuse.\n\nStart that conversation \u2013 Having a straight conversation about body parts can go a long way in protecting the children without scaring them off. Talk about body parts early, name body parts as it\u2019s never too soon to talk about them while they are still very young. Always use the right names for the different body parts. Sweet-coated names are not allowed. Feeling comfortable using the proper names and knowing what they mean can give them the ability to come to you when something is wrong and help them talk clearly if something inappropriate has happened.\n\nLet them know that some body parts are private \u2013 Tell him/her that their private parts are called private because they are not for everyone to see. Gently explain to them that only mummy and daddy can see them naked up to a certain age; but outsiders like relatives, friends/strangers are not allowed.\n\nTeach your child body boundaries \u2013 That under no circumstance should any one touch their private parts, and also no one should ask them to touch somebody else\u2019s private parts. This second part is very important because sexual abuse often begins with the molester asking the child to touch them or someone else.",

          "text": "The Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu has declared that he has no grudges against Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB.\n\nThe governor, who spoke during an interview with newsmen in Umahia, the state capital, said he was ready to engage the Biafra freedom fighter on how security would be restored in the state and other parts of Southeast.\n\nGovernor Ikpeazu while reacting to the activities of the IPOB members, who were accused of attacking security operatives in the state, said violence would not bring the expected change.\n\nThe governor called for dialogue between the secession agitators and the government to address their grievances, stressing that, \u201cif there are things you want us to vocalize about the way things are going in this country, raise the tune a little bit, I think there are people who are willing to say that and do that\u201d.\n\nBiafra: Nigerian forces arrest ex-soldier for training 2,000 IPOB ESN fighters\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI am not going to engage Nnamdi on the grounds of IPOB, but I can speak to citizen Nnamdi who happens to be an Abian but not on the basis or affiliation with IPOB. I\u2019m going to speak to Nnamdi on the basis of the fact that I am the governor of Abia State and he is a citizen of Abia State.\n\n\u201cBut again, why won\u2019t I discuss with anybody? I don\u2019t have anything personal against Nnamdi and I don\u2019t think he has anything personal against me. But all of us are saying the same thing to the extent that there is injustice, there is marginalization, we are saying the same thing. Our point of divergence is the approach.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re taking up arms against the Nigerian nation, what capacity do you have to conclude it? Because I\u2019m not a suicide candidate and I saw a bit of the civil war and I don\u2019t want to get people on a boat that is sailing to nowhere. He is entitled to his opinion, views and approach, but I\u2019m also saying to him, that as a young boy who went to Maiduguri at the age of 16, the boundaries of the South East and Northern Nigeria is not in Umuahia or Ubakala Police Station, neither is it in Bende or Ohafia.\n\n\u201cFighting in the kitchen is one of the indices that define lack of appreciation of the first rule of human existence which is self-preservation, because after the fight in the kitchen, with which pot and plate are you going to eat? Is it possible that while you\u2019re fighting in your kitchen with your kinsmen, that your real enemies could be sitting somewhere drinking Champaign and be laughing at your lack of understanding and love among yourselves?\n\n\u201cIf you have a perceived enemy and you embark on such a voyage and your son kills you, your enemy will just attend your funeral and save his gunpowder for another enemy. I think there is a need for a good reason to prevail. Let\u2019s sit down and talk about it.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think we need to change a few things in this country and I think we need to be smart about the way we change it. There is somebody who said that those who resort to violence have exhausted the capacity of their intelligence to resolve the matter. I don\u2019t think we have exhausted the capacity of our intelligence to resolve the matter. Violence cannot be the first option\u201d.\n\nI sacrificed my parents for Biafra, I will sacrifice everything \u2013 Nnamdi Kanu vows",

Anyone that has lost a close relative knows what it means to lose parents or children. I am more concerned about the lives lost because of the trickle down effects on families.\n\n\u201cOur people are not known for burning homes to punish enemies. Destroying police stations and infrastructures can never be the best path to express grievances. Whenever the 1967 \u2013 1970 civil war is mentioned, it\u2019s an emotive experience for any peace loving Nigerian not just an Igbo man.\n\nContinuing, he said \u201cWe should not either by words or actions pursue a repetition of that horrible genocide. We should come to understand that every war ends on a table. Instead of destructions before coming to the table, is it not wiser to come to table and avoid destruction? We need infrastructure, we need investments, we don\u2019t need hostilities. So we are pleading with you to stop and embrace peace,\u201c he said.\n\nOn the killing of innocent young people, kalu charged the security agencies to desist from harassment , molestation and killing of innocent young people in the region.\n\nHe said he is worried that some security agents have been reported to be killing innocent souls .\n\n\u201c It is better to thoroughly conduct your investigations and avoid the indiscriminate killings of young innocent Igbo men . Our people have raised alarm and we are very worried at the rate of disappearance and deaths of innocent young men . Some of our young people now live indoors for the fear of being tagged unknown gun man \u201c He said\n\nThe Chief Whip also reaffirmed his call for a national dialogue chaired by the President.\n\nHe noted that the need for a national dialogue is eminent to douse tensions in the country .\n\n\u201cWe have come a long way , our entanglement is so deep that all we need is diligent and deliberate efforts to realize the great dividends of diversity and pluralism.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nFour days after the Federal Government slammed indefinite ban on use of Twitter, prominent Nigerians have continued to flout the order.\n\nThose who have dared the FG include Governors of Kaduna and Ondo states, Nasir El-Rufai and Rotimi Akeredolu respectively, former Ekiti governor, Ayo Fayose and senators Dino Melaye and Shehu Sani\n\nGovernment had on Friday imposed suspension on Twitter alleging persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the ban on activities of the microblogging platform by Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, Minister of Justice and AGF, Abubakar Malami have directed the Director of Public Prosecution of the Federation (DPPF) in his office to swing into action and commence the process of prosecution of violators of the Federal Government\u2019s de-activation of operations of Twitter\n\nBut prominent clerics, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Enoch Adeboye and the General Superintendent, Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuyi, yesterday, posted separate tweets reacting to the ban of the microblogging platform.\n\nAdeboye said tweeting is in accordance with Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of human rights.\n\n\u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 Nations & Territories. The tweets here are in accordance to Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of Human Rights,\u201d the cleric tweeted.\n\nExplaining why Deeper Life Church would remain active on Twitter, Kumuyi said his tweets were targetted at over 100 nations where the church has branches. He said the church made use of Twitter to share contents from any of the locations across the five continents.\n\n\u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMocking the FG last night, Shehu Sani tweeted: \u201cYou have to come to Twitter to know who is in Twitter and coming is a Taboo.\u201d\n\nAlso defying the order, yesterday, Ayodele Fayose tweeted: \u201cAnyone they arrest will only end up being celebrated. No one should be moved by empty threats of arrest. Certainly, what has a beginning must have an end. This dictatorial govt came and shall definitely go. No shaking!\n\n\u201cGood days ahead\u201d while Melaye agreed with Pastor Adeboye that \u201cUnited Nations Charter of which Nigeria is a signatory and have since domesticated.\u201d\n\nEarlier, El-Rufai and Akeredolu, both members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), had tweeted through their verified accounts, daring Malami\u2019s prosecution threats. At exactly 9:37 p.m. on Sunday, Kaduna governor shared an opinion article titled: \u201cBased Nigeria: African country teaches US lesson in how to handle Big Tech tyranny\u201d.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu also posted a statement reacting to the night attack that claimed several lives in Igangan community in Oyo State on Sunday.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai\u2019s media aide, Muyiwa Adekeye said he had been outside the country for over a week, noting, \u201cthe activities of Twitter is not banned in the country.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson of Governor Akeredolu, Olabode Richard, also argued that the microblogging platform was accessible to Nigerians on Sunday, adding that his principal did not make use of the Virtual Private Network (VPN) or other alternatives being explored by Nigerians.\n\nIt, however, remains unclear if the order from the office of the AGF would be effected on, Adeboye, El-Rufai, Akeredolu and other \u201coffenders\u201d.\n\n\u2022FG could have handled it a lot better, says Sanwo-Olu\n\nSpeaking on a live television interview programme, yesterday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said considering the economic implications of the decision, the Federal Government could have handled the situation better.\n\n\u201cFederal government can handle this a lot better. Because of the number of eCommerce, the number of youths doing digital stuff on the internet, and we cannot throw that away and say it\u2019s not happening. I believe there could be a lot of restraint and better management from both sides,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\u201cOn both sides, there are issues that can be resolved between Twitter and the government and I think what they\u2019ve done is not a ban but a suspension like they said, so in the period of suspension let us sit down.\n\n\u201cIf we have 40 million users of that micro-blogger and another country has five million and they chose to take their investment to a country that have five million compared to a country with 40 million. It speaks to the reason we need to have that conversation with them. Probably if they have an office here things would have been done a lot quicker and better.\u201d\n\n\u2022Envoys maintain position on ban\n\nFederal Government, yesterday, met envoys of the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Canadian Government and the Government of Ireland over their response to its ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country.\n\nThe meeting which was at the instance of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, followed a statement jointly issued by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Delegation of the European Union to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Canadian Government, and the Republic of Ireland at the weekend, expressing disappointment over the ban on Twitter\u2019s operations.\n\nPrior to the joint statement, the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, had issued a separate statement where it said the ban on Twitter\u2019s operations in the country was an infringement on the rights of Nigerians to freedom of expression.\n\nPresent at the meeting were the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard; the British Deputy High commissioner, Gill Atkinson; Canadian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Nicolas Simard; the Political Adviser on Maritime and Security, Politics, Press and Information Section, Delegation of European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Thomas Kieler; and the Charge d\u2019Affaires of the Embassy of Ireland, Mr Conor Finn.\n\nOnyeama said the meeting was as a result of the statement jointly issued by the missions which was forwarded to him.\n\nOnyeama further said he felt it was absolutely appropriate to take their comments very seriously and meet with the heads of missions due to the respect for their countries and in view of the relationship with the affected countries.\n\nHe also said the meeting was in their usual friendly way, to discuss and share opinions with respect to the Twitter ban and clarify certain things.\n\n\u201cSo, it was for that reason that I have invited you here this morning, not summon, invited to discuss some of these issues,\u201d Onyeama said.\n\nResponding on behalf of other envoys, Leonard said as partners, they want to see Nigeria succeed, unified, peaceful and prosperous.\n\nAsked if they were withdrawing their statement, Leonard said they recognised that there were issues of irresponsible use of social media, but \u201cwe remain firm in our position that free access to the ability to express oneself is actually very important, and perhaps, even more important in troubled times.\u201d\n\n\u2022FG to sanction broadcast stations using Twitter\n\nThe Federal Government has directed broadcast stations to de-install twitter handles and desist from using twitter as a source of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in programmes.\n\nThe directive was issued in Abuja by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) in a statement by its Acting Director-General, Professor Armstrong Idachaba.\n\nNBC said it would be unpatriotic for any broadcaster to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information.\n\n\u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all broadcasting stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install twitter handles and desist from using twitter as a source of User Generated Content (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) r of the NBC Act entrusts the commission with responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules and regulations. Also, section 3.11.2 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u2018the broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than Crime and Anarchy,\u201d Idachaba said.\n\nIdachaba further said attention was also drawn to Section 5.6.3 of the Broadcast Code which required broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite to panic or rift in the society in the use of a UGC.\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined,\u201d Idachaba said.\n\n\u2022Asking TV, radio stations to deactivate accounts unlawful \u2013 SERAP\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has condemned the directive by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to all broadcast stations in the country to suspend patronage of Twitter with immediate effect as \u201cthe patently unlawful and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nNBC had reportedly stated that the decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over purported use of the platform for \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSERAP in a statement by its Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare said the directive by the NBC is itself unlawful because it is based on another unlawful decision by the Federal Government to suspend Twitter in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe NBC\u2019s directive has political interference written all over it. It is a blow to Nigerians\u2019 rights to freedom of expression, media freedom, media independence and diversity. The directive must be immediately withdrawn. Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right. This action by the NBC is yet another nail in the coffin for human rights, media freedom and independent journalism under this government.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should publicly and vigorously express concerns over the Nigerian government\u2019s increasingly brutal crackdown on media freedom, and use all possible means to urge the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to protect and respect freedom of expression.\u201d\n\n\u2022Stop mocking democracy, Norsemen tell FG\n\nAn international humanitarian body, De Norsemen KClub International has kicked against the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter, saying it was an ambush on the nation\u2019s fledgling democracy.\n\nThe group said the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was mocking democracy, adding that it was appalled that a government that came in through a democratic process, and prided itself as an upholder of democratic principles, could take such brazing unpopular decision without recourse to democratic principles and constitutionality.\n\nIn statement by it International President, Dr. Adeshola Giwa, on Monday, De Norsemen stated its belief and commitment to free speech, noting that only a government that had something to hide would abridge freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cDe Norsemen Kclub International wish to remind the Federal Government that a government that has nothing to hide is not afraid of free speech. The rule should be: let the people express themselves and take responsibility of their expressions. We want to emphasize that freedom of speech is an inalienable constitutional right of citizens. Citizens\u2019 right to free expression is non-negotiable and it is only a court of competent jurisdiction, and not the fiat of government, that can determine when the expression of citizens runs foul of the law.\u201d",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Imo state Commissioner of police, Abutu Yaro, has ordered a thorough investigation into the alleged killing of a German-based Nigerian, Oguchi Unachukwu, who was said to have been shot by the personnel of the 211 regiment of the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nThe deceased and his family were said to be on their way to catch a flight at the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo airport, Owerri, to Lagos, for an onward movement to Humburg, Germany, when he was shot at the tollgate of the airport, on May 31.\n\nThe CP, sequel to the call by the widow of the slain Unachukwu, Mrs Ijeoma Unachukwu, and other concerned citizens, to ensure that the killers did not go unpunished, swiftly commenced investigation into the killing.\n\nThe CP, in a statement issued by the command\u2019s Spokesperson, Bala Elkana, assured that his office would ensure that justice prevailed.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Commissioner of Police Imo State Command, Abutu Yaro, has ordered an in-depth investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of one Uguchi Unachukwu \u2018m\u2019 near the toll gate of Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, on May 31, 2021, at about 0804 hours.\n\n\u201cThe deceased person is alleged to have been shot by personnel suspected to be staff of 211 Regiment of the Nigerian Air Force, responsible for the security of the International Airport. The deceased was said to be on his way to catch a flight to Lagos. A survivor stated that one of the Air Force operatives shot the car of Oguchi when he failed to stop at the Air Force checkpoint after they had flagged him down.\n\n\u201cFollowing the information, the Air Force team at the toll gate, who were already on red alert, especially considering the recent killing of a high profile politician around the same area, intercepted a fast approaching Mercedes Benz vehicle.\n\n\u201cThey flagged down the vehicle and ordered the driver to park by the roadside for search, but the driver who, at first, slowed down and pretended to move to the side of the road, suddenly took off.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Air Force, being suspicious of the mission of the occupants of the said vehicle at the International Airport, they made an effort to demobilise the vehicle. When the vehicle eventually came to a halt, the operatives rounded it and ordered the occupants out.\n\n\u201cIt was at this point that a female passenger in the car mentioned that the man driving the vehicle was her husband and that he was rushing to catch his flight. He was, however, rushed to the hospital by the Air Force team for medical attention, where the doctors on duty made frantic efforts to stabilise him. He later died at about 1900 hours of the same date.\n\n\u201cImo State Police Command has commenced investigation into the case. The Commissioner of Police called for calm and assured family and friends of the deceased person that no stone will be left unturned in unravelling the circumstances surrounding the death.

          "title": "Twitter Loses Billions, Nigerians Lose Instant Communication Tools",
          "text": "\u2022Govt communication system in shambles as agencies return to old, archaic mode of information dissemination\n\n\u2022Buhari, Osinbajo, MDAs suspend tweeting\n\n\u2022Akeredolu, el-Rufai, Makinde defy directive\n\nBy Chiemelie Ezeobi in Lagos, Adedayo Akinwale and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFederal government\u2019s suspension of the operation of American micro-blogging company, Twitter, in Nigeria, might have left both in a catch-22 situation as the duo have lost millions of followers that they had built for more than half a decade.\n\nFor Twitter the saga has cost it billions of cash, while Nigerians, in both private and public sectors have lost their means of instant communication.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, had last week announced the suspension of Twitter after the firm deleted some aspects of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet, which the company found to be in breach of its rules.\n\nFollowing searing attacks of the suspension by social activists, who said it was an abuse of Nigerians\u2019 freedom of expression as guaranteed by Section 39 (1) of the Constitution as altered, Muhammed added an extra reason for the act, saying the temporary prohibition of the internet platform was a response to the firm\u2019s persistent violation of the nation\u2019s national security interest.\n\nThe suspension order had attracted a directive from the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), asking all Telcos and broadcasting media to deactivate their Twitter handles and block access to the internet facility.\n\nMany Nigerians, have, however, circumvented the federal government\u2019s blockage of the micro-blogging facility, resorting to the virtual private network (VPN) to connect Twitter.\n\nAlthough THISDAY\u2019s checks showed that Buhari, his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN), and many government agencies, including the armed forces, ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), have suspended tweeting, some governors including Malam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo) and Mr. Seyi Makinde (Oyo) have continued to tweet in defiance of the federal government\u2019s directive.\n\nAnalysts, however, told THISDAY yesterday that both the federal government and Twitter must be feeling the rough edges of the suspension as they suffer its adverse effect.\n\nFor the Nigerian government, its agencies and millions of private sector users of the micro-blogging facility, it amounts to a loss of an instant communication tool, which had helped to facilitate the dissemination and receipt of information necessary for the conduct of their businesses.\n\nBuhari, for instance, said an analyst, has lost millions of his followers that it has taken him six years to build. \u201cHe may have to start afresh when he returns to the site,\u201d he said.\n\nAgencies like Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) that had used its Twitter handle to instantly communicate with the public information on the COVID-19 pandemic, would now have to revert to other pre-Twitter messaging platforms, including e-mail, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram that are not as fast, another analyst explained last night.\n\nA day after Mohammed announced the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, had warned that violators of the ban would be prosecuted.\n\nBut senior lawyers have questioned the legality of Malami\u2019s order, saying that it is not grounded in law, adding that Nigerians could not be prosecuted for offences not specified by law.\n\nTo calm the global outrage that the suspension of Twitter has generated, the federal government yesterday met with ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland in Nigeria and sought their understanding on its suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nBut save for the First Lady, Hajia Aisha Buhari, who deactivated her Twitter handle following the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in the country, Buhari, Osinbajo and some other top government officials still retained their accounts, although they\u2019re inactive.\n\nHowever, the federal government\u2019s directive suspending Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria was silent on whether or not Nigerians should deactivate their accounts.\n\nBut a directive yesterday by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) had directed road and television stations in the country to de-install their Twitter accounts.\n\nChecks by THISDAY yesterday showed that Twitter accounts belonging to government Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are also being retained.\n\nSome of the accounts being retained belong to the Foreign Affairs Minister, Chief Geoffrey Onyema; Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN); and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).\n\nOthers include the Nigerian Police, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the\n\nSuper Eagles, the official Twitter account of Nigerian football team; and the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF), among many others.\n\nWhile most of these accounts are not active, the same cannot be said of their aides who have bypassed the networks to tweet with their Virtual Private Network (VPN).\n\nAlso active are Twitter accounts of former Senators Shehu Sani and Dino Melaye, as well as el-Rufai who tweeted the link of a story on \u201cNigeria: African country teaches US lesson in how to handle Big Tech tyranny \u2014 RT Op-ed.\u201d\n\nWhile Akeredolu\u2019s last tweet, on the attack on Igangan community in Oyo State was at 7.11 pm on Sunday, Makinde, at 9.45 am, on Sunday, tweeted to urge for calm over the attack on Igangan.\n\nAlso, most churches are still active on Twitter with both Deeper Life Bible Church and Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), justifying their accounts being active on the grounds that they need to reach congregants in other countries.\n\nThe RCCG, in a clarification, said: \u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 nations & territories. The tweets here are in accordance with Article 19 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201d\n\nArticle 19 of the UDHR said: \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Deeper Life General Overseer, Pastor Williams Kumuyi said: \u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations.\u201d\n\nFG Seeks Support of US, UK, Others over Twitter\u2019s Suspension\n\nThe federal government yesterday sought the understanding of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the European Union and Ireland over its suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria.\n\nIt, however, gave conditions to lift the suspension.\n\nAlso yesterday, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, called for a speedy resolution of the dispute.\n\nAddressing a press conference after a meeting with the five representatives of the missions in Abuja, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Onyeama, said they had a discussion concerning the issues of Twitter ban and based on the joint press statement earlier made by the missions.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe had a useful discussion with the countries that are considered to be close friends and partners of Nigeria. We sat down and reviewed the whole situation and we stated the security concern of Mr. President and the whole Nigerians and the very strong steps we\u2019ve taken to address the security challenges of the country.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said they presented first-hand information about the security challenges of the country and also the role of the social media.\n\nHe stated that social media is good for dissemination of information, but it can also be used for good and the bad.\n\nHe added that the bad side of it has dire consequences on human lives and property.\n\nAccording to him, it is germane to keep the unity of the country and to achieve all these, a decision has to be taken and measures put in place to ensure the social platforms are used responsibly.\n\nHe said as a democracy, the issue of fundamental human rights was expected to be respected, especially freedom of speech, adding that this should not be allowed to bring the country down.\n\nHe stated that the five missions and their countries have been supporting Nigeria even with its security and development challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have been having partnership and solidarity with the five countries. They have supported us very strongly in our security challenges, humanitarian crisis, development challenges and economic challenges, so we can say that these countries are our partners. We are asking them to also support us as we continue to confront all these challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have listened to them and they also have their views on all of these issues and we gave them the opportunities to also expressed themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly gratified with the statement and reassurance of support and friendship towards Nigeria. We have to keep an eye on the main objective of this government, when Mr. President was elected, security was number one of his priorities and it is something he really wants to be able to deliver for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithout security, everything else fails, investments go out of the country, regular migration out, it will be a vicious cycle.\n\n\u201cWe will all be losers and our children, generation to come will all be affected. What we do today will really determine the future of this country. That is why this government gives priority to security, that this government would have to live in peace and security. And we have to keep our country together.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done today, will really define the future of the country and that is why Mr. \u201cPresident is absolutely determined that security has been made and Nigerians have to live in peace and security and that we have to keep our country together. We listened to each other and clarified some areas.\u201d\n\nOnyeama, however, said the government was already discussing with Twitter on lifting the suspension.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you yourself have said, discussions are ongoing with Twitter, we want to see how that progresses. So I cannot say for now the duration of the suspension. There are conversations with our partners and with social media.\n\n\u201cThe basic condition is really responsible communication. We know the power of words and the power of words for good and the power of words for bad. You know when you have that kind of power to manage and facilitate the communication of billions of people around the world; it has to come with responsibilities. Absolutely, it has to come with responsibilities. So the condition will be a responsible use of media and that really has to be adhered to.\u201d\n\nIn her response on behalf of the five missions, the US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth- Leonard, said: \u201cI will say that first of all that we recognise that there are issues of responsible use of social media but we remain firm on our position that free access to the ability to express one\u2019s self is actually very important perhaps on one part, but also at trouble times.\u201d\n\nShe urged Nigeria to identify those who commit crimes and use judicial processes to deal with offenders, adding \u201cbut to constrain, that is not the behaviour.\u201d\n\nThe envoy added that they were glad to hear that Nigeria was interacting with Twitter.\n\nOn the challenges confronting the country, she said: \u201cI think we made that statement very clear that we are Nigeria\u2019s strong partners. We recognise the daunting times in the area of security challenges that confronts Nigeria. Well, they are daunting, they are not insurmountable and part of the way you surmount them is through partnership.\u201d\n\nThe federal government had earlier summoned the envoys over their recent comments on the suspension.\n\nThe missions had in a joint statement condemned the suspension.\n\nNBC Orders Broadcast Stations to Suspend Twitter Patronage\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has ordered all broadcast stations to suspend the patronage of Twitter with immediate effect.\n\nNBC said the decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the federal government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that could undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nThe acting Director-General of the NBC, Prof. Armstrong Idachaba, in a statement directed the broadcast stations to \u201cde-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation especially phone-in.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the federal government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all broadcasting stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn compliance to the above directive, broadcasting stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for news and programmes presentation, especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) of the NBC Act entrusts the Commission with the responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules and regulations. Also, Section 3.11.2 of Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u201cthe broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than crime and anarchy.\n\n\u201cAttention is also drawn to section 5.6.3 of the Code which requires Broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite panic or rift in the society in the use of user-generated content (UGC).\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Media aide dismisses speculation\n\nBy Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThere is rising tension in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) following an alleged plan by the Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, to transmute to the national chairman of the party, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that Buni\u2019s alleged ambition may have stopped the caretaker committee from announcing dates for national and states congresses in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory to usher in new party leadership.\n\nSources familiar with the power game in the party told THISDAY that Buni\u2019s game plan is to resign his position as governor and join the race for the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nHe\u2019s billed to end second term tenure in May 2023.\n\nBut in a swift response, Buni dismissed the claim, saying he has no intention to resign his position as governor.\n\nThe caretaker committee was given up to this month to conduct a national convention and states\u2019 congresses after a reconciliation of the members as well as the revalidation of membership registers.\n\nThe sources said a self-succession motive by Buni to become the substantive national chairman is currently stalling moves to hold a national convention.\n\nHowever, many of the governors elected on the platform of the party are said to be opposed to Buni\u2019s bid to transform into the substantive chairman of the party.\n\nThe APC governors opposed to the Buni\u2019s ambition, it was learnt, are those who would be rounding off their second term in office by 2023.\n\nAlso, the ministers who have political ambitions by 2023 are opposed to the transmutation plans of Buni and some selected members of the APC caretaker committee.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that a National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party would soon be summoned.\n\nA special NEC meeting of the APC in June 2020 had appointed Buni, a former national secretary of the party, as chairman of the caretaker committee following the leadership crisis triggered by the suspension of the then National Chairman of the party, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nThe caretaker committee was given a six-month mandate to organise a convention that would elect a new National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nBut the committee sought and was granted a six-month extension to complete its mandate.\n\nBut after 12 months in office, no date has been announced for the election of the executive committee members.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the Buni-led caretaker committee has begun to plan another meeting of NEC to seek an elongation of its tenure.\n\nA member of the committee that spoke to THISDAY in confidence said there is a plot for the Buni committee to seek an elongation or an outright self-perpetuation of members in office.\n\nThe argument, the source said, would be that an election from ward to states and eventually, national convention in the party would further divide the party at a time when it should be consolidating in the states ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt was against this backdrop that some committee members, albeit with the consent of Buni, were considering presenting to the NEC that he should rather resign as governor and continue at the national convention, where he would be affirmed as the substantive national chairman of the party.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that since his emergence as caretaker committee chairman, Buni has not spent up to four days a week in Yobe State as he stays in Abuja most of the time.\n\nBefore winning the election to become the governor, he was the national secretary of APC when Oshiomhole was the national chairman.\n\n\u201cAlthough this has not been tabled before the NEC, members of the party, who should know, were already protesting against the idea of members self-perpetuating themselves under any guise,\u201d the source said.\n\nSome of the APC members who did not want to be quoted said they had concluded plans to seek legal action against any plans by the committee members to self-perpetuate themselves in office.\n\nAnother member told THISDAY that the Buni committee has already overstayed its welcome.\n\nA member of the committee also confirmed the self-succession bid, saying: \u201cWe were appointed to right the wrongs of Adams Oshiomhole, and not this idea of not announcing the dates for the wards, local government, states and national convention.\n\n\u201cAnything outside announcing the dates of the national convention and other dates for the states congresses is outside our mandate. If by the next month, there is no date announced for the elections, I will speak out and also resign. What is happening is not our mandate.\n\n\u201cWe were appointed in June 2020 and our mandate was renewed in December to end in June. Any further plan to seek an extension or perpetuate us in office, count me out.\u201d\n\nBut in a swift response, Buni dismissed the allegation of self- perpetuation, saying he has no intention to resign his position as the governor of Yobe State to become the substantive chairman of the party.\n\nBuni\u2019s Director of Media, Mr. Mamman Mohammed, said he already has a job, and he is not looking for another one.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a blatant lie; it is just a fabrication. The governor has a job, which he\u2019s doing and he is not looking for any other job. It is not even worth responding because it does not even get an inch close to anything obtainable with the governor.\n\n\u201cThe task before him is to build a viable and vibrant political party; organise a very successful congress and convention and handover the party to elected officials.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted yesterday on the purported plan to convey NEC meeting of the party to seek further extension, the National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said \u201cno comment.\u201d\n\nBut a party source, who pleaded anonymity, told THISDAY that conducting party congresses and convention this month was not feasible, as there is no road map.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe president has not agreed with what the caretaker committee is trying to do as regards another elongation. The president is still adamant, he has not said anything. He is waiting for them to convince him.\n\n\u201cIf we want to conduct the congress, it starts from the ward to the local government to the state. It is those who emerge from these congresses that will form the national delegates to the convention. But we have not done any of this and there is no date scheduled for it at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe party source added ward congress will take a week or two, same as local government congresses and state congresses.\n\nHe said there would also be an appeal for ward, local and state congresses which would take two weeks each.\n\nThe source added: \u201cNow we are in Lagos to authenticate the membership register for it to be used for the primary election, which we are in the process. We have done that of Ogun, we are now in Lagos. We have not authenticated that of other states, how do you now expect a congress to come up.\u201d\n\nAsked if the membership register was authenticated by the party officials before the primary, he replied: \u201cThey didn\u2019t use it, they by-passed it. If there is any litigation against them, they will win in court. They didn\u2019t use the approved membership register; they falsified the one they used. Even in Abeokuta, they are falsified.\u201d\n\nThe source stated that there is no way the party can conduct congress without authenticating and finalising the registration of new members.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Even if any breakaway will start, it will end on a table, so, let\u2019s create that table amongst ourselves and start talking.\n\n\u201cIf we understand that there are different strengths in the room, let equity and fairness come into play, let\u2019s understand what are the things you have that is bothering you and what are the things you don\u2019t have that you want to have and let\u2019s be able to resolve it.\n\n\u201cIt is not by saying that we want to go (our separate ways).

          "text": "By Michael Olugbode\n\nThe Federal Government has said it is in talks with Twitter over the suspension of the micro-blogging site in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama disclosed this Monday at press conference after his meeting with representatives of five foreign missions in Nigeria over their comments on the Twitter ban.\n\nThe Minister however said that Twitter remains suspended and there was still no date for the lifting of the suspension.\n\nHe said Twitter operations in Nigeria would be restored only if the platform could be used \u201cresponsibly.\u201d\n\nHe further said that the federal government never said Twitter was threatening the country, but said\n\nthe suspension of the platform was a measure taken to stop it from being used to destabilize the country.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe are not saying that Twitter is threatening the country or any such thing.\n\n\u201cWhy we have taken this measure is to stop them from being used as platform for destabilization and facilitation of criminality or encouragement of criminalities.\u201d\n\nHis remarks were however at variance with the statement by the Ministry of Information last Friday wherein the Federal Government announced the indefinite suspension of the operations of the micro-blogging and social networking service site in Nigeria, citing the persistent use of the Twitter platform for activities that were capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\n\nThe Federal Government had on Monday summoned ambassadors of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland and the European Union in Nigeria over their comments on the suspension of Twitter.\n\nCommenting on the meeting with the five envoys, Onyeama said: \u201cThey had useful discussion with the countries that are considered to be close friends and partners of Nigeria. We sat down and reviewed the whole situation and we stated the security concern of Mr. president and the whole Nigerians and the very strong steps we\u2019ve taken to address the security challenges of the country.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said government presented the first hand information about the security challenges of the country and also the role of the social media.\n\nHe admitted that the social media was good for dissemination of information, but just like anything else it can be used for bad purposes, insisting that such could have dire consequences on human lives and property.\n\nHe said that it was important to keep the unity of the country, and to achieve all these a decision had to be taken and measures put in place to ensure the social platforms were used responsibly.\n\nHe admitted that as a democracy, the issues of fundamental human rights was expected to be respected, especially freedom of speech, but added that this should not be allowed to bring the country down.\n\nWhile admitting that the five missions and their countries had been supporting Nigeria in the areas of security and development challenges, he said Nigerian government was also asking that they should support the need to control the use of social media.\n\nHe said the major task before President Buhari was security of lives and property of everyone in the country, insisting that without security everything would turn up-side-down in the country and foreign investments would even be at risk.\n\nResponding to questions from the media, the United States Ambassador, to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, who spoke on behalf of the other envoys, said the security situation of Nigeria was understood and the need to do something urgently to address the drift was equally important.\n\nShe insisted that the issues of fundamental human rights was inalienable and needed to be respected by the government.\n\nShe said that judicial process should be allowed to take effect in some of the disputed areas.\n\nThe Twitter ban was announced by the Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, Friday, two days after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet posted wherein he threatened to deal with secessionists \u201cin the language they understand\u201d.\n\nThe social media networking site had said the tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\n\nThe ban has attracted widespread condemnations as Nigerians described it as violation of rights of citizens and a prelude to dictatorship.\n\nMore than 39 million Nigerians have a Twitter account, according to NOI polls, a public opinion and research organization based in Nigeria.\n\nNigerian telecoms operators complied with the government directive on the ban Friday but Nigerians are navigating around the ban using VPN\n\nThe U.S. and the European Union had on Saturday expressed concern over Nigeria\u2019s decision to ban Twitter.\n\n\u201cBanning systems of expression is not the answer,\u201d the diplomatic missions of the EU, U.S., Britain, Canada and Ireland had said in a joint statement Saturday condemning the ban.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This had a severe impact on the resources available to the government to pursue its development programmes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the dip in oil revenue in 2020, Barkindo said the situation was aggravated by the coronavirus pandemic which impacted global oil demand.\n\nHe said developing economies were most affected as several jobs were lost during the period.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the 2020-21 recession was also caused by extraneous factors far beyond Nigeria\u2019s borders. The devastating spread of COVID-19 severely impacted global oil demand and, again, developing economies were exposed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere were significant job losses across the industry, as well as increasing financial and operational stresses for many companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn fact, a record number of companies in our industry filed for bankruptcy.\u201d",

She was the youngest editor in Conde Nast\u2019s history and the second African American person to be made editor-in-chief at Teen Vogue.\n\nYou have described yourself as a homebody who enjoys the occasional getaway. How are you able to marry your introverted personality with your role as a communications executive?\n\nBeing able to switch into extroverted comms mode provides a nice balance. If I had a job in a quiet little cubicle, I would probably be miserable. I get my fix from my job. I get my fix when I interact and engage with my team, and with customers. Human interaction is very important, especially because we are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\nTell me about school. What did you study? Where did you go?\n\nI did not study marketing or communications (surprise surprise). I have a Bachelor of Commerce in Law (BCom Law) and it\u2019s a program that is only offered in South Africa. I started off with studying economics, but after my first year and learning more about what economists did for a living, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to go down that career path.\n\nSo, you changed your degree?\n\nYes, I did \u2013 at the start of my second year. Here\u2019s the truth: initially, I thought I was going to enjoy the law aspect of the program. I mean I enjoyed speaking, had gone through Toastmasters, and being a lawyer seemed like a viable career option. I was wrong. In the end, I realized that I didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer.\n\nWow. How were you able to figure out your career path?\n\nI didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do or what kind of career I wanted to pursue. It wasn\u2019t until my time at Elizabeth Arden that I figured out my passion: talking to customers and connecting them to their favourite brands or businesses. When I was in South Africa, Elizabeth Arden was typecast as a beauty brand that catered exclusively to white South African women. Black South African women bought their perfumes, but make-up and skincare? No chance. When Elizabeth Arden was ready to change that image, I became fully immersed in trying to figure out our campaigns and how to speak to this new target audience.\n\nSo you kind of fell into marketing and communications?\n\nBasically. I didn\u2019t realize until years later that what I was doing at Elizabeth Arden was marketing. And I loved it.\n\nHow are you able to wear both hats? Especially because marketing and communications (comms) are two different departments?\n\nMy career in Nigeria started in PR. Then I worked in digital marketing, media, marketing, before finally settling down in a communications role at 54gene. My learnings have prepared me for where I am right now and given me the skills I need to wear both hats effectively well.\n\nHow do you find alignment between the two?\n\nI\u2019ll admit that although they are significantly different, there are parts of marketing and communication that are interwoven. For me, it\u2019s about finding synergy in those interwoven parts. My job is to set key goals and metrics for each department and ensure that we are all working towards achieving them with maximum efficiency. Sometimes, it gets tricky.\n\nHow so?\n\nWell, comms is heavy on messaging and storytelling. While marketing is more tactical and strategic with a lot more moving parts. And obviously, because we are in a fast-paced social media and technology age, digital marketing is hot right now and isn\u2019t what it used to be three years ago.\n\nHow are you able to keep up with the changes?\n\nSocial media is my new learning ground. You\u2019ll be surprised by how much you learn on Twitter, Youtube, and Medium. On the marketing side, I follow themarketingtopic on Twitter and I\u2019m also subscribed to Marketing Brew. I also enjoyed reading Clueless To Designer \u2013 it\u2019s a beginner\u2019s guide to product design written by Mitchelle Chibundu. Mark Manson also writes a newsletter that I\u2019m subscribed to and enjoy reading every now and then.\n\nHow are you applying what you are learning on the job?\n\nMy role at Eze is vastly different from my role at 54gene. With Eze, I\u2019m dealing with markets outside of Africa which means I have to learn how to speak the marketing language for those markets. I have to draw inspiration from marketing leaders who understand what Eze is trying to do in the wholesale ecosystem.\n\nWhat would you say to aspiring and working communications and marketing professionals?\n\nFirstly, prioritize storytelling. Eat, breathe, and live storytelling. Explore how different brands are telling stories and motivating their customers to buy a product or engage with their posts on social media.\n\nSecondly, study consumer behaviour. What is driving people to spend money? What are your customers\u2019 pain points? Who are you selling to?\n\nLastly, invite empathy into your work. Tactics are important but if you don\u2019t know how to connect with your audience on a deeper level, you will lose them to a competitor. A growing number of young buyers are paying attention to businesses that care about promoting social change and impact.\n\nMoyosola\u2019s tip: Empathy and storytelling go hand-in-hand.\n\nWhat does good leadership look like to you?\n\nI believe that leadership is about paying attention to your people. It\u2019s important to be kind, empathetic, and supportive. I think not enough is said about managers who support their team members. You need to move away from just doling out tasks to going over and beyond to arm your team with the tools and resources they need to succeed. I\u2019m dedicated to ensuring that my team members are developing their skill sets and getting access to the training they need.",

          "text": "South African Mobility startup WhereIsMyTransport has raised a $14.5 million Series A extension round to continue its expansion across emerging markets.\n\nThe round was led by Naspers Foundry, Cathay AfricInvest Innovation Fund and Japan\u2019s SBI Investment. This investment comes a year after the company raised a $7.5 million Series A round from investors including Google and Toyota Tsusho. This brings the total raised by the company during its Series A funding to $22 million.\n\nFormed in 2016, WhereIsMyTransport is a big data platform that provides sustainable mobility solutions in emerging markets. It maps formal and informal public transport networks. The company then uses data obtained to improve the public transport experience, making commutes safe and accessible.\n\nIts products are used by cities to coordinate and monitor services, operators to integrate their systems, and passengers, who access the platform through apps and endpoints connected to the WhereIsMyTransport platform. WhereIsMyTransport has been used to enrich Google Maps in Mexico and has helped the World Bank examine access to job opportunities via public transport in 12 African cities.\n\nWith this new investment, WhereIsMyTransport plans to continue its expansion across emerging markets, with a launch in Peru planned for later this year. It has already mapped 34 African cities and has over 100,000 users in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWhereIsMyTransport started in South Africa, focused on becoming a central source of accurate and reliable public transport data for high-growth markets. We\u2019re thrilled to welcome Naspers as an investor as our journey continues in megacities across the majority of the world,\u201d said CEO Devin de Vries.\n\nFabian Whate, head of Naspers Foundry, said WhereIsMyTransport had a strong track record of developing the best-in-class technology for improving the daily commutes of people across the world.\n\n\u201cThe mobility technology company is a great addition to the Naspers Foundry investment portfolio and we look forward to working with the WhereIsMyTransport team as they take their business to the next level,\u201d he said.\n\nMobility in emerging markets via public transportation is often a hassle \u2013 it\u2019s inefficient and time-consuming.

          "title": "Club Swan Creates Services To Address Challenges Faced By Nigerian Entrepreneurs",
          "text": "Abiodun Ajayi \u2013 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Strategist\n\nClub Swan, a global lifestyle club designed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, has launched new services to address challenges faced by Nigerian cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.\n\n\n\nInnovation in payments first came with the advent of paper money to replace bartering. The second wave of innovation continued with the issuance of credit and debit cards. Now, through technology, we are on the third wave of payment innovation: the blockchain and digital currencies.\n\nTo provide recent historical context, in the late 1990s, many believed mobile phones were too expensive for a large majority of people in Africa. Lack of infrastructure meant that it was unthinkable to just set up a mobile telecommunications market. However, in 1998, Mo Ibrahim saw an opportunity and developed a business model to meet the needs of Africans. This triggered development across the continent and created thousands of jobs. The telecoms industry in Africa is now worth over $200 billion.\n\nToday, cryptocurrency has initiated an entrepreneurial boom in Nigeria. A report by Chain Analysis showed that in 2020, Nigeria ranked first among African countries in peer-to-peer payments. Up to $139 million was traded in peer-to-peer payments in 2020 according to the report.\n\nCryptocurrency activity in Africa.\n\nThe basis of this adoption is the need for viable alternatives to challenges we face in global payments.\n\nNigeria has become a hotbed for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and has unleashed a vibrant crypto and blockchain community alongside a teeming population of digitally native youth who are unabashedly united to participate in the third wave of payment innovation.\n\nTo a large extent, the situations we see in Nigeria are indicative of the trends occurring generally in sub-Saharan Africa. Simply put, there is a wave of enlightenment and Nigerians are willing to test and figure out new ways of doing things facilitated by technology.\n\nWhen oil revenue plunged in 2020, a dollar shortage ensued which devalued the Naira. As of March 2021, the inflation rate in Nigeria hovered around 18%. Aspiring business leaders are now dealing with the fact that current financial options available simply can\u2019t keep up with inflation. Hence, many entrepreneurs have turned to crypto as a viable option.\n\nChallenges faced by Nigerian entrepreneurs\n\nParticipating in Global eCommerce International Settlements\n\nParticipating in Global eCommerce\n\nCryptocurrency allows entrepreneurs to transfer and receive money from anywhere worldwide. However, some face undue obstacles when payment firms place limits on Nigerians.\n\nCrypto has enabled Tola Fadugbagbe, a businessman who moved to Lagos 10 years ago to grow his business. Today, he sources his mobile phones from east Asia and he finds it easier to make payments to his east Asian partners in bitcoin.\n\nCrypto has created a paradigm shift in the way people start to think about emerging markets and creating new business opportunities. The success of cryptocurrency can be attributed to the fact that business owners need alternative ways to conduct trade in a seamless fashion.\n\nInternational Settlements\n\nCryptocurrency and blockchain technology have made it possible for individuals to conduct business virtually without any intermediaries, thereby enabling companies worldwide to reach out to customers across international borders. In the past few years, merchants have leveraged for cross-border payments. According to Lagos vendor Abolaji Odunjo, \u201cmaking payments with Bitcoin makes transactions easier and reduces costs.\u201d\n\nCrypto advantages for Nigerian Entrepreneurs\n\nExpanded payments opportunities\n\nSince the dawn of civilization, payment for goods and services has been ever present. However, it has gone through innovation over the years. From the earliest exchange of goods by barter to the advent of cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith crypto, there are expanded payment opportunities. This makes transactions easier and more efficient.\n\nTrusted transactions\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are based on blockchain which is publicly accessible and transparent. The transactions are relatively secure and fast.\n\nWe Nigerians know, the quickest way to build trust is to give customers the quickest response time as we prefer quick service delivery. The entrepreneur or business owner that can provide the shortest time between when the customer makes payment and when the customer receives value ultimately wins the heart of the customer.\n\nDisadvantages of crypto for Nigerian Entrepreneurs\n\nNo reliable methods to off-ramp large amounts of crypto to fiat\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to large funds of $2000 and above, only one reliable service is available to Nigerians. Unfortunately, this service is designed mainly for peer-to-peer transactions, which come with their own set of challenges.\n\nClub Swan provides a reliable bridge\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Club Swan is a global lifestyle concierge membership club designed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Members can take advantage of their payments platform that enables the use of cryptocurrencies alongside traditional currencies. Club Swan created the platform to address the obstacles many legitimate entrepreneurs face when using digital and legacy currencies.\n\nNot only does Club Swan enable its members to use crypto to off ramp to fiat currency and use fiat to purchase crypto currency from its inventory, it also provides an option for its members to receive the Club Swan prepaid card that can be used globally. Moreover, members enjoy expanded flexibilities when it comes to spending as the platform supports three major global currencies. For entrepreneurs that travel extensively, Club Swan provides dedicated concierge, travel and lifestyle services for its members. This includes but is not limited to discounted hotel and airfare and access to exclusive luxury events. Best of all, membership is open to Nigerians and services are geared toward Nigerian entrepreneurs.\n\nTo become a member of Club Swan, go to https://clubswan.com and select the membership tier that suits your needs. All members are vetted through their Know Your Customer protocols and upon successful completion, entrepreneurs can now fully participate in the third wave of payment innovation.\n\n",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nUberX Hourly launches in Nigeria\n\nMoneyHash pre-seed investment round\n\nUpdates on the Twitter ban in Nigeria\n\nUber Launches UberX Hourly in Nigeria\n\nOn Monday, June 7, 2021, US-based ride-hailing platform, Uber, announced the official launch of UberX Hourly in Nigeria.\n\nWith this new feature, riders can stop at multiple locations to carry out activities without requesting several rides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this means is that you can book a ride to an event centre but also stop by the pharmacy to get drugs or the supermarket to grab a few things with the same ride. Of course, you can\u2019t do all that with the initial amount paid.\n\nHow it works is, on the Uber app, you can order a ride as usual, but this time, you\u2019d select an Hourly Driver. Then, put in your destination and send your driver an in-app message to discuss how much time you think you might spend on all trips. Upfront charges are based on the minimum per hour, and consequently, per minutes.\n\nThis launch follows a warning strike action carried out by Bolt and Uber riders under the Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA) in April and a 13% increase in fares in Lagos in May.\n\nBefore now, UberX Hourly was only available in Africa in Tanzania\u2019s largest city, Dar Es Salaam. According to Uber\u2019s Country Manager for Nigeria, Tope Akinwumi, the warm reception of the product by both riders and users in that city reflects its viability and scalability in Nigeria. .\n\nEven if there is some excitement about the feature in the country, the drivers\u2019 concerns haven\u2019t been addressed. Time will tell how affordable UberX Hourly will be.\n\nMoneyHash raises undisclosed pre-seed round\n\nL-R MoneyHash co-founders Nader Abdelrazik, Anisha Sekar and Mustafa Eid. Source:The Capital Quest\n\nEgypt-based fintech startup, MoneyHash, raised an undisclosed pre-seed investment on Monday, June 7,2021. The round was led by COTU ventures, a leading seed-stage venture firm in the Middle East.\n\nOther investors in the round include Kepple Africa Ventures, Nigeria-based early-stage VC, Ventures Platform, and some angel investors.\n\nThe startup is currently building an API to help businesses access all payments and fintech services across the Middle East region. This will help eCommerce merchants provide users with a seamless experience during checkout and create a compact user database.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Nader Abdelrazik, Mustafa Eid, and Anisha Sekar, MoneyHash launched in December 2020. The app is currently running a private beta mode. The funding will be put towards a public launch, product development, and team growth.\n\nIt goes to say that more startups realise the necessity of fintech platforms in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This should be no surprise as it\u2019s a region where only 40% of the population have access to bank accounts. The fintech and digital banking scene is plagued with issues like lack of a unified data system and payment integration; startups like MoneyHash are looking to provide viable solutions to these problems.\n\nStill on the Twitter ban in Nigeria\u2026\n\nA lot seems to have happened since the Federal Government of Nigeria banned the use of microblogging platform, Twitter, on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nThe news was received with a bitter counteraction by a large number of the public, as it poses a threat to the core values of free speech and freedom of expression that are the bedrock of a democratic state.\n\nHowever, it is one thing to react to a wrong, and it is another to be aware of the facts as to why an action may be wrong or right.\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo picked the brains of three lawyers to find out the legality of the directive. What\u2019s your guess?\n\nYou should check it out: #TwitterBan: Exploring the legal intricacies of Nigeria\u2019s decision\n\nThat\u2019s not all. In a bid to access Twitter, Nigerians currently have to resort to using Virtual Private Networks (VPN).

In addition, the body further prohibits media platforms from using User Generated Content (UGC) as sources in their reportage.\n\nThe statement calls for strict compliance citing lines from the NBC Act and The Broadcasting Code that point to media companies having an obligation to adhere to national laws and be mindful of content capable of inciting violence or public unrest.\n\nAlthough not outrightly stated, defaulters could be penalised based on the federation\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s order to prosecute any Nigerian still using the microblogging platform.\n\nThe latest order resulting from the ongoing Twitter suspension in the country since Friday, June 4, 2021, is a way of disincentivising individuals and corporate bodies from patronising Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this proves to be a challenging period for businesses strongly dependent on the social media platform.\n\nWhile the statement does not clearly state what media platforms are affected by the directive, the NBC Act defines broadcasting stations as entities \u2014 like radio, sound, television, cable, or satellite stations \u2014 that have received a broadcasting licence after satisfying the regulator\u2019s requirements. From the definition, it is not clear if new media companies are also caught in this web.\n\nThis is not the first time the NBC is clamping down on broadcasters in the country.\n\nRecall, during the October 2020 #EndSARS protest, NBC suspended three media companies on the claims of using UGC as their sources while accusing them of misinformation and releasing content that could incite unrest.\n\nIn a previous article, we established the role that UGC has played in the past in Nigeria while questioning why it should be forbidden because of the October 20, 2020 Lekki Tollgate Massacre.\n\nFollowing the Twitter suspension order, some digital platforms have disengaged themselves from receiving customer complaints via their Twitter handles, advising users to reach out through other channels; others have put up disclaimer posts about where they are tweeting from.\n\nFor one, recent events have pointed to the intensified drive of the federal government to inhibit free speech, one of the many signs that the country may gradually be borrowing China\u2019s cards.\n\nAs Twitter users in Nigeria find alternatives to access the platform either through VPN and other channels, it remains to be seen how this would ultimately impact journalism, freedom of speech, and timely dissemination of information in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, Nigeria has finally joined the list of countries losing millions of dollars to government-led Internet crackdowns annually. According to the NetBlocks Cost of Shutdown Tool (COST), the country may have lost up to $18 million (~\u20a66.5 billion) having kept up the order for almost 36 hours.",

They have run that school aground.\n\n\u201cThe university has been divided down the line; it is like the school is just there for the workers, not the students.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cSo, as a government, we have decided that AAU must be restructured. AAU is Edo State university; it is not a local university. We must restructure it to meet universal standards. Ambrose Alli\u2019s dream was to make it an internationally-recognized university and that is my dream.\n\n\u201cCan any foreign university come to partner with us like this? So, I have to prepare the school to be an international university, which Ambrose Alli meant it to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleading for your support for the sake of our children and for the sake of our future. Please, join me; support me, so that we can clean up AAU, because what it has done and what it can do for Esan land and the entire Edo Central Senatorial District, you cannot imagine,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, former Minister of Works, Mr. Mike Onolememen, assured the governor that the entire Esan people are fully in his support.\n\n...",

In addition to all the receipts, they incurred debt of more than N10 billion; I want to find out what happened.\n\n\u201cWe are operating a system that is not working anymore and we all must agree to change it because we are all involved. We can only deliver services to our people only if we agree moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe must clean up the local government system knowing that elections will soon take us back to the people who will ask us about our electoral promises. The clean-up is necessary to enable us to deliver services to our people.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how well we perform in the state, the local government is closest to the people. If the local government does not work, it will be difficult for us to show what we have achieved. What happens at the local government level affects the people.\n\n\u201cWhen the term of the past local government administration started, we knew that we had to undertake some changes. We sought people with integrity and experience to take charge of the local government. We know what happened during the political season.\u201d\n\nHinting on his government\u2019s backing for local government autonomy, the governor noted: \u201cI have come to realise that there are structural problems in the local government. We don\u2019t take money or touch the local government\u2019s money. We are transparent and open as we don\u2019t interfere in the local government\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cIf you want me to publish the amount that accrues to local governments monthly, I will do that to ensure transparency in the incoming administration. Moving forward, I will hold local government leaders responsible for any mismanagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to fulfilling our promises to the people of the state. We must fix the engine of government, make it work more effectively and ensure development in the local government areas,\u201d he reassured.\n\nThe governor further charged local governments not to rely on monthly federal allocation but to be innovative and come up with better means of improving their revenue.\n\nObaseki stated: \u201cThe money is not there again as it used to be. The dependence of money from Abuja is not possible anymore, that is why I am insisting and emphasising local government reforms.\n\n\u201c70 to 80 percent of finance for local governments comes from Abuja and there will be problems if the money stops coming. We will not and can\u2019t continue like this. You will help me to stop people from collecting revenue and putting it in their private pockets. We have enough resources to keep us going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must bring the leadership together and agree on the way forward as this is the only way to solve the problem faced by the State,\u201d he said.\n\nA leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Igueben Local Government Area, Chief Felix Omi Imoisili said, \u201cWe will collaborate with you in the reforms you are embarking on at the local government level.

          "title": "CBN gas policy holds out promise for domestic market",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThere is high optimism among Oil and gas experts and economic analysts that the target of expanding gas consumption in Nigeria would be substantially achieved with appropriate deployment of the N250bn gas intervention fund set aside by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe use of cooking gas in Nigeria increased to one million metric tonnes in 2020 from about 400MT consumption level recorded four years ago. But operators attribute the increase to the removal of the subsidy on kerosene, noting that Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) penetration was still far from the national target of five million metric tonnes set for next year.\n\nIt is no longer debatable that Nigeria is endowed with enormous natural gas resource. However, how to use this resource to develop and transform the nation\u2019s economy and add significant value to the lives of its citizens remains a major issue for decades.\n\nAccording to the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) \u2013the regulator of activities in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, as at January 2020, Nigeria\u2019s proven gas reserves stood at 203.16trillion cubic feet. The nation\u2019s unproven gas reserve is still at about 600trillion cubic feet. These numbers no doubt put Nigeria as a major player in the world gas market, ranking as the ninth largest gas producer globally and the number one on the African continent.\n\nFor long, there have been conversations around how Nigeria can leverage the vast opportunities in its gas resource to open up the country for investments, which will in turn lead to massive job creation, enhanced energy efficiency, increased productivity as well as increased revenue to both government and businesses.\n\nAlthough, Nigeria prides itself as a major exporter of LNG to the world via the Nigeria LNG Limited, making gas available for domestic use through business-friendly government policies and actions will help a great deal in driving economic diversification and competition.\n\nPlayers in the country\u2019s gas sector are of the view that there is no better time to optimise the potential of the gas resources than now that the whole world is struggling to survive the impact of coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTo them, the pandemic and its attendant economic turmoil has presented an opportunity for the country to look inward by prioritising in-country utilisation of the abundant gas resources. They believe there should be increased attention to the development of gas infrastructure in Nigeria and the deepening of domestic consumption and utilisation of the commodity in order to boost the country\u2019s economic development.\n\nHowever, despite the abundant gas potential, Nigeria still struggles to develop and grow its economy, a situation that makes jest of the country at the international front.\n\n\u201cNigeria does represent quite an interesting paradox. We are major resource holders, major exporter of gas, at the same time we struggle on the domestic front with de-industrialization, with unmet domestic gas demand and insufficiency in gas supply to the power sector for power generation,\u201d President of the Nigerian Gas Association (NGA), Mrs Audrey Joe-Ezigbo, once said.\n\nCBN to the rescue\n\nIn order to make Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) the fuel of choice for transportation and LPG the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, captive power and small industrial complexes, the federal government introduced the National Gas Expansion Programme (NGEP). Under the NGEP, the CBN is providing N250 billion loan to help stimulate investment in the gas value chain as part of its efforts to stimulate finance to critical sectors of the economy.\n\nIn a guideline titled \u2018Framework for the implementation of intervention facility for the national gas expansion programme\u2019, CBN set N10bn as the maximum loan an obligor can access under its N250bn intervention fund for the gas sector.\n\nPart of the term loan conditions for manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, was that the term loan, \u201cShall be determined based on the activity and shall not exceed N10bn per obligor. Working capital is maximum of N500m per obligor.\u201d\n\nIt said the objectives of the facility included improved access to finance for private sector investments in the domestic gas value chain; and also to stimulate investments in the development of infrastructure to optimise the domestic gas resources for economic development.\n\nThe facility, the apex bank said, also aimed to fast-track the adoption of CNG as the fuel of choice for transportation and power generation, as well as LPG as the fuel of choice for domestic cooking, transportation and captive power.\n\nIt would also fast-track the development of gas-based industries particularly petrochemical (fertilizer, methanol, etc) to support large industries, such as agriculture, textile, and related industries; provide leverage for additional private sector investments in the domestic gas market; and boost employment across the country.\n\nEligible activities under the intervention include establishment of gas processing plants and small-scale petrochemical plants; establishment of gas cylinder manufacturing plants; establishment of L-CNG regasification modular systems; and establishment of auto gas conversion kits or components manufacturing plants.\n\nOthers are establishment of CNG primary and secondary compression stations; establishment and manufacturing of LPG retail skid tanks and refilling equipment; development/enhancement of auto gas transportation systems, conversion and distribution infrastructure; and enhancement of domestic cylinder production and distribution by cylinder manufacturing plants and LPG wholesale outlets.\n\nIt also involves the establishment/expansion of micro distribution outlets and service centres for LPG sales, domestic cylinder injection and exchange; and any other mid to downstream gas value chain related activity recommended by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.\n\n\u201cThe intervention fund by CBN is a welcome development because it will not only support in deepening the consumption of gas but will help ameliorate sicknesses caused by the use of firewood,\u201d an economic analyst with interest in public health, Mr. Bath Onwuachu, told our correspondent.\n\nHe urged operators in the gas industry to take advantage of the fund to further expand the sector and increase the penetration of gas consumption. According to Onwuachu, deepening of gas usage would reduce the rate of deforestation, a development that would impact positively on the environment.\n\nMr. Lambert Ojo, a gas processing and evaporative cooling specialist, believes the intervention for local investors in the gas sector would stimulate the economy. He, however, called for a transparent and seamless process when obtaining the facility from the apex bank in order to encourage industry players.\n\n\u201cWe have enough to do in the domestic gas space. What is happening internationally in the near future should not affect us because there\u2019s a lot we can do with our resource,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, the Executive Secretary, Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF), Ahmed Bobboi, stated that PEF was aligning with the CBN and the federal government to further deepen the consumption of gas in Nigeria. He said to achieve this, the agency was planning to equalise gas price so as to ensure that more citizens had access to gas.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are trying to introduce the bridging scheme to gas because government has declared this year till 2030 as a decade of gas.\n\n\u201cAnd we say if this (petrol price equalisation) is working for the economy for over 45 years now effectively, if we can extend the practice to gas we believe that it will add value to the economy in so many ways in the value chain.\u201d",

          "text": "Two persons were reportedly shot and injured on Saturday after residents of a community, recently attacked by bandits, blocked the convoy of Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State while protesting against insecurity in the state.\n\nThe protest followed the killing of 88 persons by bandits in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area of the state on Thursday.\n\nResidents said a vehicle attached to the governor\u2019s convoy was burnt by the protesters after shots fired by security agents to disperse the crowd hit two persons. The two men were said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in the state, Premium Times reported.\n\nMr Bagudu was in the council area on Saturday to condole with the people over the killings. However, some residents burnt used tyres on the streets, booed the governor and attacked his convoy over his alleged poor handling of security challenges in the areas.\n\nThe Emir of Zuru, Muhammadu Sani-Sami, who confirmed the incident in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, said the governor was in the area to sympathise with the residents, following the bandits\u2019 attack, when the incident happened.\n\nThe governor usually visits and sympathise with residents whenever such things happened and promised to bring an end to such attacks but they keep on reoccurring, the emir said.\n\n\u201cBut the youth this time came out en masse and showed their grievances, maybe because they did not see any change, despite the repeated promise to stop the attacks,\u201d the traditional ruler said.\n\nMr Sani-Sami, however, said the governments was doing its best to forestall the attacks but noted that security agents in the area do not have the numbers to stop the bandits.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday when he paid a condolence visit to the affected communities, the governor regretted the nefarious acts of banditry in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is really unfortunate that these obnoxious and deadly attacks occurred after the area had been quiet and peaceful.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow this vicious cycle to continue, as such, all hands must be on deck to provide plausible solutions to the problem,\u201d Mr Sarki quoted his governor saying in the statement.\n\nThe governor also admonished the people to regard the tragic incident as an act of the Almighty Allah and urged the residents to pray for God\u2019s intervention.\n\nThe governor also urged vigilante groups in the area to collaborate with the security agencies, traditional rulers and the various communities, to ensure the success of their activities.\n\nIn his remark, the village head of Gaya, one of the attacked communities, Ahmad Ubandoma, narrated how the attacks happened and urged the governor to facilitate the deployment of more security personnel in the area.\n\nDanko-Wasagu, like Sakaba LGA where bandits killed nine police officers in April, shares boundary with Zamfara and Niger states.\n\nAt least 88 people were killed by bandits in attacks on some communities in Danko-Wasagu Local Government Area.\n\nSome of the affected communities are Koro, Kimpi, Gaya, Dimi, Zutu, Rafin Gora and Iguenge, all of which are described as difficult to access from Kebbi State.\n\nThe governor, following the incidents, urged residents to be optimistic about the security situation in their area. He said passing blame will not solve the problems and pledged to take more pungent measures against the bandits.\n\n\u201cWe should note that passing blame will not solve the problem. What is required (is) mutual trust and respect for all,\u201d the governor\u2019s spokesperson, Yahaya Sarki, said in a statement.\n\nMr Sarki was, however, silent on the violent protest in the affected areas.\n\nCredit: Premium Times",

Even if it means sacrificing my people, none of them will return alive.\u201d On Twitter, the IPOB commander has almost 300,000 followers.\n\nThe Buhari administration has since been chastised for allegedly restricting freedom of expression.

          "text": "A 35-year-old woman, Oluwadamilare Aremu, has accused the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital of negligence leading to the amputation of her right leg.\n\nAremu told PUNCH Metro that she was admitted to LASUTH in December 2018 when an 18-passenger vehicle she boarded was involved in a crash on the Third Mainland Bridge, leading to her suffering a broken thighbone.\n\nShe alleged that doctors at LASUTH assured her that she would walk again, but her hope was dashed after two surgeries with the doctors still demanding funds for a third and final surgery, which they claimed would solve the problem.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was discharged on July 8, 2019, to go and find the money for the third surgery, adding that she was already broke as a result of the bills she had to pay while on admission.\n\nAremu stated, \u201cI was involved in an accident and rushed to LASUTH on December 16, 2018. LASUTH doctors told me that I would walk again. But after two surgeries in 2019, I was told that I needed a third and last one. They sent me home to find money, but I was broke because I had spent over N4m while on admission.\n\n\u201cThey assured me that after the third surgery, I would be able to walk again. A social media blog, Gistlover, helped me crowdfund over N1m for the last surgery. I got the money in a week and returned to the hospital for the last surgery.\u201d\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she was readmitted to the Ortho \u2018A\u2019 ward of the Bola Ahmed Tinubu orthopaedic section of the hospital, adding that despite having severe pain, LASUTH allegedly kept postponing the surgery.\n\nShe also alleged that she was later moved to the Ortho \u2018B\u2019 ward under the supervision of one Dr Kayode, who was to conduct the third surgery. But no surgery was performed from 2019 till 2020.\n\nAremu said she sought alternative medical help at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, in October 2020, adding that she was advised that the leg would have to be amputated.\n\n\u201cLASUTH readmitted me and kept postponing my surgery from 2019 till October 2020 on COVID-19 excuses. I took a COVID-19 test and it was negative. I was still passing through a lot of pain. I went to Igbobi because LASUTH stopped attending to me. Igbobi told me that amputation was the only solution left because my leg had been mismanaged. But I would have to wait till 2021 because of the queue for amputation surgery. LASUTH didn\u2019t tell me the truth from the outset,\u201d Aremu lamented.\n\nShe told PUNCH Metro that she attempted to poison herself when the pain became unbearable, adding that she opted to amputate the leg at the Oak Hospital, Ikeja.\n\nShe also alleged that one of her doctors at LASUTH was a consultant at Oak Hospital.\n\nShe stated, \u201cI opted to have the leg amputated at Oak Hospital, Ikeja. The pain was so much that I once tried to commit suicide. Oak Hospital couldn\u2019t remove the iron that LASUTH inserted in my leg, so they called a consultant to come. It was Dr Afariogun of LASUTH, who came.\n\n\u201cHe was surprised to see me. Afariogun told me that he couldn\u2019t tell me the truth, because he was afraid of his seniors at LASUTH. Dr Soga, Dr Afariogun and Dr Ajiboye were the three doctors, who attended to me at the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe victim told our correspondent that she was still in pain despite the amputation of the leg and lamented that LASUTH wasted her money and rendered her immobile.\n\n\u201cEven after the amputation surgery, the damage LASUTH did to my leg could not be undone. My left leg is weak and I keep falling each time I try to stand. I have to walk with a frame. LASUTH wasted my money and still damaged my leg. I want justice and proper compensation.\u201d\n\nWhen PUNCH Metro contacted the Chief Medical Director of LASUTH, Prof Tokunbo Fabanwo, he said investigation into the case had begun.\n\n\u201cWe are already investigating it.

          "text": "By K\u1ecd\u0301la\u0301 Tu\u0301b\u1ecd\u0300su\u0301n\n\nNigeria has slipped back to dictatorship\n\nIt was already clear when dozens of protesters were shot in October 2020 for demanding a change to the behaviour of heavy-handed security agencies. But it has become even clearer. President Muhammadu Buhari, formerly the military dictator of the country from 1984-85, used threatening language on Twitter last week in response to agitations in the southeastern part of the country. The tweet in question, a threat to use \u201cthe language they will understand\u201d against civilian protesters, was deleted shortly afterward by Twitter for violating its policies. Two days later, the government announced an indefinite ban on Twitter, because its actions in the country were \u201ccapable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d As of today, millions of citizens can only access the social media platform through VPNs.\n\nThe real reason for the ban, of course, is to silence a citizenry that found, through social media, an unfettered speech and a way to hold the leadership accountable through screenshots, quote tweets, replies, satire, mockery, and humour. This has not gone down well with their political leaders who consider it an affront to the old ways of ruling, as Minister of Information Lai Mohammed accidentally implied during the week. \u201cBooks and all forms of writing have always been objects of terror to those who seek to suppress truth,\u201d as Wole Soyinka once wrote.\n\nThe surprising efficiency of the ban\u2014most telecommunications providers quickly complied, even though the policy was not passed through legislation and could be subject to court litigation on the basis of free speech\u2014illustrates the priorities of an administration that has spent the last couple of weeks weakly upbraiding kidnappers and bandits ravaging the country. As I write this, there\u2019s news of another extrajudicial murder in a community in Oyo state. As with the other murders or kidnappings, the government will not respond with efficiency. It appears that only when it concerns silencing citizens\u2019 rights to protest and demand better that the government gets its mojo. For everything else, we citizens are on our own.\n\nBut social media in Nigeria, especially for the young people who populate it, isn\u2019t just about political expression. Many people use it to promote their business, sell their wares, express personal social or religious opinions, read and share the news, including of crimes in progress or road traffic, make friends, find mates, advocate for causes, including recently finding the culprit in a recent kidnapping, or just share news often not covered by mainstream media. Even government officials use it to offer opinions and weigh in on issues, and some of them complained in April when Twitter announced that its first office in West Africa would be in Ghana and not Nigeria.\n\nSo the ban has been met, naturally, with rebellion; with citizens rushing to find ways to bypass it and continue to hold the government accountable through the medium of 280 characters. In response, the attorney general of the federation instructed law enforcement officers to begin prosecuting people who \u201cviolate\u201d the Twitter ban. It is still unclear how this violation will be measured, or under what laws the culprits will be punished. But it points to more disturbing days ahead.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here before. This is not the first overwrought response to citizen agitation in Nigeria. Late last year, after the #EndSARS protests in October 2020, protesters were shot dead, and others were wounded, people\u2019s names were placed on no-fly-lists, and many citizens were arrested on charges relating to \u201cdisturbance of the peace.\u201d None of these comes from legislative action as the national assembly has become a limp appendage of the executive. Even the opposition party has remained quiet in the face of the many violations of human rights. So far, only one state governor has objected to the Twitter ban. And since the national judiciary is currently on an industrial strike, there is no government agency to turn to if things continue to get worse, as they certainly will.\n\nPeople familiar with Buhari\u2019s antecedents as a military dictator will also find these actions match his past draconian reputation, successfully disguised during the last two elections that brought and kept him in office. No longer encumbered by elections\u2014he doesn\u2019t have to run again\u2014the next two years of Buhari\u2019s rule will come with hardship, and tremendous damage to the rule of law. This, if the trend doesn\u2019t lead to a total shutdown of the internet for the purpose of illegally extending his rule, will only have been the foreshadowing.\n\nAmericans will also be very familiar with this behaviour. Former U.S. President Donald Trump was suspended by Twitter and other social media platforms for his role in the January insurrection, and he hasn\u2019t been let back in. In Buhari\u2019s case, only one of his tweets was deleted\u2014a transcript of an earlier remark he made seemingly threatening violence on citizens. Yet, in spite of Trump\u2019s interest in muzzling social media after initial warnings, the American system thrived. Trump got a two-year ban.\n\n*First published in Foreign Policy Magazine",

          "text": "The federal government has said the operations of Twitter in Nigeria will be restored only when \u201cresponsible communication\u201d can be assured on the platform.\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs Geoffrey Onyeama made the position known after a meeting with some envoys Monday in Abuja.\n\nTwitter had deleted a controversial civil war tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari saying it went against their rules.\n\nConsequently, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension of Twitter in the country, citing the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate interest\u201d.\n\nThough mobile operators have blocked their customers in the country from using Twitter, many Nigerians adopted the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to access the platform.\n\nOnyeama on condition\n\nSpeaking on how the Twitter service could be restored in the country, the foreign affairs minister, Mr Onyeama said while there is no definite timeline for this, \u201cthe condition (for lifting the suspension) would be responsible use of social media and that really has to be it. When you have the power to communicate, it has to come with responsibilities.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that Twitter is threatening the country or any such thing; why we have taken this measure is to stop them from being used as platforms for destabilisation and facilitation of criminality or encouragement of criminalities,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe added that this decision was key to maintaining security in the country, because \u201cwithout security, everything else fails. We will all be losers. What we do today will define the future of the country.\u201d\n\nThe federal government had Friday suspended the operations of Twitter in the country after the social media platform deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari which it deemed as inciting violence.\n\nThe government claimed that the suspension of Twitter was to protect the sovereignty of the country, but digital rights advocates said it was censorship.\n\nDespite public outcry and international condemnations, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) doubled down on the crackdown saying violators of the directive risked being charged to court.\n\nWhile he could not cite the law which these alleged defaulters would be breaching, the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation would later direct television and radio stations to deactivate their Twitter handles.\n\nAmid this, the envoys of the U.S., UK, Canada and the European Union, issued a joint statement to condemn the Nigerian government\u2019s crackdown on Twitter, prompting the government to summon the envoys for a behind-closed-door parley.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, Mr Onyeama said the Buhari administration was committed to protecting the lives and properties of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNigerian lives matter and we have to do everything we can to preserve Nigerian lives. And when we feel our goals are threatened, actions need to be taken.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to see to what extent this media can be a force of good and not for the facilitation of criminalities or the destabilization of the country. We can disagree, but Nigerians\u2019 lives matter.\n\n\u201cDifferences of opinion is not a problem; everybody will not think alike,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we want to use social media for good. There is a lot of good that can come out of communication today. Part of the conversation will be how to use them for global good,\u201d the minister further added.\n\nAsked if the government was seeking Chinese advice on how to place a firewall around the internet in the country, the minister said, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any meeting with the Chinese authorities in respect of social media.\u201d\n\nNBC threatens sanction\n\nMeanwhile, the NBC has directed all broadcast stations in the country still using the Twitter platform after its ban by the federal government to suspend the use of the platform with immediate effect.\n\nThe Commission maintained that its decision followed the suspension of Twitter operations in the country over the persistent use of the platform for activities that were capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nActing NBC Director-General Prof. Armstrong Idachaba gave the directive in a statement issued Monday in Abuja.\n\nIn the statement titled \u201cSuspend Twitter handles\u201d, NBC directed the broadcast stations to un-install their Twitter handles and desist from using the platform as a source of information gathering for news, and programmes presentation especially the phone-in programmes.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cConsequent on the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria by the Federal Government over the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining the corporate existence of Nigeria, the National Broadcasting Commission directs all Broadcasting Stations in Nigeria to suspend the patronage of Twitter immediately.\n\n\u201cIn Compliance to the above directive, Broadcasting Stations are hereby advised to de-install Twitter handles and desist from using Twitter as a source (UGC) of information gathering for News and programmes Presentation especially phone-in.\n\n\u201cSection 2(1) r of the NBC Act entrusts the Commission with responsibility to ensure strict adherence to the national laws, rules, and regulations. Also, Section 3.11.2 of the Nigeria Broadcasting Code provides that \u201cthe broadcaster shall ensure that law enforcement is upheld at all times in a matter depicting that law and order are socially superior to or more desirable than crime and anarchy.\n\n\u201cAttention is also drawn to section 5.6.3 of The Code which requires Broadcasters to be mindful of materials that may cause disaffection, incite to panic or rift in the society in the use of a user-generated content (UGC).\n\n\u201cNote that it will be unpatriotic for any broadcaster in Nigeria to continue to patronise the suspended Twitter as a source of its information therefore strict compliance is enjoined.\u201d\n\nEnvoys summoned\n\nIn a relateddevelopment,the federal government has invited the envoys of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union in Nigeria, over their recent comments on the suspension of the operations of the social media platform, Twitter, in the country.\n\nThis was made known in an invitation to journalists issued Monday morning by the Crisis Monitoring and Public Communications Division of the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and signed by Kimiebi Ebienfa.\n\nThe invitation reads: \u201cI am directed to inform that following the recent ban on Twitter by the Federal Government and Press Statement issued by some Heads of Diplomatic Missions Accredited to Nigeria on the subject matter, the Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs, His Excellency, Geoffrey Onyeama has invited the affected Ambassadors to a meeting today at noon.\n\n\u201cThe venue is Minister\u2019s Conference Room, 8th Floor.\n\n\u201cYou are hereby invited to cover the meeting. Thanks for your usual cooperation.\u201d\n\nThe envoys were reported to have condemned the suspension in a joint statement, citing an infringement of the citizens\u2019 rights to freedom of expression.\n\nRCCG takes exception\n\nMeanwhile, an influential Nigerian Christian cleric, Mr Enoch Adeboye, has said tweets by his church were in accordance with the United Nations declaration on human rights, irrespective of the controversial ban on Twitter by the Nigerian government.\n\nAdeboye\u2019s church, the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), has millions of followers across Nigeria and globally.\n\n\u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 Nations & Territories. The tweets here are in accordance to Article 19 of the UN universal declaration of Human Rights,\u201d he wrote via his official Twitter account Monday.\n\nAdeboye was reacting to allegations that he was flouting the order of the federal government suspending the use of the microblogging platform, Twitter.\n\nSimilarly, theGeneral Overseer, Deeper Christian Life Ministries, Pastor William Kumuyi has ignored the ban as he tweeted that content wouldn\u2019t stop being posted on the handle as it targets a global audience via his social media handle. He also noted that they share content from any of the location their churches were situated around the world.\n\n\u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than 5 continents and over 100 Nations and we share the content from any of these locations,\u201d the cleric wrote.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has asked the federal government not to stop at anything that could avert another civil war in the country.\n\nNigeria had its first and only civil war between 1966 and 1970 during which the Eastern Region, mainly peopled by Igbo, attempted a secession from the then federal government led by Gen. Yakubu Gowon (retd).\n\nThere were attendant losses after the war, particularly on the side of the secessionists who wanted a Biafran Republic under Odumegwu Ojukwu, then a Colonel in the Nigerian Army.\n\nHowever, a truce was reached at Aburi, Ghana, during which the warring parties agreed to sheathe their sword and declared a \u2018no victor no vanquished\u2019 position with the 3Rs of Reconciliation, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation.\n\nFresh threat\n\nBut addressing select journalists at the end of its meeting Monday in Abuja on the fresh threat from the South-east, NEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said the South-east political leaders are even afraid of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN), hence cannot curb insecurity in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum has reviewed events and tendencies, which suggest that the country is headed for more crises. Nigerians live in fear of violence today and in fear of uncertain future. The capacity of the Nigerian State to secure citizens, protect the country\u2019s territorial integrity and resist violent assaults on our unity is weakening to the levels of making threats that have no impact.\n\n\u201cArmed criminals of all types have increased their audacious stranglehold over our lives in all parts of the country. Irredentists are increasingly asserting their influence over in the South East and some parts of the country, and in the manner that millions of Nigerians now live. Rhetorics from political leaders and ethnic champions who speak in threats and demands routinely suggest that the sentiments in support of irredentism are becoming more widespread.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians are paying the price of failure of two sets of leaders. At the national level, the administration appears to have lost the capacity to halt the gradual descent of the country into anarchy. Political leaders in the South East appear to have submitted to violence and terror of IPOB and ESN. Muted voices of millions of Igbo cannot be heard so that fellow Nigerians could understand the degree to which secession by the Igbo represents the popular choice.\n\n\u201cThis nation has had to fight a terrible war to preserve the country. The North had paid its dues in that war, as indeed it did in many ways throughout the history of the country. Under our current circumstances, no Nigerian should welcome another war to keep the country together. The North in particular has more than enough challenges, and we recognize that violent secession by any part of Nigeria will compound the problems all Nigerians live with.\n\n\u201cThe Forum has arrived at the difficult conclusion that if support for secession among the Igbo is as widespread as it is being made to look, and Igbo leadership appears to be in support of it, then the country should be advised not stand in its way. It will not be the best choice for the Igbo or Nigerians to leave a country we have all toiled to build and a country we all have responsibility to fix, but it will not help a country already burdened with failures on its knees to fight another war to keep the Igbo in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Forum insists that attacks and killings of Northerners and Federal Government employees and destruction of National assets must stop. Those who have been involved in it must be arrested and prosecuted. Until the Igbo decide whether it wants to secede or remain part of Nigeria, the law applies to it, and Federal and State Governors who have responsibility to enforce the law and protect citizens must enforce it.\n\n\u201cWe support calls for Northerners who are exposed to harassment and violence to consider relocating to the North. Unlike the postures and complacency of the leaders of the South East, we advise that all Igbo and other ethnic groups from the South residing in the North should be accorded the usual hospitality and security.\n\n\u201cThe Forum believes that it is vital to address amendments to the constitution and achieve major changes in the structure and operations of our Federal system now. Members of the National Assembly elected by Nigerians have lost touch with the people they are supposed to represent. This explains the major distances which exist between the people and the vital national institution which should play a major role mitigating national crises.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should explore additional avenues for tapping into opinions that can help redress serious limitations to the Federal system before the 2023 elections. The North is willing to discuss all matters related to constitutional amendments/ restructuring with the leadership of the country and other groups who see their presence in the future of Nigeria,\u201d NEF added.\n\nUmahi resigns\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of the South East Security Committee, codenamed, Ebubeagu, Major-General Obi Abel Umahi (rtd) has resigned his position.\n\nUmahi tendered his resignation in a letter dated June 4, 2021, entitled: \u201cResignation as Chairman South East Security Committee \u2013 Ebubeagu\u201d and addressed to chairman of the South-East Governors Forum.\n\nIn the letter also copied to President General Ohanaeze Ndigbo Ambassador George Obiozor, Umahi said since the formation of the security outfit, the southeast governors had stifled it of funds and without providing it with an office space.\n\nPart of the letter reads: \u201cSince this Security Committee was formed, we deliberated and agreed on ways to raise security consciousness down to the community level in Igbo land, mode of operations, logistics and some types of equipment required, such as drones, vehicles etc. We also crafted the Concept of SE Security.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, I chaired a 21-man Committee set up to draft a legal framework for the SE Security outfit. The committee was composed of members of SE Security committee, the Attorney generals of the five Southeast states and some prominent Igbo sons and daughters. The 21-man Legal Framework Committee was funded to completion by the Governor of Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cOn 11th April, 2021, SE Governors announced the formation of EBUBEAGU at Owerri. Subsequently, the draft legal framework produced by the 21-man Committee was reviewed by SE Security Committee members and the Attorney Generals of the five Se States to suit South East Ebubeagu Security outfit.\n\n\u201cThe SE Security Committee thoroughly prepared and submitted the modalities, including the structure, for the take-off of EBUBEAGU to the Governors\u2019 Forum during the security of South East Governors\u2019 Forum, attended by the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide and some other Igbo leaders presented a request that Ebubeagu should be jointly rolled out as a matter of urgency and also funded by the Government of the five SE States. From inception to date, SE Security Committee was never funded at all in any capacity and not even an office space was provided.\n\n\u201cI respectfully request that Your Excellencies kindly permit me to resign my appointment as the chairman, SE Security Committee in the spirit of my love to serve Ndigbo, I can assure you that I will always be available to advice on the success of Ebubeagu at no cost, just as I served as the Chairman of South East Security Committee from 31 August, 2019 till date at no cost directly or indirectly to the five South East State Government, groups and individual. I highly appreciate Your Excellencies for the opportunity you gave me to serve Ndigbo.\u201d\n\nUmahi, who confirmed his resignation to journalists on telephone said, \u201cPlease be assured of my loyalty, respect and accept my highest regards of your esteemed considerations.\u201d",

I have been a leader in Onitsha main market for 10 years. Within the 10 years of my reign, I brought a change that cannot be erase in 100 years going forward.

There have been absolute peace in Anambra state. Until a good leader gets to power. There will be a drastic change towards that agitation. If you read my manifesto, I am going to single Anambra out to become the industrial hub of Africa.

I have been to Israel about three times, I have been to Ethiopia with outstanding agricultural records. We are going to employ the best brains. In all my companies, I have always partner with the best companies in the world. Why people failed in agriculture is because they dont look for those with the pedigree. People with the records and experience to manage their entities. And that is why they failed.\u201d",

Lukman, the Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) which will take place Friday, June I l , 2021.\n\nIn a statement issued by Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu on behalf of the Organising Committee, the book is a contribution to APC\u2019s quest to bolster its democratic credentials towards engendering political stability, best practice, and good governance in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Onilu, the book captures the distinctive progressive ethos and political worldview of APC as a bastion for national renaissance exemplified by patriotism and adherence to the rules of political engagements, and moral rectitude.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no better time to put this book together as APC grapples with the nitty-gritty of formative challenges. This is coming at a period when APC leaders availed members of the Nigerian progressive family the opportunity to relaunch the party more surefootedly as Nigeria\u2019s best vehicle to save Nigeria from the nagging socio-political uncertainties.\n\n\u201cThe book contains submissions that speak directly to the existential challenges the APC is facing; it illustrates the collective desire for enduring and firmly rooted democratic practices anchored on the overarching requirement for unity of all party leaders; it examines the hurdles that the APC is facing in its nascent democratic journey and cut open the underbelly of the numerous drawbacks in the leadership that it currently offer the nation through the political instruments it is deploying as a party.\n\n\u201cThis book is an essential intervention at this critical turn as APC leaders and members embark on the important task of putting in place new leadership structures at all levels and in underlying what the future bodes for the party in terms of laying a solid foundation for healthy contestations among varying interests and political players.\n\n\u201cAPC\u2019s Litmus Tests is therefore, more than just a book. It is more of a workbook, standing at the intersection between the difficult past and the promising future. Its main agenda is to assist APC leaders and, indeed, all stakeholders in negotiating the next bend.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR will be the Special Guest of Honour. The Vice President Prof. Yemi Osibanjo GCON will be the Chief Guest of Honour and Chairman of occasion.\n\n\u201cHis Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, APC Chairman, will be the host.

Femi Gbajabiamila, Secretary to Government of the Federation Mr. Boss Mustapha, Progressive Governors led by His Excellency, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, Ministers, APC Senators and members of the House of the Party, members of the House of Representatives will be the Guests of Honour.\n\n\u201cAPC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will be the Father of the day. Her Excellency, Ambassador Fatima Balla will be the Mother of the day. Prof. Adebayo O. Olukoshi, Professor of Politics and Director for Africa and Asia will present the Keynote Address. The book will be reviewed by His Excellency, Hope Uzodinma, Governor of Imo State and His Excellency, Nasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to commission the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail later this week, an APC support group has stated.\n\nAccording to the group, the rail line is the first double-track Standard Gauge Rail project in West Africa, and the first Standard Gauge Rail project in Nigeria to be started and completed by the same administration.\n\nThe group, under the auspices of APC Legacy Awareness & Campaign, APC-LAC, emphasized that this landmark commissioning is taking place nine months after the president commissioned the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail , completed by his administration 33 years after construction began, adding that the 168km Abuja-Kaduna Rail project, and the 42.5km Abuja Light Rail project, both inherited from previous administrations, were completed in 2016 and 2018 respectively.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by four notable APC chieftains, Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi and Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, the support group maintained that the second Niger Bridge, originally conceived decades ago, is now more than 50 percent completed, and scheduled for commissioning in 2022, as is the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, which has defied every administration since 1999.\n\nAPC-LAC further stated that other landmark projects being completed include the Bodo-Bonny Road in Rivers State, Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki Expressway, Loko-Oweto Bridge connecting Benue and Nasarawa States across the River Benue, Port Harcourt-Enugu Expressway, East-West Road (across Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa-Ibom and Cross River States), the new Ikom Bridge in Cross River, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway, Keffi-Akwanga-Lafia-Makurdi Road, and many more.\n\nThe group emphasized that President Buhari remained committed to building the infrastructure that will drive Nigeria\u2019s growth and prosperity.\n\nThey maintained that more road and rail infrastructures are being built and/or completed since President Buhari assumed office in 2015, than in the sixteen years between 1999 and 2015.\n\nThey also boasted that President Buhari has fulfilled his promised on delivery of good infrastructure for the opening up of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cFrom the start, President Buhari promised to complete as many abandoned projects as possible, and he has worked hard to fulfil this promise. His administration has committed more resources to Infrastructure than any other administration since 1999. It is no coincidence that the last time Nigeria saw an infrastructure revolution on this scale was during the period, in the late 1990s, when the President ran the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF).\n\n\u201cBeyond the focus on completing inherited and abandoned projects, the Buhari Administration has creatively unlocked public and private sector financing for infrastructure in Nigeria, through such initiatives as the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), the Highway Development Management Initiative (HDMI), the Sovereign Sukuk Bonds (that have collectively raised close to a billion dollars), and the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme. Between them these initiatives cover thousands of kilometres of critical roads and will mobilize several billions of dollars in public and private financing.\n\n\u201cNew International Airport Terminals have been completed and commissioned in Abuja and Port Harcourt, while those in Lagos and Kano are being completed. In addition, brand new Runways have been constructed in Abuja and Enugu, in 2017 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cOff-grid solar and gas electrification programmes are being rolled out for homes, markets, educational institutions (Federal Universities, Unity Schools, Primary Healthcare Centers); and a National Mass Metering Programme launched in 2020 will deliver 6 million new electricity meters nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe Administration is also enabling and supporting the private sector to invest in critical infrastructure. Finally, a brand new Deep Sea Port is being constructed, in Lagos, the first new Deep Sea Port in the country in more than four decades; while ground-breaking for a second private-sector-funded Deep Sea Port (in Bonny) took place in March 2021.\n\n\u201cWith a diverse mix of financing options in place, the Buhari Administration has broken Nigeria\u2019s decades-old infrastructure development jinx and set new standards for future administrations to build upon,\u201d the group stated.",

          "text": "Police arrested more than 800 people worldwide in a huge global sting involving encrypted phones that were secretly planted by the FBI, law enforcement agencies said Tuesday.\n\nCops in 16 countries were able to read the messages of global underworld figures as they plotted drug deals, arms transfers and gangland hits on the compromised ANOM devices.\n\nMafia groups, Asian crime syndicates, motorcycle gangs and other organised crime syndicates around the world were all monitored using the spiked phones as part of Operation \u201cTrojan Shield\u201d.\n\nThe sting, jointly conceived by Australia and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, prevented around 100 murders, foiled several large-scale narcotics shipments and led to seizures of weapons and cash, they added.\n\n\u201cThe results are staggering,\u201d FBI Assistant Director Calvin Shivers told reporters at the headquarters of the EU\u2019s police agency Europol HQ in The Netherlands.\n\nShivers said the FBI had provided criminal syndicates in over 100 countries with the devices over the last 18 months \u201cthat allowed us to monitor their communications\u201d.\n\nEuropol hailed the \u201cexceptional\u201d operation, which saw around 12,000 of the ANOM devices distributed worldwide to criminals who thought they were chatting in secret.\n\n\u201cThis information led over the last week to hundreds of law enforcement operations on a global scale from New Zealand to Australia to Europe and the USA, with impressive results,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Lecouffe, Deputy Director Operations at Europol.\n\n\u201cMore than 800 arrests, more than 700 locations searched, more than eight tonnes of cocaine.\u201d\n\nPolice also seized 22 tonnes of cannabis, two tonnes of methamphetamine, 250 firearms, 55 luxury vehicles and over $48 million (39 million euros) in various currencies and cryptocurrencies, Europol said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Heavy blow\u2019 \u2013\n\nAustralian police said the supposedly hardened encrypted devices were handed out to operatives within the mafia, Asian crime syndicates, drug cartels and outlaw motorcycle gangs as part of the elaborate FBI-led plot.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday had \u201cstruck a heavy blow against organised crime \u2014 not just in this country, but one that will echo around organised crime around the world\u201d.\n\nThe operation began after global police work in the past two years disrupted two other major encrypted phone networks used by criminals, Encrochat and SkyGlobal.\n\n\u201cThe closure of those two encrypted communication platforms created a significant void in the encrypted communication market,\u201d said New Zealand police.\n\nTo fill the void, \u201cthe FBI operated its own encrypted device company, called \u2018ANOM'\u201d, the New Zealand police added.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Shivers said this enabled them to \u201cturn the tables\u201d on criminals.\n\n\u201cWe were actually able to see photographs of hundreds of tonnes of cocaine that were concealed in shipments of fruit, we were able to see hundreds of kilos of cocaine that were concealed in canned goods,\u201d Shivers said.\n\nShowing the massive global scale of the sting, Australia said more than 200 people had been charged already.\n\nSweden said it had arrested 155 people, Germany detained 70 suspects, the Netherlands 49, and New Zealand 35 as a result of the operation.\n\nMost of the 27 million ANOM messages obtained by the sting were in Dutch, German and Swedish, Dutch police said.\n\n\u201cCriminals assumed that the service was safe and touted it among themselves as the platform you should use, because it would be absolutely reliable. Nothing could have been further from the truth,\u201d Dutch police said in a statement.\n\n\u2013 \u2018They came to us\u2019 \u2013\n\nAccording to unsealed court documents, the FBI worked with insiders to develop and distribute ANOM devices through the Phantom Secure network of existing criminal customers, unloading 50 \u2014 mostly to Australia \u2014 as a \u201cbeta test\u201d.\n\nThe devices are said to have had no email, call or GPS services and could only message other ANOM phones.\n\nThey could only be bought on the black market \u2014 for around $2,000 \u2014 and required a code from an existing user to access.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t hand them out, people actually came to us seeking those devices,\u201d Shivers said.\n\nAustralian agencies helped get the phones in the hands of underworld \u201cinfluencers\u201d \u2014 including an Australian fugitive drug boss on the run in Turkey \u2014 in a bid to gain trust.\n\nThe cover appeared to be blown in March 2021 when a blogger detailed ANOM security flaws and claimed it was a scam linked to Australia, the United States and other members of the FiveEyes intelligence sharing network. The post was later deleted.\n\nANOM\u2019s website \u2014 which once offered \u201cmilitary grade\u201d encryption services and devices with special features like \u201clight and dark\u201d display themes \u2014 was unavailable Tuesday, with a message from authorities that the \u201cdomain has been seized\u201d.",

          "title": "FDA Approves Much-debated Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Panned by Experts",
          "text": "Government health officials on Monday approved the first new drug for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in nearly 20 years, disregarding warnings from independent advisers that the much-debated treatment hasn\u2019t been shown to help slow the brain-destroying disease.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the drug from Biogen based on study results showing it seemed \u201creasonably likely\u201d to benefit Alzheimer\u2019s patients. It\u2019s the only therapy that U.S. regulators have said can likely treat the underlying disease, rather than manage symptoms like anxiety and insomnia.\n\nThe decision, which could impact millions of Americans and their families, is certain to spark disagreements among physicians, medical researchers and patient groups. It also has far-reaching implications for the standards used to evaluate experimental therapies, including those that show only incremental benefits.\n\nThe new drug, which Biogen developed with Japan\u2019s Eisai Co., did not reverse mental decline, only slowing it in one study. The medication, aducanumab, will be marketed as Aduhelm and is to be given as an infusion every four weeks.\n\nDr. Caleb Alexander, an FDA adviser who recommended against the drug\u2019s approval, said he was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the decision.\n\n\u201cThe FDA gets the respect that it does because it has regulatory standards that are based on firm evidence. In this case, I think they gave the product a pass,\u201d said Alexander, a medical researcher at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s top drug regulator acknowledged that \u201cresidual uncertainties\u201d surround the drug, but said Aduhelm\u2019s ability to reduce harmful clumps of plaque in the brain is expected to help slow dementia.\n\n\u201cThe data supports patients and caregivers having the choice to use this drug,\u201d Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni told reporters. She said the FDA carefully weighed the input of people living with the \u201cdevastating, debilitating and deadly disease.\u201d\n\nUnder terms of the so-called accelerated approval, the FDA is requiring Biogen to conduct a follow-up study to confirm benefits for patients. If the study fails to show effectiveness, the FDA could pull the drug from the market, though the agency rarely does so.\n\nBiogen said the drug would cost approximately $56,000 for a typical year\u2019s worth of treatment, and said the price would not be raised for four years. Most patients won\u2019t pay anywhere near that thanks to insurance coverage and other discounts. The company said it aims to complete the FDA-mandated follow-up trial by 2030.\n\nBiogen shares jumped 38% in trading Monday on the news, with analysts forecasting billions in future sales. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company plans to begin shipping millions of doses within two weeks.\n\nThe non-profit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which studies drug value, said Biogen\u2019s drug would have to halt dementia entirely to justify its $56,000 per-year price tag.\n\nSome 6 million people in the U.S. and many more worldwide have Alzheimer\u2019s, which gradually attacks areas of the brain needed for memory, reasoning, communication and basic daily tasks. In the final stages of the disease, those afflicted lose the ability to swallow. The global burden of the disease, the most common cause of dementia, is only expected to grow as millions more baby boomers progress further into their 60s and 70s.\n\nAducanumab (pronounced \u201cadd-yoo-CAN-yoo-mab\u201d) helps clear a protein called beta-amyloid from the brain. Other experimental drugs have done that but they made no difference in patients\u2019 ability to think, care for themselves or live independently.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry\u2019s drug pipeline has been littered for years with failed Alzheimer\u2019s treatments. The FDA\u2019s greenlight Monday is likely to revive investments in therapies previously shelved by drugmakers.\n\nThe new medicine is manufactured from living cells and will be given via infusion at a doctor\u2019s office or hospital.\n\nResearchers don\u2019t fully understand what causes Alzheimer\u2019s but there\u2019s broad agreement the brain plaque targeted by aducanumab is just one contributor. Evidence suggests family history, education and chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease may all play a role.\n\n\u201cThis is a sign of hope but not the final answer,\u201d said Dr. Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging, which wasn\u2019t involved in the Biogen studies but funds research into how Alzheimer\u2019s forms. \u201cAmyloid is important but not the only contributing factor.\u201d\n\nPatients taking aducanumab saw their thinking skills decline 22% more slowly than patients taking a placebo.\n\nBut that meant a difference of just 0.39 on an 18-point score of cognitive and functional ability. And it\u2019s unclear how such metrics translate into practical benefits, like greater independence or ability to recall important details.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s review of the drug has become a flashpoint in longstanding debates over standards used to evaluate therapies for hard-to-treat conditions. On one side, groups representing Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families say any new therapy \u2014 even one of small benefit \u2014 warrants approval. But many experts warn that greenlighting the drug could set a dangerous precedent, opening the door to treatments of questionable benefit.\n\nThe approval came despite a scathing assessment in November by the FDA\u2019s outside panel of neurological experts. The group voted \u201cno\u201d to a series of questions on whether reanalyzed data from a single study submitted by Biogen showed the drug was effective.\n\nBiogen halted two studies in 2019 after disappointing results suggested aducanumab would not meet its goal of slowing mental and functional decline in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nSeveral months later, the company reversed course, announcing that a new analysis of one study showed the drug was effective at higher doses and the FDA had advised that it warranted review. Company scientists said the drug\u2019s initial failure was due to some patients not receiving high enough doses to slow the disease.\n\nBut the changes to dosing and the company\u2019s after-the-fact analysis made the results hard to interpret, raising skepticism among many experts, including those on the FDA panel.\n\nThe FDA isn\u2019t required to follow the advice of its outside panelists and has previously disregarded their input when making similarly high-profile drug decisions.\n\nAbout 900 U.S. medical facilities are ready to begin prescribing the drug, according to Biogen, with many more expected in coming months. But key practical questions remain: How long do patients benefit? How do physicians determine when to discontinue the drug? Does the drug have any benefit in patients with more advanced dementia?\n\nWith FDA approval, aducanumab is almost certain to be covered by most insurers, including Medicare, the government plan for seniors that covers more than 60 million people.\n\nInsurers could try to manage the drug\u2019s costs by requiring strict conditions, including brain scans to confirm plaque, before agreeing to cover it.\n\nAdditional scans will be needed to monitor potential side effects. The drug carries a warning about temporary brain swelling that can sometimes cause headaches, confusion and dizziness. Other side effects included allergic reactions, diarrhea and disorientation.\n\nAlthough Biogen studied the drug in people with mild dementia or early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s, the FDA label approved the drug for anyone with Alzheimer\u2019s, a sweeping population given doctors have broad leeway in diagnosing the condition.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is empowering the physician to make the decision on diagnosis,\u201d Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos said in an interview.\n\nFor patients already enrolled in Biogen\u2019s trials, Monday\u2019s announcement means they can continue taking a drug many believe has helped.\n\nPhillip Lynn, 63, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in the spring of 2017 after having trouble with conversation and memory, including forgetting a recent vacation to Hawaii.\n\nHis husband Kurt Rehwinkel says Lynn\u2019s cognitive ability has stabilized since starting on Biogen\u2019s drug more than three years ago. And his performance on short-term memory tests has actually improved, though the couple acknowledges most patients are unlikely to see similar results.\n\n\u201cBut even for those who it has little or no effect, I think hope is a good thing,\u201d said Rehwinkel. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as false hope.\u201d",
          "summary": "Government health officials on Monday approved the first new drug for Alzheimer\u2019s disease in nearly 20 years, disregarding warnings from independent advisers that the much-debated treatment hasn\u2019t been shown to help slow the brain-destroying disease.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approved the drug from Biogen based on study results showing it seemed \u201creasonably likely\u201d to benefit Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\nOther experimental drugs have done that but they made no difference in patients\u2019 ability to think, care for themselves or live independently.\nOn one side, groups representing Alzheimer\u2019s patients and their families say any new therapy \u2014 even one of small benefit \u2014 warrants approval.\nInsurers could try to manage the drug\u2019s costs by requiring strict conditions, including brain scans to confirm plaque, before agreeing to cover it.",

          "text": "Over 30 people were on Sunday killed by suspected Fulani herdsmen in an attack on Odugbeho village in Agatu Local Government Area of Benue State.\n\nAccording to a resident of the community, Mr. Isaac Oche, the death rate could be more as more bodies were being recovered from the bush and other settlements.\n\nThis is coming as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has condemned what he described as the unprovoked daily killings and maiming of Nigerians.\n\nHe stated that the herdsmen invaded their village around 5:45 pm and started shooting sporadically.\n\nAccording to him, the attackers disappeared into the bush around 6:40 pm after the killings.\n\nHe added that when most of them who escaped the attack came back, they discovered 11 bodies at the village centre.\n\nThey also saw other nine bodies on the roadside but couldn\u2019t evacuate them for fear of being attacked.\n\nOche, who spoke to THISDAY late Sunday night, said they believed more bodies would be recovered on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe cannot stay any longer to recover all the dead bodies this night because it is dark and no security. I believe more bodies will be recovered when the day breaks and security agents are around,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the herdsmen were believed to have come from Nasarawa State, through the neighbouring local government of Gwer West in a guerrilla-style, and took them unaware.\n\nHe attributed the high number of casualties to the fact that it was on Sunday and most people were at home.\n\nCorroborating the first eyewitness account, another eyewitness, Iyu Goche, said he was one of the youths that searched and recovered the bodies, adding that the death toll may rise later.\n\nAccording to him, herdsmen from Nasarawa have been invading the riverine areas of Guma, Makurdi and Agatu local government areas, killing many people and displacing thousands of inhabitants.\n\n\u201cThey are currently occupying the deserted villages, denying inhabitants access to their farms in the ongoing cropping season\u201d.\n\nHowever, the Agatu Local Government Chairman, Mr. Sule Adoyi, said 27 bodies had been recovered from the community.\n\nHe said more search was going on, adding that security agents have been informed over the killings.\n\nThe Benue State Police Command confirmed the killing, saying the death toll is yet to be determined.\n\nThe Police Public Relation Officer, Sewuese Anene, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, said: \u201cThe attack is confirmed and the commissioner of police has deployed more police officers to manage the incident and forestall further breakdown of law and order. Number of victims is yet to be ascertained as officers are still engaged in stabilising the area.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku has condemned the daily killings and maiming of Nigerians.\n\nIn a statement yesterday by his media office in Abuja, the former vice president expressed dismay at the level of bloodletting in the country, for which he said, \u201cthere can be no justification.\u201d\n\nAtiku\u2019s reaction was necessitated by last Thursday\u2019s killing of 88 persons in Kebbi State, with many still missing or unaccounted for, in a state that is yet to recover from the boat mishap that claimed the lives of over 100 people.\n\nHe was also reacting to the reported killing of persons in states like Niger and Imo, with the attack on a police station in Delta State; the yesterday\u2019s killing of 22 persons in Igangan in Oyo State with yet, another reported attack that has claimed scores of lives in Zamfara State.\n\nAtiku expressed deep concerns about how far criminals are willing to go, but \u201cmost worryingly, how we, as citizens, can continue to absorb these shocks unabatedly.\u201d\n\nHe expressed concern about the depreciating value of human life in the country.\n\nAtiku stated that all the negative activities have debilitated national development and democracy.\n\nHe added that no nation can witness any meaningful growth in the midst of worsening insecurity.\n\nWhile noting the efforts of the nation\u2019s security agencies in battling criminals, Atiku urged them not to rest on their oars.\n\nHe urged the government and the security agencies to place greater priority on the protection of lives and property of the citizens, \u201cbeing the first line charge of duty to the citizens.\u201d\n\nAtiku acknowledged that the fight against insecurity can be herculean in terms of human and financial resources, but added that \u201cit\u2019s a course that as a nation, we have no choice but to face it headlong.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi",

          "title": "Nigeria Seeks Lower Oil Production Costs, Targets 40bn Barrels Reserve",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday called on the operators of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry to search for more efficient ways of exploiting the commodity to reduce the cost of production per barrel.\n\nHe said at the fourth edition of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS) in Abuja that although Nigeria is observing the trend in the global movement toward renewables, he is optimistic that oil would remain relevant in the coming years.\n\nAccording to him, his administration\u2019s drive for the discovery of more reserves and ramping up oil production is irrevocable.\n\nThe president, represented by the Minister of State for Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, stated that his administration has demonstrated commitment to the overhauling of the oil and gas industry to make it fit for the future.\n\nOther speakers at the event included the Managing Director, Total E&P, Mr Mike Sangster; Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan; Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, and other stakeholders in the industry from other African nations.\n\nBuhari said he had continued to receive updates on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) and expressed the hope that the National Assembly would pass it into law soon.\n\n\u201cThe ambitious goal of ramping up crude oil production to at least four million barrels per day, and building a reserve of 40 billion barrels remains sacrosanct and guiding principle to our overall outlook for the industry, creating a conducive business environment for hydrocarbon industry to thrive is no longer a choice. It is a necessity,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president said the accelerated and unprecedented oil demand disruption and the supply glut that generated the crisis in the global economy had presented both challenges and opportunities.\n\nWhile calling for stringent measures to reduce production cost, Buhari stated that if strategies are not quickly put in place, the country may witness a situation in which expected oil revenues will be wiped out by costs.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, lower cost is critical. Cost is the energy of the future. The industry needs to drive down costs per barrel before it is exterminated by prices falling below production costs, a phenomenon we experienced at the outset of the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that given that about 80 per cent of the global energy mix by 2040 will still be a hydrocarbon, Nigeria cannot turn its back yet on more exploration, as the discovery of new fields remains crucial.\n\nThe president said the industry needed to address short-term opportunities using existing technologies that could extend the life of mature fields, adding that nobody should doubt his commitment in that regard, given the bold move to issue new more marginal field licences recently.\n\nAccording to him, the immediate challenge is that the global agenda for energy transition is slightly taking the backseat of governments across the world, which is now more focused on managing the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on economies than the quest for the energy transition.\n\n\u201cHowever, energy transition is real, renewable technologies are getting cheaper and investors are increasingly conscious of environmental issues and are beginning to turn their back on hydrocarbon investments, but history has shown that human beings have such an appetite for energy, which renewables do not have the capacity to cope with in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cExperts project that about 80 per cent of the world\u2019s energy mix in 2040 will still come from hydrocarbons. Fossil fuels will continue to be the source of dozens of petrochemicals and petrochemical feedstock that companies transform into versatile and valued materials for modern life,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the hydrocarbon industry will still remain a multi-trillion dollar industry in the coming decades, especially for a country with a vast hydrocarbon potential like Nigeria.\n\nIn his remarks, the Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, described cost as \u201ceverything\u201d in the future of the industry.\n\nHe stated that the COVID-19 crisis has shown that only the best of producers will survive because cost control has become a major issue for the industry.\n\nHe, however, added that the corporation and its partners were working together to make sure that it is achieved.\n\nHe mentioned funding as another major issue in the industry today due to the paucity of resources across the globe and overall reluctance by investing companies or banking authorities to divest from oil-related businesses.\n\n\u201cThis is what we have to live with and what we have to contend with. Obviously, the best of the business that will survive are the ones that try to translate into much more climate-friendly businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari added that security remains a major issue for the industry in the country, but assured stakeholders that there is a concerted effort across the industry in the Niger Delta and all other locations to make sure that all the security threats are dealt with.\n\nHe stated that the industry must work together to look at advantages that are inherent in the transition, while moving from fossil fuels to renewables energy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd to do this, you must automate, you must reduce your cost, you must be more efficient and also, we must be more collaborative in our approaches and this has paid off for us.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this crisis that we face in the industry is surely an opportunity for us to do many things differently, and particularly more so in our country to see where the enormous gas resources can be converted to value and join the journey to blue and green hydrogen.\u201d\n\nSecretary-General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, in his address, stated that participating countries have taken proactive and pre-emptive actions to help reduce volatility, stabilise the oil market, and provide a flexible platform for recovery with potentially broader participation in the coming years.\n\nHe added that countries have reviewed the decisions on a monthly basis to proactively anticipate market developments and improve the core principles upon which the oil enterprise was founded.\n\nHe listed the principles as transparency, equity and fairness, emphasising that conformity levels with the production adjustments have been a testimony to the depth of member countries\u2019 commitment.\n\nHe added: \u201cAfter the unprecedented turmoil of last year, in recent months we have seen relative stability in the oil market. The market has continued to react positively to the decisions we took, including the upward adjustments of production levels beginning in May this year.\n\n\u201cOverall conformity to the production adjustments was 114 per cent in April 2021, reinforcing the trend of high conformity by the participating countries.\u201d\n\nHe said despite the positives, the uncertainties remained, such as the continuing high number of COVID-19 cases in some countries; the uneven vaccine rollout, particularly when looking at the developed versus the developing world.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
