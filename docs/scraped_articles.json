          "text": "The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, on Thursday, in Rivers State, has said despite the number of aspirants vying for the All Progressives Congress presidential ticket, they must be willing to rally around and support whoever emerges candidate in the forthcoming primary elections.\n\nThis was as he said there was no need for hostility among aspirants as the ultimate goal remained the country\u2019s unity.\n\nAccording to a statement signed on Friday by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande, Osinbajo spoke in Rivers in continuation of his nationwide consultations with stakeholders and delegates of the APC.\n\nThe statement was titled \u2018APC has greatest potential to do the best for Nigeria, says Osinbajo in rivers.\u2019\n\nIn his call for unity, the Vice President noted that all the aspirants that had made public, their intention to run for president under the APC, were progressives.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are all progressives, we represent the same point of view that this country can be better; that we can improve the fortunes of our young people; that our country can be a great place. Every one of us has that desire, and every one of us can achieve that, given the chance.\n\n\u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve gone, I\u2019ve pointed out that there is no need for conflict of any kind, especially among presidential aspirants. All of us, who are presidential aspirants, have either worked together or eaten together in one place or the other. We are aspirants today, but only one person would emerge, and we must be prepared to work with that person.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the best aspirant should be chosen to lead the party as its presidential candidate in 2023.\n\nThe Vice President also noted that the governing APC had the greatest potential to do the best for Nigeria and ensure its further development and progress.\n\n\u201cWe are also, of course, completely at one on the idea that the party needs to be united. So, everything that needs to be done is being done and will be done to ensure the unity of the aspirants.\n\n\u201cOur party is, as you know, not just the ruling party, but the party that has the greatest potential to do the best for this country,\u201d he noted.\n\nWith regards to his consultations with the delegates, Prof. Osinbajo disclosed that \u201cWhat we spent our time doing today was talking more about national issues, about issues of development; and we all affirm that we have to do a lot of work; we are willing and able to do the work.\u201d\n\nBefore his interaction with the APC delegates and stakeholders in Rivers, the Vice President had paid a courtesy to the Rivers State Traditional Council led by the King Jaja of Opobo, Dr. Dandeson Jaja, Jeki V, Natural Ruler, Amanyanabo of the Opobo Kingdom, who is also the Chairman of the Council.\n\nInforming the monarchs of his aspiration to run for president, he said, \u201cOur country is at a critical phase in its existence and every country faces its challenges. Our country is facing some of the biggest challenges it has ever faced.\n\n\u201cThis current administration has faced more security challenges than any other administration. But I am confident that, not only will we be able to tackle the challenges today, we will be able to tackle the challenges of the future.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, King Jaja of Opobo thanked the Vice President for his \u201cgood wishes\u201d and for sending a representative to his 80th birthday celebration saying \u201cThat was very kind of you. Let us campaign in peace and let us not add to the challenges that we are going through already.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "[PROLOGUE] Vanguard 2021 Personality of the Year: Greatness in uncertain times",
          "text": "By Charles Kumolu, Deputy Editor, Sunday Vanguard\n\nSINCE great men and women look very different at different times, readers deserve to know editors\u2019 definition of greatness in a year disrupted by alarming insecurity and falling standard of living. Like in 2020, the social, political and economic space hardly operated at optimum levels \u2013 no thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and widespread security breaches. This nearly foreclosed the emergence of men and women whose exploits are nothing but enduring images of greatness.\n\nIf you agree less, consider the negatives occasioned by two-digit inflation, food crisis, shrinking national income and volatile oil prices in the previous 12 months. That aside, Nigeria had the worst of it in terms of safety of lives and property, with an average of five persons killed daily in 2021, according to reports.\n\nThese and others added in making the year yet another one like no other in the nation\u2019s history. Yes, activities were less as dictated by the new normal in several sectors, but impacts weren\u2019t less profound in some areas.\n\nUndeterred by the prevailing social climate, some exceptional Nigerians, in various fields, braved the storm, pushed boundaries and impacted positively.\n\nFor better, they influenced the course of history in the last 12 months. The result of their resilience didn\u2019t just keep hope alive, it also kept a troubled nation working. In arriving at these persons of impact, Vanguard editors employed the same criteria used ever since this flagship event debuted: Excellence, courage, integrity and national pride.\n\nWorking on the Personality of the Year Award comes with a sense of pride as it presents the opportunity of assessing the year through the lenses of those who defined it. But in 2021, the task of choosing the best wasn\u2019t made a lot easier by the dynamics of the year.\n\nIn fact, at the Board of Editors\u2019 sessions, loud silence often preceded calls for nominations in various categories. From the visage of each person, you could feel conflict of thoughts as they ruminated about who to nominate. It wasn\u2019t that political leaders and captains of industry were mostly passive last year, activities that could have produced many champions were less. Hence we found ourselves in a situation in which somewhat difficult choices had to be made between two or more alternatives.\n\nEven when you thought you had nominated the best, a counter argument sometimes emerged, presenting another perspective on the person or sector you thought you knew well. Anytime a superior opinion succeeded, the house reverted to square one as it pondered available alternatives. The more we thought through, the fewer our choices became.\n\nAt some point, the limited number of likely options resulted in vacant expressions that gave way to robust debates and ultimately the best recommendations. The outcome, after nearly three months of painstaking nominations and heated debates, is this gallery of great men and women. They are all here: The statesmen, boardroom gurus, public service icons, philanthropists, business moguls, and entertainers who have consistently inspired others.\n\nAs demanded by Vanguard\u2019s expansive coverage of events, persons, and issues, new categories of awards emerged this year. The innovativeness of certain individuals in their areas of influence also necessitated the expansion. For the first time, we are having Regulator of the Year, Private Sector Icon of the Year, Foreign Investor of the Year, Fintech Company of the Year, Real Estate Icon of the Year, and Special Recognition.\n\nThe awardees are persons, who through innovations powered public and private service for the common good. How these remarkable Nigerians made living a lot easier for the average person in 2021, is best understood through our editors\u2019 prisms.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Elebeke\n\nThe Federal Executive Council has approved a plan to incentivise and further harness Nigeria\u2019s digital innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem.\n\nThis followed the presentation of a memo by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami.\n\nThe approval, according to the ministry will enable the implementation of strategies to encourage and support the development and growth of more Innovation-Driven Enterprises (IDEs), which have the potential to create millions of additional jobs in the country.\n\nThis will also help to develop innovative solutions to societal problems, and rapidly grow, as well as diversify the Nigerian economy, in line with the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) for a Digital Nigeria.\n\nThe ministry said a number of the proposed strategies resulted from recommendations that were made at an interactive forum held on 22nd February 2022, where the Honourable Minister led a Federal Government Delegation on a working visit to the Lagos digital innovation ecosystem.\n\nThe delegation included the Director-General of NITDA, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the Post Master General and the Managing Director of Galaxy Backbone Plc.\n\nThe visit provided a useful platform for open and interactive discussions on the ecosystem\u2019s pertinent challenges and interventions required from the government to enable the ecosystem achieve its full potential.\n\n\n\nThe forum was attended by 143 ICT and Startup Companies.\n\nThe delegation also paid a visit to 3 selected tech startups, namely: Flutterwave (currently valued at US$3 billion), Treepz (with a current funding of US$3.1 million) and Reliance Health (with US$48.3 million in funding).\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nThe Nigeria Startup Bill (NSB) was earlier approved by the Federal Executive Council and forwarded to the National Assembly and the process is about 90% complete. The approval of the incentives at the Council will consolidate the gains recorded for far in the NSB process. The implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) emphasises the importance of the innovation and startup ecosystem to the development of an indigenous digital economy. The Ministry will continue to position Nigeria to develop this ecosystem in order to transform Nigeria into a country with a sustainable and thriving digital economy.",

          "title": "Inside PMB\u2019s meeting with Ministers exiting the cabinet, by Femi Adesina",
          "text": "Date was Friday, May 13, 2022, time 10 am, and venue was the Council Chamber of the Presidential Villa. The event was valedictory session for appointees leaving the cabinet to pursue political ambitions at different levels. Some were aspiring to be President, others Governors, and others Senators.\n\nIt was solemn and sombre. Yes, it had to be. Some of the Ministers had been with the Government since 2015, some others came in 2019. Like it is said, there\u2019s no good in goodbye, and parting can be such sweet sorrow.\n\nAll the Ministers who had bought forms to contest were around, except Hon. Emeka Nwajiuba, erstwhile Minister of State, Education, who was said to have travelled. He had turned in his resignation letter since April 28, when he bought the form to be President.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 11, President Buhari had required Ministers with political ambitions to turn in their letters, with the deadline being Monday, May 16. And in line with his commitment to human dignity, the President decided to hold the valedictory session.\n\nI\u2019ve told this story before, but let me tell it again. The President had retained the Service Chiefs he inherited in 2015 for some weeks, when the usual practice was to remove such people with the speed of light. He didn\u2019t, but kept them for almost two months.\n\nThe day the President decided to appoint new Service Chiefs, he sent for me, and I reported in his office. He told me what he had decided to do, and he gave me the names of the incoming set.\n\nThen President Buhari gave a strange instruction. \u201cI\u2019ve discussed with the exiting Service Chiefs, but don\u2019t announce their exit immediately. Let them get home, and let them be the ones to announce to their families and friends. It\u2019s not good for a man to have a job in the morning, lose it in the afternoon, and he hears it over the media.\u201d\n\nI told the President that once he had told those Service Chiefs, it would be virtually impossible to keep the news till the next, as he was asking me to do.\n\nThe President looked at me with a smile on his face, and declared: \u201cYou won\u2019t understand, because you\u2019ve not been sacked before. Me, I\u2019ve been sacked, so I know how it feels.\u201d\n\nThat was how we held back the official news of the appointment of new Service Chiefs for a while. President Buhari believes in the dignity of man. The same thing he did with the two Ministers who had to leave the cabinet involuntarily last year. He had privately met with the Ministers of Power, and that of Agriculture and Rural Development, told them that time was up, before the other cabinet members and the nation were told.\n\nThat was not the staple Nigerians were fed with, or used to. They usually would tune their radio sets to Radio Nigeria 4 pm news, or NTA Network News, only to hear that some public officials had been dismissed \u201cwith immediate effect.\u201d Some of them would still be in their offices, working, or be at home relaxing with their families, when the news would hit like a thunderbolt. Obviously, many leaders enjoyed that supercilious and cavalier treatment of their appointees, but not President Buhari. He believes in the dignity of man.\n\nSo, that Friday morning, the Ministers with intention to run for offices were invited. And gracefully, the President appreciated them, and wished them well in their political aspirations. What were the germane points Mr President made?\n\n-The day marks yet another landmark designed to establish a culture of managing the departure of public officers who have served the nation sacrificially, with dignity and honor.\n\n-The cabinet had been composed, first in 2015, and then 2019 at reelection. Some of the old Ministers were retained, while some new ones were brought in.\n\n-Looking back as the President and head of the team over the years, I hold fond memories of incisive and robust discussions during cabinet meetings, rendering of performance reports during special sessions and presidential retreats.\n\n-A significant number of cabinet members have become sufficiently equipped for higher elective offices, including the Office of the President. It shows the impact of the experience gathered while serving as members of the Federal Executive Council.\n\n-If the next President emerges from among former members of the cabinet, ample competence would be on display.\n\nPresident Buhari didn\u2019t claim that he made any of the Ministers. \u201cPrior to some of you joining the cabinet, you had made your marks in other areas as Governors, legislators, entrepreneurs and core professionals in different fields.\u201d I tell you, there seems to be no proud bone in the body of this our Baba.\n\nHe wished the Ministers success in the upcoming elections, and in their future endeavors. It was a poignant moment.\n\nFor members of the cabinet remaining onboard, \u201cI wish to remind you that the journey to the finish line is still very far, and this calls for more diligence, resilience and commitment to serve Nigerians better.\u201d\n\nOutgoing Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, and former Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Godswill Akpabio, spoke on behalf of his colleagues. He expressed \u201cdeep appreciation and gratitude for the opportunity to work with you,\u201d adding that they had learned, tapped from experience, and contributed their quota to national development.\n\nSaying they had become disciples of Mr President, Akpabio pledged that they would \u201ccommunicate Buharism, and take your message of transformation, patience, administrative sagacity to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe said leaving was filled with sadness and joy. \u201cWe will miss the weekly learning and interaction with a father. Joy, in that we can now speak to a wider number of Nigerians. Those who misunderstood you will hear from us, and posterity will never forget you for your love for the country.\u201d\n\nAkpabio prayed that the President would land well at the end of his tenure, \u201cand may one of us succeed you. We know where you are going, your mission, vision, which somebody from outside may not understand.\u201d\n\nSome of the Ministers have since rescinded their decisions to run for elective offices. That is not the purpose of this piece. The purport is to dwell on the dignity of man, how some leaders love to trample on it, and how President Buhari loves to respect and uphold it. That is why some of us love and admire him, and would stand by him through thick and thin, whether in government or out of it.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "title": "Asiwaju Tinubu: The experienced candidate Nigeria needs!",
          "text": "As the race for the Presidential primaries of all political parties gather steam, all eyes are on the two major political parties; the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as it is widely believed that either of its flagbearer will become Nigeria\u2019s next President. Out of the litany of aspirants in both parties, one name resonates across the length and breadth of the country, one looms large with a larger than life image \u2013 Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Unfortunately, not many, especially the younger generation, are familiar with the progressive political trajectory and exemplary leadership antecedents that gave rise to this.\n\nTinubu\u2019s rise to political dominance dates back to the early 90\u2019s when as a Senator in 1993, he became a rallying point for the de-annulment of the June 12 Presidential elections, widely believed to have been won by late business mogul, M.K.O Abiola. Despite mouth-watering offers by the then military government which allegedly included an oil bloc, Tinubu stood fiercely on the side of the people and became the leading light of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), the pro-democracy movement that fought the military junta to a standstill. Indeed, Tinubu\u2019s activities soon became unbearable for the then Abacha regime that he became a target of annihilation, and only escaped assassination by the whiskers, through the then famous, but covert \u201cNADECO route\u201d. The rest is now history, but his sacrifice and contribution to the pro-democracy struggle endeared him to the people, and formed the fulcrum of popular support that culminated in his emergence as Lagos Governor in 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Asiwaju literarily took over a collapsed Lagos, where public infrastructure had broken down irretrievably, where organized crime was the order of the day, where heaps of refuse reigned supreme, adorning the landscape of the metropolitan city, earning it the epithet of \u201cone of the dirtiest cities in the World\u201d. Like a clinical physician, Tinubu rolled up his sleeves, and wheeled critical sectors of the State into his theatre, in preparation for an extensive surgical procedure. But first, he assembled a team of surgeons \u2013 a widely acclaimed star studded cabinet, gifted in diverse fields to assist him.\n\nThe likes of current Vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo, Minister of Works and Housing, Ex-Lagos Governor Babatunde Fashola, Wale Edun, Yemi Cardoso, Rauf Aregbesola, Ben Akabueze amongst others were the team, under Tinubu\u2019s leadership that conceptualized the Lagos master-plan culminating in innovative financial reengineering of the State \u2013 raising monthly revenue from a paltry 600m in 1999 to N8.2bn in 2007; community-based Private Sector Participation (PSP) in reorganizing and reequipping the Lagos State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) that addressed the refuse menace; Justice reforms that included enhanced welfare for judicial officers, establishment of the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) for provision of free legal services to indigent citizens, computerization of court registries; Reorganized and restructured \u201cOperation Sweep\u201d into an effective crime-busting outfit called Rapid Response Squad (RRS) which is maintained and equipped by the private-sector led Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSTF); Establishment of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA) to plan and manage an integrated transport masterplan for Lagos which culminated in the revolutionary Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme, construction of 55 bus shelters, development of the blue and red line fast rail amongst others.\n\nDespite stiff opposition by the then Obasanjo-led Federal Government, it is on record that Asiwaju made a bold move to solve the power supply conundrum in Lagos, successfully establishing the first Independent Power Project (IPP) by any State which contributed 260MW to the national grid. Narrating the innovation, pragmatism and creativity brought into governance would take more than a literary piece, but what is important to note is that Tinubu revived an ailing State, revamped a comatose State economy which is today rated as the 4th largest in Africa by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). There is a biblical saying that \u201cwhoever is faithful in little things, will be faithful in large ones\u201d, that is why since Asiwaju\u2019s declaration to run for President, his legacy of exemplary performance in Lagos has spurred a groundswell of support across the country.\n\nNigeria today is similar to what Lagos was in 1999. Despite the modest efforts of the present administration in infrastructure and social services, it is evident that the need to create wealth and ingeniously increase revenue, cannot be overemphasized. The financial wizardry of Tinubu will be needed to diversify the economy \u2013 unlock the solid minerals potentials of the country, modernize the agriculture sector and stimulate the growth of agro-allied industries that will culminate in exports of products which will in turn become major foreign exchange earners for the country. Once we produce more and export, we will gradually stabilize our forex and reduce the overly high forex rates with its attendant adverse effect on inflation.\n\nAmongst all the aspirants jostling for the Presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Tinubu has proven to have the capacity to harness the best possible human resources, provide the requisite direction that will galvanize and motivate them to achieve spectacular results. It is envisaged that a President Bola Tinubu will assemble a crack team of experts, wherever they may be, across the World to assist his administration in providing solutions to challenges that have become intractable. Unlike what is obtainable under the present administration, it is expected that those that believe in the ideology of the APC, those that toiled for the party and understand what it stands for, will form the core of the cabinet and drive the vision of the party in the Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs). That way, the party and the administration will work in synergy, reward system for party loyalists will cascade down to the grassroots, and further strengthen the party.\n\nThe issue of age which seem to be recurring in debates should not be a factor in determining the next President as most developed countries have since embraced the experience and competence that comes with age. America just last year elected Joe Biden, 78, as its oldest, first term President. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa is just a few months younger than Asiwaju as he will be 70 by November! Former US President, Donald Trump assumed office in 2017 at age 71. Therefore, mental acuity and clarity is what a leader needs, and Tinubu has over the years shown he has that in abundance. Indeed, he restated this in a chat with press men after his famous informal declaration to run, \u201cI have the competence, the vision and the capacity to rule\u201d. Perusing his antecedents and achievement, it will be difficult to fault that assertion.\n\nThere is also the over-flogged perception of Tinubu as being corrupt. Till date, those allegations remain in the realm of beer parlour gossips as no \u201cprima facie\u201d case has been established against him. It will be recalled that the case brought against him at the Code of Conduct Bureau by the Jonathan administration was dismissed for lack of merit, and he was discharged and acquitted. Indeed, a former EFCC chairman had declared Asiwaju as the most investigated politician, stating however nothing incriminating was found against him. This is the time to tap the intellect of this gifted administrator, utilize this shrewd manager of human and material resources for the development of our country, not a time to exalt inanities or flawed hypothesis.\n\nAs the APC races towards its party primaries in the coming weeks, it is important delegates to the National Convention consider what is paramount in the mind of voters \u2013 the economy and the security situation, in selecting the party\u2019s flag-bearer. A candidate that will resonate with the people will be one that has the record of a fixer, one who can break barriers to reset the system and bequeath well-thought out solutions to problems, not one that is running on continuity \u2013 bereft of fresh ideas. Let\u2019s make it a date with history by electing the best man for the job as APC\u2019s Presidential Candidate \u2013 Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu!\n\nTomori is a member of the Media & Communications Directorate of Asiwaju Tinubu Presidential Campaign.",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) irked by the incessant insecurity situation in Imo State has called on elder statesman,chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu and retiring Arch bishop of Owerri Catholic archdiocese, Anthony Obinna as well as the Ohanaeze Ndigbo to wade into the problem and save the State from further bloodshed.\n\nIPOB in a statement by its spokesperson,Emma Powerful claimed that its M-branch has discovered that politicians in the State are fueling the crisis in the State for political reasons.\n\nThe group has also urged governor Hope Uzodimma,Rochas Okorocha,Emeka Ihedioha and senator Ifeayin Araraume to settle their political rivalry to avert further security issues in the State.\n\nPowerful has also warned in the statement that IPOB will have no other option but to come after politicians causing the upheaval in the State.\n\n\u201cThe fact remains that IPOB and ESN are not behind the insecurity in the Eastern region because we cannot shed innocent blood of a fellow Igbo person or Biafra citizens.\n\n\u201cThis disheartening insecurity is the handwork of some traitors and renegades who see politics as a career job and we have discovered how they recruited external aggressors whom they use to murder their people and target political opponents at will.\n\n\u201cThis problem is lingering in the region and particularly in Imo state and had spilled over to some part of Anambra State because of political reasons and interests.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on stakeholders in the Eastern region, the Governor of Imo state Hope Uzodimma and most especially some key players in Imo state politics like Emeka Ihedioha, Senator Ifeanyi Ararume, Rochas Okorocha of Imo State to make peace among themselves in order to stop the killing of our people because of political interest in the state.\n\n\u201cIf this continue IPOB will have no option than to do the needful so they will understand that Imo State is not for them alone and we will ensure that security of the state will not be jeopardise.

When Emefiele joined, many said he was the one. Some also believe that the president entered into an agreement with former Lagos State governor, Ahmed Tinubu to succeed him after his eight years in office. There are others who say that having enjoyed a good working relationship with his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Buhari may have secretly endorsed him.

So, Nigerians have to brace themselves up to do what needs to be done to put Nigeria back on the right path. And you are right in saying that wherever you go now, one of the things you hear is that Nigeria is not on the table, but why shouldn\u2019t Nigeria be on the table? What does it cost Nigeria to be on the table? I will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, may be the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent and indeed of the world is not that adequate. If that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right. The second is vision. What is the vision that we have?

Passion means being mad about Nigeria, having a touch of madness and I look at you (Hayatu-Deen) and say yes, you are mad about Nigeria too. Fourth one is innovation. We cannot be doing the same thing that we have done in the past that did not pay us and continue to repeat it and expect any change, we have to move out it, we have to innovate, we have to re-strategise.\n\n\u201cLike you said, I couldn\u2019t agree with you more that no individual in Nigeria, no political party, no single person or individual can make a critical mass that will resolve the situation that we are today. It has to be an all Nigerians\u2019 hands on deck. No section of the Nigerian community should be left out. So, I believe you have knowledge. From what you have said, you have the vision. Also, you told me that you have the madness and you have innovation but let me add, Nigeria is a complex country.

          "text": "\n\n*Says current period unlike any other in country\u2019s history\n\n*Terrorists killed 360, abducted 1,389 in three months in Kaduna, report indicates\n\n*What\u2019s happening in North-west far more serious, potentially more dangerous than we\u2019ve ever had in North-east, El-Rufai declares\n\n*Explains insecurity high in his state because terrorists find its forests comfortable\n\n\n\nJames Sowole in Abeokuta and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday, said Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its security challenges was a choice by the country\u2019s leaders and not by God\u2019s design.\n\nObasanjo declared that the country was going through a more difficult time than any other period in its political history. He said he had no apology for having \u201cmad passion\u201d for Nigeria, \u201cbecause I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say, yes, I have come to live here.\u201d\n\nThe former president\u2019s comments came as a report recently presented by the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, stated that between January and March this year, a total of 360 people were killed by terrorist groups in the state, while 1,389 others were abducted.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, in his own assessment, said the epicentre of insecurity in Nigeria had moved from the North-east to the North-west. El-Rufai declared that what was currently happening in his North-west geopolitical zone was far more serious and potentially more dangerous than what happened in the North-east.\n\nThe governor said Kaduna State was becoming a haven for terrorists because they saw its forests as a comfortable fortress for their activities.\n\nObasanjo spoke at his penthouse residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, when he played host to a presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-Deen. The ex-president said Nigeria required a leader, who had passion, innovation, and vision for Nigeria, some who possessed adequate knowledge of the challenges faced the country.\n\nThe former president insisted Nigeria could overcome its security challenges within two years with the right leader willing to make tough decisions. He urged Nigerians to brace up and be ready to make sacrifices to put the country back on the right path.\n\nObasanjo explained, \u201cSome people say the human memories are short, maybe they are right, because if human memories are not short, some of the mistakes that we are making, we will not be making them.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a record, which some people may find a little bit not what they want to hear, but whatever people want to hear, I believe, like you (Hayatu-Deen) have rightly said, this period is not like any other period in the history of Nigeria and you used two words, decomposing and dissolving. I can\u2019t find any better words to describe the situation we have found ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt is an agonising situation for you, obviously, and also for me. I want to emphasise the point that the Nigerian situation, bad as it is, will only be put right by Nigerians at the forefront of our situation. So, Nigerians have to brace themselves up to do what needs to be done to put Nigeria back on the right path.\n\n\u201cAnd you are right in saying that wherever you go now, one of the things you hear is that Nigeria is not on the table, but why shouldn\u2019t Nigeria be on the table? What does it cost Nigeria to be on the table?\n\n\u201cI will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, maybe the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent, and, indeed, of the world is not that adequate. If that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right.\n\n\u201cThe second is vision, what is the vision that we have? And if you have no vision, you may have eyes, but you are blind. And I believe that is part of our situation.\n\n\u201cThe third is passion. And when you said you are involved in this with a passion, and I was telling some people this morning that passion means madness; that you are mad about Nigeria. I am and I have no apologies for that, because I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say, yes, I have come to live here.\n\n\u201cPassion means being mad about Nigeria, having a touch of madness and I look at you (Hayatu-Deen) and say, yes, you are mad about Nigeria, too.\n\n\u201cFourth one is innovation. We cannot be doing the same thing that we have done in the past that did not pay us and continue to repeat it and expect any change. We have to move out of it, we have to innovate, we have to re-strategise.\n\n\u201cAnd you talk about security and people ask me about it and I say I know that we can put all insecurity in Nigeria behind us within a space of two years. That we have not done or that we are still in the situation we are is a choice that has been made by our leaders, not the way God wants us to be.\n\n\u201cLike you said, I couldn\u2019t agree with you more, that no individual in Nigeria, no political party, no smuggled person can make a critical mass that will resolve the situation that we are on today. It has to be an all Nigerian hands on deck. No section of the Nigerian community should be left out.\u201d\n\nObasanjo said he believed Hayatu-Deen had the requisite knowledge, \u201cfrom what you have said, you have the vision, also you told me that you have the madness and you have innovation, but let me add, Nigeria is a complex country. And we need to understand the complexity of Nigeria and that complexity if we take care of it, Nigeria is not a difficult country to rule or to manage, but we must all be ready.\u201d\n\nEarlier at the PDP secretariat in Ogun State, Hayatu-Deen, a former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, declared that Nigeria was \u201cdecomposing and dissolving very fast\u201d. But he said he had the capacity, experience, and knowledge to turn things around for the country.\n\nThe aspirant, who said he had been to several parts of Nigeria, including South-west, described himself as a passionate and complete Nigerian.\n\nAccording to Hayatu-Deen, \u201cMy blood is a Nigerian blood. I had seen Nigeria with the eyes of a Nigerian and not from the perspective of a tribal man. I am prepared to govern Nigeria from the first day of inauguration on May 29, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering from self-inflicted wounds. As an economist, I know how to fix the economy. I will provide social security, I will provide energy security, I will deal with the issue of national insecurity.\u201d\n\nTerrorists Killed 360, Abducted 1,389 in Three Months in Kaduna\n\nEl-Rufai expressed concern about the existence of Boko Haram and Ansaru terrorist enclaves, particularly, in Birnin-Gwari and Chikun local government areas of Kaduna State. He stated this while receiving the first quarter 2022 security report at the Government House, Kaduna.\n\nThe governor appealed to the military and other security agencies to take note of the situation before it got out of control.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that in spite of our investment in human, material and other resources to stem the tide of criminality in the state, the levels are still a source of concern,\u201d El-Rufai stated.\n\nHe said the security report \u201chas brought out new emerging concerns that I will want the security council to take note of and discuss and, maybe, to proffer some suggestions.\n\n\u201cThe first great concern is the emergence of Boko Haram terrorist enclave as well as activities of Ansaru, particularly, in Birnin-Gwari and Chikun local governments.\n\n\u201cAmong those kidnapped from the train was a roommate and classmate of mine, who was released upon payment of a ransom and throughout the period that he was in captivity, it was very clear that the terrorists were making comments like the forests in Kaduna are even better than Sambisa, so, they should all relocate here.\n\n\u201cI think this is an area we should all be concerned about. And that is why we have been making the point that the problem of insecurity now has moved from the North-east to the North-west.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in North-west is far more serious and, potentially, more dangerous than we have ever had in the North-east and we will like the military and other security agencies to take notice of this before it gets out of control.\n\n\u201cThe second, which is related to the first, is the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and mines in the state. We have been lucky; thanks to the police, we have been able to defuse most of them without causing major loss of lives.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the IEDs issue was a major concern because \u201cit shows very clearly the movement from banditry to terrorism with expertise in making explosive devices\u201d.\n\nEl-Rufai lamented the high rate of drug abuse in the state and called for urgent action to curb the trend, saying, \u201cI think we should give KASUPDA (Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Agency) a clear directive that any building housing any patent medicine selling these drugs should be acquired by the government and demolished.\n\n\u201cThis will be a deterrent to those that give these people the wherewithal to poison our young people. We have to take this action, because it is related to banditry and all forms of criminalities drugs play a major role. We must cut the supply chain of drugs to the bandits.\u201d\n\nThe governor said action should be taken against communities constantly mentioned in criminal acts along the Abuja-Kaduna road.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat I noticed in the report is continuous mention of Rijana, Kateri and Akilibu axis (along Kaduna-Abuja highway) in all these crimes, particularly, as regards the safety or lack of it.\n\n\u201cWe have been exploring what to do about these three communities, whether to relocate them to near Kagarko, whether to clear the three communities. I will like the security council to deliberate on it and look at the options, because it is very clear that there are higher levels of informants and criminals in these locations, because why is it that anytime there is attack or any form of kidnapping on the road, it happens around this axis and nothing ever happens on the Kagarko axis?\n\n\u201cThere is something wrong with the Rijana, Katari axis and government should not refuse to do anything. We have to look at the options, including the clearance of the settlements completely and relocation of the people to where other more honest people can watch them.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai observed that the security agencies were overstretched and recruitment of vigilantes needed to be ramped up.\n\n\u201cI think the 1,000 (vigilantes) we trained have been very useful in assisting the army, the police and other security agencies and, perhaps, this is the time to get another 1,000 and send them to Police College for training,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor added, \u201cWe have already bought weapons that are with the Commissioner of Police, but we need more men and women.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that he would like to see resumption of flights at the Kaduna International Airport.\n\nFlight operations at the airport was suspended following terrorists\u2019 attacks in March.\n\nEl-Rufai said, \u201cWe are grateful to the Defence Headquarters for enabling the establishment of the NDA Demonstration Battalion. I will like to appeal to the Air Force, whose Area of Responsibility includes the Kaduna airport, to also have some kind of permanent deployment at the airport to secure it so that flights can resume.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "N\u2019Assembly Pressures Buhari to Sign Act that Changes Rules in Middle of Game",
          "text": "\u00b7 Analysts say proposed legislation will be for personal benefit of legislators\n\n\u00b7 Supreme Court joins Rivers on clause 84(12)\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nMembers of the National Assembly have started mounting President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the amended Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act, which some analysts have said would amount to altering rules of the electoral process in the middle of the game.\n\nThis is coming at a time the Supreme Court has joined the Rivers State government in a suit seeking its interpretation of the controversial Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHowever, analysts also expressed concern that if the president yields to the pressure of the lawmakers and assents to the amended section of the Act, it might affect the timetable for the 2023 general elections that had been released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) because under the electoral body\u2019s schedule of activities, elections for delegates ought to have taken place this weekend.\n\nMore so, some analysts pointed out that what members of the National Assembly did was that they amended the Act for their own personal gains.\n\n\u201cEssentially, once they passed the Electoral Act, INEC released the timetable and the process started. They now went back and changed the rules when the game has already started,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe federal legislature, had last week amended Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act to enable some categories of non-elected offices within the executive officers of the 18 registered political parties vote at the various categories of party executives, including the President, Vice President, Governors and Deputy governors, at the congresses and national convention expected from Saturday.\n\nIn view of this, the 18 registered political parties have not been able to present their delegates lists, because the President has yet to assent the amended act.\n\nThe implication is that only the elected delegates could vote at the congresses expected to have commenced this Saturday.\n\nIn the PDP, for instance, a source said the delegates list was not ready, because the NWC was waiting for the signing of the amended section 84 (8) to enable the party compile a list of the executives from the wards to the states congresses.\n\nSpecifically, Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, initially allowed only elected delegates of a party to participate in conventions and congresses. But the National Assembly, last week, amended the Electoral Act to allow statutory delegate participate and vote in party conventions, congresses, and meetings.\n\nHowever, in his argument, the Deputy Senate President Omo-Agege, said the amendment sought to make provision for those who would not be elected as ad-hoc delegates to participate in the conventions, congresses, or meetings of political parties.\n\nHe further asserted that the initial section of the Bill was an error on the part of the legislature.\n\nCorroborating Omo-Agege\u2019s presentation, Senator Uche Ekwunife, said the amendment was a straightforward one, adding that, \u201cwithout this amendment, most of us will not have the liberty of voting during the convention. I support the amendment. Let us have it for second reading.\u201d\n\nSenator Sabi Abdullahi, said, \u201cThis Bill is a very straightforward Bill, and let us put in on record that this error was something that happened inadvertently. We have seen the error and that is why we are back here to ensure nobody suffers any harm.\u201d\n\nThe Bill was read the second time and referred to the Committee of the Whole where it was passed.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that if by the end of Friday, the bill was not signed into law by President Buhari, then, executives of the 18 political parties would not be allowed to vote at the presidential conventions, National Assembly congresses, governorship congresses and other congresses to elect the standard bearers of their candidates.\n\nS\u2019Court Joins Rivers in Case over Section 84 of Electoral Act\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court, yesterday, joined the Rivers State government in a suit seeking its interpretation of the controversial Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nThe apex court joined the state after its application for joinder was not opposed by other plaintiffs in the suit filed by President Buhari and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nThe hearing was earlier slated for May 19 but has now been adjourned to May 26 to enable parties exchange processes.\n\nBut the Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly and the State Attorney General, were joined as second and third defendants in the suit. The National Assembly is the first defendant.\n\nAccording to the applicants, they would be affected one way or the other by the outcome of the case since the subject matter in the originating summons relates to the validity and constitutionality of the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act enacted by the National Assembly and applicable through-out the country, including Rivers state.\n\nThe 1st applicant claimed that the outcome would affect the, \u201cLegal rights of the Rivers State House of Assembly and impinge upon its legislative powers to make laws in addition to, but not inconsistent with Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act enacted by the National Assembly and applicable in Rivers State and will affect the scope of its authority to make laws as conferred on it by Section 7 and Item E. 12 of the concurrent legislative list of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nThe AG of Rivers, said he should be joined in the suit as the state was constitutionally bound to be governed democratically in accordance with letters and spirit of the constitution.\n\nResponding, Buhari\u2019s counsel, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), said he was not opposed to the applicants joining the suit.In the suit filed on April 29, 2022, marked: SC/CV/504/2022 by the President and the Chief Law Officer of the country, wherein they are contending that the said Section of the Electoral Act 2022 was in conflict with constitutional provisions, has the National Assembly as the sole defendant.The plaintiffs noted that the Constitution has made provisions for qualifications and disqualifications for the offices of the President and Vice President, Governor and Deputy-Governor, Senate and House of Representatives and House of Assembly, Ministers, Commissioners and Special Advisers.\n\nBuhari and Malami added that the same Constitution has equally, \u201cThe qualifying factors for election into the office of President, Vice President, Governor, Deputy Gravenor, Senate, House of Representatives, Houses of Assembly and Ministers.\u201d\n\nThey also prayed the apex court to declare that, by the joint and or combined reading of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196, of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which also ignores Section 84(3) of the same Act, is an additional qualifying and/or disqualifying factors for the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential elections as enshrined in the said constitution, hence, unconstitutional, unlawful, null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that having regard to the clear provision of Section 1(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended, read together with Section 4 of the same Constitution, the legislative powers vested in the defendant do not permit or empower it to make any other law prescribing additional qualifying /disqualifying grounds for election to the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential election outside the express constitutional qualification and disqualification provisions as already provided in each or all of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), and without amendment to any of those sections is for reason of inconsistency, unconstitutional and therefore null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 disqualifying a political appointee from being a voting delegate or be voted for at a convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election is discriminatory, inconsistent with and in violent breach of the provision of each or all of Sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), as well as Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and some is null and void by reason of its inconsistency.\n\n\u201cA declaration that by the introduction of the provisions of Section 84(12) into the Electoral Act, 2022, but in disregard of Section 84(3) of the some Act, the Defendant has acted ultra vires the legislative powers vested in it under the provision of section 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and/or in violation or breach of the provisions of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196, thereby rendering Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 unconstitutional, null and void.\u201d\n\nThey also prayed for an order nullifying the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 by application of the blue pencil rule, for being unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and having been made in excess of the legislative powers of the defendant as enshrined in Section 4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nHouse Minority Caucus Urges Buhari to Sign Electoral Act\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately sign the one item amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 transmitted to him by the National Assembly, last week, to avert imminent political crisis in the country.\n\nThe caucus, in a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said the President\u2019s delay in signing the single amendment to Section 84 (8), has thrown the nation into serious confusion and constituted a huge threat to democracy and the smooth conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, warned that any further delay in signing the amendment to the Electoral Act to give political parties a sense of direction in the conduct of primaries for the election of candidates for the 2023 general election has the capacity to derail the entire democratic process and destabilise the nation.\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the people, the Minority Caucus, urges Mr. President to avert an imminent political crisis, which has the capacity of exacerbating the security situation in the country by immediately signing the Amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 and leaving a legacy of a credible electoral process to the nation.\n\n\u201cOur caucus calls on all Nigerians, the Civil Society, the International Community and all lovers of democracy to prevail on President Buhari to immediately sign the amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 and save our nation from an avoidable crisis.\u201d\n\nMark: PDP Will Not Compromise Her Rules\n\nIn a related development, Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 National Convention Organizing Committee, Senator David Mark, has urged party faithful across the country to imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship in the conduct of the exercises, promising that the PDP would not compromise her own rules.\n\nIn a statement issued ahead of the party primaries, which began with the election of candidates for the state Houses of Assembly seats on Saturday (May 21, 2022), Mark urged party men and women to comply with the rules of the game.\n\nThe former senate president between 2007 and 2015, said, \u201cThe Party has clear guidelines and rules for the exercises. Every aspirant should be guided by the processes. The party will not compromise any of the rules.\u201d\n\nHe counseled delegates to the congresses and conventions to consider the integrity and past accomplishments of aspirants in order to make informed choices of candidates for the elections.\n\n\u201cIn making your decisions, consider the interest of the people. Politics is a conveyor belt to serve humanity. The greater interest of our people is paramount,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, therefore, cautioned against politics of acrimony, bitterness or violence, saying, \u201csee politics like a sporting competition. If you don\u2019t win today, you can win tomorrow \u201c.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Says PIA capable of provoking, triggering commercial interests, investments in gas utilisation\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe federal government yesterday stated that Sub-Saharan Africa could require as much as $60 billion to access reliable electricity and clean cooking facilities between now and 2030.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who disclosed this, noted that an annual investment of around $35 billion could bring electricity access to 759 million Africans who currently lack it.\n\nSpeaking at the annual Symposium and Exhibition of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), in Lagos, Sylva added that another $25 billion a year could help 2.6 billion people globally to access clean cooking by 2030.\n\nThe SPE annual symposium and exhibition had as its theme: \u201cEnergy Transition in Africa: A Strategic Pathway to Net Zero.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnnual investments of around $35 billion could bring electricity access for 759 million people who currently lack it, and $25 billion a year can help 2.6 billion people gain access to clean cooking between now and 2030,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHowever, he stressed that the required investment represents only a small fraction of the multi-trillion-dollar global energy investment needed overall.\n\nSylva noted that despite contributing less than six per cent of world energy consumption and two per cent of total global emissions, there was need for the continent to shift to cleaner energy use.\n\nWith significantly untapped fossil fuel reserves, which could provide the much-needed foreign direct investment and export revenue, Sylva said Africa has the ability to play a leading role in this regard.\n\nHowever, the minister stressed that Nigeria has the mineral resources with approximately 208.62 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of proven gas valued at over $803.9 trillion and potential upside of 600TCF of gas, the most extensive in Africa, and in the top 10 globally.\n\nDescribing the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) as a game changer, Sylva said the legislation would help support the continent to alleviate energy poverty.\n\n\u201cThe PIA has generous incentives to enable development, distribution, penetration, and utilisation of gas even as it incentivises entry into the midstream, especially for pipelines with an additional five-year tax holiday for investment in gas pipelines.\n\n\u201cThe PIA is a supply-side enabler, capable of provoking and triggering commercial interests and investments in gas utilisation as well as treating gas as a stand-alone commodity.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we are following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transition from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role over the next generation, roughly between now and 2060,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister insisted that there must be multiple pathways to the energy transition in order to ensure that no country is left behind in the process of achieving net-zero by 2060.\n\n\u201cAs a continent, we need to be intentional and recognise the need to develop hydrocarbon resources in environmentally and socially responsible ways.\n\n\u201cAnd as alluded to by the African Union, we need to be realistic in choosing the energy transition pathways which addresses our unique requirements and circumstances,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nAccording to Sylva, global energy demand would likely be almost 60 per cent higher in 2060 than today and by 2070 the world is likely to be using at least 50 per cent more energy than it does currently as population grows and people seek to improve their quality of life.\n\n\u201cAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable energy is expected to support the growth of electricity from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of total energy supply by 2050.\n\n\u201cThe remaining energy demand that is impossible to electrify will require cleaner solutions, which can only come from natural gas \u2013 the closest ally to renewables,\u201d he noted.\n\nQuoting United Nations estimates, he noted that the current world population of 7.6 billion was expected to reach 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100, while half of the world\u2019s population increase is anticipated to occur in just five nations in Africa between 2017 and 2050.\n\nHe listed the countries as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda.\n\nSylva said around 900 million people are presently without access to clean cooking in Africa; and in 32 countries more than 75 per cent of the population are without access to clean cooking.\n\n\u201cLet me also mention that the world\u2019s 20 least-electrified countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the global unserved population live,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nBut he insisted that the foregoing does not mean it is all gloom and doom, maintaining that everyone in the world could have access to clean, affordable energy within the next nine to ten years if countries modestly increase investments.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Welby, who is the Senior Bishop and Principal Leader of the Church of England and the head of the Anglican Communion worldwide, condemned the violent murder of the late Deborah in a series of tweets late Wednesday.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the Nigerian government to ensure that religious rights are protected.\n\nWelby stated, \u201cI strongly condemn the appalling stoning to death of a Christian woman in Sokoto, Nigeria. This violence is a sin against God. I pray for the family and loved ones of Deborah Samuel, and I continue to pray fervently for the nation of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have spent much time in northern Nigeria working with others in pursuit of reconciliation and interfaith dialogue.

While Malami had purchased forms to vie for Governor in his home State of Kebbi, a group of rice farmers purchased forms for Emefiele to contest for ticket to vie for the presidential election.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige; his Women Affairs counterpart, Dame Pauline Tallen; Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timpre Sylva, had rescinded their decisions to contest for elective offices in the 2023 general election.\n\nMalami was physically present at yesterday\u2019s council meeting, while Tallen and Sylva attended the meeting virtually from their offices in Abuja.\n\nNgige was said to be away on official engagement in South Africa, where he was attending the global conference on child labour in Durban, organised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\nThe information and culture minister also shed more light on the recent meeting between the federal government and Facebook\u2019s management over the alleged biased coverage of the country by the blogging platform. He said both parties had a fruitful discussion, adding that the government is not contemplating banning Facebook operations in the country.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cWe had a very robust discussion with Facebook. Facebook saw our point and they said they\u2019re going to do much more than what they were doing. So if they do that, why would we ban them? We don\u2019t ban for banning sake. We ban or we only suspend operations if, for any reason, lives are threatened and they do not listen.\u201d\n\nHe also said the government was able to express its reservation about some of the reports on Facebook.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAt that meeting, we expressed our displeasure that Facebook was becoming a power of choice for those who stay outside Nigeria, in particular, to incite violence, killings, burning of government properties, killing of soldiers and policemen. And that they do more than what they are doing now in looking at the contents, which are unwholesome, which are being used on their platforms.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, the BBC did a documentary on this particular issue and found out that some of them who call themselves social media warriors in England, in France, and other places, have in recent times been using the Facebook platform to incite violence in Nigeria. And we\u2019ve all seen the real life impact of those war mongering, the young couple who are going to marry, soldiers who were gruesomely murdered.\n\n\u201cOver this weekend in Anambra State, policemen were killed, military barracks were attacked. And we did warn Facebook to, please, do more than what they are doing now. And I must say that their response was quite encouraging. They said they are going to do much more.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the approval of N169.7 billion private sector investments for road infrastructure through the government\u2019s TCP, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who also briefed newsmen, stressed that the programme was initiated in 2019, through Executive Order 7 signed by the president, which allowed the private sector to finance public infrastructure in lieu of tax and then offset it overtime using tax credits.\n\nFashola said the first project FEC approved, based on TCP, was the 234-kilometre road from Bali to Sheti through Gashaka to Gembu in Taraba State at the sum of N95, 232,474,010.72. He disclosed that an existing N20 billion, under NNPC Tax Credit Scheme, would be used to kick-start the project.\n\nFashola said the second project, under the tax credit scheme, approved by Council covered three roads.\n\n\u201cThe applicant in this case is Mainstream Energy Solutions, a major energy player in the country, is now seeking to also participate in this policy by investing a total of N74, 486,577, 050,\u201d he said.\n\nFurthermore, Mohammed, who briefed journalists on behalf of his colleagues in aviation, power, and agriculture, said FEC approved the sum of N3, 491,622,340 for the purchase of a property in Abuja for the Ministry of Aviation. He said the property to be acquired was to enable the ministry co-locate with many of its agencies.\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cThis property will enable the ministry to be in the same building with many of its agencies. As of now, many of the agencies operate from rented properties and this is a drain on government, apart from the fact that it does not allow for good coordination of activities.\n\n\u201cNecessary checks and legal searches have been made and the council approved the purchase today.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said Council awarded a N553.575 million contract for the establishment and deployment of Advanced Report Generation Utility Engine Web-based Reporting Tools in favour of Messrs Sinecou Limited with delivery date of 12 months.\n\nMohammed further disclosed that the power ministry got approval for the upward review of the original contract sum in respect of the construction of 232 kilometres Yola, Song, Gombe, Mubi, Gulako 132 KV double circuit transmission line, from $16 million plus N1.248 billion, to $16.698 billion plus N2,337,643,640. He added that the sum of N409 million was approved for the power ministry to purchase replacements of defective circuit breakers, and disclosed that a memo from the Minister of Agriculture seeking approval for a National Agricultural Technology Innovation Policy was approved.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cAnother memo by the Minister of Power also sought approval for the repair and refurbishment of defective nine sets of 330 KV, 13 sets of 132 KV, and 26 sets of 33 KV Crompton grips circuit breakers for the Transmission Company of Nigeria. Some of these circuit breakers are weak, having been there for more than 35 years and the total sum is N409, 089,841. And this is to help the network of the TCN.\n\n\u201cA memo of the Minister of Agriculture seeking approval for a national agricultural technology innovation policy was approved. It is a policy that aims at better synergy and alignment with MDAs to overcome inadequate coordination on policy implementation. It will address the issue of fragmentation of mandates and rivalries among MDAs in the agricultural sector. It will help livestock development and it will support the establishment of functional models of ranches, grazing reserves and integrated meat and dairy processing among others.\n\n\u201cThe policy is also going to help promote knowledge creation and transfer through reorganising, unbundling and strengthening agricultural research and training systems. The policy will give access to mechanisation via tractor and implement hiring scheme. It will also impact on quality extension service delivery, leading to enhanced technology adoption to strengthen the value chain for quality crops, fisheries and aquaculture, among others.\u201d\n\nMinister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clement Agba, who also spoke after the FEC meeting, said the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, presented a memo on the Phase 3 of the Lighthouse programme on digital infrastructure of voluntary assets and income declaration scheme bids and tax harmonisation normalisation analytics and application programme interface.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has tasked the apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide to prevail on some politicians allegedly responsible for the rising cases of insecurity in the southeast region to amend their ways.\n\n\n\nIPOB, in a statement by Emma Powerful, its spokesperson alleged that insecurity in the Orlu Senatorial District of Imo State is primarily a result of political conflict among key players in the state including Governor Hope Uzodinma; former governors Emeka Ihedioha, Rochas Okorocha, and Senator Ifeanyi Ararume.\n\nThe secessionist group said these key players should make peace among themselves and stop the killing otherwise, it will intervene. However, IPOB said the advice should not be misinterpreted by the politicians.\n\n\n\nIPOB further insisted that it is not responsible for the killings in the region, stating that its members cannot shed the innocent blood of fellow Igbo persons.\n\nIt, however, vowed to unravel the faces behind insecurity in the region.\n\n\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cFollowing the incessant insecurity situation prevailing in the entire Biafra land, particularly in Imo State, we the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the command and leadership of our great prophet and liberator of our time, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wish to state unequivocally that our intelligence unit the M. Branch has unravelled those masterminds and sponsors of these atrocities and genocidal attacks going on in the entire territory of Biafra and its territory since almost two years now.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fact remains that IPOB and ESN are not behind the insecurity in the Eastern region because we cannot shed innocent blood of a fellow Igbo person or Biafra citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis disheartening insecurity is the handwork of some traitors and renegades who see politics as a career job and we have discovered how they recruited external aggressors whom they use to murder their people and target political opponents at will.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis problem is lingering in the region and particularly in Imo state and had spilt over to some parts of Anambra State because of political reasons and interests.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are calling on stakeholders in the Eastern region, the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma and most especially some key players in Imo state politics like Emeka Ihedioha, Senator Ifeanyi Ararume, Rochas Okorocha of Imo State to make peace among themselves in order to stop the killing of our people because of political interest in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cImo State citizens have suffered much in the hands of these renegades employed by these politicians in Imo State. If this continues, IPOB will have no option but to do the needful so they will understand that Imo State is not for them alone and we will ensure that the security of the state will not be jeopardised. This advice should not be misinterpreted by these evil politicians.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's quite appalling that someone like Eng. Emmanuel Iwuanyanyu, Archbishop Anthony Obinna and many others including our traditional rulers and Ohanaeze Ndigbo leadership could not come together and call these politicians like Emeka Ihedioha, Senator Ifeanyi Ararume, Rochas Okorocha and Hope Uzodinma to order and allow peace to reign in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat does it benefit you, people, to see Imo state be in this kind of turmoil because of politics, especially in Orlu senatorial zone. The Ohanaeze Ndigbo should call these politicians in the state to a meeting with a view to settling them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIPOB and ESN after a long and tedious covert intelligence work on the insecurity ravaging the Eastern region and Imo State, in particular, have made a tremendous breakthrough in unravelling those behind the situation and those politicians who are deriving joy because of the blood of their people. It is shocking that they can murder our people because of political interest and turn around to blame IPOB/ESN.\n\n\n\n\u201cImo State is the home base of these renegades and traitors who are committing these heinous crimes against humanity and blaming them on peaceful movement seeking freedom of our people. But be assured their cup is now full. We are about to bring them to their knees to the public and anybody who knows them should blame them for what will befall them because IPOB is coming for them and they will regret being involved in this kind of activity in the region.\n\n\n\n\u201cInformation at our disposal reveals that many desperate political elites of Imo extraction, are strongly behind the insecurity in the state and blaming it on IPOB and ESN. The sole aim of these criminal politicians in Imo State was to destroy, demonise and tarnish the image of IPOB but we won't accept or allow them to continue to terrorise our land.\n\n\n\n\u201cIPOB shall, very soon, mention and expose the names of foot soldiers and criminals they are using for these evil acts so that the general public will know who are behind their misery and the harvest of innocent blood in Imo State.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey will be exposed to the public to ensure that the Imo state crisis is brought to a stop and afford the Imo State Indigenes the space and environment to live in security and have rest.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe politicians behind these devilish activities thinking that nobody will know them and expose them should retrace their steps because it will bounce on them shortly.\u201d",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

Also, the CEO says they have sold to mass market Africans through a highly innovative Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) cold chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Rehmann, the RTM cold chain uses predictive data to push fish to thousands of marketers every day across Kenya with less than 1% spoilage.\n\nCurrently, Victory Farms has more than 54 retail locations where over 15,000 market women go to buy fish, and according to Rehmann, they use no electricity or ice.\n\nThis funding will enable the company to expand into Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.\n\nNetflix for kids and people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix has launched \u201cMystery Box\u201d, a new feature that helps kids discover new movies and TV shows.\n\nWhy? Netflix wants children to try new movies. According to Netflix, children frequently rewatch their favourite shows, making it difficult to persuade them to try something new.\n\nAlso, the company says Mystery Box will provide kids with a personalised experience that will assist them in discovering their next favourite series or movies, and reconnect them with a familiar character.\n\nThis is now available on the company\u2019s connected TV platforms globally.\n\nNetflix is also expanding its accessibility features globally and launching a new collection featuring stories about people with disabilities in honour of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which was observed yesterday, May 19, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the company is expanding its subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) and audio descriptions (AD) offerings in additional languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\nWhy? Heather Dowdy, Netflix\u2019s Director of Accessibility, stated that they are adding more subtitles because more subscribers are watching disability-inclusive content globally.\n\nMoreover, remember that Netflix reported a 200,000-subscriber loss globally in the first quarter of 2022. Perhaps, this could be a strategy for Netflix to retain and gain more subscribers.\n\nTikTok to credit creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never used TikTok, but I\u2019m considering signing up. You\u2019re asking me why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\nJust this month, the company introduced two new features \u2014 Pulse and Branded Mission \u2014 for content creators to earn money on the app.\n\nDespite its popularity, TikTok has been criticised for amplifying trends without crediting the original creators. TikTok launched a new feature to that effect two days ago, May 18, 2022.\n\nThis feature, a button, allows creators to credit all types of inspiration for their content, like dances, jokes, and viral sounds. By tapping on \u201ccredit\u201d in the video\u2019s caption, TikTok viewers can discover the original creators behind the content.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nReport: The impact of Y Combinator in Africa over the years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

This means you can skip some boring parts of YouTube videos. And no, you haven\u2019t missed out because the feature was introduced yesterday, May 18, 2022.\n\nThe company said it added a graph that people can use to quickly locate and watch parts played the most by other users. Per YouTube, \u201cif the graph is high, that part of the video has been replayed frequently.\u201d\n\nYouTube is also introducing another feature, Single Loop, which allows users to loop a video indefinitely. Moreover, in full-screen mode, a new panel will appear to display video information like the video description, video chapters, and comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, YouTube is expanding support for video chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles. It\u2019s a feature that enables users to skip ahead to a specific video section or easily rewatch that section.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAutochek\u2019s new acquisition\n\nTikTok\u2019s Branded Mission\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\nJumia\u2019s earnings for Q1 2022\n\nAutochek acquires Morocco\u2019s KIFAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek, a digital automotive commerce company, has acquired Morocco\u2019s KIFAL Auto.\n\nThis follows Autochek purchasing Cheki\u2019s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria and collaborating with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast last year.\n\nConsequently, Autochek is now available in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast). It\u2019s also present in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). And thanks to the acquisition of KIFAL Auto, it now has a presence in North Africa, specifically Morocco.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, KIFAL claims it\u2019s one of the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets for used and new cars.\n\nKIFAL Auto, like Autochek, connects car buyers and sellers and, through partnerships, provides financing and insurance.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Maane and the KIFAL Auto team joins Autochek to lead the company\u2019s North African expansion efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Autochek, it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and partnerships with over 70 financing partners, including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Bank.\n\nFor more information on this acquisition, listen to today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast here.\n\nTikTok to roll out a new ad product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has announced the launch of \u201cBranded Mission,\u201d a new advertising product.\n\nWith this product, creators will be able to connect with brands and potentially earn rewards for their videos using this product.\n\nAdvertisers can use the new ad product for crowdsourcing content from creators and turning top-performing videos into ads. Also, they can launch branded campaigns and encourage creators to participate in them.\n\nThey\u2019ll create a brief and distribute it to the creator community to encourage them to participate in Branded Missions. TikTok creators can then choose which Branded Missions to join.\n\nIn summary, Branded Mission allows emerging and aspiring creators to respond to ad casting calls directly on TikTok.\n\nSo, who is eligible to participate? Branded Missions are open to all creators who are 18 years old and above and have at least 1,000 followers.\n\nPer TikTok, eligible creators whose videos are chosen by brands will \u201cbenefit from a cash payment and increased traffic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company believes that this product will allow the TikTok community to have a creative hand in brand campaign ads.\n\nBranded Mission is currently in beta testing and is available to brands in over a dozen markets. Plus, it will be available in more markets later this year.\n\nSimilar, but kinda different: Recall that earlier this month, TikTok introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that allows brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nWell, the company emphasises that it is constantly looking for innovative ways to support creators and assist brands in reaching users on its platforms with relevant content.\n\nBesides, the product is currently available in 12 countries, with plans to expand into additional markets by the end of the year.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in two days! Are you ready?\n\nMARA is giving away 20 tickets to attend Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit.

To win, follow the instructions here.\n\nBesides, online tickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBamba, a mobile-based enterprise software for African micro-merchants, has raised $3.2 million in seed funding to scale its app and expand its team.\n\nThe round was led by 468 Capital, with participation from Presight Ventures, Jigsaw VC, and high-profile angel investors, Mato Peric, Leonard Stiegeler, Laurin Hainy, and Thomas Stafford.\n\nBastian Gotter (CEO) founded Bamba in 2022 as a mobile application company. The startup is focused on simple tools for merchants to manage their customers, record stocks, receive payments, make payments, and access cash advances against their future cash flow.\n\nBamba aims to be one of the innovators in addressing the lack of digital solutions for record-keeping and payments, which creates a barrier that prevents these businesses from scaling due to insufficient access to credit facilities.\n\nConsequently, it plans to use the funds to expand its engineering team and user base in 12 sub-Saharan African countries where mobile money is prevalent.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumia, the pan-African e-commerce company, announced its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.\n\nOn today\u2019s podcast, Chimgozirim refers to Jumia as \u201c\u2026the guy who never fulfils his potential.\u201d What?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d That was brutal, if you ask me. What do you think?\n\nAnyway, when you compare this report to the first quarter of 2021, you\u2019ll see how Jumia\u2019s results demonstrated consistent growth.\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking me how. Well, I\u2019ve got you. The report shows that Jumia experienced significant growth in orders, gross merchandise value (GMV), and revenue.\n\nIn other words, orders increased by 40% year on year, from 6.6 million to 9.3 million. GMV increased by 27% year on year, from $198.9 million to $252.7 million. And Jumia\u2019s revenue reached $47.6 million, up 44 percent from $33 million in Q1 2021.\n\nHowever, these figures fell far short of where the eCommerce giant ended 2021, with the last quarter recording GMV sales of $330 million, revenue of $62 million, and orders of 11.3 million.\n\nDespite \u201ccontinued global supply chain volatility for these categories,\u201d food delivery grew 86% year over year, while phones and electronics grew 19%.\n\nOther negatives include its Q1 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) loss, at $53 million, up 70% year on year.\n\nIf you want to know why Chimgozirim said what he said, don\u2019t forget to listen to the podcast.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSEC\u2019s rules: Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

Using the National Identification Number (NIN), the organisation wants to track financial transactions in the country to tax Nigerians effectively. Your NIN will be required for any transaction you engage in, including paying school fees or purchasing a car.\n\nThis was how we kicked off proceedings on the Techpoint Africa podcast today. While this development could increase government revenues, Oluwanifemi wondered how good this could be in light of revelations that cast doubt on the safety of data collected by Nigerian government agencies.\n\nNext was a look at Jumia\u2019s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1 2021, the company witnessed impressive growth with revenue growing to $47.6 million, orders growing to 9.3 million, and gross merchandise value hitting $252.7 million.\n\nWith the company announcing that it had acquired a payment service solution provider license (PSSP), we explored the possibility of the company growing its fintech footprints. We also touched briefly on its healthtech ambitions and its chances of survival.\n\nWe rounded up the day\u2019s discussion with news of Autochek\u2019s acquisition of the Moroccan cars marketplace KIFAL Autos and the viability of the BNPL model for cars. Emmanuel shared a Technext report that revealed that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales. With many Nigerians earning below 200,000, it\u2019s not clear how profitable these companies could be in the long run.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, please follow the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

Please help us express our profound gratitude to him. We will continue to appreciate his kind gesture.\u201d\n\nHailing the army officers\u2019 wives for the support and encouragement they continue to give to officers, ensuring peace and security in the country, the governor said, \u201cWe know the role of the Nigerian Army Officers\u2019 Wives play in the lives of our services men, and also, when we run into a crisis, we call on the army and we know the professionalism at which they respond to our call.\n\n\u201cFor us as a government, our priority is our people. It\u2019s our people first because it\u2019s people that create everything first; it\u2019s people that create money, as well as technology, among others. So, without education and healthcare, at the basis, to strengthen your population, nothing else is going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThat is why we have prioritized education in Edo and we are spending as much as we can afford on those two issues that affect the people. In the case of education, our focus is on the foundation, because once you have a sound foundation, that child can build on that foundation subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe children in our public schools can compete with their colleagues anywhere in the world. Certainly, we want to extend this to your barracks if you allow us. The Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) is acclaimed as one of the most transparent educational projects on the continent.\n\nEarlier, Mrs. Salamatu Yahaya, said that they were in Edo to launch a skill acquisition empowerment programme and inaugurate a daycare facility, both in Ekehuan cantonment, Benin City.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nAdegboyega Oyetola, Osun State governor, on Thursday said he is seeking reelection to further transform the state, just as he flagged off his reelection campaign in Ile Ife.\n\nThe governor who was at the palace of Ooni of Ife , Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, Ojaja 11, for royal blessing said he does not have money to purchase private jets for monarchs or hard currencies to splash around for citizens, but he is endowed with the capacity to transform Osun through good governance.\n\nOyetola, said Osun was too sophisticated to be governed by kindergarten politicians seeking to experiment with the state.\n\nHe added that because he is a man of peace and a believer in the fact that politics is not do-or-die affair, he is not interested in fire-for-fire approach espoused by a certain governorship aspirants.\n\n\u201cI am happy that the Ooni knows that I have good intention to govern this State. I may not be able to buy private jets, but I have all it takes to fix Osun,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have hard currencies to splash around and I don\u2019t believe in fire-for-fire approach, but I am confident of victory in the next governorship election because of the modest achievements of our administration and the wide acceptance from our people in the last three-and-a-half years.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done across sectors is evident for people to see. We have proved to our people that Osun is in safe hands in view of the equitable distribution of resources that had culminated into the development that our people have been witnessing in the nooks and crannies of the state.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, a State like Osun is too sophisticated for kindergarten politicians to govern. It is costly to allow such people experiment with Osun.\n\n\u201cIn view of the way we have been managing the meagre resources at our disposal, coupled with the attendant challenges that we have successfully surmounted since assumption of office, it is instructive for discerning minds to know that governance is a serious task that cannot be left in the hands of mediocres.\u201d\n\nThe governor also lauded the people of Osun, particularly residents of Ile-Ife for their unflinching support, cooperation and prayers for his administration, which he said have been the foundation of the success recorded so far.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, who reeled out some of his achievements across various sectors, promised that his administration would not relent in delivering democratic dividends for all and sundry.\n\nHe attributed the decision to flag off his re-election campaign in Ife to the strong successes and victories the town had brought to his party in the past elections.\n\n\u201cThere is no seed we plant in Ife that doesn\u2019t sprout, this explained why we are flagging off our campaign from Ife. We appreciate the people of Ife, we do not joke with this town and we will never stop prioritising the welfare, wellbeing and overall development of Ife, and indeed the entire Osun,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will stop at nothing to ensure that dividends of democracy are equitably spread across the nooks and crannies of the State, just as we have spread our health and infrastructure interventions around, among many other interventions\u201d, Oyetola added.\n\nIn his remark, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi, lauded Governor Oyetola for justifying the mandate of Osun people, saying that he had done excellently well across sectors.\n\nOba Ogunwusi who described Oyetola as a complete gentleman, highly intelligent and calculated leader, said what has endeared him the most to the governor is his demonstrable capacity to govern Osun.\n\n\u201cWe thank the governor for doing so much great works with less noise. Quietly but steadily, he has set the state in a progressive path.\n\n\u201cYou are doing excellently well, and we pray God Almighty to continue to support your quest to see Osun develop. It is indeed true that your first term had brought so many goodies to citizens and we pray God to grant your desire to serve the State for second term\u201d, Ooni said.\n\nAlso speaking, the National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Otunba Iyiola Omisore, who hails from Ife charged his kinsmen to show appreciation through their votes for the many good fortunes that Oyetola has brought to Ife in particular and Osun in general.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cIfe is regarded as our source and that is why we are flagging off our Party\u2019s campaign from Ife. If we have been trusted that much and regarded as deserving of this honour, we must not disappoint. We must show appreciation, not just for this gesture but for other good fortunes Governor Oyetola has brought to Ife.\n\n\u201cWe assure the Governor that we are solidly behind him. We have to show that we are really the source. We have to show that Ife has become the defacto secretariat of APC.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the APC in Osun, Prince Gboyega Famodun, appreciated the people of Ife for their cooperation and support for the Oyetola-led administration. He added that Oyetola remains the best candidate that will deliver good leadership and progress for Osun.\n\n\u201cThis is the Party and the Governor that can assure our progress. Others who are parading themselves as governorship candidates have nothing to offer the state,\u201d Famodun said.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Senate Spokesperson and Director-General of the Osun APC Campaign Council, Senator Ajibola Basiru described the decision to flag off the campaign in Ife as symbolic and strategic.\n\nAccording to him, the good works of Governor Oyetola and the prayers he has received from Ife will earn him victory in the July 16 governorship election.\n\nShortly after the session in the palace, Governor Oyetola headed to Enuwa Square, the venue of the campaign where he addressed the mammoth crowd of party members and supporters as well as residents of Ife.",

          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has obtained a court order to detain the suspended Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, accused of N80bn fraud, for more days.\n\nAn EFCC of official who craved anonymity disclosed that the legal department of the commission secured the order within 24 hours after Idris was arrested in Kano.\n\nAlthough the detective did not state the court where the order was obtained, he explained that they have been relying on the order to keep him in their custody pending the conclusion of their investigation.\n\n\u201cHe is still here with us, he has been cooperating. We will get to the root of the matter. The good thing is that our legal department has secured a court order helping us to hold him till we conclude our investigations,\u201d Daily Trust quoted the source to have said.\n\nWhen asked about when he would be released, the official said Idris may be charged to court anytime, saying \u201cevidence at our disposal is damning\u201d.\n\nHe added that some of the properties linked to him in Abuja, Lagos and Kano might be forfeited temporarily, noting that the commission will also push for their permanent forfeiture to the federal government.\n\nThe Federal Government on Wednesday announced the suspension of the embattled accountant-general with a view to allowing a thorough investigation.\n\nIn a letter conveying Idris\u2019 suspension, the Minister of Finance, Mrs Zainab Ahmed warned the embattled public official not to visit the office at any time.\n\nAccording to her, the accountant-general\u2019s suspension was in line with the public service rules.\n\n\u201cFollowing your recent arrest by EFCC on allegations of diversion of funds and money laundering, I write to convey your suspension from work without pay effective May 18, 2022,\u201d the letter partly read.\n\nEfforts to reach the spokesman of the commission, Wilson Uwujaren, proved abortive as several calls pulled across to him did not connect.\n\nMeanwhile, the anti graft agency has traced at least 17 properties to Idris, as investigation on his financial dealings continue.\n\nAn official of the EFCC, who wished to remain anonymous, said the properties traced to Idris are located in Kano, Lagos, Abuja, Dubai and London.\n\nHe, however, said preliminary investigations showed that the nation\u2019s chief accountant allegedly used proxies to buy some of these properties. The commission would therefore need to invite some of the proxies of the accountant-general.\n\nThe detective added that from all indications, these properties were purchased while Idris was in office and did not declare them before the Code of Conduct Bureau as stipulated by law.\n\nHe added, \u201cAbout 17 houses in London, Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Dubai have been traced to him. In Abuja, some of the houses are located in serviced estates.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC had in a statement on Monday announced the arrest of the accountant-general for fraud to the tune of N80bn.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe commission\u2019s verified intelligence showed that the AGF raked off the funds through bogus consultancies and other illegal activities using proxies, family members and close associates. The funds were laundered through real estate investments in Kano and Abuja.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that Idris came under scrutiny last year following allegations that he offered huge sums of money to a family in order to secure the marriage of their 16-year-old daughter.\n\nThe uncle of the teenager, Nura Bagudu, had said in an interview that the accountant-general offered properties and gifts to the young lady and her family and had lodged complaints to the Federal Government.\n\nIdris had in 2021 launched Gezawa Commodity Market and Exchange Limited which he had openly admitted to owning.\n\nIdris stated this when he received a delegation of Kano Concerned Citizens Initiative led by its late Chairman, Alhaji Bashir Tofa. The project is said to be worth huge sums of money which is far more than his income.\n\nAn EFCC official said the legal department was already getting an order to remand the accountant-general and get an interim forfeiture on some of his properties pending the completion of investigations.",

          "text": "Some Lagos residents on Thursday expressed divergent views over the ban on commercial motorcycles in the state by the state government.\n\nGov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Wednesday imposed a total ban on activities of commercial motorcycle operators in six local government areas of Eti-Osa, Ikeja, Surulere, Lagos Island, Lagos Mainland, and Apapa.\n\nSanwo-Olu directed security operatives to enforce the ban beginning from June 1.\n\nSome residents, however, told NAN in Lagos that the government decision on the ban was a welcome development while others frowned at it.\n\nMr Gbenga Ajayi, a teacher, resident of Ayobo, said that \u2018okada\u2019 ban was a good decision but should be extended to other local government areas, not only in selected areas.\n\n\u201cThe ban should be extend to all local governments in the state, if not the riders will migrate to the other parts of Lagos where it is not banned and the story will continue.\u201d\n\nHe said the proliferation of okada operators posed serious threats to security structure in the state.\n\n\u201cOkada is constituting security threats, it is being used to perpetuate evils.\n\n\u201cSome riders do arm themselves with dangerous weapons to rob their passengers and even pedestrians of their valuables.\n\n\u201cSome do not have regards for human life, they ride like they have extra lives. Some passengers have lost their lives while boarding motorcycles while others became disabled.\n\n\u201cMy brother was beaten and almost lynched last month over N100 by some okada riders.\n\n\u201cIt took the timely intervention of some policemen around to save the situation from further deterioration.\n\n\u201cSome riders drive recklessly, I lost a neighbour to bike accident last year.\n\n\u201cThere should be no going back, the ban must stay to save lives and reduce crime,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the same view, Mr Ayodele Ojo, a civil servant, who resides at Ojuelegba, Surulere, commended the state government for the ban.\n\nHe urged the government to enforce and ensure total compliance this time round.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time the governor is issuing such directive, announcement is not enough but enforcement.\u201d\n\nOjo said that some riders use their motorcycles to kill, steal and to destroy.\n\n\u201cMotorcycle is used for fast get-away in crime scenes, the ban should stay so that sanity can return to our roads.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer condone criminality all in the name of unemployment, motorcycle business is not the only means of livelihood, there are many other businesses that people can engage in.\n\n\u201cThe ban will rid the city of insecurity and other vices,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, a businessman, Mr Olaniyi Daniel, resident of Agege, frowned at the ban of commercial motorcycles.\n\nHe said banning okada would further broaden the way to unemployment.\n\n\u201cOkada creates massive job for the unemployed young people and the livelihood of many depend on it.\u201d\n\nDaniel said that banning okada was not the solution to okada riders\u2019 menace and would not solve insecurity instead, it would increase the rate of criminal activities in the state.\n\n\u2018Prohibiting okada will not solve the issue of crimes in the state; criminals are very sensitive and strategic in their ways if the government bans okada, they will find other ways to perpetuate their crime.\n\n\u201cI believe it is not only motorcycle that is used to commit crime, criminals use cars too.\u201d\n\nHe urged the government to provide alternatives to alleviate the initial inconveniences,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs Glory Ameh, resident of Apapa, said that the ban on okada was not a good move, adding that it would bring undue hardship to some residents of the state.\n\n\u201cMy area cannot be accessed except by Okada, it is the only means of transportation, if the ban is enforced, it will bring undue hardship.\u201d\n\nShe urged the state government to come up with a policy and regulation that would guide the okada riders, rather than outright ban.(NAN)",

          "text": "Tension is rising in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as some residents have barricaded the main entrance gate of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), preventing staff from entering the premises of the ministry.\n\nThe residents, who were protesting against the suspension of the swearing-in of the newly elected FCT council chairmen and councillors, said that the Administration was trying to rob them of their mandates with the excuse of what they described as kangaroo judgment to extend the tenure of the outgoing chairmen by one year.\n\nThe protesters, who were chanting different slogans, carried placards with inscriptions, \u2018You cannot access your office if you do not handover,\u2019 \u2018Please release our victory\u2019 \u2018Give us our AMAC mandate today\u2019 \u2018You took an oath before, you cannot take another one again,\u2019 amongst other inscriptions.\n\nHon. Shekonlumi Yakubu Adamu, one of the FCT youth leaders, who led the protesters to the FCT minister\u2019s office, explained that as indigenes of FCT, everyone knows that an election was conducted in February this year and the PDP won three area councils, while the APC won the rest of area councils.\n\n\u201cThe chairmen were supposed to be sworn in today, but to our surprise, we woke up on the eve of today, to get a press release from the Minister that the swearing-in will not hold today again. We do not know the reason behind that.\n\n\u201cThe only reason was that there was a court order restraining the minister from swearing-in the new chairmen because of tenure elongation.\n\n\u201cSo, we want to know the reason why the swearing-in cannot take place today because the election has been conducted and won under the 2010 Electoral Act. The election that brought in the outgoing chairman was the 2010 Electoral Act and even the incoming chairmen were also elected wirh the 2010 Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cSo why will they now come at the eve of the swearing-in and tell us that it will no longer hold because of tenure elongation. We are saying no to that and we are insisting that the swearing-in must take place today. We are not leaving this place until the needful is done, because we do not want any breakdown of law and order,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that they are peace-loving people and anything that happens in the FCT today affects them, hence they were pleading with the minister that whatever kangaroo arrangement that they have for the AMAC chairman not to be sworn in, should be reversed.\n\n\u201cThat judgment to suspend the swearing-in is faulty and fraudulent. We need a clearer explanation of why the judge went ahead with the judgment without taking into consideration all the parties involved,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Joshua Yohanna, a PDP stakeholder, described the development as worrisome that the FCT High Court presided over by Hon. Justice Ibrahim Mohammed would allow itself to be used to a point where it can give a judgment that the judge knows or ought to know is illegal as no law can be made to have retrogressive effect.\n\n\u201cWe are cautioning the outgoing Chairmen and Councilors whose tenure under the 2010 Electoral Act upon which they were sworn in will effectively come to an end by the effusion of time on Friday, May 20, 2022, to steer clear of the respective Area Council offices from that date, if they want peace to reign,\u201d he said.",

Hon. Isah Ashiru at the Kaduna High Court 1 sitting in Zaria, alleging that he does not have minimum educational qualification to contest for governor in Kaduna State and seeking some reliefs. But Ashiru filed a counter claim seeking to be declared fit and qualified to contest and seeking N1 million damages for defamation of his character.\n\n\u201cAshiru tendered six documents including his GCE certificate issued to him in January 1980 by Kufena College, Zaria. A national diploma and higher national diploma from a polytechnic, a PGD and a Master\u2019s degree in public administration by Bayero University, Kano. On May 9th, 2022 the suit was dismissed by Justice M. K. Dabo.\n\n\u201cThe case was dismissed not struck out, so it cannot be returned back to the court forever unless it is appealed and to the best of our knowledge up till this moment it has not been appealed. The plaintiff has fulfilled part of the rulings by publishing a retraction in a national daily but he is yet to publish the second and pay the damages to the defendant.\n\n\u201cAshiru covenanted to do everything possible to ensure law and order during the primaries by following due process to ensure that sanity is maintained.\u201d\n\nJustice Bashir Dabo of the Kaduna State High Court 1 Dogarawa-Zaria on Monday May 9 2023 dismissed the suit and ordered the plaintiff to pay the sum of One Million Naira to the defendant for the damages that the allegation had done to his reputation.\n\nIn the judgment, Justice Dabo described as frivolous the claim by the plaintiff that Ashiru was in possession of fake academic qualifications.",

          "text": "The international wing of Lagos\u2019 Murtala Muhammed International Airport was briefly shut down early Thursday after a mangled body was discovered on Runway 18R of the country\u2019s main airport.\n\nAs of press time, the identification of the body had not been determined. It was also unclear whether the deceased individual was struck by an aircraft taking off or landing on the runway.\n\nThe runway was briefly shut down, according to airport officials, while a team of officials from the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and the Nigeria Police Force evacuated the body from the runway.\n\nInternational flights were unable to land or take off from the airport\u2019s international terminal during the runway\u2019s temporary closure.\n\nEthiopian Airlines flight 3907, a Boeing 77F aircraft with the registration number ETAVN, was one of the flights that could not land due to the shutdown. It was flying from Lome, Togo to Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nFollowing a brief wait, the airplane was diverted back to Lome.\n\nThe body was discovered on Runway 18R during a normal FAAN runway inspection, according to airport officials.\n\nThe officials were said to have reported a corpse on the runway around the cargo area.\n\nThe spokesperson for FAAN, Mrs. Faithful Avokerie Hope-Ivbaz, could not immediately confirm the incident, saying she had yet to be briefed on the development.\n\nAlso, the Police Public Relations Officer, Airport Command, Mr Olayinka Ojelade, said he had yet to get the requited signal on the incident.\n\nHe promised to get back. As of the time of filing this report, he had yet to do so. However, a top police official at the MMIA confirmed the development.\n\nHe said the command was called upon in the early hours of Thursday to evacuate the corpse from Runway 18R.\n\nAccording to him, the police are still investigating the identity of the dead man and how he got to the security area of the international airport.\n\nHowever, an aviation security expert and former Military Commandant of the MMIA, Group Captain John Ojikutu,retd, said there was a need to investigate how the unidentified man found his way into the sensitive area of the airport, describing the incident as a major security breach.\n\nAccording to him, the perimeter fence of the MMIA is not a security fence, adding that this has exposed the airport to various security breaches.\n\nOjikutu said, \u201cThe authorities need to investigate how the man got to the airport. Nobody can say much now; but he may have been knocked down by the wingspan or undercarriage of a jumbo jet but it is too early to say anything like that now. But we need to examine the issue of houses that have been built too close to the Lagos airport. The rule says no building should be situated less than six metres to the airport structure or fence. However, we have seen cases of people crossing the runway before.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority and FAAN need to investigate this to ascertain what really happened.

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo says Nigeria requires a leader driven by passion and madness to rule the country and put it on the right footing.\n\nObasanjo, who stated this when he played host to a presidential aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, at his Abeokuta, Ogun State residence, said he is mad about Nigeria and has no apology for that.\n\nHe lamented that the current situation in Nigeria is not only agonising for him, but for other Nigerians who also desire a better country.\n\nThe former President insisted that, Nigeria can overcome its security challenges within two years with the right leader who is willing to make tough decisions.\n\nObasanjo, therefore urged Nigerians to brace up and be ready to made sacrifices to put the country back on the right path.\n\nHis words: \u201cSome people say the human memories are short, maybe they are right because if human memories are not short, some of the mistakes that we are making, we will not be making them.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a record which some people may find a little bit not what they want to hear, but whatever people want to hear, I believe like you (Hayatu-Deen) have rightly said, that this period is not like any other period in the history of Nigeria and you used two words, decomposing and dissolving. I can\u2019t find any better words to describe the situation we have found ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt is an agonising situation for you obviously and also for me. I want to emphasise the point that the Nigerian situation, bad as it is, will only be put right by Nigerians at the forefront of our situation. So, Nigerians have to brace themselves up to do what needs to be done to put Nigeria back on the right path.\n\n\u201cAnd you are right in saying that wherever you go now, one of the things you hear is that Nigeria is not on the table, but why shouldn\u2019t Nigeria be on the table? What does it cost Nigeria to be on the table?\n\n\u201cI will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, maybe the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent and indeed of the world is not that adequate, if that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right.\n\n\u201cThe second is vision, what is the vision that we have? And if you have no vision, you may have eyes, but you are blind. And I believe that is part of our situation.\n\n\u201cThe third is passion. And when you said, that you are involved in this, with a passion and I was telling some people this morning that, passion means madness, that you are mad about Nigeria, I am and I have no apologies for that because I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say yes, I have come to live here.\n\n\u201cPassion means being mad about Nigeria, having a touch of madness and I look at you (Hayatu-Deen) and say yes, you are mad about Nigeria too.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Hayatu-Deen declared that, Nigeria is \u201cdecomposing and dissolving very fast.\u201d\n\nHayatu-Deen, a former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, is currently meeting with the PDP delegates at the party secretariat in Abeokuta.",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai has proposed the clearance and relocation of Katari, Rijana and Akilibu communities along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, saying they harbour criminals and informants.\n\nHe also raised the alarm that the Boko Haram and the Ansaru elements in the Sambisa forest of the North-east have now shifted base to Kaduna forests.\n\nThe governor\u2019s red alert came after a similar one by Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello some 13 months ago that insurgents had infiltrated his state and were just two hours from Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city.\n\nWhat Niger gov said 13 months back\n\nThe Niger state governor had in April 27, 2021, while speaking to journalists during a visit to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs\u2019) camp in IBB primary school Minna, said over 50 villages were overrun by the terrorists/ bandits and deserted by original inhabitants.\n\nHe also said the insurgents had \u201cestablished territory in parts of Niger state and hoisted their flag in Kaure village from where they made spontaneous incursion into more than 50 villages in the past three weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am confirming that there are Boko Haram elements around Kaure in Shiroro local government of Niger state. They have taken over the territory. They have installed their flag. I am confirming to you now that they have taken over the wives of people by force,\u201d Bello had said.\n\nThe governor had also said the Boko Haram terrorists were trying to make Kaure their home and headquarters like they did in Sambisa forest, warning that \u201cwhile Sambisa forest is several kilometers away from Abuja, Kaure is only two hours drive to Abuja.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s latest fear\n\nAnd 13 months after, Governor el-Rufai raised similar fear, saying the insurgents had relocated their abodes from Sambisa to Kaduna forests.\n\nSpeaking after receiving the first quarter 2022 security report which said 360 persons were killed and 1,389 others kidnapped in the state between January and March 2022, the governor said Boko Haram, ISWAP and Ansaru terrorists had abandoned Sambisa forests in the Northeast for Kaduna forests where they were recruiting young citizens into terrorism, having claimed that \u2018Kaduna forests are better than Sambisa\u2019.\n\nThe report was presented before the governor and combined security chiefs, as well as traditional rulers.\n\nEl-Rufai, who expressed worry about the influx of terrorists into the state, said the problem of insecurity had shifted from the Northeast to the Northwest, adding that the situation in the Northwest was far more serious and potentially more dangerous than that the Northeast.\n\nHe decried what he described as emergence of Boko Haram terrorists\u2019 enclave as well as activities of Ansaru terrorists group, particularly in Birnin Gwari and Chikun local government areas of the state.\n\n\u201cThis presentation has brought out new emerging concerns. The first great concern is the emergence of Boko Haram terrorists\u2019 enclave as well as activities of Ansaru particularly in Birnin Gwari and Chikun Local Government. The terrorists were making comments like the forests in Kaduna are even better than Sambisa, so, they should all relocate here. I think this is an area we should all be concerned about.\n\n\u201cThe problem of insecurity now has moved from the Northeast to the Northwest. What is happening in Northwest is far more serious and potentially more dangerous than we have ever had in the Northeast and we will like the military and other security agencies to take notice of this before it gets out of control.\n\n\u201cThe second is the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (EIDs) and mines in the state. We have been lucky, thanks to the Police, we have been able to diffuse most of them without causing major loss of lives. This is still a major concern, because this shows very clearly the movement from banditry to terrorism with expertise in making explosive devices. Again, this is because Boko Haram and Ansaru elements have moved into the state.\n\n\u201cI noticed the continuous mention of Rijana, Katari and Akilibu axis in all these crimes, particularly as regards the safety or lack of it of Kaduna-Abuja road. We have been exploring what to do about these three communities, whether to relocate them to near Kagarko, whether to clear the three communities. I will like the security council to deliberate on it and look at the options.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that, there are higher levels of informants and criminals in these locations, because why is it that, anytime there is attack or any form of kidnapping on the road, it happens around these three axes and nothing ever happens on the Kagarko axis? There is something wrong with the Rijana, Katari axis and government should not refuse to do anything. We have to look at the options including the clearance of the settlements completely and relocation of the people to where other more honest people can watch them.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies are overstretched, we need to ramp up our recruitment of our vigilance service volunteers, I think the 1,000 we trained have been very useful in assisting the Army, the Police and other security agencies and perhaps this is the time to get another 1,000 and send them to Police College for training. We have already bought weapons that are with the Commissioner of Police but we need more men and women.\n\n\u201cI will like to see resumption of flights at the Kaduna International Airport. We are grateful to the Defence Headquarters for enabling the establishment of the NDA Demonstration Battalion. I will like to appeal to the Air Force whose area of responsibility includes the Kaduna Airport to also have some kind of permanent deployment at the Airport to secure it so that flight can resume,\u201d he said.\n\nAruwan presents report\n\nPresenting the report, Kaduna state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said 360 persons were killed by terrorists in the first quarter of 2022 in the state.\n\nHe said 1,389 persons were kidnapped while 3,251 cattle were rustled during the period.\n\nHe also disclosed that 258 persons were injured in the first quarter, adding that 10 rape cases were recorded during the period under review.\n\n\u201cThe interaction between bandits and terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, ISWAP and Ansaru has been established, as evidenced by the deadly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna AK9 train on 28th March 2022,\u201d the commissioner further said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "There is palpable tension among major stakeholders in Abuja over alleged tenure elongation for the current area council chairmen and councillors in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja.\n\nIn suit No. FCT/HC/W/910/2022, Justice Ibrahim Mohammed of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, had extended by one year, the tenure of the out-going chairmen and councillors of FCT Area Councils, which expires Friday, May, 20, 2022.\n\nWith the judgement, FCT Minister Muhammad Bello suspended the swearing-in of the new set of elected officials.\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the judgement, threatening to drag the Judge to the National Judicial Council (NJC).\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, Thursday, PDP National Publicity Secretary Debo Ologunagba alleged the All Progressives Congress (APC) was in connivance with certain judicial officers to abridge the democratic system and foist anarchy on the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, Thursday, May 19, 2022, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has just been made aware of a bizarre judgement by Hon. Justice Ibrahim Mohammed of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, in suit No. FCT/HC/W/910/2022, wherein he attempted to extend by one year, the tenure of the out-going Chairmen and Councillors of FCT Area Councils, which expires tomorrow, Friday, May, 20, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe clear intent of this judgment is to abridge our electoral process, overthrow the entire outcome of the FCT Area Council election held on Saturday, February 12, 2022 which was overwhelmingly won by candidates of the PDP, halt the swearing in of the newly elected Chairmen and Councillors and impose an undemocratic government in the FCT,\u201d Ologunagba said.\n\nOn why the party rejected the judgment, the image maker said the Electoral Act 2022, upon which the judgement was based, cannot be made retroactive to apply to outgoing chairmen and councillors, who were elected under the 2010 Electoral Act which provided for a three-year tenure.\n\nOlogunagba continued: \u201cThe PDP vehemently and without equivocation rejects the judgement in its entirety. This judgment cannot be executed as it is unconstitutional, illegal, baseless and devoid of any legal foundation and reasoning for implementation.\n\n\u201cThis is because the four-year tenure provided for FCT Area Council Chairmen and Councillors in the newly enacted Electoral Act 2022, upon which the judgement is based, cannot be made retroactive to apply to outgoing Chairmen and Councillors who were elected under the 2010 Electoral Act which provided for a three-year tenure commencing from the date of their swearing in.\n\n\u201cThe party noted that the intent of the judgement by Hon. Justice Ibrahim Mohammed is to make the law retroactive to illegally favour the out-going Chairmen and Councillors, who were sworn in for a three-year tenure under the 2010 Electoral Act, which tenure, by the provision of that Act, ends on May 20, 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that the Electoral Act 2022 has a commencement date of February 25, 2022. It is trite in law that laws become effective from their commencement date and cannot be retroactive in effect as being attempted by Hon. Justice Ibrahim Mohammed.\n\n\u201cIt is even more worrisome that the FCT High Court presided over by Hon. Justice Ibrahim Mohammed would allow itself to be used to a point where it can give a judgment which the judge knows or ought to know is illegal as no law can be made retroactive.\n\n\u201cNigerians are invited to note that the Court gave judgement in this case with a set of individuals as Claimants and the Minister of the FCT as the Sole Defendant, leaving out necessary parties, including the PDP, whose candidates won the majority of seats in the February 12, 2022 elections; the National Assembly that enacted the law, the Attorney General of the Federation, who has the responsibility of executing the law and of course the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) which conducted the elections.\u201d\n\nThe PDP insisted that the judgment was a deliberate attempt to subvert the democratic process without regard to the consequential crisis and restiveness such portend in the FCT.\n\nIt also cautioned the APC that, the seamless transfer of power from one administration to another is the bedrock of democracy.\n\n\u201cThe APC should know that any breakdown of Law and Order in the FCT on account of an attempt to muscle or abridge the right and the Will of the people will be inconsistent with that very fundamental principle of democracy, which is the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to another,\u201d PDP stated.\n\nThe PDP said the tenure of the outgoing chairmen and councillors, under the 2010 Electoral Act upon which they were sworn in, would effectively come to an end by the effusion of time on Friday, May 20, 2022, and urged them to steer clear of the respective Area Council offices from that date.\n\nIt called on the people of the FCT \u201cto get ready for the swearing in of their new Chairmen and Councillors duly elected on February 12, 2022 as the party takes firm legal steps to address the attempt by the APC and Justice Ibrahim Mohammed to frustrate the Will of the people.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) to protect the integrity of the judiciary by immediately calling Justice Mohammed to order.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "title": "Border Demarcation, A Big Challenge In The Curbing Of Petrol Smuggling \u2013 Customs",
          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

All of those places, they are not supposed to be found there.\u201d\n\nThe state government on Wednesday had announced restrictions on okada operations in six local government areas of the state.\n\nBut it is not the first time the activities of okada riders have been restricted in Lagos.\n\nIn January 2020, the government had proscribed the operations of okada and kekes.\n\nBut enforcement became lax due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Omotoso said, adding that recent increases in accident rates prompted the government to act again.\n\n\u201cOur doctors are complaining that more persons are coming in with okada emergency,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAbout 45 percent of accidents in the first quarter were caused by okada. And most of the victims are between the ages of 30 to 39.\u201d\n\nThe latest ban on okada in the state comes after a sound engineer, David Imoh, was allegedly lynched to death by motorcycle riders in the Lekki area of the state over a fare dispute.",

          "title": "\u2018It Is Hell There\u2019: Ukraine\u2019s Zelensky Says Russia Has Completely Destroyed Donbas Region",
          "text": "Russian forces have bombarded areas of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas from land and air, killing at least 13 civilians, Ukraine\u2019s military said on Friday, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the assaults had turned the region into \u201chell\u201d.\n\nAs the war neared the three-month mark, the Russians were intensifying their efforts to subdue the Donbas region, the Ukrainian general staff said.\n\nThey had hit civilian infrastructure with \u201cmassive\u201d artillery shelling, including multiple rocket-launchers, the general staff said in a statement. Russian aircraft had also struck at targets.\n\nRussian shelling in the Luhansk area of Donbas killed 13 civilians over the past 24 hours, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Twelve of those deaths were in the town of Sievierodonesk but a Russian assault there had been unsuccessful, he said.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports and Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\n\u201cThe Donbas is completely destroyed,\u201d President Zelenskiy said in an address on Thursday night. \u201cIt is hell there \u2013 and that is not an exaggeration.\u201d\n\nThere were also constant strikes on the Odesa region in the south, he said.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports and Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nRussia\u2019s focus on Donbas follows its failure to capture the capital Kyiv in the early stages of the invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24.\n\nThousands of people \u2013 many of them civilians \u2013 have been killed and whole towns and cities razed in the gravest crisis in Europe in decades.\n\nAlmost a third of the Ukraine\u2019s people have fled their homes, including more than 6 million who have left the country in a refugee exodus, while others remain trapped in cities pulverised by Russian bombardments.\n\nBritish military intelligence said on Friday that Russia is likely to further reinforce its operations in Donbas once it finally secures the southern port city of Mariupol \u2013 scene of a weeks-long siege and Russia\u2019s most significant success in an otherwise faltering campaign.\n\nThe region, an industrial powerhouse, compromises the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\n\nPutin calls the invasion of Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to rid the country of fascists \u2013 an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.\n\nThe Kremlin leader was due to hold a security council meeting later on Friday.\n\nWESTERN SUPPORT\n\nWestern powers, who have strongly condemned Russia\u2019s actions and sought to isolate Moscow with an array of sanctions, were stepping up their support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Group of Seven rich nations on Thursday agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion to make up for lost revenues as the war wrecks its economy.\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved nearly $40 billion in new aid for Ukraine, by far the largest U.S. aid package to date.\n\nThe White House is also working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia\u2019s naval blockade, which has largely stopped Ukraine\u2019s exports of food. read more\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of using food as a weapon by holding \u201chostage\u201d supplies for not just Ukrainians, but also millions around the world. read more The war has caused global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser to soar.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nHOLD OUT\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began, with the Kyiv government ordering the defenders of a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down after a protracted siege.\n\nBritish military intelligence said as many as 1,700 soldiers were likely to have surrendered at the Azovstal steel factory, matching a similar number released on Thursday by Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have tried to arrange a prisoner swap, have declined to comment on the number, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still inside the plant.\n\n\u201cA certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\u201d he said.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of prisoners from Azovstal now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks.\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said.",

          "text": "A new video that begins moments before Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed has emerged showing relative calm and quiet, contrary to claims by Israeli officials that fighting was taking place in the area.\n\nAbu Akleh, 51, was killed by an Israeli soldier on May 11, according to colleagues and witnesses who were present at the scene, while covering a military raid by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe clip, which was filmed by a Jenin resident and verified by Al Jazeera, shows initial quiet with no sounds of fighting, corroborating witness reports that there were no clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters at the time of the shooting, as the Israelis have suggested.\n\nSome people are seen to be talking and laughing in the foreground, with people in the background, including Abu Akleh and some of her colleagues wearing blue press flak jackets, also visible.\n\nfire shots start ringing out.\n\nOnce the shooting starts, people in the foreground start running away from where the Israeli forces were positioned. Abu Akleh can be seen lying in the street after being shot.\n\nA Palestinian American citizen, Abu Akleh\u2019s killing by Israeli forces has led to global outrage and widespread calls for an independent investigation.\n\nIsraeli probe\n\nOn Thursday, an Israeli military official said the Israeli army had potentially identified the rifle from which Abu Akleh may have been shot, but added that they could not be sure unless Palestinian authorities handed over the bullet.\n\nThe Palestinians have said they were conducting their own investigation and have refused to turn over the bullet to the Israelis citing a lack of trust based on past experiences.\n\nIsraeli authorities initially said Palestinian fighters were responsible for Abu Akleh\u2019s death, circulating video of Palestinian men shooting down an alleyway.\n\nHowever, researchers from the prominent Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem found the spot where the clip was filmed: 300 metres (985 feet) away and with no line of sight to the location where Abu Akleh was shot. Al Jazeera\u2019s Sanad news verification and monitoring unit also conducted an investigation and reached a similar conclusion.\n\nThe open-source research group Bellingcat has also supported accounts of Palestinian witnesses present at the scene of the killing, based on their own audio and video analysis.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, the Israeli military, according to local media, said it was not planning to investigate Abu Akleh\u2019s death.\n\nThe Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Israel\u2019s Military Police Criminal Investigation Division believes an investigation that treats Israeli soldiers as suspects will lead to opposition within Israeli society.\n\nShortly after, dozens of United States legislators signed a letter demanding the FBI investigate Abu Akleh\u2019s killing.\n\nAbu Akleh\u2019s family has also urged the US government and international community to step in and ensure an independent probe.\n\nAl Jazeera",

          "title": "Nigeria: Parliament Pressures Buhari to Sign Act that Changes Rules in Middle of Electoral Process",
          "text": "Members of the National Assembly have started mounting pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the amended Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, which some analysts have said would amount to altering rules of the electoral process in the middle of the game.\n\nThis is coming at a time the Supreme Court has joined the Rivers State government in a suit seeking its interpretation of the controversial Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHowever, analysts also expressed concern that if the president yields to the pressure of the lawmakers and assents to the amended section of the Act, it might affect the timetable for the 2023 general elections that had been released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) because under the electoral body\u2019s schedule of activities, elections for delegates ought to taken place this weekend.\n\nMore so, some analysts pointed out that what members of the National Assembly did was that they amended the Act for their own personal gains.\n\n\u201cEssentially, once they passed the Electoral Act, INEC released the timetable and the process started. They now went back and changed the rules when the game has already started,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe federal legislature, had last week amended Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act to enable some categories of non-elected offices within the executive officers of the 18 registered political parties vote at the various categories of party executives, including the President, Vice President, Governors and Deputy governors, at the congresses and national convention expected from Saturday.\n\nIn view of this, the 18 registered political parties have not been able to present their delegates lists, because the President has yet to assent the amended act.\n\nThe implication is that only the statutory delegates and the elected three man-delegate as well as local governments\u2019 delegates could vote at the congresses expected to commence Saturday.\n\nIn the PDP, for instance, a source said the delegates list was not ready, because the NWC was waiting for the signing of the amended section 84 (12) to enable the party compile a list of the executives from the wards to the states congresses.\n\nSpecifically, Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, initially allowed only elected delegates of a party to participate in conventions and congresses. But the National Assembly, last week, amended the Electoral Act to allow statutory delegate participate and vote in party conventions, congresses, and meetings.\n\nHowever, in his argument, the Deputy Senate President Omo-Agege, said the amendment sought to make provision for those who would not be elected as ad-hoc delegates to participate in the conventions, congresses, or meetings of political parties.\n\nHe further asserted that the initial section of the Bill was an error on the part of the legislature.\n\nCorroborating Omo-Agege\u2019s presentation, Senator Uche Ekwunife, said the amendment was a straightforward one, adding that, \u201cwithout this amendment, most of us will not have the liberty of voting during the convention. I support the amendment. Let us have it for second reading.\u201d\n\nSenator Sabi Abdullahi, said, \u201cThis Bill is a very straightforward Bill, and let us put in on record that this error was something that happened inadvertently. We have seen the error and that is why we are back here to ensure nobody suffers any harm.\u201d\n\nThe Bill was read the second time and referred to the Committee of the Whole where it was passed.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that if by the end of Friday, the bill was not signed into law by President Buhari, then, executives of the 18 political parties would not be allowed to vote at the presidential conventions, National Assembly congresses, governorship congresses and other congresses to elect the standard bearers of their candidates.\n\nS\u2019Court Joins Rivers in Case over Section 84 of Electoral Act\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court, on Thursday, joined the Rivers State government in a suit seeking its interpretation of the controversial Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nThe apex court joined the state after its application for joinder was not opposed by other plaintiffs in the suit filed by President Buhari and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nThe hearing was earlier slated for May 19 but has now been adjourned to May 26 to enable parties exchange processes.\n\nBut the Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly and the State Attorney General, were joined as second and third defendants in the suit. The National Assembly is the first defendant.\n\nAccording to the applicants, they would be affected one way or the other by the outcome of the case since the subject matter in the originating summons relates to the validity and constitutionality of the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act enacted by the National Assembly and applicable through-out the country, including Rivers state.\n\nThe 1st applicant claimed that the outcome would affect the, \u201cLegal rights of the Rivers State House of Assembly and impinge upon its legislative powers to make laws in addition to, but not inconsistent with Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act enacted by the National Assembly and applicable in Rivers State and will affect the scope of its authority to make laws as conferred on it by Section 7 and Item E. 12 of the concurrent legislative list of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nThe AG of Rivers, said he should be joined in the suit as the state was constitutionally bound to be governed democratically in accordance with letters and spirit of the constitution.\n\nResponding, Buhari\u2019s counsel, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), said he was not opposed to the applicants joining the suit.\n\nIn the suit filed on April 29, 2022, marked: SC/CV/504/2022 by the President and the Chief Law Officer of the country, wherein they are contending that the said Section of the Electoral Act 2022 was in conflict with constitutional provisions, has the National Assembly as the sole defendant.\n\nThe plaintiffs noted that the Constitution has made provisions for qualifications and disqualifications for the offices of the President and Vice President, Governor and Deputy-Governor, Senate and House of Representatives and House of Assembly, Ministers, Commissioners and Special Advisers.\n\nBuhari and Malami prayed the apex court to declare that, by the joint and or combined reading of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196, of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which also ignores Section 84(3) of the same Act, is an additional qualifying and/or disqualifying factors for the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential elections as enshrined in the said constitution, hence, unconstitutional, unlawful, null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that having regard to the clear provision of Section 1(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended, read together with Section 4 of the same Constitution, the legislative powers vested in the defendant do not permit or empower it to make any other law prescribing additional qualifying /disqualifying grounds for election to the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential election outside the express constitutional qualification and disqualification provisions as already provided in each or all of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), and without amendment to any of those sections is for reason of inconsistency, unconstitutional and therefore null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 disqualifying a political appointee from being a voting delegate or be voted for at a convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election is discriminatory, inconsistent with and in violent breach of the provision of each or all of Sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), as well as Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and some is null and void by reason of its inconsistency.\n\n\u201cA declaration that by the introduction of the provisions of Section 84(12) into the Electoral Act, 2022, but in disregard of Section 84(3) of the some Act, the Defendant has acted ultra vires the legislative powers vested in it under the provision of section 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and/or in violation or breach of the provisions of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196, thereby rendering Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 unconstitutional, null and void.\u201d\n\nThey also prayed for an order nullifying the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 by application of the blue pencil rule, for being unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and having been made in excess of the legislative powers of the defendant as enshrined in Section 4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nHouse Minority Caucus Urges Buhari to Sign Electoral Act\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately sign the one item amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 transmitted to him by the National Assembly, last week, to avert imminent political crisis in the country.\n\nThe caucus, in a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said the President\u2019s delay in signing the single amendment to Section 84 (8), has thrown the nation into serious confusion and constituted a huge threat to democracy and the smooth conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, warned that any further delay in signing the amendment to the Electoral Act to give political parties a sense of direction in the conduct of primaries for the election of candidates for the 2023 general election has the capacity to derail the entire democratic process and destabilise the nation.\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the people, the Minority Caucus, urges Mr. President to avert an imminent political crisis, which has the capacity of exacerbating the security situation in the country by immediately signing the Amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 and leaving a legacy of a credible electoral process to the nation.\n\n\u201cOur caucus calls on all Nigerians, the Civil Society, the International Community and all lovers of democracy to prevail on President Buhari to immediately sign the amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 and save our nation from an avoidable crisis.\u201d\n\nMark: PDP Will Not Compromise Her Rules\n\nIn a related development, Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 National Convention Organizing Committee, Senator David Mark, has urged party faithful across the country to imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship in the conduct of the exercises, promising that the PDP would not compromise her own rules.\n\nIn a statement issued ahead of the party primaries, which began with the election of candidates for the state Houses of Assembly seats on Saturday (May 21, 2022), Mark urged party men and women to comply with the rules of the game.\n\nThe former senate president between 2007 and 2015, said, \u201cThe Party has clear guidelines and rules for the exercises. Every aspirant should be guided by the processes. The party will not compromise any of the rules.\u201d\n\nHe counseled delegates to the congresses and conventions to consider the integrity and past accomplishments of aspirants in order to make informed choices of candidates for the elections.\n\n\u201cIn making your decisions, consider the interest of the people. Politics is a conveyor belt to serve humanity. The greater interest of our people is paramount,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, therefore, cautioned against politics of acrimony, bitterness or violence, saying, \u201csee politics like a sporting competition. If you don\u2019t win today, you can win tomorrow.\u201c\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah and Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "title": "Obasanjo: Nigeria\u2019s Inability to Contain Insecurity a Choice By Her Leaders",
          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday, said Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its security challenges was a choice by the country\u2019s leaders and not by God\u2019s design.\n\nObasanjo declared that the country was going through a more difficult time than any other period in its political history. He said he had no apology for having \u201cmad passion\u201d for Nigeria, \u201cbecause I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say, yes, I have come to live here.\u201d\n\nThe former president\u2019s comments came as a report recently presented by the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, stated that between January and March this year, a total of 360 people were killed by terrorist groups in the state, while 1,389 others were abducted.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, in his own assessment, said the epicentre of insecurity in Nigeria had moved from the North-east to the North-west. El-Rufai declared that what was currently happening in his North-west geopolitical zone was far more serious and potentially more dangerous than what happened in the North-east.\n\nThe governor said Kaduna State was becoming a haven for terrorists because they saw its forests as a comfortable fortress for their activities.\n\nObasanjo spoke at his penthouse residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, when he played host to a presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-Deen. The ex-president said Nigeria required a leader, who had passion, innovation, and vision for Nigeria, some who possessed adequate knowledge of the challenges faced the country.\n\nThe former president insisted Nigeria could overcome its security challenges within two years with the right leader willing to make tough decisions. He urged Nigerians to brace up and be ready to make sacrifices to put the country back on the right path.\n\nObasanjo explained, \u201cSome people say the human memories are short, maybe they are right, because if human memories are not short, some of the mistakes that we are making, we will not be making them.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a record, which some people may find a little bit not what they want to hear, but whatever people want to hear, I believe, like you (Hayatu-Deen) have rightly said, this period is not like any other period in the history of Nigeria and you used two words, decomposing and dissolving. I can\u2019t find any better words to describe the situation we have found ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt is an agonising situation for you, obviously, and also for me. I want to emphasise the point that the Nigerian situation, bad as it is, will only be put right by Nigerians at the forefront of our situation. So, Nigerians have to brace themselves up to do what needs to be done to put Nigeria back on the right path.\n\n\u201cAnd you are right in saying that wherever you go now, one of the things you hear is that Nigeria is not on the table, but why shouldn\u2019t Nigeria be on the table? What does it cost Nigeria to be on the table?\n\n\u201cI will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, maybe the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent, and, indeed, of the world is not that adequate. If that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right.\n\n\u201cThe second is vision, what is the vision that we have? And if you have no vision, you may have eyes, but you are blind. And I believe that is part of our situation.\n\n\u201cThe third is passion. And when you said you are involved in this with a passion, and I was telling some people this morning that passion means madness; that you are mad about Nigeria. I am and I have no apologies for that, because I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say, yes, I have come to live here.\n\n\u201cPassion means being mad about Nigeria, having a touch of madness and I look at you (Hayatu-Deen) and say, yes, you are mad about Nigeria, too.\n\n\u201cFourth one is innovation. We cannot be doing the same thing that we have done in the past that did not pay us and continue to repeat it and expect any change. We have to move out of it, we have to innovate, we have to re-strategise.\n\n\u201cAnd you talk about security and people ask me about it and I say I know that we can put all insecurity in Nigeria behind us within a space of two years. That we have not done or that we are still in the situation we are is a choice that has been made by our leaders, not the way God wants us to be.\n\n\u201cLike you said, I couldn\u2019t agree with you more, that no individual in Nigeria, no political party, no smuggled person can make a critical mass that will resolve the situation that we are on today. It has to be an all Nigerian hands on deck. No section of the Nigerian community should be left out.\u201d\n\nObasanjo said he believed Hayatu-Deen had the requisite knowledge, \u201cfrom what you have said, you have the vision, also you told me that you have the madness and you have innovation, but let me add, Nigeria is a complex country. And we need to understand the complexity of Nigeria and that complexity if we take care of it, Nigeria is not a difficult country to rule or to manage, but we must all be ready.\u201d\n\nEarlier at the PDP secretariat in Ogun State, Hayatu-Deen, a former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, declared that Nigeria was \u201cdecomposing and dissolving very fast\u201d. But he said he had the capacity, experience, and knowledge to turn things around for the country.\n\nThe aspirant, who said he had been to several parts of Nigeria, including South-west, described himself as a passionate and complete Nigerian.\n\nAccording to Hayatu-Deen, \u201cMy blood is a Nigerian blood. I had seen Nigeria with the eyes of a Nigerian and not from the perspective of a tribal man. I am prepared to govern Nigeria from the first day of inauguration on May 29, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering from self-inflicted wounds. As an economist, I know how to fix the economy. I will provide social security, I will provide energy security, I will deal with the issue of national insecurity.\u201d",
          "summary": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Thursday, said Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its security challenges was a choice by the country\u2019s leaders and not by God\u2019s design.\nObasanjo declared that the country was going through a more difficult time than any other period in its political history.\nThe former president insisted Nigeria could overcome its security challenges within two years with the right leader willing to make tough decisions.\nIf that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right.\nI will provide social security, I will provide energy security, I will deal with the issue of national insecurity.\u201d",

          "text": "Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), on Thursday, faulted the 1999 constitution, which puts security on the exclusive list of the federal government as well as the concept of the federating unit being practised in the country.\n\nAkeredolu said the federal government wields too much power, hence, a need to rejig the constitution in such a way that would give power to the states in the country.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Akeredolu who said the 1999 Constitution, as amended, mocked the federal status of the country, noted that the precarious state of the polity, about security and economy, made it compelling.\n\n\u201cWe hold it as self-evident that a federal state must put in place a system of administration, which reflects its heterogeneous character. The Federating units must progress from the semblance of autonomy to the recognition of their unique features, which justify their existence.\n\n\u201cAll institutions must emerge as consequences of deliberative engagements designed to accommodate and serve all segments of society. Social services become seamless and effective, when governance is localised,\u201d he said.\n\nAkeredolu added that legislators must consider, very seriously, making laws that would deepen the current democratic experiment.\n\nHe stressed that the development pointed to the ostensible potential of a nation-state sincerely desirous of mobilising the citizens for the production of goods and services.\n\nOn the growing acceptability of the Amotekun Corps, Akeredolu said the corps pointed at the path to tread in ensuring that collaborative efforts among security agencies yielded maximum protection for the citizenry.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt, therefore, becomes anomalous and suspicious to insist on a central command structure of policing the polity. We are proud of our modest intervention at a most auspicious moment in the country. We enjoin all patriots to look critically into the issues bordering on the challenges faced by the country as a result of the current system.\n\n\u201cDevolution of powers must be perceived as necessary for the development of the country. There can be no meaningful progress in a system where the Federating units are treated as mere outposts for the central administration.\u201d",
