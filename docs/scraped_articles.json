          "title": "N\u2019Assembly ignores South govs, others, defends controversial PIB provisions",
          "text": "There are strong indications that the National Assembly will ignore opposition to some provisions of the Petroleum Industry Bill recently passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nThe PUNCH on Wednesday gathered that after the harmonisation of the versions of the bill passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives, the bill would be submitted to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) for assent.\n\nAfter 13 years of its introduction, both the House and the Senate on Thursday passed the bill. While the House proposed five per cent share for host communities, the Senate suggested three per cent.\n\nThe National Assembly also proposed 30 per cent of the profit of the planned Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited for oil exploration in frontier basins, which are mostly in the North.\n\nBut at their meeting in Lagos on Monday, southern governors rejected setting aside 30 per cent of the NNPCL\u2019s profit for oil prospecting in frontier basins. They also opposed three per cent share proposed for host communities.\n\nOn his part, a prominent leader in the Niger Delta, Chief Edwin Clark, described the bill as satanic.\n\nAlready, both chambers have set up conference committees to harmonise the different versions of the bill.\n\nThe PUNCH, however, learnt on Wednesday that the conference committee would only focus on the areas of difference and would not tinker with the provisions under criticism.\n\nSpeaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, had on Tuesday constituted a conference committee to harmonise the differences in the versions of the PIB passed by the Senate and the House.\n\nGbajabiamila announced members of the panel as including the Chairman of the House\u2019 Ad Hoc Committee on PIB and Majority Whip of the House, Mohammed Monguno and six others as members\n\nThey are Victor Nwokolo, Ademorin Kuye, Kingley Uju, Tijjani Yusuf, Ibahim Hamza and Mansur Soro.\n\nOn Wednesday when asked if the joint committee of both chambers would consider issues raised by the southern governors and other stakeholders, a member of the panel, who spoke to one of correspondents on condition of anonymity, said the lawmakers would only concern themselves with resolving the differences in the versions passed.\n\nHe stated, \u201cConference committees are meant to harmonise differences reached by two chambers. So, if this (Senate and House\u2019 3%/5% disparity) is the only difference, that is it.\u201d\n\nCriticism on provisions on host communities hasty, propelled by lack of in-depth analysis \u2013 House spokesman\n\nBut the House hit hard at critics of the PIB and described opposition to the bill provisions on host communities as hasty and propelled by lack of in-depth analysis.\n\nThe Chairman of the House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Benjamin Kalu, in a statement made available to one of our correspondents dismissed the controversy over the definition of \u2018host communities.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kalu, states hosting production facilities of international oil companies are also considered as host communities.\n\nThe note was titled \u2018The Petroleum Industry Bill 2020: A Simplified Explanation to the Constituents of Bende Federal Constituency by Rep. Benjamin Okezie Kalu, Member Representing Bende Federal Constituency of Abia State and the Spokesman of the House of Representatives.\u2019\n\nKalu said, \u201cOn the 1st of July, 2021, both chambers of the parliament went through the clause by clause consideration of the bill in preparation for the third reading, which was a major achievement, although not without a call from the public to explain grey areas appearing discriminatory to the host communities, while claiming that a section of the nation is set up to benefit from both the Host Community Trust Fund as well as the Frontier Exploration Fund.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker said he considered the opposition as \u201ca hasty conclusion propelled by the lack of an in-depth analysis of the bill.\u201d\n\nKalu said, \u201cIn Section 318 under the interpretation section, \u2018host community\u2019 is defined as those communities situated in or appurtenant to the area of operation of a settlor, and any other community as a settlor may determine pursuant to chapter 3 of the bill.\n\n\u201cThese are those communities housing the production assets of the settlors (the IOCs) and are compensated for the loss of surface use of land for exploration after the land survey is carried out.\n\n\u201cThe IOCs know their hosts at all times. There is zero ambiguity on this, as no settlor will accept to fund those who are not hosting them. Surely, the IOCs have a role to play in determining this, especially when one looks at the provisions of the bill with regard to the host Community Trust Fund and the process of setting up the organisational structure as well as the implementation guidelines as outlined by the bill. Nigerians are assured that the Trust Fund will take care of the host communities, to the exclusion of all others.\n\n\u201cPipeline routes are not host communities, they are impacted communities under the care of the operators in the course of their operations. It is still not obvious which part of the bill mandated the Host Community Trust Fund to cater for the needs of the \u2018impacted communities.\u2019 These divisive propagandist theories should be ignored fully.\u201d\n\nThe House spokesman noted that what the executive sponsored bill proposed was an annual contribution of 2.5 per cent of the operating expenditure of the preceding year of the IOCs to fund this, as provided for in Section 240(2), which the House amended based on technical advice to 5 per cent, though the host communities asked for 10 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe reason behind our decision is to ensure that the financial burden is not much on the investors in this era of great competition across the sector. Since the desire of every investor in choosing the destinations for investment is majorly profit, it presupposes that for our bargaining to be attractive, it should create value for the investors to energise their buy-in. The point remains we can\u2019t fund the whole nine yards of exploration and production without the foreign direct investments.\n\nSouthern lawmakers decry late circulation of report\n\nSeveral members of the House declined to speak on the record over the controversial clauses.\n\nSome members, especially from the southern part of the country, said copies of the report on the PIB were distributed late to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe document is voluminous and some of us received the report on the morning of the day it was to be considered. No one could have seen all the loopholes within the short period,\u201d a member from the South-East said.\n\nSenate harmonisation panel may recommend 4 % oil equity share for host communities\n\nIn the Senate, a member of the panel told one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity that the committee met on Wednesday.\n\nHe said members only deliberated on the issue of five per cent equity share for the host communities passed by the House of Representatives and the three per cent approved in the Senate.\n\nHe said, \u201c When there is a conference committee, the essence is to reconcile only the areas where there are differences in the bill passed by both chambers.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, there are no other areas of disagreement apart from the oil equity share. While Senate approved 3 per cent, the House passed 5 per cent.\n\n\u201cDuring our meeting today (Wednesday), some of our members suggested that we adopt the House decision of 5 per cent while others said jerking the Senate version up from 3 to 4 per cent would be okay.\n\n\u201c From the look of things, the Senate Committee would canvass 4 per cent oil equity share during our joint conference meeting with the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to touch other clauses because they are no differences in the Senate and House versions.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan had on Tuesday said the panel would meet with their counterparts in the House of Representatives as early as possible to reconcile the differences in the two versions passed.\n\nThe Senate President said the conference committee would start sitting immediately so that the National Assembly could transmit the harmonised the bill to the President.\n\nLawan charged members of the conference committee to meet with their counterparts in the House of Representatives to enable the National Assembly to come up with a final document on the PIB for transmission to the Executive arm of government.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThe conference committee will meet with our counterparts in the House, the House will also announce the composition of the conference committee.\n\n\u201cWe hope that they will swing into action immediately, so that we are able to have the final document of the PIB which we will transmit for the presidential assent.\n\n\u201cSo, we expect our delegation here under the leadership of the Senate Leader to engage with our colleagues in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH had on Tuesday reported that the National Assembly might transmit the PIB passed by both chambers of the federal Parliament to the President, ,for assent next week.\n\nA principal officer of the Senate who spoke with The Punch on conditions of anonymity, on Monday, had confirmed that the Senate and the House of Representatives would harmonise their different positions on the Bill latest by Tuesday next week.\n\nThe Senator had said the conference committee of the two chambers which would harmonise the two versions of the bill would start sitting before the end of the week.\n\nHe had said, \u201cIt is just that people love to play politics with everything. This is not the first time that the Senate and the House of Representatives would pass different versions of a Bill.\n\n\u201cThe usual conference committee would be constituted this week to harmonise the different versions and they are likely to submit their report early next week.\n\n\u201cWe are going on our annual recess on July 15th and we would transmit the bill to the President before we go on vacation. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives leaderships have said so, on number of occasions.\u201d\n\n\u2018PANDEF\u2019ll resist disrespect against N\u2019Delta\u2019\n\nThe Pan Niger Delta Forum in its reaction insisted that there was no going back on the rejection of the three per cent for host communities.\n\nIt also reiterated its rejection of the five per cent okayed by the House of Representatives.\n\nPANDEF National Publicity Secretary, Ken Robinson said this on telephone to our correspondent on Wednesday.\n\nThis is as Robinson took a swipe on the House Chairman on Media and Publicity, Benjamin Kalu on his remarks on the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\nHe said, \u201cPANDEF is amazed at the comments of one Hon. Benjamin Kalu who is representing Bende Federal Constituency in Abia State.\n\n\u201cWe have also rejected the fraudulent and provocative 30 per cent of profits that have been designated for frontier exploration funds.\n\n\u201cBut for us we are rejecting the insults and we are saying that we will resist it. Our people, we are talking and consulting and we will respond appropriately to the disrespect being meted out to the Niger Delta people by the National Assembly and its leadership and by the Nigerian state,\u201d he added. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Suspected Boko Haram fighters operating on 11 motorcycles, in the early hours of Wednesday, invaded Dabna village and adjoining communities in Adamawa State and allegedly killed scores.\n\nDabna is less than three kilometres from Garaha, the hometown of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha.\n\nEighteen corpses had so far been recovered from the dawn attack and more bodies were being expected to be discovered because of the way the attack was carried out.\n\nThe Chairman, Hong Local Government Area, Adamawa State, James Pukuma, who gave the casualty figure, said a joint team of security officials had restored normalcy and was helping with the recovery of the dead.\n\nHe explained that the attackers did not come looking for food but to cause terror, adding that the attackers, who came on 11 motorbikes, waylaid and gunned down fleeing members of the community.\n\nThe council boss added, \u201cThe attackers came on motorbikes and waylaid their victims, who they chased and opened fire on. We learnt that they came on 11 motorbikes each conveying two to three persons. So far, 18 corpses have been recovered with the help of security agents, who have restored normalcy.\n\n\u201cMost of the attacks are around the Sambisa axis; we want our people to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement to security agencies. Because this is the rainy season, without such measures, it means vast communities from these areas will be unable to farm.\u201d\n\nEarlier, a resident of the area, who spoke to The PUNCH on the telephone, said no fewer than 20 bodies had been recovered following the attack.\n\n\u201cThis morning (Wednesday), heavily armed gunmen invaded Dabna community. No fewer than 20 persons are believed to have been killed in the attack. At the moment, the military has recovered 18 corpses. One of the vigilantes in the area was also killed. The attack also affected Garka, where a lot of residents fled to,\u201d he said.\n\nThe military, however, said the information at its disposal was that only two corpses had been recovered from the community.\n\nThe Army Public Relations Officer, 23 Armoured Brigade, Jalo Cantonment, Major Sani Mohammed, told our correspondent on the telephone that the brief he had indicated that only two corpses were recovered after the attack.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said he was not authorised to speak on the attack since it had to do with Boko Haram.\n\nIn his reaction, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar condemned the attacks.\n\nThe 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party on his official Facebook page, wrote, \u201cI categorically condemn the killings in some communities of Adamawa earlier today, he said.\n\n\u201cHuman life is sacrosanct and no matter how often these attacks occur, we must never get used to them. They are unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThey must stop. And we as Nigerians, have a duty to work with government at all levels to make sure that these attacks are brought to an end.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Luminous Jannamike, ABUJA\n\nSome civil society organisations and the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, on Wednesday, said Nigeria was at war with bandits and insurgents, therefore, the military should leave no stone unturned to check their menace.\n\nThey said any bandit who took up arms against the State and challenged its sovereignty should be killed except he willingly surrendered.\n\nThe CSOs, which stated these in a separate interview with Vanguard in Abuja, insisted that murderers should not be treated with kid gloves.\n\nSpeaking, the Head, Public Affairs Bureau of the National Consultative Front, Dr. Tanko Yunusa, said: \u201cThe truth about it is that we have a war on our hands with bandits and Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cKilling them extrajudicially may not be conventional, but it is equally not a matter of applying the rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cThese are people who are carrying arms against the state. So, every effort to defend the sovereignty of the country is in the right place.\n\n\u201cIn any situation where people have engaged the country militarily, it is expected that the Nigerian military should rise up to the challenge and defend the nation.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for selective justice but, if the criminals willingly surrender, then they should be arrested and prosecuted in the court of law and not killed.\n\n\u201cBut if they insist on engaging the country in a warlike manner, then we have no options.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, CAN\u2019s Vice Chairman, Northern region, Reverend John Hayab, said bandits are not friends but enemies.\n\n\u201cTreating them in the language they understand could mean showing them no mercy as they do not show other Nigerians mercy.\n\n\u201cThis should be what our military was supposed to be doing with the bandits a long time ago, but our military seems to have become like our politician. Bandits should only be seeing action from our military not rhetorics.\n\n\u201cThe reason why some Nigerians are seeing the remarks by the Chief of Army staff and the Minister of Defense as a threat is that some elites are treating and giving criminals names depending on where they come from in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut when we give all criminals and murderers equal treatment and call them the same names Nigerians will not complain but celebrate our military.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Legal Adviser of the Take-It-Back Movement, Inibehe Effiong Esq., noted that the implications of the comments by the Chief of Army Staff and the Minister of Defense concerning being ruthless with bandits and insurgents will depend on the circumstances.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhere criminals, bandits or terrorists engage security agencies in a shoot-out, it will be lawful for the security agencies to return fire in self-defense and to also protect victims of the attack.\n\n\u201cHowever, security agencies, including the military, are not legally empowered to carry out extrajudicial executions of suspects.\n\n\u201cThat will violate the fundamental right to life under Section 33 of the Constitution and the right to presumption of innocence. It will also be a crime under the Anti-Torture Act of 2017.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that the military under the Buhari regime has demonstrated primitive apatite to kill indiscriminately.\n\n\u201cWe have seen this murderous proclivity in the mass murder of members of the IMN, IPOB and even peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate among others.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I object to such statements. The military shouldn\u2019t be talking too much in a democracy. But tragically, we are suffering from the relics of military dictatorship in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the convener of Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, kicked against the position of the nation\u2019s army chief.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe COAS\u2019 comment is an open confession to extrajudicial killings, crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\n\u201cEven our constitution frowns at extrajudicial killings. Even criminals have rights in Chapter 4 of the 1999 constitution.\n\n\u201cSo, it is regrettable that the COAS is proud to announce himself as an \u2018agent of death sending criminals to hell.\u2019\n\nSimilarly, Dare Ariyo Atoye of Centre for Liberty said, \u201cThis repeated attempts to justify, amplify, and magnify Buhari\u2019s genocidal remarks against a section of the country under any guise should be stopped.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Colonel Abubakar Umar (rtd), a former Military Administrator of Kaduna State, has blamed the current government under President Muhammadu Buhari for separatist agitations threatening the country\u2019s unity.\n\nUmar, who disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday titled: \u2018Nigeria; A Nation Challenged, \u2018insisted that the current administration under Buhari has failed to unite Nigeria.\n\nHe also criticized the federal government for undue attention to threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting threats posed by kidnappers, bandits and insurgents in the Northern region of the country, adding that the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, is of no serious consequence.\n\nUmar said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite strange and disturbing the Federal Government is according undue attention to the threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting ones posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\n\u201cActivities of those criminals have resulted in the evacuation of over 20 per cent of the villages in North West and North East. Hundreds are being murdered and maimed every week. Many more are kidnapped for ransom.\n\n\u201cMillions have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation. Over one thousand school children were abducted in the past eight months, with over 300 still in the hands of the bandits and kidnappers demanding humongous ransom payments.\n\n\u201cRape of women and young girls has become a daily occurrence. Most economic activities, particularly farming, which is the mainstay of the people in these areas, are now all but impossible.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s earlier claim of having technically defeated the Boko Haram insurgency in the North East has turned out to be empty propaganda. Contrary to this claim, the enemy has morphed into a more determined and deadly force, threatening to overrun the whole of the North East.\n\n\u201cFor the average Northerner living in these zones, who is barely aware of the activities of separatists, banditry, kidnappings and insurgency are of greater threat and concern to him. The arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is of no serious consequence since it does nothing to ameliorate his harsh and brutal condition.\u201d\n\nUmar\u2019s comment is coming at a time the federal government clamped down on leaders of some agitators in Nigeria.\n\nNnamdi Kanu, the leader of IPOB, was rearrested and repatriated to the country to continue his trial.\n\nKanu is presently in detention in the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, while his trial continues.\n\nSimilarly, the Ibadan residence of Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, aka Sunday Igboho, was invaded by the DSS.\n\nSome of Igboho\u2019s associates were also arrested, while guns and charms were allegedly recovered from the activist\u2019s house.\n\nIgboho is presently on the run as nobody has seen him since the attack on his residence.",

Haiti is the poorest country in North America with a per capita GDP of less than $700.\n\nBiden reacts to assassination of Haiti President, Moise\n\nWhat should interest many is that the assassination occured days after one of Haiti\u2019s most powerful gang leaders announced the launch of a revolution.\n\nDAILY POST findings show that on June 23, Jimmy Cherizier, a.k.a. Barbecue, a former police officer, declared war against business and political elites in Haiti.\n\nCherizier is the head of G9. Last year, he formed a coalition of nine gangs which has been involved in battle with rival groups amid deteriorating humanitarian crisis.\n\nDuring an address at La Saline, Cherizier, flanked by his foot soldiers, told the media that the G9 had become a force to deliver Haiti from the government and the opposition.\n\nThe revolutionary has been accused of massacres in recent years and was sanctioned in towards the end of 2020 by the United States government.\n\nCherizier openly admitted that his gang members spearheaded the recent looting at several stores in Port-au-Prince because of hunger.\n\n\u201cIt is your money which is in banks, stores, supermarkets and dealerships. Go and get what is rightfully yours,\u201d he charged citizens.\n\nOn July 7, Moise, a former plantation manager who referred to himself as \u201cBanana Man\u201d was murdered around 1 a.m.\n\nGunmen invaded his private residence\n\novernight and shot him dead, according to a statement by Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph.\n\nJoseph said a group of persons, including some speaking Spanish, carried out the deadly assault. The First Lady suffered bullet injuries and is being treated at a hospital.\n\nJoseph, now in charge of Haiti, condemned the \u201cinhumane and barbaric act\u201d.

          "title": "Back to the era of \u2018Abacha stove\u2019?",
          "text": "By Samuel Ogunnaike\n\nSIR: About two decades ago, Nigerians were axed by the economic hardship machete which resulted in stove technology. For us who can remember vividly, the Abacha Stove was usually powered by sawdust, making it the most economical means of cooking our food. This stove was not altogether a blessing, as it soon led to the destruction of our forests. Mad rush for sawdust got some of the stove dealers to ruthlessly destroy valuable trees in order to see their business continue and grow.\n\nThose who cooked with it knew they needed not complain of the poisonous smoke to be inhaled from it. One pertinent question to ask is this. What actually led to this stove \u2013 invention? Scarcity! Indeed, kerosene was scarce, and where it was available, the prices were outrageous and budget-shattering. Some people reported that there was over 200% increase in the price of kerosene. The government at the material time could do nothing to ameliorate the needless pain and plight of the people. Faced by this biting challenge, we found a respite in the invention of the Abacha stove. We at least accepted the good and bad sides of our new invention.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nToday, we are heading for Buhari stove. It seems to me that by some mysteries, Nigeria will always have a leader, whether at state or federal level, to remember for thorough hardship and infuriating price increase. As an aside, transport fares have doubled. For example, if you rode on a BRT in Lagos just a year back, you would agree that today the prices have astronomically increased. This happened with chronic insensitivity to the salaries of the masses. Back to the Buhari stove. It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, if we were ushered into the regime of Buhari stove. Prices of items are continuously on the rise, with the government seemingly helpless and hopeless. In fact, for those who can stockpile foodstuffs, now is the time. A visit to the same market in less than 48 hours will throw you into a moronic stance. Why? Prices have again gone up. I wonder if there is any item that has enjoyed stable price system in the last six months.\n\nThe prices of gas are busy running upward. Between today and next week, seriously, even economists can not categorically put the price at a figure. In the days of Abacha, we invented Abacha stove; today, we may well be on our way to Buhari stove. One thing stands for sure, a poor invention for purposes of economic survival is proof of insensitive and incompetent leadership.\n\nSamuel Ogunnaike,\n\nLagos.",

          "title": "Our founding fathers and current state of affairs of our country",
          "text": "By Jide Osuntokun\n\nWho were our founding fathers? We do not need to go beyond Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Chief Obafemi Awolowo and the Sardauna of Sokoto, Sir Ahmadu Bello even though our first and last prime minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa could be included in the list but he was inconsequential in the power play in the politics of Nigeria. He was his master\u2019s voice and that master was Ahmadu Bello. The family backgrounds of these three people determined to a certain extent their attitude to life and to the Nigerian state that was their destiny to create and nurture. Nnamdi Azikiwe was born in Zungeru in what is present Niger State in 1904 where his father, Chukwuemeka Azikiwe worked as a clerk in the Railways Department. The elder Azikiwe had some smattering of mission education and he could read and write. It was because of absence of a fulfilling life and means of profitable existence that he went in search of some meaning to his life in what would have been terra incognita to most of his people. Nnamdi\u2019s father sent the young lad first to his relatives in Onitsha apparently to be well grounded in Igbo culture before he was again sent to Hope Waddell Institute, Calabar, the only school of a grammar school type in the eastern part of the country. He eventually landed at the Methodist Boys High School in Lagos where he benefited from the basic western education that prepared him to seek the golden fleece in the USA as he himself described in his autobiography \u201cMy Odyssey \u201c.\n\nWhile in Lagos, he imbibed Yoruba culture and mastered the Yoruba language on top of the rudimentary Hausa he picked up in the north. In essence he was a true Nigerian by birth and experience. While in America where he spent more than a decade, he went from one black college to another raising funds to educate himself and even engaging in professional boxing for money that saw him through Storer College, Lincoln University until he graduated with a Master\u2019s degree in political science in the Ivy League university of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1933, the first African to achieve that feat.\n\nAwolowo\u2019s family background was not as dramatic as that of Azikiwe\u2019s. He was born in Ikenne in 1909 by an Abeokuta Muslim woman married to David Sopolu Awolowo, an Ijebu -Remo father who was a devotee of African religion before becoming a Christian. His son, Obafemi started schooling in a Christian mission school and that changed the young man\u2019s educational and religious trajectory because he could have been raised a Muslim like his sister. If that had happened, the course of Nigerian history may have been changed. If Awolowo had grown up a Muslim, would he and Ahmadu Bello have been so antagonistic to one another as they grew up to be or perhaps their common religion would not have influenced their politics? That is one of the ifs of History. Obafemi Awolowo after primary education in Ikenne and Abeokuta found his way to Methodist Teachers College Ibadan where he trained as a pupil teacher. The basic education he had there prepared him for self-education until he graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s of Science degree in commerce by private tuition. Not satisfied with this, he borrowed money to send himself to London to study law during the Second World War. He strongly believed he was destined for leadership position in Nigeria without any proof but absolutely trusting in his faith and some kind of mystical belief in his destiny of greatness.\n\nAhmadu Bello was born into the Usman Ibn Fudih family in Rabeh near Sokoto. As Shakespeare famously said, some are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them. In the case of Ahmadu Bello, and within the context of Nigerian politics, he had greatness thrust upon him. He had his primary and Islamic education at home in Sokoto. He had no ambition outside serving as a district head in one of the districts of the Sokoto emirate. But he and sons of prominent traditional elite in northern Nigeria were drafted to the Katsina Teachers College by the British colonial administration to be trained as teachers to introduce western type of education to northern Nigeria in order to disallow what the British colonial authorities thought was the unwieldy and inappropriate Christian mission education in southern Nigeria. These products of Katsina College included people like Kashim Ibrahim, Isa Keita, Ahmadu Bello and Abubakar Tafawa Balewa who were to play significant roles in the evolution of modern Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter graduation as teachers, these people were buried in the administration of educational institutions in their districts with occasional forays abroad for short courses to advance their knowledge and careers. Only Abubakar Balewa spent a year in London for Higher Teachers Certificate in Education. Ahmadu Bello did not bother to go beyond teachers college not because he did not have the brain but because he found acquisition of western education and certificates unnecessary in a Nigerian environment where his leadership position was guaranteed and preserved by the accident of his birth. He used to ridicule his southern colleagues who in their speeches quoted foreign authors to demonstrate their educational versatility and wondered why they couldn\u2019t just say what they wanted to say without boring people with what someone in a distant country had said some centuries before!\n\nFrom this skeletal picture of the formative years of our leaders were laid some of the problems of today. Azikiwe\u2019s sojourn in the United States despite that country\u2019s rampant racism left positive influence on him and imbued him with his republican beliefs in how education can bring out the best in men and women. This was further accentuated by the traditional Igbo belief that every man is king in his own house, a belief which made no room for a hierarchical society of kings and citizen and serfs. Awolowo also believed in the power of education and through deprivations and hardship, he acquired western education as a preparation for the arduous task of future leadership. His embrace of western education was to influence his bull dog tenacity in seeing his people in Western Nigeria go to free primary and compulsory education as from 1955. But Awolowo was unlike Azikiwe or perhaps more like him in bending his educational attainment to upholding the hierarchy and chiefly traditions of his Yoruba people.\n\nAhmadu Bello right from the word go even though seeing the British \u201calways as friends\u201d nevertheless saw them as religious foes. He rather looked towards the Islamic world for solidarity and inspiration. The English were useful up to a point because they held the keys to future power in Nigeria but Ahmadu Bello either feeling they were too far behind their contemporaries in Southern Nigeria or that he genuinely believed that the future lay in the world of traditions and Islam tried to hold the North together with its minorities which he hoped to convert or force into Islam if and when the British left Nigeria. He was not totally committed to national unity and he agreed with Awolowo that \u201cNigeria was a geographical expression \u201c and there were no Nigerians as there are French, Germans and Russians. How prophetic in view of what is happening today. Ahmadu Bello at every critical time of crisis as in 1953 and in 1959 constitutional conference threatened to withdraw the north from the federation. All the major ethnic groups, the Hausa Ibo, and Yoruba threatened to dissolve the federation in the crisis between 1966 and 1967. So what is new today? Our founding fathers would not have been surprised by our present political division. They would have said since we deviated from the specially crafted political architecture they gave us in 1960, we deserve what we get now.\n\nAm I accusing these leaders for the problems of today? Certainly not. But as political leadership was very critical to the evolution of modern states especially in Africa, we could not have had founding fathers of our country so different from one another and expect a happy ending. Our problems date back to 1900 the amalgamation of the southern provinces and 1914 the second amalgamation done by the British for the British without considering the conflicting interests of the various peoples of Nigeria. The absence of consensual leadership merely cemented the natural bifurcation of Nigeria and whether we can bridge this divide lies in the kind of enlightened and committed leadership ready to reorganize this country based on fairness, justice, equity and equality. It cannot be done by force. This is the judgment of history. Without that it is walk in the dark for our country.",

          "text": "By Jide Orintunsin, Sanni Onogu, Abuja and Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin\n\nThe Kwara State chapter of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has hinted that it will sanction Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed for his recent outburst against Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.\n\nThe party\u2019s Caretaker Committee Chairman, Alhaji Abdullahi Samari Abubakar, gave the indication yesterday in Abuja while reacting to the minister\u2019s claim that he sponsored the governor\u2019s election in 2019.\n\nThe chairman said APC might apply disciplinary measures according to the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nAbubakar said: \u201cI still see the minister as a member of our party. This is because he has not formally told us that he is moving out of the party, which I doubt if he will. He is a minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria where the APC as a ruling party is running the administration of government. So, I won\u2019t think he will want to move out.\n\n\u201cBut from those utterances he made, the party has structures and guidelines over issues. If we feel that what he said publicly amounts to disrespect or causing acrimony within the party, honestly, we are going to make sure the rules of the party are applied against him and any other person.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to be categorical on the steps the APC would take against Mohammed, the chairman said: \u201cWell, there are guidelines, like I told you. If the offence is commensurate with suspending him, or any other, definitely, the rules of the party are going to apply, because nobody is too big to be sanctioned. We want to have sanity in the party.\u201d\n\nAlso, the three senators from the state yesterday expressed their support for Governor AbdulRazaq.\n\nThe senators \u2013 Ibrahim Oloriegbe (Kwara Central), Lola Ashiru (Kwara South) and Umar Sadiq (Kwara North) \u2013 told reporters in Abuja that the governor is the authentic leader of the party in the state.\n\nThey distanced themselves from the minister\u2019s comment, saying he did not speak the minds of the party members when he said Kwara State under the current administration had \u201centered one-chance\u201d.\n\nSenator Ashiru said: \u201cOur meeting here is to assure you that Kwara, under the leadership of Governor AbdulRazaq, is doing extremely well in terms of development both physical and urban development.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure you that we don\u2019t want to escalate the issue at hand because it is totally centred on what happened two years ago. We feel we have passed that milestone. We are in a new era, a very good era, an era where the slogan of O To Ge (Enough is Enough) was orchestrated. We are happy that today, we have a new revolution in Kwara.\u201d\n\nOloriegbe said: \u201cWe are very focused on this programme (O To Ge) and what it means.\n\n\u201cAs senators, we are working harmoniously with the governor. We want to bring everybody together.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that the focus should be the people and not the individual holding a particular position.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso, the member representing Ifelodun/Oyun-Offa (Kwara) in the House of Representatives, Tijani Kayode Ismail, has said the current crisis in the Kwara State chapter of the party will not affect its chances in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe lawmaker described the crisis as a passing phase, saying those fueling it are fewer than the electorate that voted for the party in 2019.\n\nIsmail, who is the Chairman of the House Committee on Electoral Matters, said: \u201cThose fomenting the crisis in the party are not up to 20 per cent of the masses that gave us the current mandate. It is the electorate that gave us the mandate. Ninety per cent of people that voted for us in the media are not on social media.\n\n\u201cMany people making noise in the media, condemning the governor, don\u2019t have voter\u2019s cards. I am the Deputy House Chairman on Electoral Matters. We have the data of the voters.\n\n\u201cI can assure you, by God\u2019s grace, we will come back in 2023. We believe that we are trying our best to lift the state to the Next Level. We know we have a lot to be done, but we will try our best. By way of evaluation, examination or assessment, Kwarans will judge who comes back in 2023.\u201d",

          "text": "By Jesutega Onokpasa\n\nIn the buildup to the imminent inauguration of a substantive board for the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, a loud cacophony of rather perplexing calls for the commission\u2019s board \u201cto be constituted\u201d this way or, \u201creconstituted\u201d that way have been shouted over the rooftops by all manner of interest groups from all manner of quarters.\n\nYet, if one may ask, which board of the commission is supposed to be \u201cconstituted\u201d or indeed, \u201creconstituted\u201d for that matter?\n\nThe notion that the NDDC currently lacks a substantive board is a dastardly lie from the pit of hell itself and could only possibly ring true in a clime like ours where the peddling and maintenance of diabolical falsehoods has bizarrely claimed centre stage as some sort of national ethos.\n\nAs far as the law is concerned the NDDC already has a substantive board constituted by no less an authority than the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic and duly screened and confirmed by no less an authority than the Senate of the republic!\n\nIt is quite unfortunate that it required the intervention of Government Ekpemupolo, aka Tompolo, to bring about a return to the path of legality in the governance of the commission, a situation which can only serve to reinforce the notion that without violence or, at any rate, its threat, Niger Deltans should never expect justice within a Nigeria, whose development and sustenance they have, pound for pound, by far been the greatest contributors to.\n\nThis is even more pertinent against the backdrop of mounting nationwide insecurities, ever deepening divisions and quite unsettling sabre-rattling from all points of the Nigerian compass.\n\nThat aside, the idea of \u201cconstituting\u201d or \u201creconstituting\u201d a board for the NDDC is a complete nonstarter from the point of view of legality.\n\nIn the first place, the inauguration of the substantive board of the commission is aimed at correcting a blatant illegality by bringing to a close its administration contrary to law, in which case, it certainly cannot be that it is purposed to correct an illegality by its replacement with another illegality!\n\nSurely, we cannot proceed to correct a mistake by repeating the mistake!\n\nGiven the pendency, at this very moment, of a substantive board nominated by Mr. President and, confirmed by the Senate, the same president, cannot then be misguided into assaulting the constitution and, breaking the law by purporting to constitute or reconstitute the NDDC board and proceed to send a new list to the senate all over again.\n\nNeedless to say, it would amount to a most egregious constitutional abomination for the senate, of all authorities, to undermine and embarrass itself by repudiating its own earlier work and then proceed to consider any new list of fresh nominees, having already duly and honourable concluded that process more than a year ago!\n\nThere is already a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, indeed one constituted by the president and confirmed by the senate.\n\nFor the avoidance of all doubt, short of the entire board resigning even before it has been inaugurated, or, its entire membership kicking the bucket overnight, there is simply no lawful means available to us for reconstituting that already existing board or, much like a bunch of kindergarten kids with no knowledge of the law, simply pretending it doesn\u2019t exist and constituting a fresh board!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe legal mechanisms for constituting or reconstituting a board for the NDDC while a substantive board is pending are not available because they simply do not exist in the first place.\n\nWe are not a banana republic for God\u2019s sake!\n\nIn other words, there is no lawful recourse for the president in the present circumstance to \u201cconstitute\u201d or \u201creconstitute\u201d, such being actions he has already dutifully concluded in the eyes of the law.\n\nIn short, there is no board to be constituted or reconstituted; rather there is an already constituted, screened and confirmed board waiting to be inaugurated!\n\nThere should be no further tolerance for any more subterfuges to delay the lawful management of the NDDC and exclude the Niger Delta people from the legally envisaged participation in the affairs of the commission they are entitled to, through their representatives nominated by our president and confirmed by the senate.\n\nThere is already a substantive board of the commission in-waiting and it should be inaugurated first thing tomorrow morning.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe Abuja division of the Federal High Court on Wednesday said that former Minister of Finance Mrs Kemi Adeosun was ineligible for the mandatory one-year National Youth Service (NYSC).\n\nIn his judgment on the subject matter, Justice Taiwo Taiwo said Mrs Adeosun was not supposed to present herself for the National Youth Service because under the 1979 Constitution, which was in force at the time of her graduation, she was not a Nigerian citizen either at the time of her graduation or when she turned 30.\n\nJustice Taiwo held the constitution does not require the former Minister of Finance to have presented her first-degree certificate or any other certificate, including the NYSC certificate, to be appointed a minister.\n\nThe court agreed with Chief Wole Olanipekun, SAN, that the ministerial appointment of Adeosun was not illegal, neither was it unconstitutional, even without presenting the NYSC certificate.\n\nIn the judgment in a suit for constitutional interpretation filed at the court in March 2021 by the firm of Chief Wole Olanipekun, SAN, on behalf of Adeosun, the court said since the 1979 constitution, which was in force at the time did not recognise dual citizenship, Adeosun could not have served because she was a British citizen.\n\nAdeosun graduated from the University of East London in 1989 at the age of 22.\n\nThe court held that Nigeria citizenship only reverted under the extant constitution by which time Adeosun was well above 30, and, by the court decision, ineligible to participate in the NYSC scheme as the scheme is exclusively reserved for Nigeria.\n\nThe court said that it would have been a grave crime if Adeosun had taken part in the NYSC and subsequently granted all reliefs sought by Adeosun\u2019s counsel;\n\nThe declared that the plaintiff is under no constitutional disability, disadvantage, prohibition, inhibition or disqualification to hold any of the following offices established by the Constitution, to wit: offices of member of the House of Assembly of a State, a Commissioner in the State Executive Council; Governor of a State; member of the National Assembly; Minister in the Federal Executive Council or the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on the ground that she did not participate in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme, established by the National Youth Service Corps Act, CAP N84, LFN 2004.\n\nThe judge also declared that the plaintiff is not under any constitutional disability, disadvantage, prohibition, inhibition or disqualification to hold any office as member or Chairman of any of the State Executive or Federal Executive bodies established by the Constitution or otherwise, on the ground that she did not participate in the National Youth Service Corps scheme, established by the National Youth Service Corps Act, CAP N84, LFN 2004.\n\nAnother declaration by the court is that the plaintiff cannot be subjected to any penalty, forfeiture or put under any encumbrance in relation to her occupation or assumption of any of the following public offices, created by the Constitution, to wit: membership of the House of Assembly of a State, a Commissioner in the State Executive Council; Governor of a State, member of the National Assembly; Minister in the Federal Executive Council, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, membership of any of the States or Federal Executive bodies, established by the Constitution or otherwise, on the ground that she did not participate in the National Youth Service Corps scheme, established by the National Youth Service Corps Act, CAP N84, LFN 2004.\n\nJustice Taiwo further declared that the plaintiff, being a United Kingdom Citizen as of 1989 when she graduated from the University of East London, London, United Kingdom, at the age of 22 years, was ineligible to participate in the National Youth Service Corps Scheme, established by the National Youth Service Corps Act, CAP N84, LFN 2004.\n\nResponding to the judgment, Adeosun\u2019s lawyers said: \u2018Today\u2019s judgment vindicates my client. The court has made it clear that at the time she presented for public service starting from 2011 up till 2015, she was not required to perform the NYSC under the 1979 Constitution, since client graduated in 1989.\n\n\u2018Throughout client\u2019s travail which lasted 69 days, client was never in doubt about her innocence.\n\n\u2018Client chose to resign on September 14, 2018, because client did not want the case to become a distraction to the government and the public. Client also believed it would give her the opportunity to vigorously pursue a constitutional remedy to the end, to clear her name.\n\n\u2018Client wishes to state, without equivocation, that in light of all that happened, she is exploring other remedies within the law and will take the appropriate steps at the right time.\n\n\u2018The 69 days of her travail and the years following that have taken a great toll on client\u2019s reputation and caused client\u2019s family deep grief and misery.\n\n\u2018It is, however, not only a personal victory; it\u2019s also a victory for many Nigerians in the diaspora under similar conditions who are desirous to serve their country.\n\n\u2018Finally, client wishes to thank her family, friends, the legal team and numerous well-wishers for their love, care and concern throughout this difficult period. Client is pleased that, at last, the cause of justice has been served.\u2019\n\nIt would be recalled that Adeosun resigned as Finance Minister in 2018 on allegations that her NYSC discharge certificate was forged.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe controversy trailing the nomination of a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof Charles Soludo, as the flag bearer of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, has resulted into a lawsuit filed before the Abuja division of the Federal High Court.\n\nIn the originating summons, a chieftain of the party, Okoye Nwabuogo, is seeking an order of court setting aside the election and nomination of Soludo as the party\u2019s candidate for the November election.\n\nThe suit dated July 6, 2021, and filed the same day by counsel to the plaintiff, Okoro Nkemakolam, is further seeking an order restraining Soludu from parading himself as the validly or duly elected candidate of the party for the said election.\n\nIt is the case of the plaintiff, who is a card-carrying member of the party and a registered voter, that the statutory 21 days notice was not given to INEC by the party, prior to the holding of the special ward congress, held on June 15, 2021, for the election of ad hoc delegates for the nomination of the party\u2019s governorship candidate for the Anambra State gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021.\n\nListed as defendants in the pre-election suit are All Progressive Grand Alliance, Prof Charles Soludo and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nWhile urging the court to invalidate and set aside the entire primary election of the party held on June 23, the plaintiff is equally seeking an order of injunction restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC, listed as 3rd defendant), from accepting the name of or recognising Prof Soludo (the 2nd Defendant), as the candidate of APGA (the 1st defendant), for the Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6, 2021.\n\nShe is also seeking an order of the court restraining the party from holding out or in any manner howsoever and/or according to Soludo the rights or privileges as its validly or duly elected candidate for the November 6, 2021 governorship election in the state.\n\nIn addition, she is further seeking a declaration that the party, is mandatorily required, given the provision of Section 85(1) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended) to give to the 3rd defendant (INEC), the compulsory 21days statutory notice prior to the holding of the special ward congress, held on June 15, 2021, for the election of ad hoc delegates for the nomination of its governorship candidate for the Anambra State gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on November 6.\n\nA declaration that the election of 812 delegates as against the 978 delegates, as provided for in Article 11(5)(vii) of the APGA Constitution 2019, to be ad hoc delegates, to elect the governorship candidate of the party, is illegal, unlawful, invalid, null and void.\n\nShe formulated the following questions for determination by the court:\n\n\u2018Whether given the clear and unambiguous provisions of Section 85(1) of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended), the 3rd Defendant can, in the light of its two separate letters dated 18th June 2021 with REF: INEC/DEPM/UPMM/1/145 and REF: INEC/DEPM/CWO/040/11/304 which disclosed that APGA (1st Defendant), failed to give it, the mandatory 21days statutory notice, prior to the holding of the special ward congress, on 15th day of June 2021, for the election of ad hoc delegates for the nomination of the 1st Defendant\u2019s governorship candidate for the Anambra State gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021, lawfully recognise, deal with and give effect to the nomination of the 2nd Defendant through the primary election of the 1st defendant held on 23rd June 2021 as the 1st Defendant\u2019s candidate for the said governorship election. Whether given the clear provisions of Article 11(5)(vii) of the APGA Constitution 2019, which provides for the election of three delegates per ward, to be ad hoc delegates, to elect the governorship candidate of the party, the party can lawfully proceed to elect only two delegates in violation of it constitution. Whether the primary election of the 1st Defendant held on 23rd June 2021 for the purpose of electing the 1st Defendant\u2019s candidate for Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021 is not invalidated by reason of the 1st Defendant\u2019s non-compliance with the mandatory provision of Section 85(1) of the Electoral Act, 2010(as amended), and Article (5)(vii) of the APGA Constitution, 2019.\u2019\n\nIn a 31-paragraphs affidavit in support of the originating summons, the plaintiff averred:\n\n\u2018That in the said letters the 3rd Defendant expressly stated that the 1st defendant failed to give the mandatory/compulsory 21days statutory notice prior to the holding of the special ward congress held on 15th day of June 2021, for the election of ad hoc delegates for the nomination of the 1st Defendant\u2019s governorship candidate for the Anambra State gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021 and as such the 3rd Defendant did not monitor the said ward congresses and cannot attest if the purported ad hoc Delegates are products of a democratic process. \u2018That she knows as a matter of fact that notwithstanding the failure to communicate to the 3rd Defendant within the mandatory 21 days, the date for the conduct of the special ward congress, the 1st Defendant held its primary election on 23rd June 2021 utilising an ad hoc Delegate list of the purported special Ward Congress wherein the 2nd Defendant purportedly emerged as the flagbearer and forwarded the name of the 2nd Defendant who was enthroned in the said congresses to the 3rd Defendant. \u2018That the 3rd Defendant as an umpire rather than intervene to stop the 1st Defendant from further perpetuating illegality in the light of the two separate letters dated 18th June 2021 with REF: INEC/DEPM/UPMM/1/145 and REF: INEC/DEPM/CWO/040/11/304, proceeded to issue a certificate of return to the 2nd Defendant, thereby lawfully accepting, dealing with and recognising the 2nd defendant as the validly nominated candidate of the 1st defendant for the Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6. 2021. \u2018That she knows as a matter of fact that the primary election of the 1st Defendant, was not conducted in accordance with the law, and will likely prejudice the chances of her party winning the gubernatorial election, except this Honourable Court intervenes as a matter of urgency. \u2018The plaintiff stated that the 1st Defendant failed to comply with the provisions of its constitution in the conduct of the special congress held on the 15th day of June 2021 to elect ad hoc delegates for the purposes of electing the candidate/flagbearer of the 1st defendant in the Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6, 2021. \u2018That there are 326 wards in Anambra State and that as a matter of fact, there ought to be three delegates from each ward, bringing the total number of delegates 978, which is not inclusive of statutory delegates. \u2018That she knows as a matter of fact that the list submitted by the 1st Defendant to the 3rd Defendant has only 812 names as against the 978 delegates. \u2018That she knows as a matter of fact, that by the constitution of the APGA, three persons were to be elected in the said special congress and not two persons as was done by the 1st Defendant in the said special congress, held on the 15th day of June 2021. \u2018That the 3rd Defendant will continue to recognise, deal with and give effect to the nomination of the 2nd Defendant through the primary election of the 1st defendant held on 23rd June 2021 as the 1st Defendant\u2019s candidate for the said governorship election unless restrained by the Court. \u2018That the 2nd Defendant will continue to hold himself with rights or privileges as the validly or duly elected candidate of the 1st defendant for the Anambra State gubernatorial general election scheduled to hold on November 6, 2021, having been recognised by the 3rd Defendant unless restrained by the court. \u2018That her interest as a member of the 1st Defendant will be highly prejudiced except by the urgent intervention of this Honourable Court. \u2018That she had invested her resources and goodwill in the 1st Defendant, and knows as a matter of fact, that except by the urgent intervention of this Honourable Court, the goodwill of the party will be totally destroyed and her goodwill and resources lost.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the suit is yet to be assigned to a judge for adjudication.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "*Says president has exhibited poor skills in management of Nigeria\u2019s diversity\n\nBy John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nA former military governor of Kaduna state Col. Dangiwa Umar (rtd), has berated the federal government over the security situation in the country, wondering why the goveement was according undue attention to the threats by separatist movements despite the more daunting security threats posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday in Kaduna, Umar, asked the federal government to go beyond the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and pay greater attention to the more serious security challenges threatening to cripple the country.\n\nAccording to him, the activities of bandits and insurgents have resulted in the evacuation of over 20 per cent of the villages in North West and North east, while hundreds of people were being murdered, maimed and kidnapped for ransom every week as million of others have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation.\n\nUmar said bandits had abducted over 1,000 school children in the north in the past eight months, adding that over 300 others are still in captivity, with the bandits demanding humongous ransom payments.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe recent rearrest of the IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was greeted with a loud sigh of relief and celebration in some sections of the country.\n\n\u201cIt also elicited congratulatory messages to the federal government which appears overwhelmed by the intractable security challenges and in dire need of any redeeming act.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly an exaggeration of the security threat Nnamdi Kanu and indeed IPOB pose to our nation\u2019s security and unity\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is quite strange and disturbing that the federal government is according undue attention to the threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting ones posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\n\u201cHundreds are being murdered and maimed every week. Many more are kidnapped for ransom\u201d.\n\nHe lamented further that millions of people have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation. \u201cOver 1,000 school children were abducted in the past 8 months with over 300 still in the hands of the bandits and kidnappers demanding humongous ransom payments.\n\n\u201cRape of women and young girls has become a daily occurrence. Most economic activities,particularly farming, which is the mainstay of the people in these areas, are now all but impossible.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s earlier claim of having technically defeated the Boko Haram insurgency in the North east has turned out to be empty propaganda\u201d, he said.\n\nUmar maintained that \u201cContrary to this claim, the enemy has morphed into a more determined and deadly force, threatening to overrun the whole of the North east.\u201d\n\nCol Umar said, \u201cFor the average northerner living in these zones, who is barely aware of the activities of separatists, banditry, kidnappings and insurgency are of greater threat and concern to him.\u201d\n\nHe argued that, \u201cThe arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is of no serious consequence, since it does nothing to ameliorate this harsh and brutal condition.\u201d\n\nHe said however that in recognizing the right of every citizen or groups to express the desire for self determination, the use of violence should not be supported or condone.\n\n\u201cIPOB and its leader may well be responsible for some of the violence, including the murder of security personnel, arson and destruction of public and private properties for which they should be held to account.\n\n\u201cWe must however be honest enough to identify the cause of the current growing restiveness in the South East\u201d, Umar said.\n\nHe called on the government to deploy nonviolent means in addressing the problem of people agitating for self determination.\n\nThe retired army officer said, \u201cIt is self evident that justice, fairness and equity are the best means of building a united and virile nation, particularly one as diverse and fragile as Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is my long held believe that this country is more beneficial to all the federating units, if only because it provides a security umbrella to all its units.\n\n\u201cNone of them will fare better in a balkanized Nigeria due to their similar diversities.\n\n\u201cThe recognition of Nigeria as the giant of Africa is not on account of its huge oil wealth but its size, diversity as well as other potentials. These not withstanding, the nation can only remain united and prosperous when all its citizens and the component parts feel a true sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cWithout it, the nation\u2019s unity will be in serious jeopardy similar to what Nigeria is currently experiencing.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, the Buhari administration has so far exhibited poor skills in its management of our diversity.\n\n\u201cYet it has the benefit of great examples by past administrations and statesmen which should guide it.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that after the civil war from July 1967 to Jan 1970, the then Head of the Federal Military Government, General Yakubu Gowon, declared a no victor, no vanquished reconciliation and reintegration policy, noting that its implementation may not have been perfect, but it produced a guiding vision which served as a template for the reintegration of the nation.\n\nUmar\u2019s statement read: \u201cIn 1978, eight years after the civil war, the NPN (National Party of Nigeria), Presidential candidate, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, a former Commissioner of Finance in the Gowon Government, picked his running mate, Dr Alex Ekweme from the South east. \u201cThey won the 1979 Presidential election and enjoyed an enviable brotherly relationship as President and Vice President.\n\n\u201cThey won a second term in 1983. President Shagari\u2019s Government pardoned the former Biafra secessionist leader, Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu, which permitted him to return from exile in 1982.\n\n\u201cHe went on to contest a senatorial seat under the NPN.\n\n\u201cThese are in sharp contrast to the declaration of President Buhari after his election in 2015 in which he promised not to treat, on equal terms, those who gave him only 5% of their votes with those who gave him over 97% of theirs.\n\n\u201cThis may account for his government\u2019s refusal to appoint an Igbo as head of any of the security services.\n\n\u201cA review of this ill-advised policy will go a long way to neutralise the growing influence of IPOB among Ndigbo, both at home and in diaspora\u201d, he said\n\nUmar stressed that \u201cfederal government must go beyond the arrest of Kanu and pay greater attention to the more serious security challenges threatening to cripple the country completely.\n\n\u201cThe apparent failure of our security forces to deal decisively, as the President so often commands them to do, with these security threats is obviously due to the acute shortage of manpower and equipment.\n\n\u201cThese deficiencies have resulted in the thin spread of our forces and lack of timely rotation in areas of conflict. Government must massively increase security manpower and equipment. As we have seen, mere change of Service chiefs would appear far from being the solution.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Former Finance Minister, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, has said that the judgment of the Federal High court Abuja that she did not need the National Youth Service Scheme (NYSC) discharge certificate to take up ministerial appointment in the country vindicated her \u201cafter a traumatic spell.\u201d\n\nShe also said the court judgment was a victory for many Nigerians in Diaspora who were desirous to serve their fatherland.\n\nAdeosun had resigned her appointment as Minister of Finance following controversy surrounding her NYSC status as she was accused of not participating in the mandatory one year national service for tertiary institution graduates. She was also accused of presenting a forged NYSC discharged certificate.\n\nShe however instituted a suit against the Attorney General of the Federation on her eligibility for the National Youth Service Corps Scheme.\n\nDelivering judgement in Folakemi Adeosun v The Attorney General of the Federation (FHC/ABJ/CS/303/2021) Wednesday, Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court, declared that the former finance minister was not eligible to perform national service because she was not a Nigerian citizen under the 1979 Constitution (which did not provide for dual citizenship) which was in force at the time of her graduation in 1989 from a London university at 22 and when she turned 30, which was the age of exemption from service.\n\nThe court held that available facts before it proved that the former minister was a United Kingdom citizen having been born there in 1967 and remained there till 2003 when she came back to Nigeria at 36.\n\nThe court also noted that Adeosun, who became a Nigerian citizen by virtue of the 1999 Constitution which came into force on May 29, 1999, was not required by the constitution to present her first-degree certificate or any other certificate, including the NYSC certificate, before she could be appointed as a minister.\n\nIn a statement sent to THISDAY, the former minister said she was happy with official clarification by the court, adding that the judgment has vindicated her after a traumatic spell.\n\nShe also said she would at the appropriate time take all further steps necessary within the law to protect her reputation.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cMy lawyers have informed me of the judgment by the Federal High Court, Abuja, in the case of Folakemi Adeosun v The Attorney General of the Federation (FHC/ABJ/CS/303/2021) in which the court, presided over by Honourable Justice Taiwo Taiwo, ruled that the constitution does not require me to present my first-degree certificate or any other certificate, including the NYSC certificate, to be appointed a Minister. More importantly, he also ruled that I was not eligible to perform NYSC by virtue of the constitution. This is the position I have always maintained and am happy for this official clarification.\n\n\u201cThe ruling vindicates me after a very traumatic spell. It is, however, not only a personal victory; it\u2019s also a victory for many Nigerians in the Diaspora under similar conditions who are desirous to serve their country.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank God, my family, friends, my counsel, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) and numerous well-wishers for their love, care and concern throughout this difficult period, which has lasted 3 whole years.\n\n\u201cI wish to add in light of the court\u2019s ruling, I will at the appropriate time and without hesitation, take all further steps necessary within the law to protect my reputation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I imagine that everybody in the trust of public funds, especially this laws will be as prudent and economical as possible\u201d.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in a request letter dated May 18, 2021 and read at Senate plenary on June 2, 2021 asked the upper legislative chamber to approve N2.3trn external loan to fund the 2021 budget deficit\n\nThe request letter was subsequently referred to its committee on Local Debts and Foreign Loan for further legislative work.\n\nPresident Buhari had in the letter sought upper chamber\u2019s approval of N2.3trn ($6.18bn) external borrowing to fund the 2021 budget deficit of N5.6trn.\n\nThe President had in the letter indicated that the loan would enable the federal government to fund critical infrastructural projects in health, education, etc.\n\nThe letter came barely a month after the Senate approved the the sum of $1.5bn and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the federal government.\n\nThe loans were part of the $5.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings President Muhammadu Buhari had, in May, 2020, asked the Red Chamber to approve to finance various priority projects of the federal government and to support the state governments facing fiscal challenges.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The senate has passed a bill to upgrade the Maritime Academy of Nigeria in Oron, Akwa-Ibom state, into a full-fledge university for maritime studies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also passed a bill to establish the Institute of Information and Communication Technology in Ogoja, Cross River state.\n\nBoth bills were passed during plenary on Wednesday after the presentation and consideration of two separate reports by the senate committee on tertiary institutions and TETFUND.\n\nSandy Onuh, a senator from Cross River, gave the presentation on behalf of Ahmad Babba Kaita, the committee\u2019s chairman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSandy said upgrading the Academy into a university would help Nigeria in achieving the prerequisites of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) convention on standard of training, certification and watch-keeping for seafarers.\n\nHe added that the university will afford students the opportunity to specialise in international shipping and waterways transportation, port operations, management as well as exploitation and exploration of oil and gas as boost for Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nHe observed that Nigeria presently recorded losses in the maritime sector, a development which was largely due to deficits in manpower and seafarers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe decried that the country committed resources in search of university degrees, postgraduate research degrees and professionals from all facets of the maritime industry outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe maritime environment requires highly trained personnel to manage the country\u2019s enormous natural endowment and resources on our offshore, international shipping, oil and gas and expansion of coastline with waterways for a viable coastal and inland water transport industry,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the upgrade of the Maritime Academy into a university would benefit host communities in the south-south geopolitical zone and the country as a whole.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

The concept is about a \u201cface me and face you\u201d house where we have so many characters with conflicting behaviours and attitudes. We have a Muslim cleric, a prophet, a man that sells Indian hemp, prostitutes, retired soldier and cybercriminals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe essence of the series is to create a comedy that will make sense. As far as we are trying to make it humorous as possible, we also want to touch some social messages that affect our environment. \u2018Ile Alayo\u2019 is a comedy flick that I know people will appreciate. I can assure that the sponsors will get value for what they have invested.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Alex Jian, the chief executive officer of StarTimes, said the partnership comes as a result of the company\u2019s desire to satisfy the growing demands of viewers for local content.\n\n\u201cNollywood is the second largest content production center in the world, in the past 10 years, StarTimes has come to the industry in our own way, whether through content acquisition and production,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, when demands from our audience increased, we began to realise we\u2019re not doing enough.

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

Six tons of hard muscle and bones will do a cruel number on any lawn, no matter how stubborn the grass is\u2014it just has to bow down to the ancestors.\n\nBut what happens when the elephants in question are not two, but three of the biggest Subscription Video-On-Demand (SVOD) platforms in Africa!\n\nWhat\u2019s the big news?\n\nWell, the grass just got greener on the Netflix side of town.\n\nNextflix just announced a mobile-only subscription starting at $3.99\u2014 that\u2019s more than half the price of its basic subscription plan.\n\nSomebody play Dorime.\n\nThe new plan caters for the majority of its African audience who stream Netflix from their mobile. And is currently available to users in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and other SubSaharan countries.\n\nThat\u2019s not all.\n\nNetflix also launched a Play Partial Download feature that allows users to play Netflix videos which haven\u2019t downloaded completely.\n\nThis means that if your connection cuts off while you\u2019re downloading an episode of Blood and Water, you can still watch the fraction that actually entered your device, and resume your download when you get a stronger connection.\n\nAre you excited? Because we are!\n\nBut this news isn\u2019t exactly unexpected, given the fact that Netflix\u2019s been in a streaming battle with two other African SVOD elephants, iRokoTV and Showmax.\n\nIn fact, with each party trying to outdo the other with more customer-friendly updates, it was actually pretty predictable, and we\u2019ll show you why.\n\nNetflix\u2019s streaming tussle in Africa\n\nWhen Netflix arrived in Africa in 2016, everyone anticipated a struggle with reigning SVOD champion, iRokoTV, even though Netflix offered mostly foreign movies and while iRokoTV focused on Nollywood.\n\nAs expected Netflix proved its mettle by edging into the African movies market too with blockbuster movies like October 1, Lion Heart, The boy who harnessed the wind, Azali, amongst others.\n\nWith Netflix pushing on one end, and a decline in the spending income of its primary market, Nigerians, iRokoTV faced its abroad audience\u2014who can blame them, really?\n\nAnd just when Netflix thought it was its turn to hog the spotlight, boom!\n\nAnother bull elephant in the ring\n\nIts name? Showmax. A MultiChoice platform, which gained increasing popularity during Season 5 of the Big Brother Naija show.\n\nBut we didn\u2019t know Showmax had another ace in its pocket besides BBN.\n\nIn April, Showmax announced that it would offer a new and affordable mobile plan price\u201420% less than the original plan price\u2014to accommodate its users who might be having it rough after the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe know that consumers are under pressure at the moment and we believe this change will be appreciated by our mobile customers as will the decision not to increase any of our other prices\u201d, said Yolisa Phahle, MultiChoice Group CEO for Connected Video.\n\nNetflix in the mud.\n\nBut not for long\u2026\n\nObviously, with the release of this cheaper plan, Netflix may come out on top in this SVOD race to corner the African market.\n\nHowever, all eyes are on iRokoTV now.

          "title": "From iPhone shortages to price surges: The global chip scarcity is affecting Africa",
          "text": "Car manufacturers in Egypt have had to cut down on production due to a recent lack of electronic control units (ECUs), which are major components in vehicle electrical systems. In South Africa, more than 20,000 people that signed up for Supersonic\u2019s Unlimited Air Fibre service are still waiting to be connected since February, as the company continues to face difficulties getting crucial router components.\n\nThe aforementioned companies operate in two distinct industries (automobile and ICT) and \u2013 apart from the consumers they sell to \u2013 do not really have much in common. But like many others in several industries across the world, they have seen their businesses disrupted by the same problem.\n\nTechnology companies globally have recently been grappling with the shortage of one of the smallest components used in producing millions of tech products yearly \u2013 semiconductor chips.\n\nMonths into the shortage, effects from the ongoing global chip scarcity have spread far and wide, across industries and the globe. Automotive and consumer hardware companies are being hit the worst and those in Africa have not been spared.\n\nDistributors of Acer products in South Africa \u2013 Mustek, Rectron, and Homemation \u2013 told ITWeb that the severe shortage has caused a ripple effect across all industry verticals, leading to a shortage of laptops, tablets, printing and scanning equipment, and peripherals.\n\nThe automobile industry is one of the hardest hit by the semiconductor shortage with carmakers across the world forced to slash production.\n\nPrice jumps as over 100 industries suffer\n\nAn analysis by U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs, estimates that the semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way. This is due to the fact that chips are more widely used today. They used to be present in only personal computers and mobile phones a little over a decade ago. Now, in the wake of rapid digital advancements, semiconductors are in everything from vehicles to washing machines.\n\nManufacturers have struggled to keep up with the huge demand in recent months, a problem blamed partly on supply chain disruptions caused by national Covid-19 lockdowns, uncertainties stemming from the U.S.-China trade war, as well as a drought in Taiwan, home to the largest semiconductor maker in the world.\n\nIn fact, Taiwan is one of the four countries in Asia behind nearly three-quarters of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Of these countries, only two produce the most cutting-edge chips.\n\nThe Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone provides 92% of cutting-edge chips globally \u2013 with Samsung accounting for the rest \u2013 and 60% of chips used by automobile companies. This leaves companies with few options to get chips when the producers run out of capacity and also raises concerns about the concentration of chip manufacturing in relatively few countries.\n\nThe global semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nU.S. tech giant Apple has been significantly affected as it is one of TSMC\u2019s biggest clients. In South Africa, many stores run by the company\u2019s authorised reseller, iStore, have reportedly experienced shortages in iPhone stock. Meanwhile, TechCabal was unable to reach the Nigerian unit of iStore for comments as of the time this article was published.\n\nGoing by the law of demand and supply in economics, there is bound to be an increase in the price of a product when there\u2019s a scarcity, as long as all things remain equal. So the global chip shortage has naturally led to price increases and there\u2019s not so much local players can do about it.\n\n\u201cThese are not components domestic car makers can produce,\u201d head of the Egyptian Association of Automobile Manufacturers, Khaled Saad, reportedly told local press. \u201cThe problem is already putting pressure on car prices domestically and it is expected to raise prices further.\u201d\n\nReports show many local stores in South Africa are now selling well above the retail prices suggested by manufacturers.\n\nAccording to David Kan, CEO of Mustek, the ongoing shortage is the worst in more than three decades. \u201cIn my 34 years of working within the IT industry, I have never experienced or seen such shortages. Pricing has gone through the roof!\u201d\n\nAny end in sight?\n\nThe multifaceted global chip shortage problem is showing no signs of abating.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, there were hopes that the supply chain issues would have been sorted by the summer. However, it is unlikely that will be the case, even though the summer does not end until September.\n\nIndustry analysts also can\u2019t seem to agree on when the shortage will end, with predictions ranging from the second half of 2021 to the beginning of 2022. Some experts say the effects of the crisis could last well into 2023. However, the general consensus seems to be that things will get even worse before it gets better as there is no immediate solution.\n\nSome global chipmakers \u2013 such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel \u2013 are already investing to expand their capacity and ramp up production. The U.S. is also working towards investing billions in its semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIn Africa, Kenya\u2019s Dedan Kimathi University of Technology partnered with American firm 4Wave Inc on the launch of the country\u2019s first semiconductor factory earlier this year.\n\nA future partnership between local car agents and brand owners to set up local facilities for manufacturing high-tech components like semiconductors is also being mooted among automobile stakeholders in Egypt.\n\nBut these moves can do little to ease off the crisis immediately as it will take months, if not several years, for the investments to mature.\n\nFor now, tech products are bound to keep fighting for limited chips, manufacturers grappling with delayed production, and consumers suffering from shortages and price increases.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "What telcos and banks look for in fintech partnerships",
          "text": "Fintech is growing in Africa thanks to strategic partnerships between startups, banks and diverse categories of global companies. According to McKinsey & Company, at least five models of partnerships are currently favoured.\n\nOne model is a vendor relationship: a bank that needs to quickly go to market with an innovation opts to ride on a fintech\u2019s technology, avoiding the hassle of building from scratch.\n\nIn a distribution model, a digital-only bank (say Kuda) partners with traditional banks to offer in-branch deposits, ATM withdrawals and card issuance. Chaka, the recently licensed stock trading app, has been able to provide investment options to users by working with brokerage partners.\n\nOther partnership models from McKinsey\u2019s research include strategic Investments (like Visa\u2019s 20% stake in Interswitch); joint ventures (where two entities create a common product together); and outright acquisitions \u2013 the popular example over the past year being Paystack\u2019s acquisition by Stripe.\n\nWhatever the partnership type, the aim is to win. For a startup, a long term win might be a successful exit or Initial Public Offering (IPO). Otherwise, the immediate goal is to accelerate growth at a rate they wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve if they worked alone.\n\nBut partnerships don\u2019t automatically work just because two parties have good intentions or similar ambitions.\n\nNot a piece of cake\n\n\u201cSuccess should not be taken for granted and both parties need to be well prepared,\u201d says Mayowa Kuyoro, partner at McKinsey and head of its West Africa financial services practice.\n\nAlignment on resources, culture and regulatory compliance, among other factors, is key.\n\nIt\u2019s a consideration that is always on Abubakar Suleiman\u2019s mind. As CEO of Sterling Bank, Suleiman receives partnership offers regularly and believes himself open to having many conversations.\n\nBut he has identified a problem: \u201cMore often than not, we are not clear about the problem we are trying to solve,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cWe are trying to jump into partnerships because we think there is profit to be shared.\u201d\n\nPartnership conversations have worked better for Suleiman when the initial focus was on problems and the capacity to solve them. And so he wishes to encourage an approach that frames partnerships in terms of capabilities, not institutions.\n\nFor example, a startup that needs a partner for regulatory issues should go for the most capable and experienced firm on the subject. It should not matter whether this firm is a big bank or whatever else.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the table?\n\nThat said, the size of rewards at stake for both parties matters.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make sure the economics work out for everybody,\u201d says Tayo Oviosu, co-founder and CEO of Paga.\n\nHe cites the example of Paga\u2019s partnership with Interswitch in the 2010s which, though initially successful in terms of returns to both parties, tapered off for a while. It raised a need for a review after which Paga decided it was in its best interest to plug directly into every other billing services provider in Nigeria.\n\nRia, the money transfer service provider, operates in 43 African countries. According to Robert Kotei, operations director for Africa, startups and companies present beyond one country can be more appealing to multinational companies looking for partnerships.\n\nHowever, sometimes a startup may need to patiently prove itself before landing big partnerships.\n\nWhile getting Bankly off the ground in 2019, Tomilola Majekodunmi faced the dilemma of deciding what partners she needed for the startup\u2019s ambition to digitalise contributory savings networks known as ajo. To achieve this, Bankly planned to work with telcos.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out, partly because the potential partners were already looking to directly offer services similar to what Bankly proposed. They did not see a unique advantage to entice them towards a partnership.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a fair or just partnership either because we were too young or too small for these big players,\u201d Majekodunmi said. So Bankly spent two years building an agent network which now numbers 15,000 agents across Nigeria.\n\nMinimum viable partnerships\n\nElsa Muzzolini, a general manager for MTN\u2019s mobile financial services, acknowledges the difficulty in partnering with relatively small startups. Three factors, she said, are often at play.\n\nParties may have different expectations for how long deals take to complete. They may diverge on the initially agreed scope, and finding the precise contact person who can activate decisions can be hard.\n\nWhere these factors come together, partnerships can work. But Muzzolini would like startups to seek avenues for collaboration that bypass the formal phases that a typical partnership entails.\n\n\u201cCan we do a lighter form of partnership? Get my API, run with it. Maybe at a later stage as your numbers grow, we can discuss co-branding and other things.\u201d\n\nFollow all TechCabal Live conversations on our YouTube channel.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

This combines solar power supply and battery storage, and clients can integrate this model into their existing power channels like an electrical grid or diesel/fuel generators.\n\nFounded in 2017 to reduce the cost of electricity and tackle the issue of epileptic power supply faced by businesses in Africa, Daystar Power has since expanded its operations. Currently, it has branches in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Togo.\n\nDaystar Power\u2019s CEO and Co-founder, Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, believes that the funds will multiply their installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power.\n\nThis fund complements their former investments of $42 million. With a $38 million Series B raise in January and a $4 million funding for their Ghana expansion, this brings it to $62 million in 2021.\n\nA sustainable power supply is essential to nation-building. Startups and small businesses in Nigeria and Africa at large have long suffered the problem of insufficient electricity, and funding for renewable energy companies will go a long way in helping to diminish the dastardly economic effects of this problem.",

          "text": "Self-service ticketing platform, Tix Africa has closed a six-figure pre-seed round to scale its event apps. The company also plans to expand operations to Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, and Egypt in H2 of 2021.\n\nThis raise will be used to expand the company\u2019s development team, revamp its organiser mobile app, develop additional products, and launch Tix Pro, a recurring subscription-based service that it plans to launch tomorrow.\n\nThe round was led by HoaQ \u2014 a community of creators and operators backing African startups \u2014 with participation from Buycoins\u2019 Ire Aderinokun, and several unnamed angel investors.\n\nIn 2019, The company had previously raised an undisclosed amount with funding from Lagos-based VC firm, Microtraction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Festival Coins and EatDrinkLagos festival creators, Folayemi Agusto and Nosa Oyegun, Tix was created to plug the gap in user data readily available to event organisers.\n\nFrom running the festival since 2015, they had encountered challenges like accurately collating guest details, payments, and ticketing.\n\nIn 2018, Oyegun, Timi Ajiboye, and Opemipo Aikomo started working on what would eventually become Tix. At first, users could only buy tickets, while event organisers could only list an event for sale\n\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic helped to kickstart other features like support for virtual events integrated with Zoom \u2014 which enabled organisers to host events on the online conference platform without a subscription \u2014 invite-only events, and custom fields for requesting specific information.\n\nCurrently, the platform makes it easy for organisers to create and monetise live or virtual events, create customisable event pages, secure payment collection via Paystack. It also gives guests a seamless way to book and attend live occasions.\n\nPer its statement, the team is working on developing a native virtual meeting space for its users. As part of its new development, it will also enable them to store balances in a digital wallet, which can be transferred between events for payments on the company\u2019s RFID wristbands \u2014 a product regular attendees of the EatDrinkLagos festival will be familiar with.\n\nAccording to Brookings Institution\u2019s 2018 Africa tourism potential report, by 2030, consumer spending on tourism, hospitality, and recreation in Africa is projected to reach about $261.77 billion. However, it was one of the sectors heavily hit by the pandemic.\n\nInterestingly, Tix claims that its revenue grew 90% year-on-year in H1 2021, especially as it began offering virtual events integrated with Zoom after lockdown measures were eased.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Agusto, \u201cThe new capital will enable us to scale quicker and to integrate the currently separate products and services we offer, including an app offering event attendees a marketplace where they can buy, trade and resell tickets securely. We\u2019re really excited to expand our platform to other markets across the continent, potentially enabling users to attend events they may otherwise not have known about.\u201d\n\nAgusto is an experienced hand in the hospitality industry, having worked in companies like Andela and Airtel Nigeria. On the other hand, Oyegun has worked in marketing and related roles in the past at companies like Stanbic IBTC and 4Twenty3 Marketing Agency.\n\nIt is this knowledge that Joe Kinvi, Managing Partner, HoaQ says spurred the community to invest.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to back a truly enterprising and innovative team. Folayemi and Nosa deeply understand this space and have built Tix.Africa to cater for the markets they will be serving. We are confident that their vision to adapt their offering and expand their tech team and product offerings will fuel their continued growth and development in the coming years.\u201d he says.",

          "text": "Former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, on Wednesday, celebrated a court judgment which trivialised her failure to participate in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme prior her appointment in 2015.\n\nIn a statement, the former minister described the judgment as vindicating her \u201cafter a very traumatic spell\u201d, although she was silent on the forgery of the NYSC exemption certificate she was caught to have committed to be appointed minister in 2015.\n\nThe judgement, too, was silent on the forgery scandal. This is because the minister who instituted the suit apparently to obtain a judicial clearance did not present it before the judge for a review.\n\nBut despite the judgement leaving the forgery allegation hanging around her neck, Mrs Adeosun issued a subtle threat to institute a legal action, perhaps against PREMIUM TIMES, whose report exposed the forgery scandal in 2018.\n\n\u201cI wish to add in light of the court\u2019s ruling, I will at the appropriate time and without hesitation, take all further steps necessary within the law to protect my reputation,\u201d her statement read in part.\n\nTaiwo Taiwo, the judge of the Federal High Court in Abuja, said in his judgement, that the former minister did not need an NYSC certificate to be appointed a minister or elected into a legislative house at either the federal or state level.\n\nBut the verdict left the more serious allegation that she forged a certificate of the NYSC purporting to have exempted her from the scheme unaddressed.\n\nRevelations\n\nA PREMIUM TIMES investigative report had exposed how she skipped the scheme and went on to forge a certificate purporting that she was granted an exemption by the NYSC.\n\nShe was forced to resign following PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 revelation in 2018.\n\nShe admitted in her resignation letter to the President that she realised that the NYSC certificate she presented was \u201cnot genuine\u201d after the PREMIUM TIMES report.\n\nShe also admitted presenting the same certificate to be appointed the Commissioner for Finance in home Ogun State in 2011.\n\nThe judgement given in her favour on Wednesday appears to be at variance with the NYSC law, which stipulates that the one year-long service is compulsory for all Nigerians who graduate from universities or equivalent institutions at less than 30 years of age.\n\nEligible Nigerians who skipped the service are liable to be sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and/or N2,000 fine, according to Section 13 of the NYSC law.\n\nRead her full statement:\n\nMy lawyers have informed me of the judgment by the Federal High Court, Abuja, in the case of Folakemi Adeosun v The Attorney General of the Federation (FHC/ABJ/CS/303/2021) in which the court, presided over by Honourable Justice Taiwo Taiwo, ruled that the constitution does not require me to present my first-degree certificate or any other certificate, including the NYSC certificate, to be appointed a Minister. More importantly, he also ruled that I was not eligible to perform NYSC by virtue of the constitution. This is the position I have always maintained and am happy for this official clarification.\n\nThe ruling vindicates me after a very traumatic spell. It is, however, not only a personal victory; it\u2019s also a victory for many Nigerians in the Diaspora under similar conditions who are desirous to serve their country.\n\nI wish to thank God, my family, friends, my counsel, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) and numerous well-wishers for their love, care and concern throughout this difficult period, which has lasted 3 whole years.\n\nI wish to add in light of the court\u2019s ruling, I will at the appropriate time and without hesitation, take all further steps necessary within the law to protect my reputation.\n\nI thank you all.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKemi Adeosun",

          "text": "Col. Dangiwa Umar (rtd), elder statesman and a former military governor of Kaduna state, has attacked the President Muhammadu Buhari led federal government over the security situation in the country, wondering why the goveement was according undue attention to the threats posed by separatists despite having more dangerous security threats posed by bandits and insurgents in the North.\n\nUmar in a statement on Wednesday , asked the federal government to go beyond the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and pay greater attention to the more serious security challenges threatening to cripple the country.\n\nHe argued that the activities of bandits and insurgents have resulted in the evacuation of over 20 per cent of the villages in North West and North East, while hundreds of people were being murdered, maimed and kidnapped for ransom every week as million of others have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation.\n\nAccording to him, bandits had abducted over 1,000 school children in the north in the past eight months, adding that over 300 others are still in captivity, with the bandits demanding humongous ransom payments.\n\nUmar pointed out that the case of agitation in the Southeast is understandable and boils down to injustice, which he accused the Buhari government of perpetuating.\n\n\u201cThe recent rearrest of the IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was greeted with a loud sigh of relief and celebration in some sections of the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt also elicited congratulatory messages to the federal government which appears overwhelmed by the intractable security challenges and in dire need of any redeeming act.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly an exaggeration of the security threat Nnamdi Kanu and indeed IPOB pose to our nation\u2019s security and unity.\n\n\u201cIt is quite strange and disturbing that the federal government is according undue attention to the threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting ones posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\n\u201cHundreds are being murdered and maimed every week. Many more are kidnapped for ransom.\u201d\n\nThe retired military general lamented that millions of people in the north have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation, while the government pays little attention.\n\nHe said, \u201cOver 1,000 school children were abducted in the past 8 months with over 300 still in the hands of the bandits and kidnappers demanding humongous ransom payments.\n\n\u201cRape of women and young girls has become a daily occurrence. Most economic activities,particularly farming, which is the mainstay of the people in these areas, are now all but impossible.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s earlier claim of having technically defeated the Boko Haram insurgency in the North east has turned out to be empty propaganda\u201d, he said.\n\nUmar maintained that \u201cContrary to this claim, the enemy has morphed into a more determined and deadly force, threatening to overrun the whole of the North east.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cFor the average northerner living in these zones, who is barely aware of the activities of separatists, banditry, kidnappings and insurgency are of greater threat and concern to him.\n\n\u201cThe arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is of no serious consequence, since it does nothing to ameliorate this harsh and brutal condition.\u201d\n\nHe noted, however, that in recognizing the right of every citizen or groups to express the desire for self determination, the use of violence should not be supported or condone.\n\n\u201cIPOB and its leader may well be responsible for some of the violence, including the murder of security personnel, arson and destruction of public and private properties for which they should be held to account.\n\n\u201cWe must however be honest enough to identify the cause of the current growing restiveness in the South East\u201d, Umar said.\n\nHe called on the government to deploy nonviolent means in addressing the problem of people agitating for self determination, while blaming injustice for the agitation.\n\n\u201cIt is self evident that justice, fairness and equity are the best means of building a united and virile nation, particularly one as diverse and fragile as Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is my long held believe that this country is more beneficial to all the federating units, if only because it provides a security umbrella to all its units.\n\n\u201cNone of them will fare better in a balkanized Nigeria due to their similar diversities.\n\n\u201cThe recognition of Nigeria as the giant of Africa is not on account of its huge oil wealth but its size, diversity as well as other potentials. These not withstanding, the nation can only remain united and prosperous when all its citizens and the component parts feel a true sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cWithout it, the nation\u2019s unity will be in serious jeopardy similar to what Nigeria is currently experiencing.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, the Buhari administration has so far exhibited poor skills in its management of our diversity.\n\n\u201cYet it has the benefit of great examples by past administrations and statesmen which should guide it.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that after the civil war from July 1967 to Jan 1970, the then Head of the Federal Military Government, General Yakubu Gowon, declared a no victor, no vanquished reconciliation and reintegration policy, noting that its implementation may not have been perfect, but it produced a guiding vision which served as a template for the reintegration of the nation.\n\nUmar\u2019s statement read: \u201cIn 1978, eight years after the civil war, the NPN (National Party of Nigeria), Presidential candidate, Alhaji Shehu Shagari, a former Commissioner of Finance in the Gowon Government, picked his running mate, Dr Alex Ekweme from the South east. \u201cThey won the 1979 Presidential election and enjoyed an enviable brotherly relationship as President and Vice President.\n\n\u201cThey won a second term in 1983. President Shagari\u2019s Government pardoned the former Biafra secessionist leader, Chief Odumegwu Ojukwu, which permitted him to return from exile in 1982.\n\n\u201cHe went on to contest a senatorial seat under the NPN. These are in sharp contrast to the declaration of President Buhari after his election in 2015 in which he promised not to treat, on equal terms, those who gave him only 5% of their votes with those who gave him over 97% of theirs.\n\n\u201cThis may account for his government\u2019s refusal to appoint an Igbo as head of any of the security services.\n\n\u201cA review of this ill-advised policy will go a long way to neutralise the growing influence of IPOB among Ndigbo, both at home and in diaspora\u201d, he said\n\nUmar stressed that \u201cfederal government must go beyond the arrest of Kanu and pay greater attention to the more serious security challenges threatening to cripple the country completely.\n\n\u201cThe apparent failure of our security forces to deal decisively, as the President so often commands them to do, with these security threats is obviously due to the acute shortage of manpower and equipment.\n\n\u201cThese deficiencies have resulted in the thin spread of our forces and lack of timely rotation in areas of conflict. Government must massively increase security manpower and equipment. As we have seen, mere change of Service chiefs would appear far from being the solution.\u201d",
          "summary": "Umar pointed out that the case of agitation in the Southeast is understandable and boils down to injustice, which he accused the Buhari government of perpetuating.\n\u201cThe recent rearrest of the IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, was greeted with a loud sigh of relief and celebration in some sections of the country,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis is clearly an exaggeration of the security threat Nnamdi Kanu and indeed IPOB pose to our nation\u2019s security and unity.\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s earlier claim of having technically defeated the Boko Haram insurgency in the North east has turned out to be empty propaganda\u201d, he said.\n\u201cThey won the 1979 Presidential election and enjoyed an enviable brotherly relationship as President and Vice President.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has attacked Minister of Justice and Solicitor-General of the Government of Alberta, Canada, Kelechi Madu over his comments on the arrest Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), describing him as an empty barrel.\n\nMadu had criticised Malami over Kanu\u2019s controversial arrest, calling him a disgrace to the rule of law, and not worthy to be an officer of the court.\n\n\u201cHe has shown himself to be a bigot who does not understand what it means to live in a pluralistic society governed by the dictates of the rule of law,\u201d Madu\u2019s statement read.\n\nHowever, in a rejoinder on Wednesday, Malami called the Canadian state official ignoramus and eccentric, adding that his views are weird to the legal profession.\n\nThe AGF said it is unfortunate that Madu faulted the internationally recognised manner through which Kanu who jumped bail was re-arrested and brought back to face trial.\n\n\u201cIt was abundantly clear that bench warrant was lawfully and judiciously procured through judicial process by a competent court of law, whose bail condition Nnamdi Kanu breached with impunity.\n\n\u201cThere was no illegality in the entire process and the question of illegality does not even arise. It is a common principle of the law that he who comes to equity must come with clean hands,\u201d Malami said.\n\nMalami said Kanu has enjoyed representation by counsel of his choice and was never denied a right of choice of counsel or recourse to one, even when he symbolises a proscribed association (IPOB).\n\n\u201cWhere was the so-called Madu when Nnamdi Kanu was inciting violence against the country? Why, as a lawyer, would Madu support a fugitive who jumped bail and accused of terrorism and treasonable felony? What stopped Madu from voicing out dissent on the atrocities of Kanu and their group?\n\n\u201cIt is important to educate the likes of Keleche Madu that both Nigeria (his country of birth) and Canada (where he claims to be practising law) are signatories to the Multinational Treaty Agreement where, among others, fugitive fleeing justice in nations with similar agreement could be brought back to face justice.\n\n\u201cIt is a pity that as a Solicitor General of a province, Madu failed to keep himself acquainted with the provisions of general laws of the country where he stays as well as international laws.\n\n\u201cWe wish to draw the attention of Madu to the provisions of Consolidated Act Criminal Code under the Canadian Law R.S., C 1985, c. C-46:1-2 on Treason and other Offences vis:\n\n\u201c46(1) Every one commits high treason who, in Canada: (a) Kills or attempts to kill Her Majesty or does her any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maims or wounds her, or imprisons or restrains her,\n\n\u201c(b) Levels war against Canada or does any act thereto; or (C) Assist an enemy at war with Canada or any armed forces against whom Canadian Forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between Canada and the country whose forces they are. 46(2) Every one commits treason who, in Canada (a) Use force or violence for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Canada or a province;\n\n\u201c(b) Without lawful authority, communicates or makes available to an agent of a state other than Canada, military or scientific information or any sketch, plan, model, article, note or document of a military or scientific character that he knows or ought to know may be used by that state for a purpose prejudicial to the safety of defence of Canada;\n\n\u201c(c) Conspires with any person to commit high treason or do anything mentioned in paragraph; (d ) Forms an intention to do anything that is high treason or that is mentioned in paragraph; (e) Conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) or forms an intention to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) and manifests intention by and overt act.\n\n\u201cWe advise the so-called \u2018learned man\u2019 to shelve his arrogance and learn to study the law books before opening his mouth to disgrace himself before the right thinking members of the society thereby attracting to himself criticism that may propel doubt about his suitability for the job he claims to be doing now, after moving out of his country of origin in which he fails to excel,\u201d the reply concluded.",

You will recall that our State has over the last one decade shown consistency in our implementation of a wide array of Social Protection Programmes which continues to impact very significantly on the lives of our citizens and has earned us the pride of place as a leading State on the Human Development Index.\n\n\u201cOnly recently, we commenced the feeding of 30, 000 persons who are poor and are vulnerable on a monthly basis, as part of our own unique way of cushioning the effect of the current economic challenges on the poor and vulnerable in our State,\u201d Oyetola said.\n\nThe governor lauded President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development,\n\nHajiya Sadiyah Umar Farouq for their sustained passion and commitment that have ensured the success of the National Social Investment Programmes.\n\nAccording to him, it is on record that the wide array of the Social Investment Programmes under the Buhari-led Administration, covering the N-Power Graduate and Non Graduate Scheme for Youths; the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme, involving primaries 1-3 pupils; Conditional Cash Transfer with N5, 000 per month paid to beneficiaries and the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (Market moni, trader moni, and Farmer moni), are the largest and perhaps the most ambitious in the history of our country.\n\nIn her remark, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development,\n\nHajiya Sadiyah Umar Farouq, said the flag-off of the training of 5000 Independent Monitors was aimed at complementing the quick actualisation of the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) created by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016.\n\nThe training which according to her was carried out across the country was initiated to ensure that each of the trained independent monitors keep a check on a designated number of beneficiaries of the National Social Investment Programmes in their respective designated Local Government Areas.\n\nThe Minister who was represented by the Director, Finance and Administration, Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Mr. Matthew Dada, said the initiative would further help to strength the existing partnership and mutual recognition of the need to do more on the National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP).\n\nShe said the initiative would go a long way to foster and bring more Nigerians under the umbrella of the government\u2019s social protection mechanism as part of efforts to look at scaling up the numbers of the pupils benefiting from the programme as directed by the President as over 9million pupils currently benefit from 1 free nutritious meal a day during the school term nationwide.\n\n\u201cYou may recall that we flagged of the training of 5000 Independent Monitors for the National Social Investment Programme in Abuja on Thursday 4th February 2021. The training was carried out across the Country from February 2021 to April 2021.\n\n\u201cToday we are here to distribute Engagement Letters and Devices to the Trained Independent Monitors. These Devices are equipped with an Application that will be used to report on monitoring activities of the trained Independent Monitors,\u201d she added.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the Governor on Social Intervention Programmes, Mr. Abimbola Bello, applauded President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Oyetola for taking the welfare and well-being of the people as priority.\n\nHe attributed the successful implementation of some of the government\u2019s social protection policies to unflinching support received from Governor Oyetola who he said had demonstrated rare leadership quality at reducing poverty and hunger to insignificant minimum.\n\nBello who disclosed that over one million Osun citizens have benefitted from various State and National social intervention programmes of the government urged the citizens to continue to support the progressive governments in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have already trained the independent monitors that we have inaugurated today. These people are selected across the State to monitor the four cardinal social intervention programmes under the National Social Investment Programmes.\n\n\u201cThe beneficiaries will be paid on monthly basis running for a year as the required devices have been given to them to carry out the assignment. But my advice for them is to be diligent and perform the duties with topmost sincerity while they are expected to be conscious of the fact that there are monitors for monitors,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Former US President Donald Trump has said that he will file class-action lawsuits against Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and Sundar Pichai, the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, and Google, respectively.\n\nThey censor users, according to the former President.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, Trump announced the suits. The news was initially reported by Axios.\n\nThe complaints were filed in the Southern District of Florida after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the January 6 insurgency due to the potential of violence. They\u2019re an outgrowth of the right\u2019s continuing battle on Big Tech, which claims that internet companies restrict conservative perspectives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m filing as the lead class representative a major class-action lawsuit against the big tech giants, including Facebook, Google, and Twitter as well as their executives,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAccording to Business Insider, he is asking the court to impose punitive penalties on the tech corporations, and that further lawsuits are likely to follow.\n\n\u201cOur case will prove that this censorship is unlawful, unconstitutional, and un-American,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn recent decades, the former President has threatened a large number of lawsuits, but just a few have been brought.\n\nA request for comment from Facebook was not immediately returned. Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe epidemic, social instability, and the 2020 presidential election have increased public pressure on social media platforms to tighten their content policing.\n\nWhen Twitter put warning labels to his tweets challenging the legitimacy of mail-in voting for the 2020 presidential election in mid-2020, companies began cracking down on Trump\u2019s posts.\n\nHe and other Republicans have been increasingly critical of mainstream digital platforms for allegedly having a liberal agenda and discriminating against conservative users, despite the fact that this assumption is unsupported by data.\n\nRight-wing content thrives online, according to data. The right\u2019s claims of censorship, according to a group of NYU researchers earlier this year, are simply a sort of deception.\n\nThings got even worse when he was suspended by Twitter and Facebook for his role in the January 6 violence. Even if he decides to run for government in 2024, Twitter has banned him indefinitely, and Facebook has announced he will be barred until at least January 2023.\n\nExperts told Insider in January that the firms have the legal authority to do so because \u201cthe First Amendment is a constraint on the power of government, not the private sector.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the right\u2019s battle with Big Tech, alternative platforms to mainstream services have sprung up. Parler, a social media platform with loose guidelines regarding what users can post, gained traction in late 2020 and swiftly garnered a following among conservatives, including Republican Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nAfter Stripe and PayPal banned Trump for his role in the January 6 violence, Fox News host Dan Bongino announced earlier in July that he\u2019s working on a payment network for conservatives. \u201cStripe is our objective here,\u201d he told the Washington Post, and his AlignPay service is aimed to combat \u201ccancel culture.\u201d\n\nA former Trump aide just revealed GETTR, a new social media app that looks eerily like Twitter. On Sunday, the day the program officially began, many of its users, mostly Trump supporters, were hacked.",

          "text": "\n\nThe Senate Wednesday approved President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request for the authorisation of N2.343 trillions! ($6.183 billion USD) as External Borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nThe upper chamber, which warned Ministries, Departments and Agencies(MDAs) against frivolous spending, also directed Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Zainab Ahmed, Director General Debt Management Office Patience Oniha, and Governor Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) Godwin Emefiele, to submit to the National Assembly within 10 working days (excluding the day of close of trading), a letter containing the United States Dollars amount so raised and received as a result of the approval together with the applicable exchange rate.\n\nThe sum is expected to be sourced through the Issuance of Eurobond in the International Capital Market.\n\nThe approval by the upper chamber followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Local and Foreign Debts.\n\nChairman of the Committee, Senator Clifford Ordia (PDP, Edo Central) said, in considering the president\u2019s request, the committee noted the serious concerns of Nigerians about the level of sustainability and servicing of Nigeria\u2019s External Borrowing.\n\nOrdia said: \u201cDue to the shortfall in our annual revenues in relation to our need for rapid infrastructural and human capital development, we had to pass deficit budget every year requiring us to borrow to finance the deficit in our budget.\u201d\n\nOrdia explained that the new borrowing was calculated at the exchange rate of USD1/N379, and raised from multiple sources\u2013multilateral and bilateral lenders through the issuance of Eurobonds in the International Capital Market.\n\nHe said the proceeds of the USD$6.183 would be used to fund various specific capital projects, specifically from priority sectors of the economy namely; power, transportation, agriculture, and rural development, education, health, provision of counterpart funding for multilateral and bilateral projects, defence and water resources.\n\nThe lawmaker disclosed that the final terms and conditions\u2013the interest rate and tenors in the case of Eurobonds \u2013 can only be determined at the point of issuance of the Bonds in the International Capital Market and would be subject to market conditions prevailing at the time of issuance.\n\nHe added that the primary listing of the bond would be on the London Stock Exchange while the secondary listing would be on the Nigerians Stock Exchange and Financial Markets Dealers Quotations (FMDQ) Securities Exchange.\n\nOrdia observed that \u201cmultilateral and bilateral institutions operate on standard terms and conditions and Nigeria secures the best terms and conditions within the context of the market.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, while adopting the resolutions of the Committee on Local and Foreign Debt, the Senate approved the issuance of $3 billion USD but not more than $6,183,081,643.40 Eurobond in the International Capital Market for the implementation of the new External Borrowing of N2,343,387,942,848, for the financing of part of the deficit authorized in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nIt also approved that the amount authorised may be raised from multiple sources such as the International Capital Market and any other Multilateral or Bilateral sources as may be available.\n\nIn addition, the upper chamber directed the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, DMO Director General the CBN governor to submit to the National Assembly within ten working days (excluding the day of close of trading) a letter containing the United States Dollars amount so raised and received as a result of the approval together with the applicable exchange rate.\n\nLawan clarifies\n\nIn his remarks, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, clarified that the approved external borrowing is not a fresh loan by the Buhari administration but a request captured in the 2021 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly last year.\n\nHe, however, tasked committees of the National Assembly to carry out strict oversight on how the loans were applied to the implementation of the 2021 budget.\n\nLawan urged Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government (MDAs) entrusted with the management of the funds to ensure prudent application to projects across the country.\n\n\u201cOur committees should be alert on how the funds that will be borrowed will be used.\n\n\u201cNo frivolous expenditures should be entertained. I imagine that everybody in the trust of public funds, especially these loans, will be as prudent and economical as possible\u201d, he said.\n\n\u2026Lawmakers pass N982bn\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate passed N982 .729billion as supplementary budget as against N895.842billion requested for by President Muhammadu Buhari, indicating an increase of N87 billion.\n\nThe passage of the bill was sequel to consideration of report submitted to that effect by its Committee on Appropriations.\n\nIn the report presented by the committee Chairman, Senator Jibrin Barau (APC Kano North) said the jerking up of the N895billion supplementary budget request to N982billion, was necessitated by the need for adequate funding of the underfunded security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe Committee in line with the harmonised position with its House of Representatives counterpart is recommending an upward review of the funding of some security agencies that were grossly underfunded or not funded in supplementary appropriation bill like the Nigerian Navy, Ministry of Police Affairs, Defence Intelligence Agency, Department of State Security Services and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)\u201d, the report stated.\n\nOut of the N982.729billion passed, N123.332billion is for recurrent expenditure while the balance of N859.397billion is for contribution to the Development Fund for Capital Expenditure for the year ending on 31st December, 2021\n\nOut of the capital vote, the Nigeria Air Force has the highest allocation of N239.477billion, followed by the Nigeria Army with N207.543billion, Nigerian Navy N157.780billion and Defence Headquarters with N33.673billion.\n\nPolice formations and Commands were allocated N22.586billion, Defence Space Administration N43.326billion, Office of the National Security Adviser N17billion and Department of State Services N17billion.\n\nIn the health component of the capital votes, N60.728billion WAs allocated for vaccine procurement against COVID-19 while N6.715billion was earmarked for procurement and installation of new oxygen plants nationwide and repairs of oxygen plants in FCT Hospitals.\n\nSpeaking after the passage, Senate President Lawan, advised the federal government to sustain adequate funding of security agencies in the 2022 budget to be presented to the National Assembly later this year.\n\nHe said doing so remains a sure way to overcome the lingering security challenges faced by the country.\n\n\u201cThis supplementary budget is targeted at addressing the security challenges in this country and, of course, the procurement, administration and management of the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe expect the relevant committees to be stiff, to be alive to their responsibilities for over sighting on how these funds would be deployed prudently.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that we have a review of the application of these funds before we pass the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\n\u201cThis is a very necessary intervention by the National Assembly, particularly this Senate and, indeed, the administration in the country that this is necessary for us to do.\n\n\u201c(And) we should continue with funding of our security agencies in the 2022 Appropriation because we have to overcome the security challenges our country faces,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

It is, however, not only a personal victory; it\u2019s also a victory for many Nigerians in the diaspora under similar conditions who are desirous to serve their country.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank God, my family, friends, my counsel, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN) and numerous well-wishers for their love, care and concern throughout this difficult period, which has lasted three whole years.\n\n\u201cI wish to add in light of the court\u2019s ruling, I will at the appropriate time and without hesitation, take all further steps necessary within the law to protect my reputation\u201d.\n\nBarely three years after she assumed office, Adeosun resigned in 2018 after she was accused of forging an NYSC certificate.\n\nRead Also: Adeosun Did Not Require NYSC Certificate For Political Appointment, Court Rules\n\n\n\nThe decision, according to her at the time, was the honourable thing to do as investigations into the allegation had commenced.\n\nUpon her resignation, she explained that she was born and raised in the United Kingdom and her visits to Nigeria up until the age of 34 were holidays, with visas obtained in her UK passport.\n\nShe went further to explain that she had obtained her first Nigerian passport at the age of 34 and when she relocated, there was debate as to whether the NYSC Law applied to her.\n\nRead Also: President Buhari Accepts Finance Minister, Adeosun\u2019s Resignation\n\n\u201cUpon enquiry as to my status relating to NYSC, I was informed that due to my residency history and having exceeded the age of thirty (30), I was exempted from the requirement to serve. Until recent events, that remained my understanding,\u201d the former minister wrote in her resignation letter.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of that advice and with the guidance and assistance of those, I thought were trusted associates, NYSC were approached for documentary proof of status. I then received the certificate in question. Having never worked in NYSC, visited the premises, been privy to, nor familiar with their operations, I had no reason to suspect that the certificate was anything but genuine. Indeed, I presented that certificate at the 2011 Ogun State House of Assembly and in 2015 for Directorate of State Services (DSS) Clearance as well as to the National Assembly for screening. Be that as it may, as someone totally committed to a culture of probity and accountability I have decided to resign with effect from Friday, 14th September, 2018.\u201d.\n\nShortly after her resignation, Zainab Ahmed was appointed as the new Minister for Finance.",

Most recently, Joseph was supposed to be replaced this week after only three months in the post.\n\nIn addition to presidential, legislative and local elections, Haiti was due to have a constitutional referendum in September after it was twice postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nREAD ALSO: Death Toll In Philippines Military Plane Crash Rises To 52\n\nMultiple crises\n\nSupported by Moise, the text of the constitutional reform, aimed at strengthening the executive branch, has been overwhelmingly rejected by the opposition and many civil society organizations.\n\nThe constitution currently in force was written in 1987 after the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship and declares that \u201cany popular consultation aimed at modifying the Constitution by referendum is formally prohibited.\u201d\n\nCritics had also claimed it was impossible to organizing a poll, given the general insecurity in the country.\n\nMoise had been accused of inaction in the face of the multiple crises, and faces steep opposition from swaths of the population.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council, the United States and Europe have called for free and transparent legislative and presidential elections to be held by the end of 2021.\n\nHenry, 71, has been part of Haiti\u2019s coronavirus response and previously held posts in the government in 2015 and 2016 as interior minister then social affairs and labor minister.\n\nHe was also a member of the health minister\u2019s cabinet from June 2006 to September 2008, before becoming chief of staff, a post he held from September 2008 to October 2011.\n\nMoise had tasked Henry with \u201cforming a broad-based government\u201d to \u201csolve the glaring problem of insecurity\u201d and to work toward \u201cthe holding of general elections and the referendum\u201d.\n\nHenry is close to the opposition, but his appointment was not welcomed by the majority of opposition parties, who has continued to demand the president step down.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The Nigerian Senate has approved a foreign borrowing plan by the country\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari of 2.343 trillion Naira, some 6.183 billion U.S. dollars to enable the federal government fund the deficit component of the 2021 national budget.\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign and Local Debts, Clifford Ordia while presenting the report of his committee said all the requirements were made for the borrowing while asking the Senate to approve the amount.\n\nAccording to Senator Ordia, \u201cit is not a new borrowing\u201d as the deficit is captured in the 2021 Appropriations Act. He also said the loan will be obtained from three sources: multilateral, bilateral and international capital markets, noting that the foreign loan will part-finance the budget deficit in the 2021 national budget.\n\nSeveral stakeholders have expressed deep concerns over the federal government\u2019s rising debt profile, which may push the country\u2019s debt in excess of N36 trillion, with as much as over N25 trillion of the sum contracted in the last six years of the current administration.\n\nIn April, the Senate had approved a plan by President Buhari to borrow $2.7 billion from external sources to fund critical projects across Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe upper legislative chamber ratified the combination of $1.5 billion and 995 million euros in loans after considering the report of its committee on local and foreign debts at the time.\n\nThe loans were sourced from the World Bank, Export-Import Bank of Brazil and Deutsche Bank of Germany, according to the lawmakers.\n\nIn 2020, President Buhari asked lawmakers for permission to obtain $5.5 billion in external funding to help finance budget deficits. Africa\u2019s biggest crude producer is struggling to meet spending commitments after oil prices slumped last year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPresident of the Senate Ahmad Lawan in his remarks reiterated that the approved loan is part of the borrowing plan of the 2021 Appropriations Act to tackle the deficit component of the budget, while urging public officials handling the borrowing and implementation of the funds to be transparent.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
