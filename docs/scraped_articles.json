          "title": "Insecurity: Stop the \u2018senseless killings\u2019 in Ogun, Group tells Abiodun, Ogun Assembly",
          "text": ".\n\nBy James Ogunnaike, Abeokuta\n\nDisturbed by the spate of cult clashes and attendant killings in recent times in Ogun State, a group of youths, under the aegis of \u2018Gateway Progressive Youths\u2019 has called on the State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun and members of the State House of Assembly to take necessary actions that will put an end to the killings.\n\nThe group, in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Olamide David and made available to Vanguard, noted that the government of Prince Dapo Abiodun needs to rise up to its responsibility of protecting the lives of citizens wherever they might be within the state.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cthese unfortunate incidents are just but an addition to the series of many other killings meted, particularly to young people. If the violence continues unchecked, Ogun State may slip into a killing field where the government and security agencies will become helpless\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe fact that these killings can occur in the open with emboldened courage is a\n\nclear indication that security is indeed falling apart in Ogun State\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe news of killings at one location or the other within the State is gradually become a norm\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe request that the government should without delay put an end to all needless\n\nand avoidable killings and fish out all perpetrators of these evil acts to properly\n\nbring them to book\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe sad losses of lives that were witnessed in different parts of the State over the last one week are heart-touching, frustrating and to say the least, unpardonable\u201d.\n\nThe group called on the state government to re-asses its security strategies with a view to unfolding a more holistic and all-inclusive approach.\n\n\u201cWe call on the government to, as a matter of urgency, do everything possible and\n\nuse any means available to curtail the situation and arrest all those who are behind the ongoing killings in the State which must be confronted head-on with might and power of the government\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe most important ingredients of living are the sanctity of human lives, the dignity of people and economic security. These factors are gradually fading away\n\nin Ogun State owing to the spate of killings witnessed in the state\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe bemoaned the fact that at a time when the country is facing its toughest\n\neconomic challenge resulting in the harsh inflation of commodities, some youths\n\nhave chosen to engage in violent acts rather than engage themselves to productive economic use\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe government should be seen as swiftly acting on security-related issues as it is its primary constitutional responsibility to protect, secure and provide welfare to citizens, as enunciated in the second schedule of the 1999 amended Constitution\u201d.\n\n\u201cExamples should be set by speedily arresting and prosecuting all criminals, hence, government should intensify efforts in identifying and prosecuting perpetrators of these dastard acts; the government and stakeholders, in collaboration with different security agencies must be up and doing against the tides of insecurities, in whatever guises\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe charge Speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Olakunle\n\nTaiwo Oluomo, to convene an emergency session on the rising state of insecurity\n\nin the State, and urge our lawmakers to come up with a unified position on\n\nspecific security challenges in their constituencies with a view to arriving at\n\nworkable solutions on the state of security\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is need for a constructive engagement mechanism with relevant\n\nstakeholders to work out modalities towards bringing the crisis to an end. The\n\nfundamental causes of the growing crisis must be identified and the problems\n\nsolved to restore confidence of the people in our security agencies to protect them\u201d.",

          "title": "Takeover of BEDC: Lawyers commence contempt proceedings against defaulters",
          "text": "Legal advisers to Vigeo Power Limited, majority shareholders of Benin Electricity Distribution Company Plc, BEDC, have commenced contempt proceedings against defaulters for illegal takeover of the company.\n\n\n\nThe law firm of Kunle Adegoke, SAN, lawyers to Vigeo Power Ltd, said the contempt proceedings has become imperative because the attention of its client had been drawn to a publication by the Bureau of Public Enterprises, BPE, on July 13, 2022, in which it laboured unsuccessfully to justify its attempts at illegally taking over the BEDC Electricity Plc, despite the orders by a Federal High Court, Abuja, on July 8, 2022, in suit between Vigeo Power Limited v. Fidelity Bank Plc & 7 Ors.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is on record that the total shareholding of the BPE and the Ministry of Finance in BEDC is just 40 percent, making the two of them minority shareholders which pales into insignificance in the face of the 60 percent shareholding held by Vigeo Power Limited, our client.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is sad that in a worst form of brigandage unknown to Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) and the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement dated August 21, 2013, which is subsisting among the parties, BPE, using Fidelity Bank Plc as a front, has decided to take over a company that is not indebted to either BPE or Fidelity Bank using the naked force of state power.\n\n\n\n\u201cContrary to the impression sought to be created by BPE in the publication referred to above, Vigeo Power Limited\u2019s 60 percent shareholding in BEDC was never collaterised in any loan transaction with Fidelity Bank Plc or any other financial institution.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is also the case that it is unknown to CAMA or the shareholder\u2019s agreement subsisting among the parties that BPE can, by unilateral declaration, dissolve the board of BEDC and appoint its preferred persons to take over the management of BEDC.\n\nWere that to be allowed, it means any minority shareholder can unilaterally take over the management of a company under the guise of enforcing a non-existent loan transaction.\n\n\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the orders of the Federal High Court in the suit mentioned above restrained Fidelity Bank Plc, BPE and any other agency of government, from altering or further altering the board composition of BEDC Electricity Plc or working in concert with any person or party to alter the board composition of BEDC.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt also restrained BPE and the persons it purportedly appointed as directors of BEDC, namely, K. C. Aguma, Adeola Ijose, Henry Ajaghawa, Charles Onwera and Yomi Adeyemi, 4th -8th defendants respectively, \u201cfrom parading themselves or holding themselves out as directors of the BEDC, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt also restrained BPE and the persons it purportedly appointed as directors of BEDC, namely, K. C. Aguma, Adeola Ijose, Henry Ajaghawa, Charles Onwera and Yomi Adeyemi, 4th \u2013 8th defendants respectively, from taking over the management and control of the affairs, assets and undertakings of the BEDC, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice before the court.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe lawyers also noted with concern, BPE\u2019s dubious attempt to misrepresent the sequence of the relevant events in a bid to justify its flagrant disregard of the extant orders of court, adding that in its publication earlier mentioned, BPE mischievously claims that it had completed the unlawful takeover of BEDC before the court granted the injunction on July 8, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is very strange that an organisation like BPE that should be steeped in corporate governance principles seems to believe that the directors of a company regulated by CAMA can be removed and/or appointed by mere declaration on the pages of newspapers, and without following the process prescribed by CAMA and the Shareholders Agreement between VPL and BPE.\n\nTill date, it is still the lawful directors jointly appointed by VPL and BPE that are recognized at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC),\u201d the law firm stressed.\n\n\u201cIt is very disheartening that a government entity that is supposed to attract private capital and expertise to enterprise previously owned by government will dishonor contracts, disregard rule of law and act in a brazen manner characteristic of executive lawlessness capable of destroying business investments just to satisfy some difficult-to-understand primordial interests.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven further disturbing is the fact that there was no written official document to BEDC or Vigeo Power introducing the persons and stating the reason why such persons have turned up. All information gathered are from BPE website and public announcements.\n\n\n\n\u201cSuch executive lawlessness has been clearly deprecated by the Supreme Court in Miliary Governor of Lagos State v. Ojukwu [1986] 1 NWLR (Pt. 18) 621 @ 638 paras E \u2013 G where the apex court emphasised the importance of the rule of law and the need to defer to the judiciary in the counsel of perfection that has been oft-cited to uphold rule of law in all affairs of every Nigerian.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe lawyers, therefore, urged members of the public to disregard and condemn the acts of lawlessness embarked upon by the BPE, Fidelity Bank Plc and their co-travellers as they have commenced contempt proceedings against all defaulters of rule of law involved in this misadventure.",

Therefore I will encourage stakeholders to look into these challenges in a contextualized manner to bring innovative evidence based solutions for these problems\u201d.\n\nOn her part, Dr Alex Okoh, Director Public Health, FMOH admitted that Nigeria\u2019s border points are porous coupled with security challenges at the four designated ports of entry, it would take effective collaboration to keep away health risks, which come from cross border migrations.\n\nPart of this, she noted, must include equipping and financing the port health service centres.\n\nA plethora of other speakers noted that within limited resources Nigeria must get it right in terms of man-power training and development, put in place structured accountability tools, continue to embrace vaccine intake, bridge gaps for effective collaboration between federal and states and above all strengthen production capacity in order not to compromise the economy whenever pandemic strikes in future.",

          "title": "APC shifts Shettima\u2019s unveiling as Bola Tinubu\u2019s running mate",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Okwe Obi, Abuja, Noah Ebije, Kaduna, Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin and Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) has postponed official unveiling of Senator Kashim Shetima as running mate to its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu for what it termed logistic reasons.\n\nThe former Bono governor who was formally announced by Tinubu as vice presidential candidate on July 10 in Daura, Katsina, was earlier scheduled to be presented to party members at the APC national Secretariat, yesterday.\n\nBut Deputy National Organising Secretary, Nze Chidi Duru, told Daily Sun that the ceremony was put off till Wednesday next week due to the involvement of most members of the party\u2019s leadership in tomorrow\u2019s Osun State governorship election.\n\nHe explained that the event was not an unveiling but more of interactive meeting between the running mate and party\u2019s national leadership to formally interact.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why people keep tagging it as unveiling. The event was meant to be an avenue for our party\u2019s vice presidential candidate to meet with members of the National Working Committee (NWC) and other national leadership of our party. The interaction is important because he has to come and thank the party for giving him the ticket.\n\n\u201cAs for postponement, the notice of invitation for the event went out rather too late on Wednesday. We also noticed that many of our officials are involved in the preparation for the Osun State governorship election. Again, Shetima equally has his personal commitment too. Those are the reasons that we had to postpone the event. However, it will now hold on Wednesday next week,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, firework over the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket has continued with the Supreme Council for Shariah in Nigeria (SCSN) knocking the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). The umbrella Christian body had kicked as against one faith ticket.\n\nHowever, Kaduna State Secretary of SCSN, AbdurRahman Hassan, in a chat with Daily Sun said recent comments by CAN was unhealthy and provocative.\n\n\u201cThe Council is observing all the happenings regarding the Muslim-Muslim ticket of APC, most especially the unhealthy and provocative comments by CAN on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the right of each party to chose its flag bearer. This is democracy, you don\u2019t expect the majority Muslim north to be neglected in the political equation of this country.\n\n\u201cWe thought CAN would toe the line of Orji Uzo Kalu who reasoned with democratic finesse about the Muslim-Muslim ticket, instead of joining the bandwagon of religious fanaticism.\n\n\u201cRegarding some Muslim clerics who go against Muslim-Muslim ticket, they are entitled to their opinion, which can\u2019t go down well with majority Muslim north.\n\n\u201cSometimes, people forget history. In 1979, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe nominated Prof. Ishaya Audu(a Christian)as his running mate. No Muslim or Muslim group in Nigeria decried any foul play.\n\n\u201cWhy the shouts now because of what the APC did? Let\u2019s concentrate on choosing competent and trustworthy leaders instead of trivialising the issues at stake. Whoever decries a particular combination of candidates can simply go for another,\u201d Hassan said.\n\n\u2022Tinubu right \u2013 Oshiomole\n\nReacting, former chairman of the ruling party, Mr. Adams Oshiomole, described the decision of Tinubu to select Shettima as a right decision.\n\nHe said the decision on who is the party\u2019s running mate is not a source of worry for Nigerians who neither have access to newspaper, television or radio but rather more concerned about who can do the job, put an end to the endless distruptions in the academic calendar and create jobs that would pay decent wages. He said the country needs a leader who would bring back the comatose textile industry and creating millions of jobs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We need a leader that would move the economy away from just talking about growth to that which is job-led growth and having a robust social policy to ensure that the fruit of growth is distributed in a way that will deal with poverty decisively.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe former APC chairman lamented that Nigeria derives pleasure in comparing itself with countries that are doing well.\n\nHe gave example of Rwanda that went through serious civil war where millions of people were killed, saying today in Rwanda, you dare not describe yourself as someone from a particular ethnic group.\n\nOn the contrary, he said Nigerians visit several countries in the realm of Rwanda who have attained development but return toNigeria and begin to talk about issues around religion and tribe.\n\nHe argued that Tinubu is a courageous leader who has taken the bold decision in his choice of running mate, adding that by the grace of God, when elected into power, he would have the bold courage to take decisions that are necessary to reposition Nigeria, saying as a country we must think out of the box.\n\nThe former Edo State governor said he was satisfied with Tinubu and his choice of Shettima, especially his promise that it would not be business as usual in government if elected president.\n\n\u2018\u2018He is not a stranger to government. He has made his mark in both private and public sector, more especially as a former governor of Borno State under very difficult circumstances. For me, this is a balanced ticket of competence and antecedent.\u201d\n\n\u2022We must convince Nigerians- Salihu\n\nAPC National Vice Chairman (North West), Salihu Moh Lukman, has admitted that the party would have to go extra mile to convince the electorate that Muslim-Muslim ticket is not to discriminate against anybody.\n\nReacting to the controversy trailing the choice of Shettima as running mate, he said the leadership of the party considered all factors before arriving at the decision and assured that Tinubu would protect the interest of all.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about contest and managing interests. Certainly, the party leadership will have to consider all the factors before arriving at picking the running mate. In the end, we have to convince Nigerians that Muslim-Muslim ticket or however you look at it, does not mean discrimination against anybody. The party and the candidate will have to work to protect their interests,\u201d he promised.\n\n\u2022Coalition wants younger candidate\n\nThe Coalition of All Progressives Congress Support Groups has called for replacement of Senator Shettima with a younger candidate, preferably, Dr Ibrahim Bello Dauda, a Christian.\n\nThe coalion in a statement by Igwe Ude-Umanta, Solomon Adodo, and 26 others argued that sidelining of youths from getting the ticket was an attempt to prevent them from making inroads when most political leaders became ministers and governors in their at thirties and forties.\n\n\u2022Prove your worth, activist tells CAN, PFN\n\nAn Edo-based human rights activist, Pastor Moses Onodua, has thrown a challenge to CAN and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) to prove that they were against the Muslim-Muslim ticket by voting against the party and its presidential candidate in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\nHe said APC has made its choice of who flies its ticket and it behoves on the Christian bodies to decide whether they were going to mobilise their followers to vote for the party or not.\n\nHe agreed that the APC did not put the interest of other religious groups into consideration in its quest of getting its presidential running mate knowing that Nigeria is a secular country.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has vowed that his administration would continue to provide the necessary support to eradicate terrorists from the face of the earth.\n\nHe spoke, yesterday, in Jaji, Kaduna State, where he celebrated the sacrifices and successes of the military in defending the country courageously.\n\nAccording to a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari pledged at the graduation ceremony of 247 students of the Senior Course 44 of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, that his government would continue to provide the needed support required to wipe out terrorists and insurgents off the face of the earth.\n\n\u201cThe Armed Forces of Nigeria are working tirelessly to enhance their combat effectiveness, operational capability and training necessary to eliminate the threats, in synergy with other institutions and nations.\n\n\u201cThe response of the Armed Forces of Nigeria to the Boko Haram insurgency, banditry, militancy, kidnapping as well as the activities of separatists and armed militias among others have been commendable.\n\n\u201cThis government will continue to provide the required guidance and support to ensure the desired results are achieved,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president noted that most of the security challenges facing the world today were both asymmetric and trans-border in nature, involving mainly non-state actors in different regions and sub-regions of the world.\n\nHe added that the West African sub-region and, indeed, the entire continent of Africa are not immune to the threats.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria bearing the hallmark of national and trans-border insurgents trying to cause havoc in Nigeria as well as in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cIt will be part of your duty to confront these terrorists and insurgents and wipe them off the face of the earth and bring peace to our countries,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari described the specifics of their training which focused primarily on countering security threats as very important, adding that \u201ccombating these prevalent security threats effectively demands that African countries continue to work together at all levels; be it tactical, operational and strategic,\u201d he said.\n\nAppraising the ongoing collaboration of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger Republic, Benin Republic and Chad in a multinational operation to combat the Boko Haram insurgency in the Lake Chad region, the Nigerian leader said it has been productive, commendable and successful.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe synergy achieved in operating together must have been enhanced by an understanding of the doctrines of the cooperating forces.\n\n\u201cThis occasion provides me another opportunity to briefly reflect on the state of the Nigerian nation, particularly regarding national security. The last 12 years have been very challenging for our nation, considering the different security threats that have besieged the country.\n\n\u201cOur government is poised to promote national security and development, as well as to remain committed to promoting a vision of a secure, safe, just, peaceful, prosperous and strong Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe shall be employing all elements of our national power in ensuring security, a just society, peaceful co-existence, national unity and sustainable development while promoting our good standing internationally.\u201d\n\nThe president expressed his delight that among the graduating students were international officers from sister African countries, saying he is confident they appreciated the country\u2019s friendliness during their stay.\n\nDespite its diversity and challenges, Nigeria remains one of the most welcoming and enjoyable countries to visit and stay in, according to the president, who urged the Course 44 fellows to cherish their memories of the over 40-year college, which prepares officers for tactical and operational level leadership, focusing on national security, joint planning processes, inter-agency cooperation and operations, and multinational integration.\n\nFurther, he told the graduating students that their participation in the course was a testimony of national security aspirations to promote international peace, friendship and cooperation.\n\n\u201cTo the graduating students from Nigeria\u2019s ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), you have, indeed, justified the confidence reposed in you by your respective organisations.\n\n\u201cWe must, specially, commend the spouses of the graduates here for keeping the home front and without whose sacrifices there would have been no celebrations for many here today,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also praised the commandant and his team for turning graduating students into highly refined products, as well as for their ongoing efforts to expand and upgrade the college\u2019s facilities. This is done to create a conducive and welcoming environment that is suitable for the purpose.\n\n\u201cYour efforts are maintaining the status of the college as a mid-level military training institution of repute. I, therefore, commend the college board as well as the commandant and staff for these remarkable achievements.\n\n\u201cThis government will continue to support the college in its developmental strides. My administration will also continue to give priority to the training and welfare of officers and men of our Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cYou, the graduating students, should realise that the nation has made a lot of investment in your training up to this stage of your respective careers.\n\n\u201cI am confident you have been sufficiently groomed in character and learning to take up the challenges you will be confronted with hereafter.\n\n\u201cFor the Nigerian graduating students among you, the graduation today is a clarion call to duty in service to our country. Nigeria expects the very best from you in terms of loyalty, commitment to duty and service to your fatherland.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you must endeavour to make honest and positive contributions in the discharge of the constitutional responsibilities of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, your strategic MDAs and be good ambassadors of Armed Forces command and staff college,\u201d the president said.\n\nCommandant of the College, Olurotimi Tuwase, explained that 111 army officers, 69 naval officers, 42 Air Force officers, 10 students from paramilitary organisations and MDAs as well as 15 international students completed the 48 weeks intensive training, leading to the award of Pass Staff Course (PSC).\n\nTuwase said the international students were from Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, The Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia.\n\nThe commandant thanked the president for his unflinching support to the college, noting that students from the school have been sufficiently trained and equipped to cope with most challenges in their career, with the staff and leadership skills acquired in the college.",

She is fourth in the top list for 2022.\n\nThe Nigerian\u2019s 65.74m personal season\u2019s best will definitely not get her over the line and will need to throw a huge personal best of at least 73.50m which is the automatic qualification mark or be among the 12 best throwers from the two qualifying groups.\n\nFor the 4x400m team of Patience Okon-George, Imaobong Nse Uko, Sikiru Adeyemi, Dubem Amene and Nathaniel Samson, the World Championships presents another big stage to make history as the first mixed relay team to make the final of a global event after debutting at the Tokyo Olympics last year, exiting in the first round\n\nThe team has been drawn in heat 1 of two first round heats and will run from lane three, sandwiched between Poland, the reigning Olympic champion in lane two and USA, bronze medal winner in Tokyo in lane four. Three teams will qualify automatically from the heat for the final while two others with fastest losing times will join. The final will be held later this evening. The Nigerian team set a new 3:13.60 African record in Tokyo last year.\n\nLater tonight, the heats for the men\u2019s 100m will hold with Favour Ashe, the reigning fastest man in Nigeria scheduled to run.\n\nAlso expected to be in the line up will be reigning World U20 Champion, Udodi Onwuzurike.\n\nThe duo will be aiming to return Nigeria to the final of the blue ribband event 15 years after Olusoji Fasuba ran in the final in Osaka, Japan.\n\nNigeria will also be hoping to win more than the one medal Ese Brume won three years ago in Doha, Qatar. The last time the country won two medals was in 2013 in Moscow, Russia where Blessing Okagbare leapt to a silver medal in the long jump and a bronze medal in the 200m.\n\nThe country will also be seeking a first ever gold medal in the championships and will be relying on Brume, the only Nigerian still competing who has won medals at the World indoor and outdoor championships and at the Olympics as well as sprint hurdler, Tobiloba Amusan who has a 50-50 chance of not just making the podium this time around after two fourth placed finishes in Doha in 2019 and at the Olympics last year but also win the gold.\n\nThe petite 25-year-old set a new 12.41 seconds personal best and African record just last month and the Nigerian knows she needs to win a world title to be able to stake a claim to being one of the greatest sprint hurdlers in the world.\n\nNigerian Medalists at Previous Editions\n\nMEN\n\nSilver\n\nInnocent Egbunike 400m: 1987\n\nOlapade Adeniken 4x100mR: 1997,\n\nDavidson Ezinwa 4x100mR: 1997\n\nOsmond Ezinwa 4x100mR: 1997\n\nFrancis Obikwelu 4x100mR: 1997\n\nBronze:\n\nKunle Adejuyigbe 4x400mR:1995\n\nSunday Bada 4x400mR: 1995\n\nUdeme Ekpeyong 4x400mR: 1995\n\nJude Monye 4x400mR: 1995\n\nAjayi Agbebaku TJ: 1983\n\nFrancis Obikwelu 200m: 1999\n\nWOMEN\n\nSilver\n\nGlory Alozie 100mH: 1999\n\nBlessing Okagbare LJ: 2013\n\nBronze\n\nEse Brume LJ: 2019\n\nBlessing Okagbare 200m: 2013",

De Jong has been United\u2019s number one target all summer long, but the move had stalled while Barca dragged their feet over the owed money.\n\nPersonal terms will now need to be fully agreed between United and De Jong, who has already indicated a willingness to reunite with Erik ten Hag \u2013 the Dutchman took over at Old Trafford this summer and previously worked with the 25-year-old at Ajax.\n\nNews of an agreement is a significant development for United and Ten Hag, with De Jong quickly identified earlier this summer as the club\u2019s primary transfer target. There had been hope he would join the club on their pre-season tours of Thailand and Australia, but Barca\u2019s tough negotiating stance has prevented those plans from coming to fruition.\n\nNevertheless, De Jong is now one step closer to becoming a United player, with sources telling 90min that would be \u2018impossible\u2019 for him to continue his career at Camp Nou.",

Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What to look for in a startup lawyer",
          "text": "Startups often relegate non-technology roles to the background in a bid to ship products quickly. However, these roles are often as important in the overall success of the company as the technical roles, and one such important role is that of the startup lawyer.\n\nAt the beginning of the technology boom in Africa, the standard practice was for startups to outsource their legal processes to law firms. With the increase in funding in Africa, more startups have become aware of the importance of having an in-house lawyer focused specifically on their legal needs.\n\nBeing a relatively new development, it is not far-fetched to assume that startups might not know what to look for in a startup lawyer. To identify the unique qualities a startup lawyer should have, I asked 4 lawyers what qualities startups should look for in an in-house counsel.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi is a lawyer with experience working in-house for a fintech startup and providing legal advisory for early-stage startups.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi: I think startups need to begin their questions with, \u201cDo we need an in-house lawyer or a lawyer I can reach out to when needed?\u201d I say this because, while you always need a lawyer, a couple of factors determine if you need one employed with you or if you need one on a retainer. These factors include how regulated your sector of operation is. The regulations guiding fintech and food ordering companies are very different from one another. The size and stage of your startup\u2019s growth matter as well. A startup at the ideation stage has different needs from a startup that has begun operations.\n\nYou also need to be conscious and properly assess your options when engaging a lawyer due to the nature of the role. A proper assessment cannot be understated. Like with every other kind of service, there is the tendency to have a \u201cvalue mismatch\u201d if you do not engage on the terms that fit your needs.\n\nThe first thing to look out for in a lawyer is honesty, and it is the single most important feature, to me. The reason is that a lawyer holds the life of your startup in his hands. You need a lawyer that informs you of the whole reality every time a situation comes up. Brilliance is overrated; it\u2019s the law, and there will always be a solution. You want a lawyer that can tell you, \u201cI am not sure what the position of the law on this is, allow me to run some checks.\u201d Your lawyer should be comfortable enough to tell you, \u201cThis is outside my speciality, we need to bring this person in to handle this particular part of the issue.\u201d If you find a lawyer that can be this honest with you, you are in good hands, regardless of how convoluted the legal situation might be.\n\nEmmanuel Ido is an associate at Olajide Oyewole LLP (DLA Piper Africa).\n\nEmmanuel Ido: Almost every startup is unique, from its product to its people. The role of a startup lawyer is essential to support the startup from a legal perspective such that it can function at optimum capacity. Whether the startup is pre-seed, bootstrapped or VC-funded, a good startup lawyer is crucial for its day-to-day running. Aside from the practical skills, there are a few things to look out for when hiring a lawyer for your startup.\n\nFirst, the lawyer\u2019s sector knowledge is important. When hiring a lawyer for your startup, one should consider the level of sector knowledge. This will be handy when drafting and negotiating contracts, advising the startup, and general day-to-day operations. A good startup lawyer should be well-grounded in data protection, intellectual property management, labour and employment law, corporate governance, public policy, dispute resolution, etc.\n\nAnother thing to look out for is the lawyer\u2019s sector experience. A startup lawyer must have relevant experience within the tech sector. The experience will come from doing the work. For instance, a corporate and finance lawyer who has practical experience will be suited to advising a fintech company. A quick review of their deal sheet will give you an idea of the type of lawyer they are and how suitable they will be for your startup.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s regulatory interface is also very important because it\u2019s almost impossible to operate a startup without constant regulatory interface. To this end, your lawyer should be someone with sufficient knowledge of the regulators and the relevant contacts.\n\nThe 3 categories above roughly summarise what is needed in a startup lawyer. Of course, they must have the right soft skills and are good at working in a team in a dynamic environment, as most startups are.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan is a partner at Springwoods LP.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan: The first thing that I think a startup should look for in a lawyer is transaction experience and compliance experience. This is not to say that a lawyer with experience in other fields should not be considered. However, that lawyer should be adaptable enough to learn.\n\nA startup lawyer should also be able to work in a startup environment, which is not as rigid as a law firm. The lawyer should ideally be someone that can think on their feet and be able to prioritise. It is not all conflicts that require a court sitting; some legal matters require collaboration. The lawyer should have a multi-faceted approach to legal matters.\n\nThe lawyer should also be able to maintain and build relationships with regulators and your competitors. This is very relevant. A startup lawyer should be aware of regulatory developments ahead of the public to navigate these developments smoothly. Unlike law firms, a startup can\u2019t afford a lawyer that doesn\u2019t have attention to detail.\n\nLastly, as the startup evolves so too should its legal needs evolve. An early-stage startup requires basic things like incorporation and a founder\u2019s contract. However, as you scale, the legal demands greatly increase. At this stage, the startup should liaise with its lawyer to understand the next steps to take to meet these demands.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye is a lawyer at Banwo & Ighodalo, and a writer.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye: The first thing to look out for is technical expertise. Knowledge of the law is the whole basis of a lawyer in a startup. As such, the first and most important thing is for the in-house counsel to be highly technical in the knowledge and application of law to issues arising out of your business. Also, a necessary plus is more industry-streamlined knowledge and awareness of current market solutions that are needed for that startup.\n\nPerhaps more useful for the startup than the lawyer\u2019s technical expertise is the lawyer\u2019s creativity, business savvy, and solutions-oriented outlook. The lawyer mustn\u2019t be restricted to the legal side of the startup only, as this may negatively impact some of the creative solutions that the product and engineering team may want to bring on board. It is therefore important for the founders to look out for the creative flair in the lawyer candidates they are speaking to.\n\nLastly, cultural fit is very important. While lawyers are inclined to be more regimented in their approach, working in a startup will require the flexibility of whatever candidate you are looking to scoop up into your team.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

That means a lot of things to us, but at the forefront of most of it is onboarding as many people as we can onto the blockchain in innovative and user-friendly ways.\u201d\n\nBefore Prodigeezy focused on onboarding Africans on the blockchain and building metaverses, he was just a passionate storyteller with a camera.\n\n\u201cWhen I was done with film school, I returned to Lagos, Nigeria, and looked around for who was doing what and who was making the most interesting things, and at the time, music was just very, very fascinating to me.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a great way to visually express yourself because you could pack as much as possible into a three or four-minute clip. So I said, \u2018You know what, I\u2019m going to shoot music videos for a while.\u201d\n\nProdigeezy is responsible for music video hits such as Falz\u2019s This is Nigeria and Burna Boy\u2019s Boshe Nlo. However, after growing a career as a music video director, his foray into the emerging tech world happened because of his childhood love for tech.\n\nSnapshot from This is Nigeria music video\n\nTech before music\n\nGrowing up, Prodigeezy loved to do anything related to storytelling and art; however, tech also had a special place in his heart. His father was a scholar and a pastor, so there was never a shortage of information; he was constantly soaking up knowledge as a child.\n\n\u201cI was soaked up in a lot of passive learning and imitating the behaviour of the people around me. My upbringing was, to a certain extent, conservative, but I really just enjoyed staying indoors and reading books.\n\n\u201cI read a ton of books and watched a lot of television. After a while, I was privileged to have the Internet, which was rare for an early 2000s Nigerian kid, but this just changed my life trajectory.\u201d\n\nBooks, TV, and access to the Internet turned Prodigeezy into what he describes as a full-blown nerd; he was almost always indoors playing games and surfing the web.\n\nHe could not get into a university immediately after secondary school, so he had an extra year to learn more about computers, games, and many other things that aligned with his interests.\n\nInterestingly, he got into the National Institute of Information Technology (NIIT), where he studied the basics of computer network engineering.\n\n\u201cI already knew where I was going at the time and wanted to be a computer scientist or engineer. Either way, it just had to be computers. You barely had to know me for an hour before you realised I was a nerd.\u201d\n\nWhen Prodigeezy finally got into the university, he discovered another interest \u2014 graphic design \u2014 which was a good source of income for him. He only enjoyed school because he studied computer science and could realise new areas of interest.\n\nUnfortunately, his learning and discovery streak was cut short by strike actions, a common occurrence in Nigeria\u2019s public universities. Back home, the zeal to continue learning and discovering new things wasn\u2019t there until his dad gave him a delightful surprise.\n\n\u201cMy father got me a camera as a present; it was a DSLR Canon 600 D. It wasn\u2019t something that I was crazy about at the time, but I\u2019d been mentioning it in passing.\u201d\n\nWhile he wasn\u2019t thrilled about the camera when he got it, it was the reason he became a music video director.\n\nOut of curiosity, he tried to figure out how the camera worked. Several YouTube videos later, he began to get the hang of it. He started taking pictures everywhere he went, and it became a habit.\n\nBefore long, film and photography became his new interest, but his father was not fond of his new obsession. Understandably so, because he was mostly out of the house taking pictures until very late at night.\n\nEventually, his parents acquiesced after he convinced them that he had found his new passion and was ready to make it his career. He then went on to study film-making in India.\n\nMusic to tech\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing time in my life, learning about film, the science of storytelling, emotions and basically how to paint the right pictures with visuals.\u201d\n\nOn his return to Nigeria, he landed an internship with Aje Filmworks, where he learnt a lot and made great connections. From there, he moved on to Aristokrat Vision Production.\n\nHis company \u2014 Global Creative Operations (GCO) \u2014 launched in 2018 and is now an established production and creative outfit. GCO is evolving to become a tech company as Prodigeezy infuses his exciting discoveries from the pandemic into the company.\n\nJust like the lecturers\u2019 strike action that led to his obsession with the camera, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 gave Prodigeezy another opportunity to pause and make discoveries.\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, I discovered virtual reality (VR). As always, it started out of curiosity, but I jumped into the rabbit hole and discovered this new immersive experience, and suddenly, my love for computer logic came back.\u201d\n\nHe decided to get an Oculus Quest VR headset and delved into the world of virtual reality. Without the distraction from work, he kept learning more about virtual reality.\n\nBlockchain meets VR\n\nProdigeezy using his Oculus\n\nWhile learning so much about VR, he came across the metaverse, Web3, NFTs, and the blockchain ecosystem. By the end of 2021, he had acquired so much knowledge about the space and had plans to integrate an NFT product within his company.\n\nThe Wizkid, Burna Boy, and Davido NFT idea\n\n\u201cI told my guys we have to start a new company because this is the future, and that\u2019s how Floats was born. And a lot of my attention has been directed at this.\u201d\n\nHe created Floats Metaverse Systems under GCO, and they began to work on some exciting projects, none of which took off. And then they had a crazy project idea to bring Wizkid, Davido, and Burna Boy \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s biggest artistes \u2014 together.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the year, we started playing around with this idea of a collaboration between Burna Boy, Wizkid, and Davido as an NFT.\n\n\u201cIt was an amazing idea; we got some prototypes, did the artwork, created a custom smart contract, and did the entire thing. And this was with a lean team at that point, but it fell through.\u201d\n\nAnyone familiar with the Nigerian music industry knows that it would be a cold day in hell before Burna Boy, Wizkid and Davido, currently Nigeria\u2019s most prominent artistes, collaborate. Having worked in the music industry, Prodigeezy knew this but what he had planned was bigger than the big three\u2019s rivalry.\n\nHe continued pitching the idea to many other artistes. Still, no one could envision merging NFTs with music the way he did until he met Daniel Benson, known professionally as Bnxn and formerly as Buju.\n\n\u201cWe eventually got across to Buju, and it was a match made in heaven. He was already exploring how to creatively interpret his journey through comics and give that as a limited artefact to his fans.\n\n\u201cSo we said, \u2018You know what, this is cool. Let\u2019s do this as part of an NFT project, as part of a bigger community,\u2019 and the conversation just kept getting broader. Buju really cares about his fans, like he really loves his fans, and he truly wants to be an innovative force as a musician.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just want to make music; he is a creative person and wants his creativity to extend to how he relates with his fans.\u201d\n\nAccording to Prodigeezy, Buju had always been about giving back to the fans, and NFTs were a great way to do that. The Heads by Bnxn NTF collection was created so Buju\u2019s fans can connect with him and profit from sales.\n\nThe NFT project will have 10,001 unique NFTs of Bnxn\u2019s face \u2014 the kind used as the art cover for his hit song Italy. Holders of the NFT will automatically have access to Bnxn\u2019s physical and virtual concerts. They will also get to claim ownership of some songs and snippets, making them eligible to receive streaming revenue.\n\nAlthough the sharing arrangement hasn\u2019t been created yet, 10% of the profit from the project will go to a creator fund, and the community will vote for which project the money will be used.\n\nIn addition, being a part of the Heads By Bnxn community also gives access to education about all things Web3.\n\nProdigeezy, Bnxn, and the team behind the project have bigger plans beyond just being an NFT collection.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also big on the metaverse. We\u2019ve done a lot of experiments, and we built a game a couple of months ago. Our goal is really to be able to replicate this virtual space of Benson\u2019s creation in the metaverse. And that means virtual concerts and everything it means to be an artiste.\n\n\u201cAs the technology evolves, we will continue building more around it. That\u2019s the roadmap we promised the community. Benson also supports this, and he\u2019s giving us a lot, from music to many other resources.\u201d\n\n\n\nCombining NFTs with music is still new worldwide, and Prodigeezy is easily a pioneer in the space. According to him, the community is on the verge of something groundbreaking, and while he\u2019s not sure what the final picture will look like, for the first time in a while, true freedom is coming to the creative space.",

          "text": "The the Debt Management Office (DMO) has clarified that Nigerian government\u2019s continued borrowing has been as a result of low revenues.\n\nThe DMO was reacting to a statement allegedly made by a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria, which according to the debt office, may have been made without due consideration of the Government\u2019s borrowing needs as captured in the Annual Budgets, Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, as well as, the Debt Management Strategy.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s growth not strong enough to reduce poverty \u2013 MPC members\n\nAccording to the DMO, the borrowing needs are derived from the Annual Budgets while the borrowing mix is based on the subsisting Debt Management Strategy.\n\nIt further explained that Successive Debt Management Strategies have often indicated that the federal government\u2019s preferred source of external borrowing is concessional sources rather than commercial sources such as Eurobonds.\n\nIt would be recalled that one of the objectives of the Debt Management Strategy 2020 \u2013 2023 is to maximise funds available to Nigeria from Multilateral and Bilateral sources in order to access cheaper and long tenored funds, whilst taking cognizance of the limited funding envelopes available to Nigeria, due to Nigeria\u2019s classification as Lower-Middle-Income country.\n\nIn line with the strategy, the DMO has been able to remix the borrowing structure to 38.66% for external bore and domestic, 61.34% as at late last year.\n\n\u201cGiven the size of new borrowings in the Annual Budgets over the years, it would not have been proper for the FGN to raise all the funds from the Domestic Market as this would result in the Government crowding out the private sector and raising borrowing rates.\n\nConsequently, some part of the required funding has to be raised externally.\n\n\u201cWhile loans from concessional sources such as the International Development Association- an arm of the World Bank \u2013 are relatively cheaper as stated above, they are limited in amount. In addition, they are not available for financing infrastructure and other capital projects.\n\n\u201cThus, Nigeria accesses concessional and semi-concessional loans as may be available, while issuing Eurobonds to part finance the Annual Budgets and the infrastructure projects contained therein,\u201d it explained.\n\nOn the issue of Eurobonds likely lead to debt distress, the DMO reiterated the need to generate more revenues significantly beyond their current levels.\n\nQuoting data from the World Bank, the DMO further explained that Nigeria has a much lower Revenue to GDP Ratio compared to a number of advanced and developing countries which have higher Public Debt to GDP Ratios than it.\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s Economic Outlook for 2020 showed that in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s Revenue to GDP Ratio was 6.3% placing it at number 194 out of 196 countries.\n\nThe DMO explained that while the Government continues ongoing efforts to diversify and grow revenues, the public should take into cognizance other benefits of Eurobonds which include increase in the level of external reserves and opening up opportunities for the private sector to access the international capital market since January 2011 when the debut Sovereign Eurobond was issued by the DMO on behalf of the FGN.\n\nAs at today, many Nigerian Banks including United Bank for Africa, Access, Zenith and Fidelity have all issued Eurobonds to raise capital, leaning on access and opportunity provided by the 2011 debut, it further explained.",

          "title": "Telcos to factories: Nigeria\u2019s diesel-run economy threatened",
          "text": "The sky-high price of diesel is roiling businesses from telecommunications companies to manufacturers\u2019 factories, leaving the Nigerian economy under threat.\n\nIn Akure, the Ondo State capital, Horbit Food and Bakery Limited is feeling the pinch as it struggles to keep the lights on, after the cost of 500 litres of diesel it relies on to power its operations rose from N175,000 to N400,000 within months.\n\nThe bakery\u2019s problem mirrors the challenge faced by hundreds of businesses that are struggling to keep their operations alive in the face of rising diesel cost and poor power supply from the national grid.\n\nHospitals, hotels, telecommunication companies and SMEs are groaning under the new reality where fuel costs now account for over half of their expenses since diesel prices moved from about N300 per litre in January to over N800 in June and looks set to hit N1,000 before the year runs out.\n\n\u201cOur operation is solely diesel-powered, from the factory to the supply trucks, to ovens,\u201d said Olatunde Samuel, manager of Horbit Food and Bakery Limited.\n\nLast week, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria expressed concern about the implications of the \u201cover 200 percent increase in the price of AGO on the Nigerian economy and the manufacturing sector.\u201d\n\nIt said: \u201cMore worrisome is the deafening silence from the public sector as regards the plight of manufacturers. Four obvious questions that readily come to mind that are seriously begging for answers are \u2013 What can we do as a nation to strengthen our economic absorbers from external shocks? Should manufacturing companies that are already battered with multiple taxes, poor access to foreign exchange and now over 200 percent increase in price of diesel be advised to shut down operations?\n\n\u201cShould we fold our arms and allow the economy to slip into the valley of recession again? Is the nation well equipped to manage the resulting explosive inflation and unemployment rates?\u201d\n\nTo remain in business, the logical option for the bakery is to raise prices but even that has a price. High inflation rate in Nigeria has eroded the purchasing power of millions.\n\n\u201cThe association put up a uniform price for bread to curb the adverse effect of diesel price on producers,\u201d he said. \u201cOne week in, its impact was nullified by higher diesel prices.\u201d\n\nTelcos in Nigeria are struggling to keep their base stations, powered with diesel, running. The Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) recently wrote to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for approval to raise prices over the rising cost of diesel.\n\nAjibola Olude, executive secretary and chief operating officer at ATCON, said the current diesel price is affecting the operation of its members, adding that the association invited the NCC to initiate a study to verify the claims by its members.\n\n\u201cWe cannot do anything until the study is carried out and shows that there is a need to review the price upward,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Olude, the high diesel cost is raising operational costs, and its impact is affecting their ability to retain staff and pay their workforce.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the exorbitant price of fuel is affecting the activities of telecom operators but the laying-off of staff is not what will be done now. \u201cHowever, if nothing is done, that will be the end-result,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s been no official guidance from major telcos on the extent to which this would reflect on margins, according to Oluwaseun Arambada, equity research analyst (banks and telcos) at FBNQuest.\n\n\u201cHowever, we should bear in mind that the sale of tower assets by telcos and the subsequent usage under a lease agreement could moderate the impact of the diesel price increase on margins,\u201d he said.\n\nFor bakeries like Horbit to remain in business, managers are making difficult decisions to keep costs down, maintain quality output, and keep operations running.\n\nUsman Imanah, managing director and CEO of Friska Farms Limited, said the operating hours of its firm have been reduced to mitigate expenses.\n\n\u201cBefore now it depends on the demand for our product, there are times when we run the factory for 20 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are doing 10\u201311 hours now to be economical in the use of diesel. Instead of diesel power being an alternative, it is now the main source.\u201d",

Together we can restore trust, rebuild our economy and reunite the country.\u201d\n\nEarlier, he took to the airwaves to say his first economic priority would be tackling high inflation, not the tax cuts pledged by his rivals.\n\nTruss, the last hopeful to launch her official campaign, is the latest to also promise to restore trust in politics, trying to distance herself from the increasingly personal and bitter briefings and counter-briefings from the opposing camps.\n\n\u201cI will campaign as a Conservative and I will govern as a Conservative. I can lead, I can make tough decisions and I can get things done. I am ready to be prime minister from day one,\u201d Truss said.\n\nAsked why she did not resign when support disappeared for Johnson prompting last week\u2019s resignation, she said: \u201cI\u2019m a loyal person.

Fuel prices have soared in an energy crunch exacerbated by the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe leadership campaign is offering a glimpse of the difficulties the new prime minister might face, and of rifts within the party.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, who is the African Anti-Corruption Champion, on Thursday, called for the establishment of an International Anti-Corruption Court to try offenders, while urging African leaders to intensify the fight against corruption, and create more disincentives for pilfering of public funds.\n\nIn his recorded remark to celebrate the African Day of Anti-Corruption, the President in a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu, praised African leaders for gains so far recorded, admonishing that efforts must be intensified to prosecute offenders and collect resources that had been stored in other countries.\n\n\u201cDistinguished participants and fellow African leaders, corruption is evil and all efforts at tackling it are desirable. I have monitored the fight against corruption in Africa and I can see both successes and drawbacks. The battle must continue for the sake of the continent and its people no matter the difficulties.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the fight against corruption has been vigorous since 2015. A lot has been achieved in the areas of arrest, prosecution, conviction, asset recovery and anti-corruption laws.\n\n\u201cI must admit that the fight has not been a bed of roses. Truly, a lot of more work in many fronts is required. For example, civil and public servants must be ethical and professional at all times. The private sector must contribute in curving corruption. The international community needs to close safe havens. The judiciary requires more impetus. Perhaps, an International Anti-corruption Criminal Court is needed,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said family and religious values will have to be upgraded, and schools have a lot of work to do for a better society.\n\n\u201cI am extremely delighted to address the participants as we celebrate the Africa Day of Anti-Corruption. Distinguished participants, we have come a long way in the fight against corruption in Nigeria and Africa in general.\n\n\u201cMay I use this opportunity to appreciate fellow African leaders for their individual and collective efforts in fighting corruption on our continent. I appreciate all of you for the confidence reposed in me being the Africa Champion on Anti-Corruption.\n\n\u201cI understand that the theme for 2022 is \u2018Strategy and Mechanisms for the Transparent Management of Covid-19 Funds, Lessons from the Pandemic.\u2019 In Nigeria, we responded to the Covid-19 Pandemic swiftly and having tamed it, we have realized the need for more awareness campaigns on health issues and more investment in the health sector. Again, service delivery requires checkmating corruption,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President told African leaders that \u201cwe must get rid of corruption in Africa if the continent is to realize its full potentials.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have come to realize that nations in Africa have to ensure that national resources are not taken to safe havens around the world and we must curtail Illicit Financial Flows in all its ramifications. Also, we must work collectively to recover all resources taken abroad. We must show looters that crime does not pay by depriving them of the proceeds of their crime.\n\n\u201cAlso, elite greed and irresponsibility must be eradicated in Africa. Again, ethics, decency, decorum and respect for rule of law must be promoted in Africa. It is important to develop strategies for behavioral change in Africa if corruption is to be tamed. This will ensure that national resources are allowed to serve the population and not a tiny few,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said Anti-Corruption Agencies must be empowered and allowed to deliver on their mandates.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, I am very proud of our Anti-Corruption Agencies, our law enforcement agencies and our regulatory bodies for their efforts at checking criminality including corruption. I very deeply appreciate them for their sacrifices,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that the fight against corruption must be sustained for the benefit of present and future generations.\n\n\u201cOur youths have no place to go and live with dignity but in Africa. As I am leaving office next year, I am proud to leave behind a legacy of fighting corruption among others.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I abhor corruption and I will render my best in or out office to get rid of corruption in Nigeria and Africa in general. I urge our youths to join me in this noble cause,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged African leaders to work together at whatever level to get rid of corruption in Africa, adding \u201cPosterity will judge us right if we deal with corruption as appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe President said it was imperative to kill corruption in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n\u201cIt will give our citizens a better life,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "BREAKING: Baba Ijesha found guilty of sexual assault of minor",
          "text": "Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court has sentenced Nollywood actor and comedian, Olanrewaju James, popularly known as Baba Ijesha, to 16 years imprisonment over sexual assault.\n\nJustice Taiwo gave the judgment on Thursday, adding that the jail term will run concurrently which will be served out in 5 years and not the entire 16 years.\n\nBaba Ijesha is facing six counts of child defilement that include indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault by penetration.\n\nThe Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions, which proffered the charges against the actor, argued that the offences contravene Section 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015, which stipulates life imprisonment for offenders.\n\nBaba Ijesha pleaded not guilty to all the counts.\n\nDelivering the judgement, Justice Taiwo said that the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of all the charges against him.\n\nHowever, she found the defendant guilty of two of the six counts against him.\n\nThe defendant was arraigned on June 24, 2021. During the trial, six prosecution witnesses testified against him.\n\nThey were actress and comedienne, Princess, the 14-year-old minor, a child expert, Mrs Olabisi Ajayi-Kayode, and medical doctor, Dr Aniekan Makanjuola.\n\nOthers were the Investigating Police Officer, ASP Wahab Kareem and a policewoman, Insp. Abigail Omane.\n\nThe DPP closed its case against the defendant on Dec. 15, 2021 while Baba Ijesha called four witnesses and closed its defence on April 1.\n\nThe defence witnesses were Baba Ijesha (defendant) and Mr Lawrence Ayeni, an expert in video production and CCTV installation and maintenance.\n\nMr Olukayode Olugbemi, a clinical psychologist and Mr Olukayode Ogunbanjo, the defendant\u2019s friend and colleague also testified for the defence.\n\nJustice Oluwatoyin Taiwo, adjourned the case for judgment on 14 July after the prosecution and defence counsel had adopted their final written addresses.\n\nDefence counsel, Mr Dada Awosika (SAN), in adopting his final written address dated May 12 and filed on May 16, urged the court to dismiss the suit and discharge the defendant.\n\nAwosika argued that the footage of the Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) was illegally obtained.\n\nHe said: \u201d In the interest of justice, the exhibit A which was the CCTV footage that recalled the event was illegally obtained.\n\n\u201cThe exhibit was not tendered by the maker. It was tendered by Princess, the complainant.\n\nHe argued that the recording had been tampered with especially since the defendant did not go to the complainant\u2019s house uninvited.\n\nAwosika added that this was even more strange as he was accused of a crime seven years ago which was not reported to the police.\n\nHe further submitted that the alleged confessional statement of the defendant failed the provision of Section 9 (3 ) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law (ACJL) of Lagos State 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Evidence Act allows legislation to guide the admissibility of document before the court. ACJL has stated that if a confessional statement is to be used, it must meet some certain degree by ACJL which is not applied in this case.\n\n\u201cWe urge the court to discredit the confessional statement. The defendant moved in a jiffy to participate in a short skit that put him in trouble. My Lord, my client was trapped.\n\n\u201cConcerning the age of the girl in question, Exhibits D and E are not saying the same thing.\n\n\u201cIt is our submission My Lord, that the court is bound to call the biological mother inside the box to tell us her real age or her birth certificate or scientific evidence is tendered to ascertain the age but none was done.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution agreed that the age of the minor must be established. However, it has also agreed that nothing has been done to provide the real age,\u201d Awosika said.\n\nThe Director of DPP, Dr Babajide Martins, in his final written address dated May 31, however, urged the court to convict Baba Ijesha as charged.\n\nHe argued that one of the defence witness, Mr Lawrence Ayeni told the court that the CCTV recording could not be manipulated.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of the CCTV recording My Lord, the first defence witness(Ayeni) told this honourable court during cross-examination that it cannot be manipulated and that the content of CCTV cannot be changed.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, he said he cannot say if the sexual assault did not happen. These are the testimonies from the defence witness My Lord.\n\n\u201cThe defendant admitted to have been with the girl in both the incident that happened seven years ago and the one that happened in 2021.\n\n\u201cHe also admitted to have sucked her fingers during the cross-examination.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of ACJL, the primary legislation supersedes the secondary legislation.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of medical certificate, the defendant said he did not have any issue with the medical doctor and had never met him when I cross-examined him.\n\n\u201cAs a result, he has no reason to mislead the court,\u201d Martins said.\n\nMartins further told the court that the definition of a child was anybody below the age of 18 years and that the prosecution had proven that the girl was below the age.\n\nHe added that the charge of defilement can be meted out irrespective of the age below 18.\n\nMartins said: \u201cSo far the age of the survivor is not up to 18, the charge is still defilement.My Lord, no amount of brilliant address can substitute for the evidence before the court.\n\n\u201cWe have a compelling evidence of six prosecution witnesses which I must say are not contradictory.\n\nThe DPP said the defendant also admitted during the trial that he never mentioned that he was acting a script when he was detained by the police at Sabo and Panti.\n\n\u201cOur position is that the prosecution has proven its case beyond reasonable doubts and we urge the court to please sentence the defendant as charged,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Ivana Trump, Donald Trump\u2019s first wife and the mother of three of his children, has died aged 73.\n\n\u201cShe was a wonderful, beautiful, and amazing woman, who led a great and inspirational life,\u201d Mr Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nMs Trump, who was born in what is now the Czech Republic, married the former president in 1977. They divorced 15 years later in 1992.\n\nThey had three children together \u2013 Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, police are investigating the cause of death, which \u201cappeared to be accidental\u201d.\n\nThe pair were notable public figures in New York in the 1980s and 1990s, and their split was the subject of intense public interest.\n\nAfter their separation, Ms Trump went on to launch her own lines of beauty products, clothing and jewellery.\n\nShe took credit for bringing up their children in her 2017 memoir Raising Trump, saying she \u201cmade the decisions about their education, activities, travel, child care, and allowances\u201d until college.\n\nIn the book, she added that her relationship with Mr Trump had improved since their divorce, and said she spoke to him about once a week.\n\nThe Trump family lauded her in a statement as \u201ca force in business, a world-class athlete, a radiant beauty, and caring mother and friend\u201d.\n\n\u201cIvana Trump was a survivor. She fled from communism and embraced this country,\u201d the statement added. \u201cShe taught her children about grit and toughness, compassion and determination.\u201d\n\nMr Trump was her second husband. Her first, Alfred Winklmayr, was an Austrian ski instructor and friend who she reportedly married in order to obtain Austrian citizenship.\n\nThat marriage allowed her to leave her communist home country \u2013 which was then Czechoslovakia \u2013 without defecting.\n\nA long-time skier, Ms Trump is said to have skied competitively in the country.\n\nBut Mr Trump\u2019s claims that she was an alternate on the 1972 Winter Olympics team were refuted in 1989 by a local Olympic official.\n\nWhile living in Canada in the 1970s, she worked as a ski instructor and model.\n\nOn a work trip to New York City in 1976, she met Mr Trump while with a group of models. They were married the following year and quickly became a tabloid fixture.\n\nOver the course of their marriage, Ms Trump held several roles within the Trump Organization, including as manager of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.\n\nBut Mr Trump reportedly locked her out of her office at the hotel in 1990 as they sparred over four pre-nuptial agreements.\n\nWhen the divorce settlement was finalised in 1992, Ms Trump had signed a non-disclosure agreement but also received $14m (\u00a311.8m) and a mansion in Connecticut among other things.\n\nShe was also married twice more: to Italian businessman Riccardo Mazzucchelli, from 1995-97; and to Italian actor Rossano Rubicondi, from 2008-09.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani wrote on Twitter that Ms Trump was \u201ca truly talented, creative and beautiful person\u201d, who had \u201ccontributed greatly\u201d to his city.\n\n\u201cShe lived the American Dream,\u201d said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a top Trump ally.\n\nAnd media personality Piers Morgan described Ms Trump as \u201ca fabulously entertaining lady and great interviewee who remained fiercely loyal to her ex-husband\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, she told ABC\u2019s Good Morning America that she didn\u2019t want to make Mr Trump\u2019s current wife Melania jealous by calling him at the White House. \u201cI\u2019m basically first Trump wife. OK? I\u2019m first lady,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was one of many memorable quotes from the former model. In a cameo role in the 1996 movie The First Wives Club, she told disgruntled divorcees: \u201cLadies, you have to be strong and independent. And remember, don\u2019t get mad, get everything.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "Mr Tein Jack-Rich, one of the All Progressives Congress (APC), presidential aspirants in the last National Convention of the party, says only an economic liberalisation strategy will help Nigeria overcome its current challenges.\n\nJack-Rich said to achieve this, policy makers must award deep tax cuts, promote sectoral economic stimulus through soft credit lines to help indegenous companies produced the country\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201dAs an entrepreneur and industrialist of the 5th era of industrial revolution, where digital transformation and technology boom have taken artificial intelligence to record high economic levels, one key engine we need in 2023 is economic liberalisation.\n\n\u201dIt is a phenomenal tool to activate private capital growth, and to join the trillion-dollar economic league,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the philanthropist, global economic trend has its impact on Africa, which accounts for only three per cent of global trade with seven per cent of trade deficit.\n\n\u201dIt is difficult to fathom the assertion that a struggling economy with negative trade balance of 19.3 per cent also exposed to surging global inflationary turmoil, due to high import dependency on what it can produce, can survive a hike in interest rate as the best monetary policy response to address surging inflation.\n\n\u201dThis is because the current inflation is cost push rather than demand pull.\u201d\n\n\n\nJack-Rich, however, said it was uncertain to see any political economist within the Sub Saharan Africa aligned with the policy postulation, calling for a hike in interest rate as best fit for the economy or good and stability of struggling low-income households living below N400 daily.\n\n\n\nThe business mogul therefore, called for a holistic approach to the country\u2019s economic policies.\n\n\u201dIgnoring economic stimulus and pursuing interest rate hike, with the taxman on the neck of businesses, will further stifle earnings and worsen access to credit for large ticket investments,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the oil tycoon, this will increase unemployment rates, and further exacerbate the wind of economic recession, and possibly social issues.",

          "text": "The Lagos State Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court sitting in the Ikeja area has convicted and sentenced Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju James, popularly known as Baba Ijesha to 16 years imprisonment for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old minor.\n\nJustice Oluwatoyin Taiwo, in a judgment that lasted two hours also convicted Baba Ijesha of four out of the six counts for which he was charged by the Lagos State government.\n\nThe charge against him borders on allegations of indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration, and sexual assault by penetration.\n\nREAD ALSO: Court Convicts Baba Ijesha Of Sexually Assaulting Minor\n\nBaba Ijesha was pronounced guilty of counts 2,3,4 and 5 while the prosecution could not prove counts one and six which were: sexual assault by penetration and attempted sexual assault by penetration.\n\nIn her sentence, the court said, \u201cI hereby find the defendant guilty of counts two to five and he is discharged of counts one and six. The defendant is hereby sentenced to five years imprisonment for count two, three years for count three, five years for count four and three years for count five.\u201d\n\nThe sentence adds up to 16 years but the court held that the sentence is to run concurrently starting from the day he was convicted. This means that Baba Ijesha will only spend five years in prison.\n\nIn reaching its verdict, the court held that defendant confessed that he molested the girl in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe court can convict a person based on his confessions. The defendant was consistent in his admission in the two videos.\n\n\u201cThe pain of the first prosecution witness (Damilola Adekoya also known as Princess) was real.\n\nThe survivor who also testified was scared and we could see the fear in her eyes while she was giving her evidence before the court.\n\n\u201cThe argument of the defence that the prosecution failed to state the exact age of the survivor cannot stand as the law states that anyone under the age of 18 years is regarded as a child.\n\n\u201cThe defendant may not have thought of having sex with the survivor on that day but he aroused her by sucking her fingers and rubbing her body. He did not take off his clothes while arousing her.\n\nThe court reviewed the medical expert and the testimony of the two witnesses, the forensic analyst and child expert, Mrs. Olabisi Ajayi-Kayode and a medical doctor, Dr. Aniekan Makanjuola who said that there was blunt penetration of the vagina but they could not ascertain the time.\n\n\u201cThe time has elapsed on the assault and the medical examination; the injury would have been erased seven years ago.\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution called six witnesses including the survivor, the mother of the victim (princess), investigation officers and medical experts.\n\nFor the defence, four witnesses testified for defendant in the case.\n\nAfter he was found guilty, the defendant\u2019s counsel, Mr. Kayode Olabiran asked the court to temper justice with mercy.\n\nHe said that the defendant is a first-time offender who has passed through the trauma of incarceration both at Kirikiri Correctional facility and Panti when he was arrested and remanded.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the defendant is remorseful. We pray my lord to consider the fact that the defendant is an actor who has impacted positively on society in the course of his career.\n\n\u201cWe urge your lordship to be lenient with the defendant who has lost his image all over the world and will be deserted by his colleagues in the movie industry.\n\n\u201cHe has aged parents, a wife, and a son who depend on him and they look up to him coming back home. We assure the court that the defendant is a changed person who will not go back to his vomit. We urge the court to be merciful unto him and consider the least sentence.\u201d\n\nThe judge while sentencing the convict said, this case bring to the limelight, numerous cases in society despite the efforts of government and non-governmental organizations to sensitize the public.\n\n\u201cThis is very sad. The behavior of the defendant is appalling, the case shows the length people can go in exhibiting the animalistic urge in them to abuse the position of friendship.\n\n\u201cChildren are frequently preyed on because of their inability to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nAfter the judgement, the convict broke down in tears, weeping and saying he did not commit the offence. He was however surrounded by his colleagues in the industry who came to console him.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the armed forces to wipe out terrorists, bandits and other enemies of the country from the surface of the earth with immediate effect in order to bring lasting peace to the country and the African continent in general.\n\nThe president who gave the directive on Thursday during the graduation ceremony of the Senior Course 44 of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji, Kaduna State, vowed that the masterminds of the recent Kuje Prison Attack and other attacks across the country must not be allowed to go free, but must be sent to their creator.\n\nHe lamented that recent attacks by terrorists and bandits in different parts of the country, bear the hallmark of national and trans-border insurgency which is a threat trying to wreak havoc in Nigeria as well as in neighbouring countries, one which must be quashed once and for all.\n\nPresident Buhari celebrated the sacrifices and successes of the Nigerian military in defending the country courageously.\n\nThe president pledged that his government would continue to provide the needed support required to wipe out terrorists and insurgents \u2018\u2018off the face of the earth.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018The Armed Forces of Nigeria are working tirelessly to enhance their combat effectiveness, operational capability and training necessary to eliminate the threats, in synergy with other institutions and nations.\n\n\u2018\u2018The response of the Armed Forces of Nigeria to the Boko Haram insurgency, banditry, militancy, kidnapping as well as the activities of separatists and armed militias amongst others have been commendable.\n\n\u2018\u2018This government will continue to provide the required guidance and support to ensure that the desired results are achieved,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari Visits Kuje Prison Hours After Attack\n\nKuje Prison Attack: Buhari Presides Over National Security Council Meeting\n\nKuje Prison Attack: Buhari Unwilling To Hold His Appointees Accountable \u2013 ACF\n\nBuhari noted that most of the security challenges facing the world today were both asymmetric and trans-border in nature, involving mainly non-state actors in different regions and sub-regions of the world.\n\nHe added that the West African sub-region and indeed our beloved continent of Africa are not immune to these threats.\n\n\u2018\u2018We have witnessed recent terrorist attacks in Nigeria bearing the hallmark of national and trans-border insurgents trying to cause havoc in Nigeria as well as in neighbouring countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018It will be part of your duty to confront these terrorists and insurgents and wipe them off the face of the earth and bring peace to our countries,\u2019\u2019 the President told the graduating students.\n\nPresident Buhari described the specifics of their training which focused primarily on countering security threats as very important, adding that \u2018\u2018combating these prevalent security threats effectively demands that African countries continue to work together at all levels; be it tactical, operational and strategic.\u2019\u2019\n\nAppraising the ongoing collaboration of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger Republic, Benin Republic and Chad in a multinational operation to combat the Boko Haram Insurgency in the Lake Chad region, the Nigerian leader said it has been productive, commendable and successful.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The synergy achieved in operating together must have been enhanced by an understanding of the doctrines of the cooperating forces.\n\n\u2018\u2018This occasion provides me another opportunity to briefly reflect on the state of the Nigerian nation, particularly regarding national security. The last 12 years have been very challenging for our nation, considering the different security threats that have besieged the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our government is poised to promote national security and development, as well as to remain committed to promoting a vision of a secure, safe, just, peaceful, prosperous and strong Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018We shall be employing all elements of our national power in ensuring security, a just society, peaceful coexistence, national unity and sustainable development while promoting our good standing internationally.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari expressed delight that amongst the graduating students were international officers from sister African countries, saying he is confident they enjoyed the friendliness of the country during their stay.\n\nDescribing Nigeria as still one of the most hospitable and enjoyable countries to visit and stay, despite her diversity and challenges, the President enjoined the Course 44 fellows to keep fond memories of the over 40-year college, which prepares officers for tactical and operational level leadership, focusing on national security, joint planning processes, inter-agency cooperation and operations as well as multinational integration.\n\nFurther, he told the graduating students that their participation in the Course was a further testimony of national security aspirations to promote international peace, friendship and cooperation.\n\n\u2018\u2018To the graduating students from Nigeria\u2019s Ministries, Departments and Agencies, you have indeed justified the confidence reposed in you by your respective organizations. Congratulations!\n\n\u2018\u2018We must specially commend the spouses of the graduands here for keeping the home front and without whose sacrifices there would have been no celebrations for many here today.\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also commended the Commandant and his team for transforming the graduating students into highly refined products and for the ongoing work to expand and upgrade the facilities of the College. This is to provide a conducive and amenable environment that is fit for purpose.\n\n\u2018\u2018Your efforts are maintaining the status of the College as a mid-level military training institution of repute. I therefore commend the College Board as well as the Commandant and staff for these remarkable achievements.\n\n\u2018\u2018This government will continue to support the College in its developmental strides. My administration will also continue to give priority to the training and welfare of officers and men of our Armed Forces.\n\n\u2018\u2018You, the graduating students, should realize that the nation has made a lot of investment in your training up to this stage of your respective careers.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am confident that you have been sufficiently groomed in character and learning to take up the challenges you will be confronted with hereafter.\n\n\u2018\u2018For the Nigerian graduating students amongst you, the graduation today is a clarion call to duty in service to our country. Nigeria expects the very best from you in terms of loyalty, commitment to duty and service to your fatherland.\n\n\u2018\u2018Therefore, you must endeavour to make honest and positive contributions in the discharge of the constitutional responsibilities of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, your strategic Ministries, Department and Agencies and be good ambassadors of the Armed Forces Command and Staff College,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nIn his address of welcome, the Commandant of the College, Air Vice Marshall (AVM) Olurotimi Tuwase, explained that 111 army officers, 69 naval officers, 42 air force officers, 10 students from paramilitary organisations and Ministries, Department and Agencies as well as 15 international students completed the 48 weeks intensive training, leading to the award of Pass Staff Course (PSC).\n\nAVM Tuwase added that the international students on the Senior Course 44 were from Burkina Faso, Cameroun, Chad, The Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia.\n\nThe Commandant thanked the President for his unflinching support to the College, noting that students from the prestigious school have been sufficiently trained and equipped to cope with most challenges in their career, with the staff and leadership skills acquired in the College.\n\n\u2018\u2018The College has laid a solid professional foundation for you to make informed decisions,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAt the event, President Buhari presented PSC certificates and awards to select graduands as well as the best graduating students.\n\nMajor Sunday Olayinka Atomode, bagged three awards namely Minister of Defence Award for highest overall score, Chief of Defence Staff Award for Department of Joint Studies and Chief of Army Staff Award for Department of Land Warfare.\n\nLt.-Cdr.

He queries how someone who could not Islamise his immediate family and home will do so for the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the more the opposition parties join the Muslim-Muslim ticket debate, the more I am satisfied that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu\u2019s decision is right. We need courageous people and we can\u2019t continue to do business as usual.\n\n\u201cNigerians complain things are not working and we\u2019ve struggled to balance this religious issue in recent past. If balancing is all we need to fix this country. since 1999 it has been efforts to balance the religion, ethnicity, primordial at the expense of good governance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think Asiwaju has taken first step that this government when elected, will have the courage to take bold decisions that are necessary to reposition Nigeria. We must think outside the box.\n\n\u201cFor ordinary Nigerians who do not have access to TV and newspaper, I don\u2019t think it bothers them, who is coming in and who will create the jobs, jobs that will pay decent wages, who will bring an end to this endless destruction to academic calendar, who will ensure the textile industry is back, moving the economy away from just talking about growth to actual development. For me I am satisfied that Asiwaju has taken the first bold step, when elected he will take decisions that will turn the fortunes of the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor those saying his plan is to islamise Nigeria, the question is that, even the candidate himself, Asiwaju, has he Islamised his family? His wife is a pastor and he did\u2019t stop that., so can he Islamise Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am troubled that even at this time that both Christians and Muslims poor are united in poverty, those who are seeking political office indulge themselves in balancing religion, ethnicity and all the dysfunctional primordial sentiments. For me there has to be a courageous person, and Asiwaju has shown that he is one that will take religion to where it becomes where CAN manages the business of the church, JNI manages Mosques and not meddle into politics\n\n\u201cGiving the level of criminality, fraud, corruption in Nigeria, does it reflect the society that is so religious? I see a lot of hypocrisy. In my view, only God knows who is a believer. The fact that a man goes to Church tells you little or nothing about his beliefs. The fact that a man sleeps in the mosque is not enough evidence he is a Muslim. We have people who go to Mosque to steal people\u2019s shoes, just like I have seen people who to Church to steal handset, those are not Christians, those are not Muslims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur presidential candidate is a happily married man, He has demonstrated not only religious tolerance, but respect for people\u2019s choice of faith.

          "text": "Ivana Trump, the Czech American ex-wife of former President Donald Trump and mother of Ivanka, Eric and Don Jr., died Thursday. She was 73.\n\nShe was found dead at her home at 10 east 64th street in Manhattan at 12:40 p.m.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nShe suffered cardiac arrest and was dead by the time paramedics had arrived.\n\n\u201cOur mother was an incredible woman \u2014 a force in business, a world-class athlete, a radiant beauty, and caring mother and friend,\u201d Eric Trump said in a statement announcing her death. \u201cShe will be dearly missed by her mother, her three children and ten grandchildren.\u201d\n\nA source close to Ivanka Trump told The Post the former first daughter is in \u201cshock\u201d over her mother\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThey were super close,\u201d the source said, adding that Ivana Trump had spent her last days with family in New York City.\n\nTrump, born Ivana Marie Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1, married the developer in 1977. The two divorced in 1992, but she kept her ex-husband\u2019s surname. She held many roles in Trump family businesses through her life.\n\n\u201cI am very saddened to inform all of those that loved her, of which there are many, that Ivana Trump has passed away at her home in New York City,\u201d the former president wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. \u201cShe was a wonderful, beautiful, and amazing woman, who led a great and inspirational life.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cHer pride and joy were her three children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric. She was so proud of them, as we were all so proud of her. Rest In Peace, Ivana!\u201d\n\nIvana Trump worked as a model in the early 70s, and met the former president in New York City in 1976. Their marriage was subject to intense media scrutiny, particularly over his affair with the model Marla Maples, whom he went on to marry. The pair then had daughter Tiffany Trump.\n\nThe couple\u2019s divorce received international attention, and during a deposition for its proceedings, Ivana Trump accused her then-husband of rape. She later disavowed the allegation while President Trump was running for office in 2015.\n\n\u201cI have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald,\u201d she said in the July 2015 statement. \u201cThe story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised 3 children that we love and are very proud of.\u201d",
