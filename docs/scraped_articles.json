          "title": "For DSO, a little consideration for the ordinary Nigerian",
          "text": "By Okoh Aihe\n\nThe monetisation and other advantages of the Digital Switchover, DSO, remain the most compelling narrative of this convoluting story. The entertainment sector will open up with foaming opportunities. The league of talents available in the sector will suddenly sponge up the opportunities \u2013 whether in the movies, music, comedy, live theatre shows, technical and every aspect of the entertainment sector, will suddenly become some kind of attractive pie that every entertainer with a little gift will scramble to have a piece of. And all of us writers will have more stories to write, build up a dome of adjectives to decorate an industry that continues to search for its best days.\n\nThis is the one story the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, loves to tell. I cede that to him with all respect. And when he tells the story, he waxes lyrical like Unoka in Things Fall Apart, seducing listeners with his flute, and perhaps those hearing the good news from the Minister will jostle for positions of advantage to reap from an opportunity unfolding piecemeal. The nation is bleeding for good stories. Every little strand is important to drop in the mix.\n\nIn spite of some spice of nihilism in a seemingly obliterating situation, I love good news and try to go overboard in search of some crumbs to sweeten our situation. This is why I am contributing this material with the prayers that it be considered dispassionately even by those who grumble that the Simply Tech Column haunts them unjustifiably.\n\nAnd there is no need to feel that way. The DSO process is a very big thing, bigger than personal convenience and predilections, and Nigeria, with the exaggerated claim of being the biggest economy in Africa, is far behind in execution. This is very painful and only a few people will understand why. While we talk of the business benefits of the DSO, some people fail to actually reason that one of the most important components of the DSO is the social inclusion in the value chain which unfolds into benefits for the ordinary TV viewer.\n\nThis is why the NTA, for me, presented a rare piece of good news last week, when it reported the meeting between the lower house of the National Assembly \u2013 House of Representatives and the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, to discuss ways of ensuring that the DSO process runs smoothly and also provide benefits for the ordinary Nigerian. It was a smart and needed move by the House and efforts should be channeled into such meetings to prevent the process from atrophying.\n\nOdebunmi Segun, Chairman, House Committee on Information and National Orientation, in the report monitored by this writer, was very concerned about government expenditure in the DSO and how such expenditures were being managed to profit the ordinary Nigerian out there. Government, he informed, has subsidized 908, 000 Set Top Boxes to be given out free. How far have we gone about it and how many have been activated? he asked.\n\nFor a simple recall, DSO means Digital Switchover from analogue broadcasting to digital broadcasting. Although some countries have since concluded the process, Nigeria is only now struggling along. A cardinal feature of the process is that when concluded some television sets will be unable to access TV programming, thus making the Set Top Box, which will help convert these signals, mandatorily indispensable.\n\nIn the United States, government gave out two coupons of $40 each to TV homes. The South African government is giving out free Set Top Boxes through the SABC. \u201cImportant notice. If you see this message,\u201d the station says, \u201cgo to your nearest Post Office to register for a free government subsidized decoder\u2026..to continue receiving a television broadcast.\u201d\n\nIt thus become very expedient to give considerate concern to the position of the ordinary Nigerian in the DSO value chain. This is the fellow who earns the minimum wage of N30, 000; the fellow for whom there is little respite because even that amount, now less than $65, is not being paid by the state governor who justifies this aggravating wrench with dwindling revenue from Abuja.\n\nA Set Top Box which some nations, including South Africa, are giving out free, costs N10, 000 at the moment. A state government which acquires 10, 000 Set Top Boxes will have to shell out N1bn. This is a lot of money, especially in the face of the economic tailspin facing the nation, and this math staggered me last week into thinking that the DSO was heading for the rocks if some ingenuity was not introduced into the process. The ordinary folk cannot afford it and government may not want to be involved, pleading a worsening economic reality.\n\nBut here is my appeal. An attractive spinoff of the DSO is the Digital Dividends which will cede the broadcast frequencies given up by broadcasters to the telecommunications industry. When former DG of the NBC, Mr Emeka Mba, tested the waters, one of such frequencies was ingeniously sold to MTN for about N34bn. There are two left, this writer was reliably informed. Even when I am the first to admit that the worsening security situation in the country will likely attenuate the value of the remaining two, there may still be the compelling need to put them up for sale. While such monies would necessarily go to the Federation Account, it is my appeal that a significant percentage be given to the NBC as seed fund to acquire Set Top Boxes for some TV homes across the country.\n\nWhile one was pained by the insipid participation of the Lagos State Government in the DSO launch in Lagos recently, my prayer is that as the exercise berths in Kano, the state government and the local councils should be fully mobilised to be part of the process, and explore the possibility of funding some Boxes for those who can\u2019t afford them economically. In addition, businesses, as part of their corporate social responsibility, CSR, should fund some Boxes while wealthy individuals should give some kind considerations to the ordinary Nigerians by funding their little window to the world.\n\nThis is what I think. The DSO process is far from being foolproof. There are too many contradictions and checkpoints that can abort the process any time, too much of dredges that won\u2019t be healthy to wash up. But the process should be niftily managed for the sake of the people. Some of us will also need to manage our badly concealed interests, expectations and plain but irritating meddlesomeness. The ordinary Nigerian needs a little space. You can\u2019t take food from his table and also take his television. That will be wicked.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026As Governor AbdulRazaq seeks more support for Nigeria\n\nBy Demola Akinyemi, Ilorin\n\nFrench Ambassador to Nigeria Jarome Pasquire has expressed readiness of the francophone nation to strengthen its ties with Kwara State especially in the area of agriculture, cultural exchanges, trade relations, and tourism development.\n\nPasquire said this Tuesday night in Ilorin at the state gala dinner organised by the state government in his honour and in commemoration of the second anniversary of the AbdulRazaq administration.\n\nThe dinner was preceded by the ambassador\u2019s visit to some projects of the state government and federal government\u2019s institutes.\n\nHe said,\u201dWe visited the economic side, cultural side, training, agriculture and we have been able to see how many projects Your Excellency has done in the last two years. What I can assure you as a representative of France is that we are willing to work with Nigeria and Kwara State.\n\n\u201cWe know that we have many friends of France in Nigeria. I can also assure you that there are many friends of Nigeria in France. So, we can develop more cooperations and I believe Kwara can have a prominent place in the cooperation between France and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nPasquire noted that the visit was to strengthen the existing cooperation between France and Kwara State for mutual benefits.\n\nHe added,\u201dWe are here to develop further cooperation between France and Kwara State as we already have Alliance fran\u00e7aise in Ilorin for teaching French language. It is important we have that in Kwara State which shares border with French speaking country, the Republic of Benin.\n\n\u201cWe are going to refurbish a market in the state and looking for other possible areas of cooperation. We can push for more economic cooperation. We are ready for more cooperation with the state.\n\n\u201cWe have had a busy schedule. We visited the BUA Sugar Company in Lafiagi (Edu local government). We also visited Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI). We also visited Alapa and saw the project going on there. We also visited the innovation hub, the visual art centre, and Esie Museum.\u201d\n\nGovernor AbdulRazaq, for his part, called on the French government and private companies to take advantage of peaceful and business friendly environment in the state to invest for mutual benefits.\n\nHe said,\u201dKwara is open for business and we invite French companies to come invest here. Kwara is peaceful, our climate is serene, business friendly, and our people are accommodating, skilled, and honest.\n\n\u201cAs a subnational government, we are taking steps to attract investments. We have been deliberate in committing huge resources to infrastructural and human capital development, agribusiness, small scale businesses, and safety net for the poor.\u201d\n\nHe also called on the French government and other countries to work more closely with Nigeria, especially in the area of security and sustainable economic growth.\n\n\u201cA key feature of our world today is the interdependence of nations. Whether in the area of economy, security, climate change, and general issues of sustainable development, it is clear that nation states must work together to achieve success. On that note, I join Mr. president to call on the French government and other countries to work more closely with Nigeria, especially in the area of security and sustainable economic growth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the government and people of our state, I thank Your Excellency for your willingness to partner with Kwara State in many areas, especially in agriculture and tourism. The inspiring cultural display you have seen tonight is a window to the rich cultural heritage of Kwara State.\u201d\n\nFor her part, the wife of Kwara State Governor, Ambassador Olufolake AbdulRazaq implored Ambassador Pasquire to explore several opportunities in the state\u2019s viable agricultural and other sectors.\n\nThe first lady said,\u201dKwara State and France have so much to achieve together. The recently launched 10 year Kwara State Agricultural Transformation Plan by His Excellency Governor AbdulRazaq is a proof of the opportunities that are abound in the state. I implore Ambassador Pasquire to explore several opportunities in our viable agricultural sector as well as other sectors in order to strengthen ties with Kwara State.\n\n\u201cFrench-Nigeria relations has spanned decades of beneficial intergovernmental cooperation as this has translated to robust economic, socio-political and cultural interactions. There is no gainsaying the fact that Nigeria is the largest partner of France in sub-saharan Africa and fourth largest in Africa behind Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. I hope with the collaboration with Kwara it will bring us closer to overtaking the other countries in closeness and economic ties.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, trade between Nigeria and France amounted to over 4.79m euro. In 2018 however Nigeria ranked 28th among suppliers to France globally with foreign direct investment of 9.4bn euro. France is one of Nigeria\u2019s leading investors and this we are very proud of.\n\n\u201cApart from the economic ties, both countries equally enjoy cultural and political relations. From the support to combat terrorism in the Lake Chad region to cultural exchanges like the Alliance Francaise with a branch here in Ilorin. There are a lot more in stock in the arts and cultural sphere coming up in Kwara. I believe you will participate in all that is coming up.\u201d\n\nAmbassador AbdulRazaq maintained that Kwara State is more than ever ready and better positioned to absorb more development in critical sectors through partnerships, saying that the administration of AbdulRazaq has put in place policies to enhance ease of doing business in the state.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "On Buhari\u2019s calls for debt cancellation for Africa",
          "text": "By Musa Ilallah\n\nFor the developed and developing nations, borrowing in the world is not just a pastime but a necessary evil to address scorching and depressing financial needs of countries during critical times. It is a norm to take loans, grants or aids to facilitate development and to stabilise economies.\n\nIn 1988, under the banner of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, 70,000 people surrounded the G-7 Summit in Birmingham, UK demanding that the debts of 52 impoverished countries be cancelled by the year 2000.\n\nUganda, became the first country to qualify for any debt cancellation under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, but its debt was reduced by just 20%, while in 2001, Tanzania qualified for debt relief after meeting the condition to privatise its water system in Dar es Salaam.\n\nThen came Malawi which entered a food crisis just a year after it was made to sell off its grain reserves as a condition to qualify for debt relief. Malawi finally got debt relief in 2006.\n\nGhana in 2004 became the 14th country to qualify for debt relief through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, getting 50% of its debt cancelled.\n\nIn total, 14 countries have had $29 billion of debt cancelled by their various creditors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2005, under the banner of \u201cMake Poverty History\u201d, 250,000 people marched in Edinburgh, UK, during the G-8 summit calling for debt cancellation, trade justice and more and better aid. The G-8 instructed the IMF and World Bank to cancel all the debt owed to them by countries which have completed the \u2018Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\u2019 process on loans before 2003. Total debt cancelled under the scheme by the end of 2005 was $77 billion for 18 countries.\n\nHowever, international loans to the governments of the most impoverished countries increased from $56 billion in 2008 to $151 billion in 2014.\n\nGlobal prices for raw materials fell rapidly from the middle of the year, causing big falls in income and exchange rates for raw material exporters such as Ghana and Mozambique. The fall in exchange rates rapidly increased the size of debts owed in US dollars and other foreign currencies.\n\nIn response to global campaigning, the IMF agreed to $100 million of additional debt relief for the countries affected by the Ebola crisis \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nComing home, precisely in 2005 during the second term of President Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria and the creditors reached an agreement on the $30 billion debt with the Paris Club. The creditors cancelled $18 billion outstanding against Nigeria while the country repaid $12 billion. Most of the $18 billion was registered as aid, justifying the question whether the cancellation contributed to development in Nigeria.\n\nOne can vividly recall that after Nigeria exited recession in 2017, the level of new borrowings at the federal level and all tiers of government as shown in the annual Appropriation Acts, had been declining as part of the Buhari administration\u2019s commitment and measures to moderate the rate of growth in the public debt stock in order to ensure debt sustainability.\n\nNew borrowing to part-finance budget deficits declined steadily from N2.36 trillion in 2017 to N2.01 trillion in 2018; N1.61 trillion in 2019 and N1.59 trillion in the initial 2020 Appropriation Act.\n\nRegrettably however, the trend was reversed in 2020 due to the economic and social impact of COVID-19 pandemic as new borrowing in the revised 2020 Appropriation Act was N4.20 trillion.\n\nThis was not peculiar to Nigeria as many countries including the developing, developed and advanced countries also increased their level of borrowing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt is therefore worth noting here that apart from the new domestic borrowing of N2.3 trillion, the other new borrowings were concessional loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the tune of $3.34 billion and other multilateral and bilateral lenders.\n\nThis incremental borrowing to part-finance the 2020 Budget and the additional issuance of promissory notes were to settle some arrears of the federal government. This undoubtedly contributed to the increase in public debt stock. New domestic borrowings by state governments also contributed to the growth in the public debt stock.\n\nTotal public debt to gross domestic product as at December 31, 2020 was put at 21.61% which is within Nigeria\u2019s new limit of 40%.\n\nThe various initiatives of government to increase revenues such as the strategic revenue growth initiative and the Finance Act 2020 should help shore up government\u2019s revenue and reduce the debt service to revenue ratio.\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari has sought approval of the National Assembly for a new external borrowing plan of N2.343 trillion (about $6.183 billion) as contained in the 2021 national budget.\n\nThis new borrowing will raise Nigeria\u2019s debt stock to about N36.3 trillion while the Debt Management Office (DMO) said at the time that \u201ctotal public debt to Gross Domestic Product as at December 31, 2020 was 21.61 per cent, which is within Nigeria\u2019s new limit of 40 per cent.\u201d It added that the proposed new capital raising is the new external borrowing already provided for in the 2021 Appropriation Act.\n\nThe president also urged the National Assembly to approve a list of all donor-funded projects under the 2018-2020 Federal Government External Borrowing rolling Plan.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari at the most recent summit in Paris called on European countries and global financial institutions to consider debt cancellation for African countries aimed at reducing devastating effect of the Corona virus pandemic on African economies through restructuring debt portfolios, opting for complete reliefs, and releasing vaccines to the continent, which is still behind in protecting majority of its citizens.\n\nHe noted that the fall in commodity prices as Covid-19 took a toll on the global economy further slowed growth in some countries and strained health facilities.\n\n\u201cIt is in this vein that we solicit the support of the French government with its influence in the European Union to lend its voice to the efforts being made to mobilize additional resources for developing economies most especially Africa in order to strengthen the quantum of investments to our economies. This financial support should also be extended to the private sector,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president used the unique opportunity offered by the gathering to call on the European Union to encourage fair and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines in less developed countries and further promote the establishment of manufacturing facilities.\n\nThe president rightly noted that many African countries were already experiencing debt distress. He expressed the view that the debt service suspension by France and G-20 countries did not go far enough adding that there was need for more sustainable and affordable financing solutions including debt relief and further debt restructuring.\n\nOn the Paris agreement for Climate Change, President Buhari noted that African countries would need financial support for green energy investment and COP-26.\n\nHe said Nigeria will refocus on gas, while adopting a strategic revenue growth Initiative.\n\nOn the theme of \u201cAfrica Private Sector \u2014 Reforms \u2013 Infrastructure\u2019\u2019, President Buhari who spoke on a number of burning issues affecting African countries disclosed that Public Private Partnership, PPP will be fully explored to ensure more precision in development, cutting down waste and reducing chances of corruption.\n\n\u201cThe government intends to leverage on Public Private Partnership to bolster its job creation and anti-corruption drive. In terms of job creation, Nigeria has an abundant labour force since 30.5 percent of its population is between the ages of 25 and 54\u2019\u2019, he said.",
          "summary": "Then came Malawi which entered a food crisis just a year after it was made to sell off its grain reserves as a condition to qualify for debt relief.\nMalawi finally got debt relief in 2006.\nGhana in 2004 became the 14th country to qualify for debt relief through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, getting 50% of its debt cancelled.\nThis undoubtedly contributed to the increase in public debt stock.\nNew domestic borrowings by state governments also contributed to the growth in the public debt stock.",

          "title": "Nigeria can \u2013 and must \u2013 climb out of the hole made by corruption",
          "text": "By Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede\n\nI was 13 years old in 1979, when Nigeria began to slip into a dark, frightening hole that seemed to have appeared overnight, and from which it has yet to emerge: corruption.\n\nUntil that point, I had walked with a particular adolescent swagger \u2013 that of a young citizen of a newly independent nation that really mattered on the world stage; of a country whose voice carried loud and clear in the community of nations. To me, Nigeria was a country that produced wonderful writers, excellent athletes, and brilliant leaders. It was the most populous African nation, one where English was spoken well and whose national IQ was one of the highest in the world. Life in Nigeria, while of course not perfect, was in so many respects good. And it was getting better.\n\nMy secondary school, looking back, provided a reflection of what was happening in Nigeria. In 1977 I was fortunate to attend an elite state-run secondary school, where by any African standard I had access to first-class teachers, academic resources, and sporting facilities. Then that hole emerged seemingly from nowhere, and into its bowels vanished so much of what was good about Nigeria.\n\nSuddenly, my school was no longer a centre of excellence, but an underfunded, overcrowded relic of past glory where standards had plummeted overnight. It was a microcosm of the insidious power of the corruption gripping Nigeria, where good was sucked into that forbidding hole and turned into bad. A nation that had up to that point embraced merit in most things, at least those things my childish mind grasped, had done an abrupt about-turn, and chosen instead to pursue mediocrity.\n\nAt that time, in 1979, Nigeria had just emerged from military rule, the only system of governance I had known since birth in 1966. Power was again handed to civilian authority \u2013 but it was not to last long before the military once again seized power in 1983 (and effectively held it again until the turn of the millennium). In 1982, a year before the military seized power from our civilian government for the second time, I began my four years of university studies. Not much changed; certainly, things were not getting any better.\n\nIndeed, if I thought that it was the civilians who could not manage our country properly, what followed when we returned to military rule proved that any civilian government is better than a military one. Dictatorship was not only bad socially and economically, but from a global point of view Nigeria was a pariah nation unable to get its act together, and on its way to joining the club of failed African states.\n\nOur military administrations from 1983 on are reckoned by some to have been the most corrupt of all, but perhaps Nigeria was so corrupted already that no one really noticed. Perhaps the hole was now so deep already that it no longer really mattered if it got deeper.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThen the miraculous happened, and in 1999 Nigeria returned to civilian rule. For the next eight years, because we had once again embraced meritocracy, our country experienced a renaissance. Nigeria made more progress in that short period than it had in the preceding 25 years. We began to climb out of that terrible hole, the one we had dug for ourselves. But then, just as we got our heads above the ground, we lost our footing and we started slipping back down again. Today, I believe, we are almost in the same position we found ourselves in 1999; we have wasted many of the opportunities and outcomes our eight-year renaissance had afforded us.\n\nBy now our country should be flying!\n\nConsequently, I have found myself asking: does our apparent inability to climb out of the hole we are in mean that we Nigerians have accepted that we cannot do any better? That our lot in life, even though we can compete intellectually with any nation on Earth, is much worse than we had dreamed it would be? That our children are consigned to being third-class citizens of the world (unless they emigrate and find opportunity elsewhere)?\n\nHere is another question to ponder. When I was a small boy, our nation was 60-million strong. When that hole yawned open when I was 13, we stood at around 80 million. Today, we have more than 200-million people mired down there, and in 30 years\u2019 time there will be over 400 million in number. Would that not be the very definition of Hell?\n\nThese are the things I dwell upon, the fears that I have for my beloved Nigeria. But then, I look to the examples of other countries that have climbed out of their own holes of poor performance and, instead of basket cases, have become success stories: countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and China. Surely, if they can, we can, too?\n\nThat is the story that I want for my nation. I certainly do not presume to have all the answers \u2013 indeed, I might not have many \u2013 but I have resolved to employ the resources I have (financial and otherwise) to do my utmost to change Nigeria\u2019s sad narrative. It is an investment in a brighter future for my country and all who live in it \u2013 and it is certainly well worth making.",

          "title": "FG fumes as Twitter pulls down Buhari\u2019s civil war tweet",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Okwe Obi, Abuja Abuja and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nApplause and condemnations, yesterday, trailed Twitters decision to delete President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s civil war tweet.\n\nIn the tweet shared on Tuesday, Buhari spoke about the civil war experience and threatened to deal with those \u201cbent on destroying\u201d Nigeria through \u201cinsurrection.\u201d\n\nBuhari had in series of tweet on Tuesday via is verified Twitter handle @MBuhari tweeted: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian civil war. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nTwitter rules prohibit a number of actions from users, including violence, abuse and hateful conduct.\n\nFollowing several complaints, Twitter deleted the tweet, stating: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, accused Twitter of double standard. He said while the social media giant had conveniently ignored inciting tweets by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and his cohorts, displaying the same biases it did during the EndSARS protest last year, where government and private properties were looted and set on fire but finds Buhari\u2019s tweet offensive.\n\nHe alleged Twitter\u2019s role is suspect and Nigeria would not be fooled.\n\n\u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed.\n\n\u201cTwo, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? We are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nAccording to the minister, Buhari\u2019s comment cannot be compared to the directive by Kanu to his followers to kill soldiers, policemen and burn down government facilities.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very, very suspect. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the EndSARS protests that was funding EndSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of former president of US, Trump. And you see, when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during EndSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\n\n\u201cYou see, we are not going to be be fooled by anybody. We have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter mission in Nigeria citing those two examples is very suspect. What is their agenda?\n\n\u201cHow does Mr. President\u2019s speech that anybody who is destroying infrastructure, who is destroying police offices, who is destroying INEC offices should be ready for the consequences, is that inciting violence?\u201d\n\nHowever, Former President of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike and former second vice president of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Monday Onyekachi Ubani and others hailed Twitters.\n\nUbani described Buhari\u2019s tweet as hate language.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the tweet has been pulled down shows that some of us who said it was wrong of the president to threaten his citizens are justified in our position. I saw that tweet as sensational especially as he was talking to his children and said he will unleash a language they will understand; that is hate language and I\u2019m happy that it has been deleted. What the president needs to do is to say I didn\u2019t mean it. What we need now is to call for a truce and listen to what the people are saying; threats will not solve our problem.\u201d\n\nAdeolu Ogunbanjo, national president, National Association of Telecommunications Subscribers (NATCOMS) said: \u201cI see his (Buhari) choice of words offensive to the younger generation and obviously it is a threat because his words were too open ended and coming. I think he should calm down and look at what Twitter is saying; that you can\u2019t use their medium to be threatening a whole generation of a country. These people he is threatening are supposed to be the ones in charge.\u201d\n\nJide Awe, chief executive officer of Jidaw Systems Limited said: \u201cThe truth is that all social media big tech platforms are private platforms. My assumption is that such actions are taken when a user\u2019s post is deemed to be against the social media platform\u2019s community guidelines and terms. All users agree to those rules when they sign up. Having social media accounts is a choice.\n\n\u201cIn view of their reach and influence, many world leaders use these platforms to communicate with their citizens and the world. The global response to posts and tweets is a sign of the power of social media platforms. However, they own their private platforms. On their own, these platforms determine when a user breaks the rules and the actions to take when there is a violation.\n\n\u201cFormer US President, Donald Trump had his tweets deleted and received several warnings and \u201cviolation\u201d reports on his tweets before he was eventually banned from Twitter.\u201d\n\nTwitter has also been on fire of the president\u2019s utterance. Former Ekiti governor, Peter Ayodele Fayose, @GovAyoFayose, tweeted: \u201cNigeria is boiling everywhere and all that the president can do is to be threatening genocide up and down? Now that Twitter has dealt with our almighty President Buhari, won\u2019t he \u201cdeal\u201d with Twitter too? Like Trump, like Buhari.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those using the president\u2019s powers for him do not know when and where to stop their power-madness. Regrettably, Twitter may not know that Buhari is not the one operating the handle. Can our president operate android phone not to talk of making genocidal tweets?\n\n\u201cA president who cannot address his own people in time of crisis can certainly not be the one tweeting on the crisis. Twitter should rather hold Garba Shehu, Lie Mohammad and co accountable.\u201d\n\nSenator Shehu Sani @ShehuSani: \u201cThe President should talk to us\u2026.The President should address us\u2026The President should speak to us\u2026.now una don hear am.\n\nReno Omokri @renoomokri: \u201cLie Mohammed accuses @Twitter and @Jack of sponsoring\n\n@MaziNnamdiKanu: \u201cHow pathetic! When Twitter permanently suspended Trump\u2019s account, Buharists celebrated. Then, Twitter was not sponsoring IPOB. And you are surprised Twitter chose Ghana over Nigeria?\n\nDele Momodu Ovation @DeleMomodu: \u201cI had no answer until i saw the video\u2026 it was a sad day for those who still have some modicum of belief in project nigeria. The president did not declare war on bandits and herdsmen but was interested in fighting another civil war, and said so openly. That was an all-time low!!\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the trenchant criticisms, a group, Vanguard for Peace and National Development, backed President Buhari\u2019s vow to crush separatist groups.\n\nIts Executive Director, Mr Ahmed Tijani, in a statement, commended the president for his stance on the agitation\n\nTijani also enjoined the government to probe alleged alliances between some highly placed politicians with managers of various security agencies in the country.\n\nAccording to him, Buhari\u2019s zero tolerance for the activities of proscribed groups was evident in his resolve to ensure Nigeria remains an indivisible entity.\n\nHe said it had become imperative to investigate true identities of some high-ranking security officers and politicians with proscribed groups.\n\n\u201cWe are equally privy to series of secret meetings between some politicians and managers of security outfits in the country.\n\n\u201cAs a group of patriots, we cannot afford to keep mute when these types of issues come up,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nBut Uwazuruike wondered why Buhari has not threatened Boko Haram, kidnappers and bandits, but was quick to threaten peaceful protesters asking for a referendum.\n\n\u201cI am not surprised, the president acted true to type, he has shown his true colour. He was speaking from his heart, he was not reading a speech. His speech manifests his 97 per cent versus 5 per cent stance. Not long ago in Kaduna, Buhari appealed to armed bandits to release kidnapped university students, Mr President has not threatened the bandits, Boko Haram or kidnappers, he has not threatened bandits and kidnappers in his home state of Katsina, but he found it very convenient to threaten unarmed people asking for a referendum. Most people don\u2019t know that what IPOB is asking for is a referendum, not secession. What President Buhari does not understand is that if a referendum is conducted those opposed to IPOB/ESN may be more. I\u2019m not surprised that he is threatening us. I want to let Mr President know that he may defeat the Igbo but he cannot liquidate us.\u201d\n\n\u2022Igbo, Arewa groups fume\n\nLeading Igbo body, Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) condemned what it called the president\u2019s penchant for ethnic profiling, stating that his body language has given impetus to allegation that the violence in the South East was being perpetrated by some imported mercenaries to orchestrate military invasion.\n\nA statement by ADF\u2019s spokesman, Chief Abia Onyike, yesterday, expressed disappointment that instead of fishing out the criminals and making them face the law, president Buhari had rushed to threaten the people of the region.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like a message of collective annihilation. Why did he not talk like this when Fulani herdsmen killed hundreds of people in the South East and other parts of Nigeria? He should stop his policy of ethnic profiling in order to save us from genocide.\n\n\u201cThere are people who believe that the violence in the South East was imported by mercenaries from outside the zone in order to create an alibi for the military invasion of Igboland. That must be a very wicked plot. Buhari should summon a national conference to restructure/reconstitute Nigeria along the lines of genuine federalism and fiscal federalism.\n\n\u201cWe need autonomy for the regions or federating units. Calling out security agencies to invade Igboland and kill people on the streets is not the solution to the current crisis in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, pan-Arewa Socio-political Organisation, Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), in a statement by Abdul-Azeez Sulaiman, contended that Buhari\u2019s remark was not only empty but unpresidential, adding that the tweet merely amounted to admission of failure and loss of capacity.\n\n\u201cWe find it ridiculous that most parts of the president\u2019s tweet concentrated more attention to infrastructure than on the lives of citizens that are wasted daily with virtually no response from the authorities.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s revelation that most of those involved in the current agitation for secession are those who have not witnessed the 1967 civil war is a vindication of our position that the only reasonable option to ensure a more secure future is for the Igbo to be allowed to have their wish for a Biafran nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that the strength of the Igbo agitation rests on youth who are mainly below the ages of 50, with diseased mindsets induced by their forefathers and encouraged by their political, cultural and religious leaders to take up arms against the Nigerian state and Northerners, has rendered the nation\u2019s unity negotiable.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore unreasonable for those older Nigerians who are mostly above 70 to insist that the unity of Nigeria is sacrosanct whereas the people executing the dangerous Southeast secession agenda are almost entirely below 50,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nAlaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, yesterday, said agitation for self-determination canvassed by some groups should not be seen as act of felony, saying the principle of self-determination by federating units was the pillar on which Nigeria was built at independence in 1960.\n\nThe monarch made the disclosure in a statement, entitled \u2018A nation on trial of survival,\u2019 made available to journalists in Ibadan. He hinged recent calls for restructuring, self-determination and true federalism to general suspicion of religious or ethnic affiliation in some public appointments by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) and Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) have been at the forefront of agitation for Oduduwa Republic in the South West and Biafra Republic in the South East. Some groups have also been agitating for Arewa Republic in the North.\n\nSaid Adeyemi: \u201cSuffice to recall that the principle of self-determination by the federating units was the pillar on which the country was built; at the London pre-constitutional conference in 1959, that was the proposal of Chief Obafemi Awolowo and the Action Group which the Sardauna, Sir Ahmadu Bello, shared with him.\n\n\u201cThe principle was that areas like agriculture, local government and chieftaincy affairs should be left to the state to develop their regions. It was proceeds from agricultural resources that led to the famous Cocoa House, Liberty Stadium and the first television station in Africa, among others.\n\n\u201cThe North later too diverted the groundnut proceeds to build the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Northern Nigeria Television among others. In other words, competitive development was the bedrock of self-determination. Unfortunately, things have degenerated at the moment to the level of seeing any call for self-determination as an act of felony by some people.\u201d\n\nOba Adeyemi said the greatest act of patriotism to save the nation from imminent collapse remains \u201cthe courage to confess the truth that this is not the best moment for the country politically, economically and indeed security wise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, what had heightened the call for restructuring, self-determination and true federalism in recent time is the general suspicion of either religious or ethnic in some public appointments. In this respect, the call for federal balancing, equity and justice in national appointments, including the security agencies can never be overemphasised. This is the only thing that can restore our confidence in the country of our political fore-bearers\u2019 dream. I make bold to say that return to true federalism today is a necessary national imperative. Hence, I personally see the return to federalism that will devolve power to the states as another word for restructuring which is gaining currency across the country at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe solution unfortunately has degenerated to the level of both ethnic and religious suspicion to levels unprecedented in the history of the country. The situation in the country is so fragile that one can hardly see any genuine intention in the security agencies including the Customs Service without reading bias into it.\n\n\u201cGoing back to the principal history of the country before and after amalgamation, the Alaafin remains a major stakeholder on behalf of the Yoruba nation. Because as the reigning Alaafin, I cannot fold my arms and see that beautiful structure called Nigeria collapse.\u201d",

So, in principle, every human being has the right to defend himself or herself. But the practice of that needs to be examine thoroughly before putting it to use.\u201d\n\nThe clergy also chided those criticising the church for speaking about issues relating to governance, explaining that \u201cthe church has the moral authority that it uses in interfacing with the people and the word of God being the basis for such interaction.\n\n\u201cThe church will continue to awaken the conscience of the people of our nation on the values that are necessary for the common good, the church will assist in teaching the people about issues concerning love for one another.

The individual federating units need to have more control over their affairs.\n\n\u201cThe regional government should control their resources and pay a percentage royalty tax to the Federal Government. The Federal Government should control issues in the single exclusive list such as military or foreign policy. We should return to agricultural businesses such as was practiced in the sixties by our former leaders. There is a need to restructure Nigeria to ensure true federalism as it was in the 1963 Constitution based on regions or zones.\u201d\n\nWe need a Nigerian political structure that is based on equity, fair play, balance and equal access to political power for the good of Nigerians,\u201d Anakwenze said.\n\nHe said a future Nigeria requires respect for our constitution and rule of law, respect for human rights and civil rights, respect for the federal character commission rules from 1979 constitution, implementation of restructuring, regionalisation and devolution of powers, merit-based appointment to government positions, firm knowledge and competent management of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nAnakwenze said detribalised appointments and leadership in all sectors of the government, equal and equitable treatment of all Nigerian regardless of tribes of origins or religion, elimination of ethnic cleansing in the Nigerian political space, free and fair electoral process, a government that unites all Nigerians and not one that is divisive, were needed now.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, if we cannot work this out quickly, a referendum might be needed so that all the major Nigerian groups can go their separate ways,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the group position about presidency of Nigeria of South East extraction, he said: \u201cWe ask that all political parties should zone Nigerian presidency to South East in 2023. And efforts should be geared to achieving that goal. IWA states only restructuring can prevent Nigeria from disintegration.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the Fulani herdsmen, he said Ndigbo will no longer tolerate the attack by herdsmen.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about that because the well-being of our people is involved. We will no longer accept this condition and we are going to talk to our people on what to do about it.\n\n\u201cEverybody needs to prepare to defend themselves and his family against the herdsmen because we are not prepared to cede an inch of Igbo land to anybody because our land is very small.\n\n\u201cOur people must protect their crops always. If any animal comes to eat the crops, it means hunger will be in the land because that is what the people use after harvesting and sales to train their children or pay for hospital bills.\n\n\u201cIf the herders kill our people and destroy our things, we have the right to reciprocate. We want peace for us and for everybody, but if somebody comes to fight us on our land, we will fight back,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended southern governors on their decision to ban open grazing in the region.",

          "text": "\u2022Vows attacks on INEC\u2019s assets won\u2019t stop future elections\n\n\u2022Reassures Nigerians no third term ambition\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday vowed to deal with those bent on destroying the nation through assaults on public buildings and institutions.\n\nHe also assured Nigerians that despite security challenges facing the country, all future elections will be conducted as scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari, while receiving a delegation of INEC, led by its National Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, at the State House, Abuja, committed his administration to providing adequate financial backing for the commission\u2019s operations.\n\nThe INEC delegation came to brief the president on the series of attacks on facilities of the electoral body nationwide.\n\nThe deteriorating security situation in the country also engaged the attention of the National Assembly yesterday with the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, stressing the need for more legislative interventions to secure Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the Senate was tired of observing one-minute silence for victims of insecurity.\n\nMedia adviser to the president, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement issued at the end of the closed-door session with the INEC officials, quoted Buhari as reiterating that he has no intention of staying in office beyond 2023.\n\nOn the dangers posed to future elections by the burning of INEC facilities, the president assured the commission that his administration will do all within its powers to mitigate the effects on the conduct of future polls.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will do that so that no one would say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We\u2019ll meet all INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nHe, however, warned those bent on destroying the country through promoting insurrection, and burning down critical national assets to back off as a rude shock awaits them soon.\n\n\u201cI receive daily security reports on the attacks, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in Nigeria is now mentioned all over the world. All the people who want power, whoever they are, you wonder what they really want. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time,\u201d he stated.\n\nBuhari recalled that he visited all the 36 states of the country before the 2019 elections, \u201cand majority of the people believed me, and the election proved it.\u201d\n\nHe promised to continue leading the country in accordance with the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, those misbehaving in certain parts of the country are too young to know the travails and loss of lives that attended the Nigerian civil war.\n\nHe added: \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand. We are going to be very hard sooner than later.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the service chiefs and the Inspector General of Police have been changed, \u201cand we will demand security from them.\u201d\n\nShedding more light on his meeting with the INEC officials via his official Twitter handle, Buhari tweeted: \u201cI received a briefing today from the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, on the series of attacks on their facilities nationwide. These attacks are totally unacceptable, and we will not allow those behind them to achieve their evil objectives.\n\n\u201cI have assured INEC that we will make available to them everything they need to operate efficiently, so that no one will say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We will meet all of INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Yakubu had said so far, 42 cases of attacks on INEC offices nationwide had been recorded, since the 2019 general election.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe 42 incidents so far occurred in 14 states of the federation for a variety of reasons\u2026.Most of the attacks happened in the last seven months, and they are unrelated to protest against previous elections. \u201cFrom the pattern and frequency of the most recent attacks, they appear to be targeted at future elections. The intention is to incapacitate the commission, undermine the nation\u2019s democracy and precipitate a national crisis.\u201d\n\nLawan Seeks More Legislative Interventions to Secure Nigerians\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has stressed the need for more legislative interventions to secure Nigerians.\n\nHe stated yesterday that that the lawmakers were tired of observing one-minute silence for the victims of insecurity.\n\nThe Senate also expressed concern about the frequency of the one-minute silence usually observed at its plenary as a result of deaths associated with security challenges facing the nation.\n\nSo far, it has observed one-minute silence six times in recent times for those who lost their lives through killings and murders in the wake of security issues across the country.\n\nLawan, at yesterday\u2019s plenary, said: \u201cLet me observe that we have observed about six one-minute silence and most of it was to pray for the repose of the souls of Nigerians who were murdered or killed by criminals.\u201d\n\nHe called for the intensification of legislative interventions by the National Assembly to protect Nigerians from the heightening insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to him, it is imperative for the National Assembly to step up legislative interventions to reduce the number of deaths caused by criminal activities.\n\nHe added that such interventions would be backed by collaborative efforts among the legislature, executive and Nigerians to address the security challenges.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is very important that we step up our legislative intervention in ensuring that we protect the lives and properties of Nigerians to reduce the incidence of one-minute silence.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Senate and, indeed, the National Assembly, working together with the executive and getting the support of Nigerians, we can bring the much needed succour to our people, and that is why we are here.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Sultan seeks immunity clause removal, role for monarchs\n\n\u2022Akeredolu wants Senate scrapped\n\nSegun James in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, James Sowole in Akure and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe clamour for federalism, local government autonomy, community policing and devolution of power dominated the nationwide public hearings conducted yesterday by the House of Representatives Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHowever, while the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, called for the removal of the immunity clause in the constitution, the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu , advocated the scrapping of the Senate to make the federal legislature unicameral, as one of the ways of reducing the cost of governance.\n\nPlateau, Benue and Nasarawa states have also unanimously demanded devolution of power in a manner that the states will be given more powers and finance considering their enormous responsibilities.\n\nAt Akure, one of the two venues of the public hearing for the South-west zone, Akeredolu said devolution of powers, true federalism, state police, among others, as presented last week to the Senate Committee on Constitutional Review were germane in restructuring the country.\n\nAkeredolu, who was represented by his deputy, Mr. Lucky Ayedatiwa, also advocated that membership of the National Assembly should be part-time.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe membership of the (National) Assembly should be part time. No member should earn allowances not known to the Revenue Mobilisation and Allocation Committee and, more importantly, people they claim to serve.\n\n\u201cLegislators should earn under a uniform salary structure. Allowance peculiarities must not be about obscenity. The Senate should be scrapped. The House of Representatives too should not be unwieldly. A maximum of four representatives should come from each zone.\u201d\n\nThe governor also advocated the decentralisation of the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Supreme Court should be decentralised to ease the current burden of the appellate court.\n\n\u201cIn a true federal state, there should be a Supreme Court whose decisions are final in residual matters. The Supreme Court at the centre should concern itself mainly with issues bordering on constitutional interpretations and matters arising between and among the states and the federal government, as well as revenue generation by the federal government. It should also administer the National Judicial Council.\u201d\n\nIn Bauchi, the state Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, stated that Nigeria needed a workable and acceptable constitution to serve the interests of the people.\n\nSuch a document, he added, should allow for true federalism where Nigeria states are autonomous entities with power to run their affairs.\n\nThe governor also appealed to the House Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution to look into the various agitations of the state and reflect them in its report.\n\nAccording to him, the participatory approach by the National Assembly in the amendment of the constitution is expected to produce a people\u2019s constitution that will address the social-economic problems in the country.\n\nHe added that Nigeria must break from the command structure imposed on the country by the defunct military government, which concentrated enormous power at the centre as manifested in the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe constituent units of the Nigerian federation represented by the current 36 states, the FCT and the 774 local government areas are near to the people that must be given enough powers with resources in order to positively impact the lives of the people at the grassroots,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn Lagos State, the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, restated his calls for a special economic status for the state owing to its status and the economic epicentre of the nation and the burdens it bears.\n\nHe said at the South-west zonal public hearing that the continuous request for a special status for the state was by no means a selfish one, but stemmed from the interest of every Nigerian in the state.\n\nHe stated that progress and prosperity of Nigeria as a nation is linked to that of Lagos State.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, while urging Nigerians to take the ongoing constitutional amendment seriously, had said the process of review and amendment would give the nation a near perfect constitution.\n\nHe expressed optimism that such a new constitution will resolve the issue of \u201cidentity, political structure, human rights, administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else that has made our nation fragile and that has hindered our progress and prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe 1999 Constitution is as a result of a hurried national compromise that Nigeria entered into two decades ago, just to allow the military vacate the political scene and return to the barracks. It has always been our intention that one day, as one people, we will return to amend this document to give voice to the yearning of the Nigerian people\u201d.\n\nIn Enugu, the Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, reiterated his administration\u2019s unwavering commitment to an egalitarian Nigeria where justice, fairness, equity and inclusiveness shall be functional directive principles of state policy.\n\nThe governor had declared the state government\u2019s support for amending the constitution to enhance the nation\u2019s quest for unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail.\u201d\n\nDeclaring open the South-east zonal public hearing in Enugu, the governor enjoined all institutions, civil society organisations, stakeholders and the entire Enugu State citizenry \u201cto stand up and be counted in this important national discussion.\u201d\n\nWomen groups, organisations and labour unions made varying submissions on how to improve the constitution.\n\nLabour unions demanded autonomy for local government, the legislature and the judiciary for improved service delivery, autonomy.\n\nAlso, women groups called for gender parity and inclusion to allow women to participate actively in governance and decision-making.\n\nSultan Seeks Removal of Immunity Clause\n\nOn his part, the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, called for the removal of the immunity clause in the constitution, saying it will compel leaders to live up to their responsibilities.\n\nHe also advocated a constitutional role for traditional rulers, saying it was time Nigerians talk frankly on how they want the country managed.\n\nAddressing stakeholders at the Kebbi zonal hearing comprising Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara States, the sultan attributed the crisis in the country to the relegation of traditional rulers as they were given no constitutional role to play.\n\nHe said before the Nigerian nation came into being in 1914, the traditional institution had existed.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne of the controversial issues, which I feel strongly about is the immunity clause. When you are immune, nobody can take you to court as a leader and it means that you can do whatever you want to do. You can claim to be God.\n\n\u201cBut when that immunity is removed and you are made to live in a society where people are taken to court for abuse of office, I think our leaders here will wake up. Let us see how to tinker with that immunity clause.\n\n\u201cWill it be better to give immunity to a few people or remove the immunity so that all of us will be equal? It is another food for thought. So, please don\u2019t hold back, speak your mind on how you want this country to move on.\u201d\n\nPlateau, Benue, Nasarawa Demand Devolution of Power, Single Tenure for Presidents.\n\nMeanwhile, Plateau, Benue, and Nasarawa states have unanimously demanded devolution of power in a manner that the states will be given more powers and finance considering their enormous responsibilities.\n\nThey also requested that the state governors, as the chief security officers of their states, be given the powers to control the police in their states to enhance quick and rapid response to crisis and crime.\n\nThey decried the situation where a state police command has to get clearance from Abuja to respond to crisis in its domain.\n\nPresenting their memoranda at the North-central zonal public hearing in Jos, the three states also advocated a single tenure of five years for the president.\n\nPresenting the position of Benue State, representative of the governor, and Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Hon. Titus Ugba, urged the National Assembly to grant the demands of people seeking creation of additional states.\n\nPlateau State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Chrisantus Ahmedu, and his Nasarawa State counterpart, Abdulkareem Kana, who toed the same line with Ugba on most of their demands, added that the three tiers of government could be reduced to two; comprising only the federal and state governments, such that states are given the resources to cater for the local governments.\n\nEarlier, while addressing the audience, Plateau State Governor, Hon. Simon Lalong, had urged Nigerians to be bold, sincere and patriotic in their submissions to the constitution review panel in their quest for a greater nation.\n\nLalong stated that the much-talked about restructuring will be considered to ensure that the agitations and anxieties being expressed are addressed.\n\nAccording to him, there are high expectations that this particular exercise will not go the way of previous ones which failed to address some key issues affecting the governance of the nation, leading to further agitations that are growing and in some way threatening peace, security and unity of the country.\n\n\u201cI therefore appeal to members of this special committee and Nigerians presenting memoranda at this public hearing to see this exercise as a very important duty which presents another opportunity for us to build a Nigeria that we desire to see. We should take advantage of the platform to ventilate and make submissions as to what we want injected or removed from the 1999 Constitution to make it more people -centred,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "After Buhari\u2019s \u201ccivil war\u201d tweet is deleted, Nigerian minister accuses Twitter of suspicious agenda",
          "text": "A tweet by Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, that seemed to imply certain people in the country will be dealt with violently caused a stir on Tuesday evening.\n\nAlmost immediately, there were calls for Buhari\u2019s tweet to be removed from the social media platform.\n\nTwitter answered that call on Wednesday afternoon. The tweet was part of a thread in which Buhari expressed displeasure at \u201cattacks on critical national infrastructure,\u201d including on facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari\u2019s deleted tweet was widely criticised as summoning the ghosts of the Nigeria civil war, a deadly three-year combat between the Nigerian government and a government in southeast Nigeria, which had seceded from the republic.\n\nThe Biafra war, as it is alternatively called, led to the death of nearly 1 million people, according to various accounts.\n\nWhile he may have intended to send a strong message against recent vandalism in the southeast supposedly led by the Indigenous People of Biafra, a proscribed militant group, Buhari\u2019s comment was interpreted as an affront and a threat to people in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet was from what Buhari said in a televised meeting with the leadership of INEC. He did not seem to be reading from a script, according to a video recording.\n\nTwitter had never deleted tweets by the Nigerian president before. Given that Nigeria is the platform\u2019s biggest market in Africa, it marks a new paradigm in the role it plays shaping civic spaces and citizen-government relations in Africa.\n\nTwitter may have been nudged to take action on Buhari\u2019s tweet following complaints by multiple accounts. Peoples\u2019 Gazette, an online publication on political affairs, reports that Twitter initially said Buhari\u2019s tweet did not violate its policies but reversed itself later.\n\nIn a statement to TechCabal, Twitter said the tweet \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules. The account owner will be required to delete the violative Tweet and spend 12 hours with their account in read-only mode.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s information minister, has accused Twitter of not being clear in its standard for deleting tweets, implying the US company has a longstanding bias against the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very very suspect,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cHas Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? The same Twitter that was funding #ENDSARS protesters\u2026 When people were burning Police stations and killing policemen, for Twitter it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the [US] Capitol, it became an insurrection.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria, citing those two examples, is very suspect. What is their agenda?\u201d\n\nLast October, Twitter became the platform where the world learned much about END SARS protests in Nigeria. Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s CEO, expressed solidarity in a couple of tweets. But it is not clear that the company funded protesters in the way the minister alleges.",

          "title": "Banks don\u2019t fund African renewable energy startups. So where can founders find money?",
          "text": "Small and medium scale enterprises in Africa receive about $70bn of credit each year. But the International Finance Corporation estimates that the gap exceeds $300bn.\n\nWhy does the gap exist? Michael Famoroti, chief economist at Stears gave two reasons during a recent TechCabal Live event on financing renewable energy companies in Africa.\n\nFirst, there is an information problem.\n\nCredit providers seem to lack enough information with which to assess the risk worthiness of many borrowers. This problem exists at the retail level as most bank customers who have tried to take personal loans will be aware.\n\nBut it is arguably a bigger problem for SMEs and startups whose businesses are typically regarded as high-risk and unproven.\n\nThe second reason Famoroti gave is that credit providers may not find enough value in the use proposed for the funds. In this case, creditors may play safe by lending to legacy industries like real estate or banking, while taking a skeptical approach to promising but new ventures. Like renewable energy for example.\n\nSo if you are setting up a renewable energy startup to provide electricity to the more than 50% of people living in SubSaharan Africa who lack access, how do you find funding?\n\nThe TechCabal Live event had Marly Diallo, Wiebe Boer and Christian Wessels in attendance as guests.\n\nDiallo runs BRT Energy, a startup that regenerates batteries by reducing lead-acid waste. She started her career in fintech and banking, but when it was time to raise money for BRT, she hid many roadblocks.\n\nIn BRT\u2019s early days, she met the criteria for a certain funding program. But because she could not produce three years of financial statements, she did not get access to the money.\n\nMarly\u2019s experience is not an anomaly.\n\nWessels, co-founder and CEO of Daystar Power, also has a banking background having worked at Barclays for years. Founded in 2017, Daystar now operates hybrid energy solutions that combine solar and generator sets in Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal and Ivory Coast.\n\nLast year, they raised $38 million in a Series B round but it was mainly from development finance institutions in Nordic countries. But Wessels still remembers the anxiety that came with sourcing funds locally.\n\n\u201cNigerian banks played zero role in our financing. That\u2019s not great because we don\u2019t like the idea that as a West Africa company, that we are getting money mainly from overseas.\n\n\u201cI mean, thank God we get the money but why is it that we need to rely on DFIs and European investors when what we are doing is locally valuable?\u201d\n\nSuch experiences scar founders and make it seem like there are no funding opportunities for renewable energy financing within Africa. But some organisations have come aboard bearing some hope.\n\nAll On is an independent, off-grid energy impact investment company. It was founded by Shell, the oil company, as a vehicle for giving back to Nigeria by making impact investments into the renewable energy sector. Shell provided the seed funding but doesn\u2019t make any money from the venture.\n\nWiebe Boer, All On\u2019s managing director, empathizes with founders who need funding but have little sources to reach out to. With banks an obvious \u201cwaste of time,\u201d he advises that family and friends will continue to be the first base for most founders.\n\nFrom there, it might be possible to access funding from All On\u2019s initiatives for projects at the ideation stage. At the moment, the firm partners with two organisations for this purpose: the Clean Tech Hub in Abuja and the Nigeria Climate Innovation Centre in Lagos. These initiatives give up to $10,000.\n\nAbove that is another stage of up to $50,000 debt investment for companies that are, for example, doing their first minigrid or importing solar equipment. All On does this in partnership with the US Africa Development Foundation. USADF matches All On\u2019s $50,000 loan with a grant of $50,000.\n\nAll On could invest further in startups that show promise after this stage. For example, Auxano, a solar equipment company, received the $50,000 loan in 2018. It performed well enough for All On to invest $1.5 million last September to help the startup scale its assembly plant over the next five years.\n\n\u201cIt really is about being credible from the beginning and delivering even at a small level. With that, investors can give you more money,\u201d Boer says.\n\nWhat Marly, the BRT founder, has learned is that a pilot program can be useful in showing how useful an investor\u2019s funds will be.\n\n\u201cYou need to prove your concept by doing pilots to get customers.You need to make sure that what you are pushing is adopted by the market,\u201d she said.\n\nWessels, who now has access to entrepreneurship support networks like Endeavor Nigeria that give Daystar access to more funding, says new founders will need much tenacity and patience along the way. But he hopes they persevere because \u201cultimately, there is a big market to serve.\u201d\n\nWatch the full video of the TechCabal Live event on financing an African renewable energy company here.",

          "title": "Sawari Ventures is leading investments in North Africa",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nBefore co-founding Almentor, Ihab Fikry wore three hats. He was a management professor, author of bestsellers on management (mainly in Arabic) and a multinational expatriate at companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil.\n\nThen he decided to quit it all to start sharing his knowledge via different mediums \u2013 television, newspapers, and YouTube.\n\nWhile he was doing this, he saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community until May 2015 when the news of Microsoft acquiring Lynda.com for $1.5 billion caught his attention. He spent the next 12 months learning about video-based learning. He was certain there was a business case for the video content he was putting out on YouTube.\n\nIn June 2016, he partnered with co-founders who worked for Google, Microsoft and other multinationals to start Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa. They started with a seed round of $3.5m.\n\nThe initial plan was to generate $10,000 in sales just to validate the business idea but they ended up making $300,000 in sales that year.\n\nIn 2019, they crossed the $1 million revenue line and raised the next funding round \u2013 Series A. Almentor\u2019s Series A round was led by Sawari ventures.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of Ask an Investor I talk to one of the oldest venture capital firms in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Sawari Ventures.\n\nFikry pointed out that Sawari Ventures helped Almentor in three critical areas: Governance, networking with the ecosystem and technical support.\n\nSawari Ventures helped them put structures that enable the company to last for decades. It also helped with meeting relevant people in the ecosystem and provided good technical support and advice.\n\nI talk to Tamer Azer, a principal at Sawari Ventures; he joined the firm in 2019. One of the first things he pointed out to me early in our initial email exchange was that he had done an Ask an Investor series before. His own version was a free-flowing conversation with people interested in learning about how investors make decisions and the differences between concepts like equity and convertible notes.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Tell me about Sawari Ventures\n\nTamer Azer: Sawari ventures has been around since 2010. It was founded by three partners \u2013 Ahmed El Alfi, Hany Al-Sonbaty and Wael Amin. They\u2019re also the founders of Flat6Labs \u2013 the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator. Sawari Ventures is also a limited partner in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. We invest in companies anywhere from a million to $3 million per ticket and up to $5 million for the life of the company, across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. We\u2019re fairly sector-agnostic. We most definitely look for companies who have a very clear product-market fit and are doing something really innovative and meaningful.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the premise behind the investments you make?\n\nTA: There\u2019s an argument to be made that the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt became a lot more attractive after the Arab Spring when a lot of people found their sense of purpose and sense of independence.\n\nIt\u2019s picking up a lot from there. A lot of people saw it as a way to express themselves in a way to be able to engage on their own terms. There\u2019s an argument that a lot of people make that\u2019s connected somehow. In terms of the investment thesis, we\u2019re definitely sector-agnostic. We look out for companies that really have unique intellectual property. I\u2019m not just talking about documentation. The company has to be doing something really defensible and really unique. It can be doing something that we all know and love, but in a way that nobody else has done. Obviously, teams factor in a huge way. We\u2019re looking for professionally mature people who work with intention, who are coachable, who understand why, what and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\nDA: How do you find these companies or better still how do people get your attention?\n\nTA: I made a decision when I first started working in this industry to respond to absolutely everybody. I respond to anyone who messages me on LinkedIn, anyone who emails me. I try to put myself out there a lot and speak at events and do articles like the one I\u2019m doing with you right now, so that people hear about me and they try to reach out to me. Deal sourcing is always two ways.\n\nSometimes it takes me longer than I\u2019d like to admit, but I do try my best to respond to absolutely everyone.\n\nDA: That\u2019s really generous. If you get more popular you\u2019ll probably need to get an assistant. So does Sawari invest in cohorts?\n\nTA: We\u2019re not an accelerator. These are types of activities that Flat6Labs would organize. For us, we look for companies that are a bit more mature than that.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the relationship between Flat6Labs and Sawari ventures?\n\nTA: The founders of Sawari Ventures and the founders and Flat6labs are the same. When Sawari Ventures raised its North Africa fund, we invested in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. There\u2019s something really important here I need to point out between when a company joins Flat6Labs and when it can join Sawari Ventures. There has to be a bit of a gap, where they go out into the world and raise their middle round.\n\nJust because you get into Flat6Labs does not mean that once you graduate you\u2019re going to get money from Sawari Ventures automatically. We look out for whoever survives, manages to go out into the world, get a seed fund, grow their business even more, and then they can come to Sawari for their Series A round.\n\nDA: What does support from Sawari Ventures look like?\n\nTA: Typically, one of the partners of the firm would sit on the board. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our companies in the beginning to build a strong relationship and to build a strong plan for the business. Moving forward, we work very closely with them to help with business development, growth, as well as fundraising. We work with them to analyze the data that they share with us and help them make data-driven decisions. Obviously, we deploy our entire network to support their growth.\n\nThese are how most VCs support the portfolio companies. We\u2019re also in a position where we have some very strong limited partners who are interested in co-investing. We have a really wide network that allows us to bring a lot of international VCs into the next rounds for the companies. For instance, we brought in Partec to co-invest with us in MoneyFellows.\n\nDA: How does due diligence happen and how long does it take?\n\nTA: Each company will have a different level of preparedness, investment readiness, and every company will have different rounds. A priced round will have a very different timeline than a convertible note round or a safe round. So ultimately, every process is fluid depending on the nature of the round and the co-investors in the round and the lead.\n\nWe will always want to be the lead on any investment that we make and we\u2019re always trying to bring co-investors into the process. We definitely conduct four layers of due diligence. There\u2019s commercial, financial, legal, and tech.\n\nThe rest happen a little later in the process. Initially, there has to be a good solid commercial due diligence, so we can buy into the market, the team, the company, and then we take it forward from there.\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nTA: One that comes to mind is coachability. I\u2019m turned off when I see that a founder or co-founders are not really being responsive to feedback from an investor or a customer. When they have a reputation for being not just defensive, but being uncoachable. That\u2019s a major red flag because when you invest in someone, the relationship is very close for a very long period of time. If you can\u2019t give and take, then it becomes really tricky to nurture this relationship over that period of time. Another thing I really look for as a red flag is co-founder dynamics. Are they both at the pitch? How do they talk during the pitch? How do they answer questions? What does the dynamic and the relationship between them look like? If it looks out of sync, that\u2019s a pretty major red flag.\n\nDA: You said Sawari Ventures typically takes the lead on investments. Why the emphasis on this?\n\nTA: We also co-lead. As regards the times we lead investment rounds, it\u2019s because of the environment. Many companies in this region find investors who can\u2019t and won\u2019t lead, who will tell them, find the lead and we\u2019ll follow. It\u2019s part of a fund ethos that we like to lead our own investments because we really believe in them. Another reason is the market dynamics in the region, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to follow on, but not lead, which ultimately leaves you in a strong position when you are capable and willing.\n\nWe\u2019re a very experienced team. We have very clear intentions about what we like to invest in and why we invest in certain things.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits and M&A?\n\nTA: I think the African market, we\u2019re all suffering from a lack of exits. We all have that problem. Angel investors all over the continent are just dying for an exit because they\u2019ve been investing for years and years. We\u2019re all really dying for exits but exits are really a function of foreign direct investment. It\u2019s a function of mature stock exchanges. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more and more exits from North Africa. We have seen a few and they\u2019re getting bigger, but we still need so many more before more capital comes into North Africa and that capital gets redeployed.\n\nYou know how it works, you have a company and you exit, all of a sudden you\u2019re an angel investor. Then you\u2019re a fund manager or you start another company that people want to invest in quickly because you already have a successful exit. We\u2019re seeing the industry in North Africa mature, and it\u2019s heading more and more towards some of these interesting exits. We\u2019re starting to see bigger rounds. We\u2019re starting to see exits, we\u2019re starting to see mergers in the continent, in North Africa and in Egypt especially because it\u2019s the market that I\u2019m closest to. We are seeing a lot of maturity, a lot of growth. For example, a lot of ex-Uber and ex-Careem staff are starting companies that have been doing fantastically well. As more and more of these things happen, the maturity of the entrepreneurs and investors grows, and exits will come. We just have to keep at it.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup?\n\nTA: VC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime, They have a 10 year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\nJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time, and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\nWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing checks, we have to get the money to be able to write these checks first.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these checks. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\n\nDA: What are some trends you\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\nTA: I think for me, the main trends are the fact that people are starting to solve deep-rooted fundamental problems. They\u2019re starting to solve access to finance. They\u2019re starting to solve financial literacy and financial inclusion. They\u2019re starting to solve healthcare problems. People are actually tackling the big-ticket issues that were previously left to the public sector. We\u2019re seeing the market respond very positively to that.\n\nDA: Any final words?\n\nTA: It\u2019d be interesting to see more engagement from large institutional investors with investing in startups. There\u2019s immense potential and having your local financial institutions support you as a fund manager helps immensely when it comes to getting international development. It\u2019s a team effort, we have to do it together.\n\nI\u2019m encouraging more engagement from African financial institutions, not just banks but hedge funds, insurance companies and pension plans.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Airtel Africa has announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175 million. According to the company, the sale to SBA Communications Corporation and Paradigm Infrastructure Limited would allow it to prioritise its core subscription services.\n\nAirtel Africa will receive approximately $157.5 million of the total amount in the first instalment, which is expected to take place in the second half of the group\u2019s financial year.\n\nA portion of the proceeds would be distributed to the Tanzanian government as part of the terms of the company\u2019s public listing in 2019. The rest is to be used for debt reduction at the group level and investment in network and sales infrastructure in Tanzania.\n\nIn 2020, Airtel Africa CEO, Raghunath Mandava, outlined plans to sell approximately 4,500 towers in five countries: Chad, Gabon, Madagascar, Malawi, and Tanzania.\n\nThe move aimed to reduce the company\u2019s $3.5 billion debt and prepare for upcoming bond repayments.\n\nThe telecommunications giant has recorded significant losses in India because of low data prices and high competition among telcos. There is also the considerable cost of the infrastructure associated with running a telecoms business.\n\nHowever, there is a growing trend of asset-light telcos focused on core network and services provisions like calls and data services with third-party providers tasked with providing last-mile access. This results in a reduction in operational and maintenance overhead.\n\nAn example of a company divesting its assets is the Indonesian telco XL Axiata which has sold 6,000 radio towers since 2014.\n\nIn 2020, the Lagos State Government also moved to provide the infrastructure that telcos can latch on to provide telecommunications service to customers through its partnership with Western Telecommunications and Engineering Services Metro Limited.\n\nIt appears that Airtel is choosing to go this route as it aims to reduce its debt and increase competitiveness.",

          "text": "Following a partnership between Releaf \u2014 an agritech startup \u2014 and fintech startup, OnePipe, farmers in Cross River and Akwa Ibom states can now easily access digital financial services.\n\nSpeaking on the partnership, Releaf\u2019s Co-founder and CTO, Uzoma Ayogu, said, \u201cSince inception, Releaf has empowered over 1,000 farmers to supply over 10 million kilograms of quality crops to various food factories.\n\nWhile disbursements to our farmers have been largely cash-based, we now have access to digitised fund disbursement via embedded, customised accounts, provisioned by OnePipe, to drive financial inclusion of previously financially excluded farmers in the digital economy.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that Releaf is exploring the provision of insurance services leveraging OnePipe\u2019s infrastructure and partnerships. The partnership provides the farmers with an embedded account branded as Releaf Wallet, which can be opened and operated by USSD and Progressive Web Apps (PWA) channels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith these accounts, the farmers can receive money from any bank/channel, transfer funds to any Nigerian bank account, and purchase airtime for themselves or third parties.\n\nLike most digital finance services on offer, they can also access loans with the loan amounts increasing according to their wallet usage.\n\nAccording to OnePipe\u2019s Founder and Chief Plumber, Ope Adeoye, \u201cworking with Releaf was inevitable as the company\u2019s vision to transform Africa\u2019s agricultural future by making decentralised food processing scaleable coincides with OnePipe\u2019s social mandate to drive financial inclusion through technology for all \u2014 including the 700m+ smallholder farmers on the continent.\u201d\n\nAs of May 30, 2021, data from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System Plc (NIBSS) reveals that 48 million Nigerians had a BVN. With Nigeria\u2019s adult population sitting at 105 million according to the World Population Review, that means that 57 million Nigerians are unbanked.\n\nWhile fintech startups have sprung up trying to increase the number of Nigerians connected to financial services, they have mostly solved the problems associated using existing financial services.\n\nResearch shows that poverty, a lack of education, or living in rural areas \u2014 all qualities of the average Nigerian smallholder farmer \u2014 are barriers to financial inclusion.\n\nReleaf\u2019s partnership with OnePipe is a welcome development that follows the playbook used by super apps in Asia.\n\nMost of the farmers who work with Releaf are smallholder farmers who live in rural areas. By providing them with an opportunity to access financial services through digital channels, they can create a digital footprint enabling them to access more financial services, thus accelerating their financial inclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear if this service is available to farmers outside Releaf\u2019s network.\n\nFounded by Isaiah Udotong, Ikenna Nzewi, and Uzoma Ayogu in 2017, Releaf was originally an online marketplace that connected buyers and sellers of agricultural commodities to trustworthy customers.\n\nThe startup was accepted into Y Combinator in 2017, receiving $120,000 in funding. After the founders returned to Nigeria, they continued to provide a marketplace for agricultural commodities until they realised that food factories were struggling to secure raw materials for their operations.\n\nThis led to a change in priority as the startup now functions as a raw materials procurement and logistics platform with oil palm as the leading product.\n\nThrough this partnership with OnePipe, it is expected that smallholder farmers in Nigeria, most of whom lack access to financial services, can now access financial services and, in the process, drive Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion goals.",

          "title": "Nourishing dairy with tech, a path to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth?",
          "text": "Milk\u2019s nutritional value compares favourably to its economic value. According to Agrilinks, milk is a commodity in high demand in Nigeria, with over a billion tons needed annually. Unfortunately, several factors impede Nigeria\u2019s capacity to meet the demand for dairy products.\n\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations says, \u201cA healthy productive population is increasingly recognized not only as resulting from but also as an important prerequisite for poverty reduction and economic and social development.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, the FAO declared June 1 World Milk Day to highlight the importance of milk and draw attention to the global dairy sector.\n\nSadly, two decades later, Nigeria\u2019s milk production pales in comparison to its potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) reports that pastoral systems, which yield meagre output, produce 90% of Nigeria\u2019s milk.\n\nConsequently, the country relies heavily on imported milk. According to a Vanguard article, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) estimates that $1.5 billion is spent on milk importation annually.\n\nDeveloped countries have employed scientific and technological innovations in the dairy sector. The US, for instance, is the second-largest producer of milk globally per the FAO. And according to Statista, it made $40.4 billion from milk in 2020.\n\nThe dairy industry\u2019s success in developed countries is mainly due to adopting technologies that make larger herds profitable. These technologies, as the FAO puts it, \u201crequire large capital investments.\u201d From milking to preserving to distribution, the role of technology in the dairy sector cannot be overemphasised.\n\nThe quest for indigenous milk\n\nIkun Dairy Farm\n\nThe demand for milk in Nigeria is an opportunity to generate revenue internally. Besides the imperfect production process, Data by AsokoInsights reveals that the country has 20 million cows \u2014 the fourth-largest herd in Africa \u2014 but only 11.5% are used for milk. In contrast, 88.5% go towards producing beef.\n\nResearch by SpringerLink highlights reasons for Nigeria, and by extension, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s failing dairy sector. Subsistence-oriented modes of production and the genetic make-up of indigenous cows are some of many.\n\nAccording to AsokoInsights, Nigerian cows can only produce between one and a half to two litres of milk daily. A cow in Kenya, one of Africa\u2019s largest producers of dairy products, produces 30 litres of milk daily.\n\nCorroborating AsokoInsights submission, research by the UK College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, shows that only two African countries \u2014 Ethiopia and Kenya \u2014 are self-sufficient in milk production. For context, Africa has five times the number of dairy cows in the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe can infer from Dairy Australia\u2019s account of the milk-making process that, unlike most parts of Africa, dairy production is more technology-driven in developed countries like the US and New Zealand.\n\nFor example, cows are milked using vacuum cups attached to their teats. The milk is then sent to large steel vats and stored at five degrees for two days. It is then pasteurised, increasing shelf-life.\n\nWhile the genetic nature of Nigerian cows cannot be overlooked, the predominantly manual production process poses a major obstacle to a sustainable dairy sector.\n\nMilking Nigeria\u2019s potential\n\nIkun Dairy Farm\n\nThe Nigerian Dairy Development Program, NDDP, started in 2019 in partnership with Sahel Consulting Agriculture and Nutrition Limited, was designed to help address the local dairy sector\u2019s problems.\n\nAccording to Agrilinks, some local producers who benefited from the programme recorded a 198% increase in milk sales. While this proves the viability of the dairy sector, more still needs to be done.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria, per Nairametrics, released a circular in March 2020 restricting the importation of milk. However, the restriction didn\u2019t affect six companies: FrieslandCampina WAMCO Nigeria, Chi Limited, TG Arla Dairy Products Limited, Promasidor Nigeria Limited, Nestle Nigeria Plc., and Integrated Dairies Limited.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s restriction is a way of enabling backward integration in the dairy sector. Ekiti State\u2019s Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Akin Oyebode, explains why the CBN\u2019s directive might not work and what Ekiti State is doing differently.\n\nIn a tweet on April 22, 2021, Oyebode announced the arrival of 250 Jersey cows in Nigeria to be delivered to Ikun Dairy Farm, Ekiti State. This was a sequel to a joint venture between Promasidor Group, a food and beverage company, and the state government.\n\nGot 41 of c. 250 heifers in today, due to their weight (mostly pregnant) and available cargo space. Hope to get the other 200+ in very soon. Another tiny milestone hit. pic.twitter.com/rWzequMybQ \u2014 Akin Oyebode (@AO1379) February 9, 2021\n\nOyebode tells Techpoint Africa that Promasidor was a strategic choice by the state government. Unlike some of the other companies restricted by the CBN, Promasidor is not from a milk-producing country. According to him, companies in milk-producing countries would be hesitant to develop Nigeria\u2019s dairy industry.\n\nThe strategic joint venture is leading to the gradual revitalisation of the Ikun Dairy Farm (IDF).\n\nOyebode identifies low-yield cows as one of the sector\u2019s challenges, hence the importation of Jersey cows. According to him, 40 indigenous cows in the IDF produce 60 litres of milk a day, while six Jersey cows produce 150 litres a day.\n\n\u201cThe cow variant in Nigeria has been really focused on beef, and we generally do a lot of open grazing over long distances. Over the years, the genes of our cows won\u2019t give us the kind of milk that we require,\u201d Oyebode says.\n\nHe adds that it will take a long period for Nigeria to regain the milk-generating capabilities of its cows through cross-breeding.\n\nOyebode admits that while factors like science and technology go into building a sustainable dairy farm, they will be futile if the cow yield isn\u2019t proportional to the infrastructural inputs.\n\nHowever, Alhaji Muhammadu Damakka Abubakar, Executive Director and owner of L & Z Integrated Farms Nigeria Limited, a dairy company established over 15 years ago, believes low-yield cows are not a major problem for the country\u2019s dairy industry.\n\nHe cites India, the largest producer of milk globally, as an example.\n\n\u201cAverage milk per cow in India is not up to ten litres, but they have plenty, so if you have low-yielding cows but in large numbers, it makes up for their low yield.\u201d\n\nAbubakar believes the problem isn\u2019t the low-yield cows but the technology used in the milk collection process. Also, rather than open grazing, he suggests ranching as an alternative.\n\n\u201cThe era of allowing cows to roam is gone,\u201d Abubakar says.\n\nWith 20 million cows milked optimally \u2014 using a technologically-based milking system \u2014 in the right conditions with the right tools, he maintains that Nigeria will produce enough milk to meet the demand.\n\nWhile increasing cow yield can be looked into in the long run, Abubakar says using the indigenous cows optimally should be prioritised.\n\nSpeaking on the dairy sector\u2019s viability, he says, \u201cFrom milk, you can derive over 100 components; and from oil, you have only 20 or 25. A barrel of milk is worth almost 100 times what a barrel of crude oil is worth.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, a barrel of crude oil is currently worth $67 while its equivalent in milk is worth $57. In terms of daily demand, more crude oil is consumed. Knoema, a data technology company, puts Nigeria\u2019s daily crude oil consumption at 522,000 barrels \u2014 82.9 million litres \u2014 in March 2021.\n\nThese numbers exceed the demand for milk greatly. Per LEADERSHIP, the yearly demand for milk is 1.6 billion litres, putting the daily demand at 4.4 million litres.\n\nWhile these numbers nullify Abubakar\u2019s claims, they do not reduce the viability of the dairy sector as a major source of revenue.",

          "text": "Shares of the South African retail giant Shoprite traded almost 4 percent higher Wednesday, the day the company announced it had received 70 percent of proceeds from the sale of its troubled Nigerian unit.\n\nAt R160.89 a share, Shoprite shares are on track for their best day in about two weeks. The group\u2019s shares have risen almost 15 percent in 2021, and 28 percent since the start of 2020.\n\nShoprite, one of the first South African companies to expand into Nigeria in the early 1990s, recently completed the sale of its supermarket business in Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nShoprite had announced its exit from Nigeria in August 2020, and has not put a price on the sale of the business, with the group also closing its last stores in Kenya earlier in 2021. The sale is to a subsidiary of Nigerian property group, Persianas Investments.\n\nThe company said the Nigerian business environment had become unfavourable for its operations and it would be closing down as a result.\n\n\u201cThe Board has decided to initiate a formal process to consider the potential sale of all, or a majority stake, in Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited (RSNL), a subsidiary of Shoprite International Limited. As such, RSNL may be classified as a discontinued operation when Shoprite reports its results for the year,\u201d the company had said in a statement released last year.\n\nIn a recent publication, the company announced its investment in Africa, particularly Nigeria and Kenya, had not yielded desired gain and it would like to explore new territories.\n\n\u201cWe are cognisant that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and, for that reason, we are assessing the future for each investment on an individual country basis.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, we have resolved to either find a local partner or sell our Nigerian supermarket business. Furthermore, we have decided we will not allocate any further capital in the pursuit of a Kenyan market greenfields expansion. The region has not met our required return-on-investment targets and, while this factor is in part because the investment is still subscale, we believe now is not the time for Shoprite to lean in and invest further into new territory,\u201d the company said in the report.\n\nThe company also revealed that the exchange rate crisis of the dollar and naira led to a 7.9 percent loss in 2020, when compared to 2019.\n\nThe terms of the transaction include both a franchise agreement that secures the Nigerian business\u2019s right to continue to use the Shoprite brand. It also includes an agreement that provides for administration and technical support from the Shoprite Group for an initial period of five years.\n\nShoprite has been trading in the rest of Africa since 1990 and operates in many markets outside South Africa, including Botswana, Madagascar, Mozambique and Angola. The group, under CEO Pieter Engelbrecht, has been assessing the capital needs of its non-South African operations, which generate less than a quarter of group revenue.\n\nIn 2013, it considered expansion to 44 Shoprite stores across Nigeria, but halted the expansion project after encountering various challenges in the West African country. In 2019, Engelbrecht said the group would not remain in Nigeria at any cost.\n\nIn that year, it faced lower consumer demand in Nigeria as locals boycotted South African brands to protest against xenophobic violence in South Africa.\n\nShoprite follows Tiger Brands, Woolworths and Mr Price in exiting the country, which is seen as a difficult market to operate, amid oil price and currency volatility, and difficulties in repatriating funds.\n\nShoprite said on Wednesday that the transaction took effect on May 23, with 70 percent of the transaction proceeds having been received and the balance due in four equal instalments over 30 months.\n\nShoprite, valued at R95 billion on the JSE, had treated the Nigerian business as a discontinued operation in its half year to end-December, reporting that assets held for sale amounted to R1.4 billion, while the liabilities of these assets stood at R1.56 billion.\n\nAt the end of December, its core business, Supermarkets SA, made up 78 percent of group sales, with 1,685 stores under the Shoprite, Usave, Checkers, Checkers Hyper and LiquorShop brands.\n\nIt had 417 stores outside South Africa, including its discontinued operations.\n\nThe company says it will be focused on investing in technology and its employees.\n\n\u201cWe want to focus on further investment in building our information and technology-driven business infrastructure. We are firm believers that the future will be strongly data-led and as such, we are strengthening and future-proofing our business and strategy by investing in our IT ecosystem and our people,\u201d the company said.",

          "text": "In a bid to boost confidence in its major asset, which is land, Lagos State government has reduced time for registering property and also for obtaining construction permit.\n\nThe state has consolidated all payment fees and taxes for property registration into a single demand notice with the aim of making doing business in the state a lot easier and even \u2018cheaper.\u2019\n\nThe sprawling city has also strengthened real estate transaction regulations with the setting up a 16-man technical committee piloted by the Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (LASRERA).\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had, shortly after assuming office in 2019, reversed the Land Use Charge, which raised enormous dust when it was reviewed upwards, to pre-2018 levels.\n\nThe implication of these moves is not only that they enhance ease of doing business in the state, which is an otherwise difficult business environment, but also to boost investors\u2019 confidence and raise public trust in real estate and land-related business in the state.\n\nThe consolidation of the property registration fees, for instance, has led to the reduction in the number of days required to obtain Certificate of Occupancy (C-of-O) and Governor\u2019s Consent. This has come down from 72 to 61 days, according Hakeem Okunola, the state\u2019s Head of Service (HoS).\n\nThe state\u2019s e-planning platform has also been activated for the submission of all construction permit applications such that the fee procedures and laws are now on the website, while there is also a reduction in the average number of days for obtaining construction permit from 42 to 28 days.\n\nThese steps are of tremendous assistance to investors who, before now, have been finding it difficult getting property registration and construction permit. It was worse for those of them who were exposed to bank credit as their projects could not take off yet interest on the loans were running.\n\nRead Also:Veritasi reiterates commitment to provide affordable housing with Eystone\n\nThe HoS, who spoke at the annual ministerial briefing to mark Sanwo-Olu\u2019s second year in office, explained that the decision to take these steps was a response to continuous demand from stakeholders in the built environment through the state\u2019s online complaints and feedback\u2014the Citizengate.\n\nAt the inaugural meeting of members of the technical committee on regulation, Toke Benson-Awoyinka, special adviser to the Governor on Housing, explained that the committee\u2019s mandate was to design a policy and fiscal framework, institute and promote global best practices in the sector.\n\nShe added that the committee had the mandate of addressing challenges in the sector with particular attention to reforming homeownership model to increase housing stock and reduce the deficit.\n\nLagos, according to a report by the Pison Housing Company, has an estimated 3 million housing demand-supply gap with a very active rental market where over 50 percent of the state\u2019s 20 million population lives in a rented apartment.\n\nIt is, therefore, hoped that a well-regulated real estate market and a friendly business environment that enables more investment in the sector would lead to increased housing stock and less \u2018homelessness.\u2019\n\nBenson-Awoyinka noted that one of the lessons learnt from COVID-19 pandemic was the need to create and develop a robust housing policy with stakeholder involvement and engagement as well as curtail malpractices in the real estate sector, while also improving financial transparency and fiscal responsibility.\n\n\u201cTo achieve its objective, the committee will be required to set up a comprehensive system and framework, which will prioritise the development of a fiscal responsibility and transparency model, to promote the inflow of local and international funding required to confront the housing deficit.\n\n\u201cThe committee will also set up a governance structure that will oversee the entire real estate framework and stakeholder engagement in the state to minimise trust deficit,\u201d she said\n\nThe special adviser explained that the structure would cater to the entire system of the real estate process and incorporate participation from private developers, financial institutions and the government in a Public-Private Partnership model.",

Francis Okiye, for being absent from the House proceedings for the mandatory 181 days.\n\nThe governor, reacting to calls to pardon the erring Assembly members-elect during an interactive session with stakeholders from Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and other civil society groups, called for the support of all stakeholders towards achieving lasting peace and development in Edo.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSome characters said they sent congratulatory letters to me and put it in all kinds of conditions.\n\n\u201cHow can you tell me to forgive those 14 lawmakers-elect who are responsible for sedition and treason in Nigeria?

We have gotten support from all of you and are very glad and happy; your support gives us the confidence to continue to fight.\n\n\u201cFor us as a government, we are open. There is nothing that we are hiding and this is why we have to kill anything that links us to godfatherism. We have killed it at the national level and need to kill it locally as it is everywhere. I urge you to please be activists for good, peace and development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis engagement is to see how we can collaborate and make things work differently; this is a time that we need leadership more than ever before,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of NLC in Edo State, Mr. Sunday Osanyande, urged the government to digitize revenue collection by migrating to e-revenue collection systems, which will check leakages.\n\nOsanyande said that the e-revenue collection system would further increase the state government Internally Generated Revenue (IGR).\n\n...",

Let us build strong institutions and not individuals. The buildings are there; people have come and gone.\n\n\u201cLet us begin to think of government that way. We must now begin to think of government differently. This is because institutions will take care of us; we also need to start to change the mentality that all arms of government go to collect allocation from Abuja. There is nothing to take. We all have to come together and create the things we need.\u201d\n\nObaseki further reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, in its efforts at making Edo great again.\n\n\u201cMy message to you is one of hope.

You need to participate \u2013 not just sit down and participate on social media \u2013 in your community; speak up,\u201d the governor charged.\n\nEarlier, the State Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa, while giving his opening remarks, said that the state civil and public service has been the focal point of government\u2019s attention.\n\nAlso, a participant, Alhaji Evbareke Ahmed, urged the governor to ensure the completion of the Benin River Port, adding that it would further create job opportunities for youths.\n\n...",

I recall that in the House of Representatives between 2003 and 2007, this was one bill that was so important, and is one way of encouraging our Polytechnic graduates.\n\n\u201cThat should not take away from the kind of training they receive, but, in fact, it is supposed to be a motivation for our polytechnic graduates.\n\n\u201c[And] I pray that the Federal Government and all those government agencies and the private sector would start to implement this by the time the President assents to this bill.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday said his government is committed to youth development.\n\nThe governor spoke at the launch of Osun Youth Policy Document to develop and empower young people in the state and put them at the centre of development.\n\nThe newly-unveiled Youth Policy Document which has four components 4Es\u2014Youth Empowerment, Youth Engagement, Youth Entrepreneurship and Youth Education, was developed to provide a crucial framework for guiding the state\u2019s approach to ensuring that large number of youth residing in the state are provided with quality of life.\n\nLaunching the Policy Document at the Aurora Event Centre, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola said his administration has enunciated a clear policy framework to ensure that an enabling environment is created for the youth to maximally realise their creative and productive potential.\n\nHe noted that the Osun Youth Policy contains commitment by government, the youth of the state and the society in pursuance of youth development and growth.\n\n\u201cAs captured in the Policy, youth development is holistic and integrated, requiring the support and active involvement of all relevant Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), Youth Organisations, Non Governmental Organisations and the Public Sector, Private Sector and Philanthropists,\u201d he said.\n\nOyetola who described the youth as the most productive, efficient and energetic segment of the population, said his administration has invested tremendously in them as part of efforts to build a virile and sustainable economy and ensure all-round growth and development.\n\nAccording to him, the youth have part of the reasons the administration since it came to power, hence, the careful crafting of Osun Development Agenda to bring all the sectors and the people into the development net.\n\nHe said his administration has been engaging youths productively as loans ranging from N500,000 to N2, 500,000 were facilitated for 4,650 people and that efforts were on to increase the number of the beneficiaries.\n\nOyetola added that the unveiling of the Youth Policy Document was to further demonstrate his administration\u2019s commitment to youth development, saying that government remains resolute to continuously engage in research and monitoring, while deploying an effective evaluation template to constantly enrich the initiative and ensure proper and sustainable implementation of the policy.\n\n\u201cYouth is a critical stage in the life cycle of human beings because of the admixture of high energy, enthusiasm, insecurities, idealism, confusion and challenges that characterise this unique life stage,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe youth are the hope of our nation and our State. They are the face and engine of any meaningful sustainable development. Unfortunately, in our clime, social norms and practices often exclude them from participating in critical decision-making pertaining to their lives and activities with dire consequences.\n\n\u201cConscious of this misnomer and intent on correcting it to harness the bundle of energy that characterises youth, our government has in recent times focused its attention on the youth, while designing programmes and projects that impact on youth empowerment, employment and social justice.\n\n\u201cThe people, including the youth, are the reason we are in government. Our Administration came into office on the shoulders of Development Agenda, a programme carefully created to bring all the sectors and the people into the development net.\n\n\u201cWithin two years after coming into office, we have delivered adequate and quality services, projects and programmes across the State in a manner that will sustain the peace in the State, transform the economy, industrialise the State, provide jobs for the people, especially the youth, and provide security and welfare for the people.\n\n\u201cWe are also determined to use sports as a vehicle for encouraging school enrolment and retention and talent identification, just as we intend using it to create opportunities for young people in our rural communities.\n\n\u201cOnly two days ago, the State Executive Council gave approval for the commencement of Osun Sports Festival. The first edition will commence in June this year.\n\n\u201cThe unveiling of the Osun Youth Policy Document today is to further demonstrate our Administration\u2019s commitment to youth development.\n\n\u201cI therefore, recommend the document to all levels of government for accelerated implementation as the roles of all stakeholders are clearly spelt out.\n\n\u201cI want to also assure all the youth in the State that this new State Youth Policy vividly captures workable strategies for achieving the Youth Development Plan of the present Administration and we will do all that is necessary to ensure that, in collaboration with other Stakeholders, the lofty intention of the Policy is made a reality for our teeming youths,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Hon. Yemi Lawal, said the newly- launched Youth Policy Document would serve as a veritable tool towards the actualisation of the lofty programmes of the administration to guarantee a better future for the youth.\n\nLawal who described the document as the first in the history of the state, expressed confidence in its significance to redefine the socioeconomic fortune of the young ones and by extension make life more meaningful and worthwhile for them.\n\nHe said the Document came into being after various stakeholders meetings with members carefully drawn from relevant MDAs; the leadership of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, Osun State Chapter; Representatives of both State and National Youth Parliaments; Political Youth Leaders; Student Bodies, as well as the officials of the Ministry of Youth and Sports to work on the production of the Document so as to have a guide that will be acceptable to all.\n\nThe Youth and Sports Commissioner further stated, \u201cThere is the need to protect the present life of these young persons in order to safeguard their future. With this in mind in mind, the Government of Osun has been striving to ensure that the youth of the State are given various opportunities through education and empowerment programmes at all levels.\n\n\u201cThe State Government had worked out this Document that would serve as policy direction for the entire youths. I commend the strong desire of the present Administration in the State under the leadership of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola who seeks to improve socioeconomic and general well being of the young people in the State.\u201d\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Akanbi and the Orangun of Oke-Ila, Oba Abolarinwa Odedokun, urged Nigerian youths to take their destines in their own hands.\n\nThe monarchs who commended the Governor on the lofty initiative, expressed the hope that the document would go a long way to address the challenges confronting the youth in the State in particular and the nation at large.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye, attributed the conceptualisation and unveiling of the Policy to the positive manifestation of the \u2018all inclusiveness\u2019 posture of the Governor Oyetola Administration.\n\nTimothy noted that the Policy would further create opportunity for the youths to be more productive and fully engaged in things that would bring about socioeconomic values to their lives.\n\nHe commended the Governor for developing a Document that would help the youths of the State to take their rightful positions in the world.",
          "summary": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, OsogboOsun state Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Wednesday said his government is committed to youth development.\nThe governor spoke at the launch of Osun Youth Policy Document to develop and empower young people in the state and put them at the centre of development.\nHe noted that the Osun Youth Policy contains commitment by government, the youth of the state and the society in pursuance of youth development and growth.\n\u201cAs captured in the Policy, youth development is holistic and integrated, requiring the support and active involvement of all relevant Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), Youth Organisations, Non Governmental Organisations and the Public Sector, Private Sector and Philanthropists,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe unveiling of the Osun Youth Policy Document today is to further demonstrate our Administration\u2019s commitment to youth development.",

          "title": "Military invasion of South East will lead to chaos \u2013 Uko warns",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nFounder, Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), Evangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari against ordering military invasion of Nigeria\u2019s South East region, as according to him, such move would lead to chaos and an unprecedented meltdown of the country.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Uko who is also the secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), warned that military invasion rather than resolve the security situation in the zone, will make things much worse, even as it could lead to anarchy.\n\nUko\u2019s warning comes amid reports that President Buhari had concluded plans to order a major military operation in all the five states of the South East in response to recent attacks on police stations and other public facilities in the zone by gunmen amid growing agitations for a separate state of Biafra.\n\nOnline newspaper, TheCable quoted multiple security sources to have confirmed that President Buhari has given the security agencies the marching order to curtail the attacks.\n\nBuhari had in a series of tweets via his verified Twitter handle, @Mbuhari on Tuesday, tweeted that, \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe president went on to say that the agitators would soon get the shock of their lives, an indication that he had a major military operation in mind.\n\nThe tweet which referenced the 1967-1970 Biafra war, in which an estimated three million people, mostly in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast, were killed, including over a million children starved to death by food blockade, however, sparked angry reactions from many Nigerians on the social media platform, with many reminding the president that he had not made similar moves against bandits wreaking havoc in the country\u2019s Northwest and Boko Haram in the Northeast.\n\nReacting to the speculations, Uko emphasized that dialogue remained the only viable solution, as according to him, an invasion could lead to an all out conflict and Nigeria may never be the same again.\n\n\u201cRumours of proclamation of a state of emergency and the invasion of South East Nigeria by contingents and battalions of Nigerian military any time now, should not be true,\u201d Uko said.\n\n\u201cIf it is, then, the largest black nation on earth, may drift into an unexpected and unprecedented meltdown, which may be difficult to contain and impossible to control, and that would be because the rulers of the land, do not have the faintest idea of the resolve and anger in the souls of majority of the citizens of that region. The rulers will certainly meet unexpected reaction from the people of the zone. 51 year old pent-up anger in their hearts will explode in an unimaginable dimension, that may make it extremely difficult to save Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe stored up anger and bitterness in the hearts of Serbs as their parents retold stories about the sufferings of their people during the siege of Sarajevo in the 19th century, ensured the destruction of Yugoslavia over a century later.\n\n\u201cThose planning to invade South East and conquer the region, clearly, do not know the pain and humiliation the people of the region have had to endure and swallow for years, their strength and wealth, and especially the commitment of the diaspora population, and their readiness for a long and protracted struggle for justice and freedom from oppression. The government underestimates the mindset of over 20 million Igbo youths scattered all over the world, who have sworn not to hand over a situation of eternal servitude as permanent onlookers in the Nigerian project, to their progeny.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whatever may be wrong with the methods of the agitators, 90 percent of the masses, sympathizes with their cause, therein lies the problem.\n\n\u201cThe government will not face stiff resistance from the people, because the agitators are saints, angels and very polite folks, agitating with humility, no, that doesn\u2019t bother the people. The people are rather, very deeply offended, that the same government that has refused to rein in the deadly Fulani herdsmen who have made it extremely difficult for them to farm in their ancestral lands, paid hundreds of millions to vicious armed bandits terrorizing the North West, are suddenly bringing war to the most isolated, ostracised and persecuted region in the country.\n\n\u201cThis planned and ill-advised military campaign to the South East, will only confirm and affirm the rhetorics of the agitators, that the South East is deliberately hated and unwanted in the land. It will be difficult to convince the people otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe collateral damage in terms of human lives of innocent citizens, damage to infrastructure, rude interruption and destruction of economic life, and obstruction of trade, academic pursuits and civil and social activities, will produce enough bitterness and hatred of the central government, that the agitators will become heroes and idols of the much oppressed people of the zone.\n\n\u201cI have been closely involved with Igbo youths for close to 4 decades. I know that the last 2 years have been a remarkable period in the renaissance of ideas for self determination, never before experienced in this clime. I happen to know, not because I am a very smart person, but because I have intensely interacted with Igbo youths over the years and managed to earn their confidence.\n\n\u201cI say this confidently: Neither their parents nor teachers have any idea the degree of anger and bitterness in the hearts of Igbo youths born between 1990 and 2000, who are aged between 31 and 21 years of age. Certainly not the government. The whole world is in for a rude shock, you may wish to take my words to the bank.\n\n\u201cThe government, politicians and leaders across strata, made terrible mistakes by misjudging the agitators and applying very wrong strategy, that led to this unpleasant tension in the land. Military option will spiral into a conflagration that will be difficult to contain.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, it is important, to advise the South East Governors to, urgently meet with and explain to Mr President, the true situation on ground. Dialogue should replace military action. The government has never demanded a list of grievances from the agitators, government must do so now. More bloodshed will only prepare the ground for a bitter, protracted conflict, that will certainly change Nigeria for ever.\n\n\u201cNobody supports the agitators\u2019 sudden militant posture. But the brigandage of the ruthless Fulani herdsmen and their seeming above-the-law arrogance, forced the helpless masses to embrace the agitators\u2019 defence militia.\n\n\u201cThe refusal by government to invite and hear the grievances of the agitators and the decision to only kill them extra-judicially, granted the agitators, huge sympathy. Marching in to kill more of them, will complicate matters completely.\n\n\u201cBesides, Nigeria\u2019s multiple heamorage on many fronts, and the deep silence of the international community to support and advise Nigeria on the urgency to restructure the polity and adopt a new federal constitution, that would enthrone equity, suggests a conspiracy to programme Africa\u2019s largest nation to implode.\n\n\u201cHeavily indebted, with a steady inflation figures, unrest in all the regions, weak economy and agitation for seccesion thriving in the South East and South West, military action in the East will ensure the utter destruction of the road to peace.\n\n\u201cWhy is our colonial master watching and not advocating a new constitution for Nigeria? Why is the Bohemian club silently watching. Why is the council on foreign relations, the trilateral commission, the U.S state department etc, not pushing for a new people\u2019s constitution for Nigeria. Is their a silent conspiracy by the west, to watch Nigeria implode?\n\n\u201cHow come, all the eggheads in Nigeria are pretending they do not know that military invasion of the South East, will have dire consequences, first on the economy, and then on the unity and the very survival of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe government should engage the agitators in a dialogue. Military option should be out of it.\n\n\u201cIt is very doubtful if other regions will applaud the decision by the federal government to use military operation in the east to save the 1999 constitution. Everybody knows where Nigeria\u2019s problem is rooted. Insistence on preserving the 1999 constitution with the blood of citizens is unholy.\n\n\u201cHistory will judge all our actions today.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government has reacted angrily as social media giant, Twitter deletes President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet threatening violence against pro Biafra agitators in the country\u2019s Igbo dominated Southeast region.\n\nBuhari had in a series of tweets via his verified Twitter handle, @Mbuhari, tweeted, in reaction to series of attacks on police stations and the facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the region by gunmen, that, \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War.

If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTwo, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that? Are we the ones guilty of double standards? I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria, and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, indications have emerged that Buhari, in fulfilment of his threat, has ordered a major military offensive in the region, further raising concerns of possible human rights abuses and extra-judicial killings\n\nOnline newspaper, TheCable quoted multiple security sources to have confirmed that President Buhari has given the security agencies the marching order to curtail what many Nigerians fear is a descent to anarchy.\n\n\u201cThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has recruited over 50,000 foot soldiers, as it were, into its Eastern Security Network (ESN) and stockpiled arms, most of which were stolen from police armoury during the End SARS protests,\u201d a security operative told TheCable.\n\n\u201cThey have been bringing in arms through Cameroon in partnership with the Ambazonia Governing Council, the separatist movement in Southern Cameroon. IPOB sends at least 2,000 men and women to Cameroon for training on weapon handling every week.\u201d\n\nAnother top security official said IPOB has stockpiled \u201cbottle bombs\u201d, locally made explosive devices, Pump Action rifles \u201cas well as swords\u201d.\n\nIn a recorded tape, two people described as \u201ctop commanders of ESN\u201d were heard discussing issues such as surveillance of INEC offices, militants wounded in previous attacks, operations of IPOB camps, doctors treating wounded colleagues, installation of CCTV camera at their training camps in Udi, Emene and Nsukka and how to attack police cells,\u201d TheCable reported.\n\nIPOB has, however, denied being violent in its separatist campaign, but it has also said it assembles arms and ammunition locally.",

          "text": "By Tunde Opalana\n\nAs permutations among politicians continue ahead of the 2023 presidential race, a group of progressives have trump up the name of Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo as a good successor to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe body, Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG) reasoned that Osinbajo will be a choice candidate from the Muhammadu Buhari presidency and the All-Progressives Congress (APC) to enhancing progressive reforms and national unity.\n\nConsequently, the group implore the national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to reconsider his presidential ambition to pave way for a total support for the Vice President.\n\n\u201cBoth President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo must reach an accord for timely preparation of a more vibrant successor administration to be headed by the current Vice President while APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu should reconsider his ambition,\u201d the group asserted.\n\nAddressing reporters in Abuja on behalf of members drawn from the six geo-political zones, PCG\u2019s National Coordinator, Hon. Ahmed Mohammed and National Secretary, Dr Eberechukwu Eli Dibia pledged the group\u2019s preparedness to begin mobilization and sensitization visits to various media houses across the federation.\n\n\u201cVery soon, our group will enlist the support of leaders of thought to drive home our points nationwide. We are aware of the insecurity, economic worries and other issues confronting citizens but planlessness is not a virtue and we advocate that after two years into its second term, this administration must begin serious plans for the years ahead.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that some aides of VP Osinbajo describe calls for the learned gentleman\u2019s involvement in the 2023 race as \u2018mere distraction\u2019 and we are also aware of the views of thoughtful Nigerians including the Emir of Gombe, Alhaji Abubakar Shehu Abubakar III who commends Osinbajo\u2019s loyalty to President Buhari and the spearheading of important reforms towards enhancing ease of doing business, enhancing ICT innovation, as well as economic policies to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari can optimally utilize what is currently within the administration now to build a better future by convincing the not-so-political Professor of Law to run in 2023. His candidature would be far more appealing to Nigerian youth, discerning elders and various sectors of the population.\n\n\u201cAs for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, he is a great war general but with chinks in his armour such that opponents may easily exploit his Achilles heels to make things very difficult for the ruling party if he becomes presidential candidate in 2023; there is no need to expatiate on what baggages constitute such vulnerabilities at the moment,\u201d they stated.\n\nExpressing what they described as \u2018patriotic concerns\u2019 over various national challenges including rising insecurity, separatist agitations, unemployment and other economic issues, the PCG which stated that its membership includes \u2018APC loyalists, patriots from other parties and numerous apolitical patriots\u2019 also urged Nigerians not to give into undue anxiety as the situation is not beyond redemption.\n\n\u201cThe rather pessimistic views of Ambassador John Campbell and others have energized anxieties but by going back to the drawing table and preparing for the future with our best eleven, including the likes of Osinbajo, Nigeria can be united and made to rise exponentially in the comity of nations.\n\nREAD ALSO: Extend teachers\u2019 retirement age, Buhari tells Senate\n\n\u201cNigeria is not a failed state; today\u2019s challenges are rooted in errors of the past and some misjudgements of the present time but if we re-strategize, we can drastically curb our difficulties and give our people greater basis for hope.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has tried his best over the past six years but much more needs to be done and an Osinbajo successor administration would be in a vantage position to marshal the energies of youth and the visionary experience to transform this great nation,\u201d the Progressive Consolidation Group emphasized.",

          "text": "By KEN EMORDI\n\n\u2026Sanwo Olu woos ADF, VDMA to set up same in Lagos\n\nThe Aliko Dangote Foundation in partnership with Germany\u2019s VDMA (the German Association for Mechanical and Plant Engineering) and its Foundation for Young Talent in Mechanical Engineering (NWS) have officially launched a technical training program in Nigeria, in a bid to significantly address the skill deficit in all the key sectors of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nSpeaking at the official launching of the programme on Wednesday, the president of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote said that the landmark program is a Seven-million Euro investment, a large percentage of which is for the specialized, leading-edge equipment that has been shipped from Germany and installed in five workshops purpose-built for this program at Dangote Academy in Obajana. He also said the beneficiaries will be trained, using these machines, so they can learn practical skills that will be transferable as they enter the work force.\n\nThis program, according to him, is the first of its kind in Nigeria, and will be replicated in all the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\nNoting that vocational and technical skills are vital to the well-being of any economy, as key levers for growth, specifically in the manufacturing sector, Dangote said significant skills gaps exist in Nigeria, which is what this program is seeking to address.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe trainees that successfully pass through the full vocational training will be prepared as well-rounded professionals. In addition to the technical training, they will also get personal effectiveness trainings of same quality as our staff\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s minister for economic cooperation and development, Dr. Gerd muller, lauded the Aliko Dangote Foundation and VDMA for the enviable program that can transform and develop the economy of Nigeria. He said his ministry has supported the initiative with \u20ac3.6 million and will not hesitate to do more for the purpose of the initiatives to be achieved.\n\nThe VDMA past president, Dr Reinhold Fostge stated that \u201cI am very happy that this has become reality eventually in Nigeria. We started six years ago. Four years ago, we signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a Nigerian German training project. This program is to raise the skill level of workers and make the youth employable\u2026our vision in VDMA is that, in future, we should be able to exchange highly skilled professionals between Nigeria and Germany and as a matter of fact, I have no objection to inviting Nigerian specialists to help me in Germany and vice versa\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, enjoined both the Aliko Dangote Foundation and VDMA to consider citing the second training workshop in Lagos, with a promise to make funds available for the take off this laudable programme.\n\nHe said: I am truly excited to be part of this epoch and nation changing event\u2026for us in Lagos, I am happy to announce that we have six well maintained vocational training schools\u2026 but we are going to not just talk here today, we are going to be making a public commitment that given what I have listened to now, we are not going to leave this to Dangote Foundation alone, we have to upscale our commitment.\n\n\u201cWe wont wait for him to replicate this in the six-geographical zones of the country. Lagos State will work with him and ask the VDMA what level of commitment is required from the state government\u2026to ensure that in no distance future, we can replicate and bring a full arm of the Dangote academy to Lagos State\u2026we do not want government bureaucracy to stall this, if it is to raise finance that is required, I can assure you that Lagos state is ready to that and why are we making this commitment?\n\n\u201cIt is because of where we see Lagos\u2026 the amount of the teeming youth that we have in our country and our state. Lagos has continued to be the biggest economy in our country and even in Africa, and what this present to us is an opportunity to bridge that will help to significantly reduce the unemployment level in the state\u201d\n\nCongratulating the trainees, Dangote said: \u201cI understand that we chose only 120 of you out of over 4,000 applicants. This means you are smart, you are the best and the brightest, we believe in you, and expect great things from you. I urge you to make use of this wonderful opportunity and become productive for the well-being of our country.\u201d\n\nHe also promised that more youth will be admitted and very soon, all the six geo-political zones of the country will witness massive development through the scheme.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

As a State with a massive population of young people, we need to play major role in the development of technology, which is an enabler to leapfrog into rapid socio-economic growth. We take technology as an important deliverable in our Government\u2019s development agenda.\n\n\u201cFor us to make lasting impact in tech industry, we said to ourselves we needed to build the infrastructure to support sector. We are building a tech campus on a 22,000 square meters land in Yaba, which we christen K.I.T.E. We are working with global brands in the tech space, such as Facebook and Google, to deliver this important technology hub.\n\n\u201cWe are currently laying 3,000 kilometres metropolitan fibre optic cables across the State to drop reliable and fast Internet connectivity in homes and work places. These are part of the infrastructure required as backbone for the tech industry to flourish and empower our young people in the space to take their businesses and ideas to the level of stability.\u201d\n\nAside the infrastructural initiatives, Sanwo-Olu said the State Government had been providing support for startups through the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) and Lagos State Science Research and Innovation Council (LASRIC), which provide grant opportunities for innovators and tech researchers.\n\nThe Governor disclosed that two out of the 20 start-ups ideas supported through LASRIC last year had secured patents for their innovations and ready to transform into fully-fledged businesses that would create jobs.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the State Government\u2019s intervention in the technology space was about creating opportunities for the future and providing platforms to make start-up businesses thrive.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe visit to your ecosystems today is for you to be assured that this Government is not sitting back in taking steps to ease access. We fully understand the role which technology plays in our lives and how technology is important to any society that wants to be relevant in coming decades. We are happy to be building the capability for Lagos, so that we can compete with other developed cities in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Governor had a roundtable discussion with some of the startups to communicate the State\u2019s effort and how better the Government could properly channel its interventions in the sector.\n\nSome of the startups had the opportunity to present their business models and innovative solutions to the Government\u2019s team. The engagement gave the Governor and his team the possible areas of intervention.\n\nLSETF Executive Secretary, Mrs. Teju Abisoye, said the agency had been providing support for over 38 partner hubs across Local Government Areas (LGAs) and Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in the State, stressing that the objective of the funding was to support startups from idea to exit stages.\n\nVenia Hub is an ecosystem housing Flutterwave and 100 other tech start-up companies.

          "title": "Foreign herdsmen poised to strike in Southwest: Amotekun boss Togun warns",
          "text": "By Abankula\n\nChairman Oyo State Security Network codenamed Amotekun Corps, General Kunle Togun (rtd) has warned Yoruba people to be security conscious because the foreign herdsmen in their midst are poised to make the big strike, any time.\n\nTogun, a former Director of Military Intelligence (DMI) and former Deputy Director-General of State Security Service (SSS), advised people to be prepared to defend themselves.\n\nAccording to the Oyo Amotekun boss, the foreigners have been penetrating localities in the region to monitor the environment over the years to pave way for the big strike.\n\nThe strike, according to intelligence report, he said will be aided by local collaborators based on the belief God has given them Nigeria, especially, the Southwest as inheritance.\n\nTogun spoke after a lecture he delivered at an event staged by the Institute of Peace and Strategic Studies Student Association (IPSSSA) University of Ibadan.\n\nHis lecture was entitled: \u201cSecurity Challenges, The significance of regional security dimensions.\u201d\n\nHe said:\u201cThe foreign Fulani herdsmen have invaded South West. There is nowhere in the South West that they are not. They are there.\n\n\u201cThey are the Okada riders. They are the ones using wheelbarrows to sell carrots and other things. I said they are foot soldiers.\n\n\u201cThey said they have come in to take the inheritance given to them by Allah and that is Nigerian land, particularly South West.\n\n\u201cSo, they will still strike. I am not just screaming aloud. So, everybody has to be ready.\n\n\u201cIt is only a foolish soldier that would say he wants to die for his country. His death cannot help his country. You are to stay alive to help your country.\n\n\u201cWhen as a soldier, you are sent to capture a particular place, they did not send you to go and die. If he gets there and scared them and the people run away, he has done what he supposed to do.\n\n\u201cBut if he was shot at and he fired back, he did not shoot to kill anybody, but to defend himself and keep himself alive, so that he can help his country.\n\n\u201cFor over 10 years, I have been saying it that the 10 local government areas of Oke-Ogun and the three local government areas of Ibarapa, both in Oyo State, have been saturated by these foreign Fulanis.\n\n\u201cAfter that, they brought in their children, selling pepper, tomatoes, carrots and so on with wheelbarrows.\n\n\u201cAll of us are looking at them. You cannot say Amotekun will do everything. Members of the public must help with credible information.\n\n\u201cMy advice to the Federal Government is that they should support regional security outfits.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore Amotekun took off, this problem has been there. They have invaded all Yorubaland. These people are just starting the plans they already had on ground, not that they are just coming in.\n\n\u201cAnd these foreign Fulani are still coming in. They have saturated already Yorubaland before Amotekun was established.\u201d\n\nGeneral Togun for many years have been drumming about the dangers of the foreign Fulani herdsmen in Nigeria, who invade farms and allow their animals to eat up crops and who also are ready to kill when the farmers complain.\n\nIn an interview with Nigerian Tribune in 2017, he spoke about a security meeting he attended in Abuja, where he made specific mention of the menace of the foreign herdsmen.\n\nHere is a reproduction of part of the interview:\n\nI was also in Abuja last June; all of us who were former directors of military intelligence were invited to Abuja by the current director of military intelligence. He tabled the security challenges of the country and we all had to make contributions.\n\nWhen it came to the issue of Fulani herdsmen, people said different things. When it came to my turn, I said these Fulani herdsmen, who the Northerners see as part of them, are foreigners.\n\nThey are foreigners; they are from Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger Republic and Chad; that is why they are so merciless. They are of no fixed address. I told them that Fulani people should call these herdsmen and ask where they come from in Northern Nigeria and ask them who their district heads are. The herdsmen are not Nigerians.\n\nI am a security man and I know my level of security status in the world. Some of these herdsmen were Al-Qaeda terrorists who took over Northern Mali and France had to send troops while ECOWAS and African Union added troops to expel them from Northern Mali and hand over the territory back to Mali. That was where they came about their assault rifles. Why are security agents not investigating how Fulani herdsmen are going about with AK 47?\n\nI told them in Abuja that you call them Fulani, but we call them Bororo in Oke Ogun and they have been harassing us for the past 25 years; it is not a joke. I said at DAWN three years ago that the 10 local governments of Oke Ogun and three local governments of Ibarapa were under the siege of herdsmen, but nobody listened and I see the invasion of these people as if someone is trying to expand their territory to Yorubaland.\n\nDo you think the problem can be solved through the provision of grazing routes across the country?\n\nHow can anyone legislate on grazing routes? How? How much grazing routes have these people been given in the North? They are now saying we should give grazing routes.\n\nThere is a claim that there are grazing routes across the country.\n\nWho made the grazing routes?\n\nIs there no grazing route in Saki?\n\nLet me tell you, from a very long time ago, they used to take cows from the North to Lagos on foot. That was when they used to pass through here and that is what they are now saying that there used to be grazing routes. Who created the grazing routes? The Fulani herdsmen we grew up to know around here do not graze on anyone\u2019s farm; we lived with them for decades. But these foreign invaders come and start grazing on people\u2019s farms. They go to people\u2019s farms to graze and tell you do you want their cows to die and once you challenge them, they shoot and kill. You see, things are happening and some idiots are sitting down somewhere making case for non-Nigerians. And do they know that if we give grazing grounds to these clowns, tomorrow they will say they own the place. That was what started the problem in Jos till date. That was what started the problem in Agatu.\n\nAnd someone expects that to happen in the South-West? Nobody should give grazing grounds in the South-West.",

Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, Fani-Kayode said the president\u2019s statement saddened him.\n\n\u201cThis statement from President Buhari saddens me. The suggestion that another 3 to 5 million Igbo, including 1 million children, may be subjected to genocide again for whatever reason is unacceptable and I condemn it in the strongest terms.\n\n\u201cNigeria should be apologising for what she did to the Biafrans in the civil war and not threatening to do it all over again. State-sponsored genocide, ethnic cleansing, religious cleansing and mass murder has no place in a civilised country. Only savages animals and barbarians indulge in such things,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cNo matter how you feel about the Igbo, you have no right to threaten to visit them with death and destruction.\n\n\u201cThey are not animals and they are not slaves: they are human beings and like all the rest of us, red blood flows through their veins!\n\n\u201cI am glad that Twitter removed Mr. President\u2019s tweet. It did more damage to the psyche and confidence of the Igbo than all the killings that have taken place over the last 5 years. It has also traumatised millions of non-Igbo Nigerians who believe that the same treatment may be visited on them.\n\n\u201cMr. President\u2019s comment is insensitive, irresponsible and wicked and I sincerely hope that he will never say such a thing again. Can you blame those that want to establish Biafra when the President of Nigeria can say such things and issue such threats?\u201d",

          "title": "EXPOSED: AGF Malami secretly asks Buhari to suspend Nigerian constitution, declares martial law",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari is in the process of declaring a state of emergency across the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Peoples Gazette can report based on a secret memo and official accounts, as the administration scrambles to waggle its way out of acute insecurity and the encumbrances of constitutional provisions.\n\nAttorney-General Abubakar Malami has already written lengthy legal advice to the Nigerian president, urging him to move swiftly to suspend the fundamental rights of all Nigerians as guaranteed under Chapter IV of the Constitution.\n\nIn the eight-page secret memo dated May 4, 2021, Mr Malami told Mr Buhari that insecurity across Nigeria has reached a level that could no longer be checked by existing democratic techniques, saying only a state of emergency promulgated by the president can help return the country to tranquillity.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and AGF Abubakar Malami\n\n\u201cThe essence of declaration is to allow for suspension of constitutional and legal bureaucratic bottlenecks pertaining to matters of National Security with particular regards to fundamental rights guaranteed under Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution and processes and procedures relating to procurements, among others,\u201d the attorney-general said.\n\nMr Malami said the president should issue instruments of emergency and publish them in the federal gazette. Senate President Ahmed Lawan and Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila will be informed about the decision ahead of implementation, he added.\n\n\u201cTo douse probable legal tension, it is important for the proclamation instrument of the statement of emergency to expressly provide for the suspension of Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution and its attendant enforcement rules,\u201d Mr Malami wrote. \u201cThe suspension of rights pertaining to matters of national security will then give legal backing for the proclamation of the statement of emergency to be operational and effective without litigious or judicial distractions.\u201d\n\nIn the early pages of the document, Mr Malami cited widespread acts of insecurity and blamed prominent separatist agitators like Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu for fueling the protracted crisis that has enveloped the country and aggravated the social and economic conditions of Nigerians.\n\nThe memo was endorsed to the president by National Security Adviser Babagana Monguno and administration officials are divided on how to proceed with the advice.\n\n\u201cClearly, different factions of our government have different positions on this alarming proposal,\u201d a presidency official told The Gazette. \u201cBut everyone agrees that the AGF holds powerful sway over the president and it would be a miracle if the Constitution is not suspended as he recommended.\u201d\n\nAnother official also within the presidency, who confirmed hearing about the memo but had not seen it before they were reached by The Gazette, said Mr Buhari might have little resistance considering the potency of Mr Malami\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cThe president is just saying they should act in the best interest of the country,\u201d the official said. \u201cEven as the president, he seemed to have given up on his own ability to get the AGF to back down.\u201d\n\nConstitution suspended\n\nMultiple constitutional scholars and practitioners who analysed the memo for The Gazette said it was essentially a suspension of the Nigerian Constitution and declaration of martial law since Chapter IV dealt with fundamental human rights absence of which there cannot be a democratic system.\n\nThe analysts acknowledged the powers of the president to issue a state of emergency under Section 305 of the Constitution but said the powers are not absolute and do not include outright suspension of Chapter IV. While Section 305 said the president can declare a national emergency to curb criminalities, it did not expressly permit suspension of Chapter IV, which analysts described as the most important section of the Constitution.\n\nThe right to life and other crucial rights of modern society will be suspended under Mr Malami\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe attorney-general appeared to lay the groundwork for the controversial plan when he decried on Tuesday that Mr Buhari\u2019s respect for human rights was largely responsible for the administration\u2019s seeming incompetence at tackling widespread carnage and lawlessness.\n\nUnder siege\n\nMr Malami and presidential spokesman Garba Shehu did not return The Gazette\u2019s requests for comments about the proposal.\n\nMr Buhari has been conflicted over widespread chaos that threatens to define his eight-year leadership as a democratically-elected leader. His administration is the fourth since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999 following years of military dictatorship.\n\nWhereas he touted his military bona fides as a plus for his fitness for a nation beset by insecurity, the country has seen no changes in security challenges under Mr Buhari. Since 2015, thousands of Nigerians have been killed by armed bandits, killer herdsmen, kidnappers and even security agents. Millions of citizens are already racked by economic hardships which analysts blamed on the administration\u2019s rudderless policies.\n\nIn his argument, Mr Malami alerted the president to the dangers of allowing the situation to go on unchecked, saying it would wreak even more devastating chaos compared to the current level of disorder.\n\nBut the prevailing state of security in Nigeria can be addressed under the existing constitutional framework, legal analyst Abdul Mahmud told The Gazette on Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cThe AGF\u2019s position is nonsensical,\u201d Mr Mahmud said. \u201cThey have their own sinister agenda and are trying to come under suspension of the Constitution to actualise it.\u201d\n\nMr Mahmud said he was incensed by Mr Malami\u2019s suggestion to the president, saying it was unbefitting of his position as attorney-general\n\n\u201cIf the attorney-general who ought to be the chief protector of our Constitution is suggesting the need to suspend Chapter IV of the Constitution, then it is clearly an attempt to plunge the country into further crisis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of the Constitution, including Section 305, that contemplated the suspension of Chapter IV, which essentially is the suspension of the Constitution itself,\u201d the legal expert said.",
          "summary": "Attorney-General Abubakar Malami has already written lengthy legal advice to the Nigerian president, urging him to move swiftly to suspend the fundamental rights of all Nigerians as guaranteed under Chapter IV of the Constitution.\nMr Malami said the president should issue instruments of emergency and publish them in the federal gazette.\nUnder siegeMr Malami and presidential spokesman Garba Shehu did not return The Gazette\u2019s requests for comments about the proposal.\nMr Buhari has been conflicted over widespread chaos that threatens to define his eight-year leadership as a democratically-elected leader.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no part of the Constitution, including Section 305, that contemplated the suspension of Chapter IV, which essentially is the suspension of the Constitution itself,\u201d the legal expert said.",

          "text": "Support group under the umbrella of All Progressives Congress, APC Legacy Awareness & Campaign (APC-LAC) , has challenged the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to practice its opposition duty by presenting to Nigerians comparatively its achievements during its 16-year stewardship as the ruling party.\n\nWhile acknowledging that criticisms and opposition are integral requirements of democracy, the group said the PDP and its leadership must never imagine that Nigerians have a short memory of how destructive they were as managers of Nigeria, insisting that APC is working to rebuild the country after years of neglect and destructions while President Buhari is laying solid and sustainable foundation for Nigeria\u2019s greatness.\n\nThe group\u2019s position was contained in a statement released Wednesday to showcase the achievements of president Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration in the last six years, and made available to journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe statement, which was jointly signed by Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi and Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, was titled: APC is Laying Foundation for the Greatness of Nigeria.\n\nThe group insisted that president Buhari\u2019s administration has developed more infrastructure in the last six years than the entire sixteen years of PDP\u2019s administration.\n\nParts of the statement reads, \u201cMore road and rail infrastructure are being built and/or completed since 2015, than in the sixteen years between 1999 and 2015. Several landmark infrastructure initiatives are being implemented by the Buhari Administration, from the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) to the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), the Highway Development Maintenance Initiative (HDMI), the Sovereign Sukuk Bonds (that have collectively raised close to a billion dollars), and the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme. All of these are unprecedented efforts in developing and upgrading national infrastructure. Equally unparalleled is President Buhari\u2019s commitment to completing abandoned and unfinished projects inherited from previous administrations.\n\n\u201cAchieving Agricultural Self-Sufficiency: Through landmark initiatives like the Anchor Borrowers Programme and the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative, millions of farmers across the country have benefited from improved access to land, input, credit and fertilizers; and private sector players have invested more than a billion dollars in cultivation, milling and processing.\n\n\u201cEntrenching Technology in Government Processes and Service Delivery: The presidential mandates to expand the coverage of the Treasury Single Account and the Integrated Public Payroll Information System (IPPIS) to all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, Automation of the Federal Budgeting Process, Automation of Import Duty Exemption, Electronic Visas, the launch of the Open Treasury Portal, National Digital Identification, and so on.\n\n\u201cCreating the first truly national Social Safety Net in the history of Nigeria: Nigeria has since 2016 built the largest social investment programme in Africa, with more than 10 million beneficiaries receiving one or more of the following: Cash Transfers, Micro-Credit, School Feeding, N-Power Stipends and a Special Public Works Programme across all 774 Local Government Areas of the country.\n\n\u201cEnabling the Private Sector: Under the watch of APC controlled Federal Government under President Buhari, the largest single-train refinery in the world is being constructed, in Lagos, as well as the first new Deep-Sea Port in the country in decades. Across the Niger Delta, several private-sector-led Modular Refinery Projects have kicked off since 2016 and are being completed; as well as the long-awaited Train 7 that will expand the NLNG\u2019s capacity by a third. Billions of dollars have been invested in every part of the country by private investors in Agriculture, Mining, Oil and Gas, Manufacturing, Logistics, and other areas, since 2016.\n\n\u201cGovernance Reforms: No administration since 1999 has assented to as much transformative legislation: the first Police Reform Bill since 1943, the first Prisons Reform Bill in almost fifty years, the first reform of Companies legislation (CAMA) in thirty years, the first reform of Fiscal Terms for the Oil and Gas Industry since 1993, the first legislation in West Africa aimed at criminalising Maritime Piracy, Clearing of longstanding Petroleum Joint Venture (JV) Cash Call Arrears, Restoration of the Budgeting Calendar to a January-December cycle, take-off of the Ogoni Clean Up, after several years of delays, and many more.\n\n\u201cA New Paradigm for Federal-State Relations: Under President Buhari led APC controlled Federal Government, the era of unhelpful Federal interference in subnational affairs, resulting in illegal impeachments of Governors, withholding of State Government Funds, balkanisation of the Governors\u2019 Forum, etc, has ended. Instead, the Federal Government under President Buhari has positioned itself as a vital source of support to the States, making available long overdue refunds like the Paris Club Refunds ($5.4 billion); Refunds for Federal Road Projects (approximately 700 billion Naira); and Bailout Funds and Budget Support in excess of Two Trillion Naira.\n\n\u201cRebuilding National Security Capacity: Even as the country continues to struggle with several historical security challenges, the APC led Administration of President Buhari has been planting the seeds for a more efficiently policed and secured country, through the following:\n\n\u201cUnprecedented investments in military hardware: dozens of new aircraft, ships, battle tanks and others have been ordered and are being delivered\n\nPresidential Assent to the new Police Act, in which Community Policing has been enshrined.\n\n\u201cEstablishment of the Police Trust Fund to finance training, logistics and welfare\n\nInvestment in technology-aided policing of land and maritime environments \u2013 Nigeria Police National Command and Control Centre (NPF-C4i); Nigeria Police Crime and Incident Data Base (NPC & IDB); NIMASA\u2019s Deep Blue Project; West African Police Information System (WAPIS) Data Collection and Recording (DACORE) Centre in partnership with INTERPOL, Nigerian Immigration Service Technology Center, and others.\n\nx\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that these efforts will begin to yield fruit in the months and years ahead.\n\n\u201cBuilding Bilateral Partnerships and Advancing Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Policy Interests: The Buhari Administration has restored Nigeria\u2019s relations with countries like the United States, United Kingdom, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and our neighbouring countries, with positive outcomes like the sale by the United States of 12 fighter aircraft, the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative with Morocco, and the revitalization of the Multinational Joint Task Force and the Chad Basin Commission.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed has taken a swipe at the US media giant, Twitter, saying its mission in Nigeria is suspicious.\n\nMohammed\u2019s comments came after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet where he issued a threat to trouble makers in the country while making reference to Nigeria\u2019s civil war.\n\nWhile defending its action, the tech company said the President\u2019s tweet violated its rules.\n\nBut briefing State House reporters at the Presidential Villa on Wednesday in Abuja, the Minister accused Twitter of ignoring inciting tweets by the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and others, adding that Nigeria would not be fooled.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspicious. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the ENDSARS protests that were funding ENDSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of the former president of the US, Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during ENDSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Twitter Deletes Buhari\u2019s \u2018In The Language They Understand\u2019 Tweet\n\nHe recalled the #EndSARS protest during which government and private property were either looted or destroyed in October last year, noting that the company also displayed the same bias during the period.\n\nThe minister also asked what rule of Twitter President Buhari violated to warrant his tweet to be deleted, wondering why previous tweets on #EndSARS protests were taken out.\n\nMohammed added, \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, it\u2019s not the universal rule. If Mr. President, anywhere in the world feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views. Now, we should stop comparing apples with oranges.\n\n\u201cIf an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed. Two, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centers, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr. President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?\n\n\u201cWe are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed. By whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari had during a meeting with the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, issued a stern warning to those plotting to destroy Nigeria, saying they will soon receive the shock of their lives.\n\nHe also condemned the series of attacks on INEC facilities, stressing that the Federal Government has given the perpetrators enough time.\n\n\u201cI receive daily security reports on the attacks, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail,\u201d President Buhari said.",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has accused Twitter, an American microblogging and social networking service of double standards on issues concerning the country\u2019s domestic issues.\n\nInformation and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed also described the company\u2019s role in Nigeria as suspicious. He was reacting to a recent message by President Muhammadu Buhari that was deleted by the social media company on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s tweet on Tuesday was reminiscing of Nigerians\u2019 experiences during the civil war and warning to armed secessionists in the Southeast region of the country.\n\nSpeaking to State House correspondents in Abuja on Wednesday, the Nigerian minister said Twitter has not been fair to Nigeria and had conveniently ignored inciting tweets by the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, and others.\n\nAccording to the Minister, the social media giant also displayed the same bias during the #ENDSARS protest during which government and private property were either looted or destroyed but finds the President\u2019s tweets offensive.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,\u201d the President had said in a series of tweets on Tuesday.\n\nTwitter has, however, deleted the tweet saying that the tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\n\nBut the minister said: \u201cTwitter may have its own rules, they are not the universal rules. If Mr President, anywhere in the world, feels very bad and concern about a situation, he is free to express such views.\n\n\u201cNow, we should stop comparing apples with oranges. If an organisation is proscribed, it is different from any other which is not proscribed.\n\n\u201cTwo, any organisation that gives directives to its members, to attack police stations, to kill policemen, to attack correctional centres, to kill warders, and you are now saying that Mr President does not have the right to express his dismay and anger about that?\n\n\u201cThey are the ones guilty of double standards. I don\u2019t see anywhere in the world where an organisation, a person will stay somewhere outside Nigeria and will direct his members to attack the symbols of authority, the police, the military, especially when that organisation has been proscribed.\n\n\u201cBy whatever name, you can\u2019t justify giving orders to kill policemen or to kill anybody you do not agree with.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
