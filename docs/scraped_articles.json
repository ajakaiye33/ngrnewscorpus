          "title": "NHRC: Chinese, Lebanese, Koreans invade Nigeria\u2019s forests, cart woods abroad -",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Osa Amadi, Arts Editor\n\nNigerian forests and the resources they harbor are not only under attack by local and foreign killer herdsmen; our forests are also raped and stripped bare by Chinese, Lebanese and Korean illegal loggers, albeit in the most unsustainable manner.\n\nThis was brought to the front burner of national discourse in Lagos on Wednesday, May 26, 2021 by the Nigerian Human Rights Community, NHRC, in a press conference titled \u201cIllegal Wood Export in Nigeria and the Far-reaching Consequences on Economy, Human Rights and Sustainable Development in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe paper by NHRC read by Taiwo Adeleye addressed the critical issue of devastation of Nigerian environment and illegal wood export which has left bitter pills on the lips of many Nigerian communities.\n\nREAD ALSO Bloggers lied about my EFCC arrest \u2015 Comedian Pankeeroy\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing across Nigeria is a blatant rape of our environment by a combined dubious synergy of local and international conspirators,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cOur forest reserves, wood species and economic trees are being mauled down in desperation \u2013 forests resources that determine the livelihood of millions of Nigerians. As we speak, Nigeria is hub to the largest illegal exportation of illegal wood in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on is the silent and vicious killing of our livelihood, the destruction of our future as a country and the violation of the Nigerian constitution in the most savage, rude and provocative manners. In Nigeria, some of these foreigners are indiscriminate in their attacks on indigenous territories.\u201d\n\nStatistically painting a grim picture of the loss the country has suffered on account of these ecological rape of Nigeria\u2019s forests, NHRC said records indicate that 96.518 square kilometers of land, which amounts to 27 percent of the total forest area and 10 percent of the total land area, was designated as \u2018reserved\u2019 by various governments in the country.\n\n\u201cMost of these, representing some 66 percent of the forest reserve are located in the Savannah area; some 20 percent of the land area are in the tropical forest zones, all in Southern Nigeria, while some 4 percent are fresh water swamps and mangroves located by nature in the Niger Delta area. At independence, Nigeria had at least 8 National Parks and 445 nature reserves. Today, more than half of all of them are gone!\n\n\u201cIn the year 2005 alone, about 11, 089, 000 hectares (27, 400, 000 acres) were destroyed in Nigeria. Between 1990 and 2000, the country lost some 409, 700 hectares of forest. The years between 1990 and 2005 saw Nigeria lose 35.7 percent of her forest strength which translates to 6, 145, 000 hectares.\u201d\n\nThe conference also revealed the country\u2019s wildlife and botanical wealth: \u201cNigeria is home to 285 mammals, 203 reptiles, 117 amphibians, 775 different fishes and about 4, 715 species of higher plants. The desperate search and destruction of these precious trees lead to the total destruction and annihilation of these special species created by God\n\n\u201cThe implications on agriculture, sustainable livelihood, spiritual well-being, climate change and political economy is unimaginable. These acts violate the Nigerian constitution and the various United Nations Conventions on environment, including, but not limited to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\u201d\n\nThese loses diminish Nigeria\u2019s biodiversity. As stated by the United Nations, \u201cCultural diversity is more than appearance, more than folklore, song and dance. It is the embodiment of values, institutions and patterns of behavior. It is a composite whole representing a people\u2019s historical experience, aspirations, culture and world view. Deprive a people of their language, culture and spiritual values, and they lose all sense of direction and purpose.\u201d\n\nThe UN noted further that \u201clocal knowledge embraces information about location, movements and other factors explaining spatial patterns and timing in the ecosystem, including sequences of events, cycles and trends. Direct links with the land are therefore fundamental, and obligations to maintain those connections form the core of individual and group identity.\u201d\n\nAccording to NHRC, in the past three months, it has been receiving reports from across the country from indigenous peoples whose livelihood is threatened and their forest are on the verge of extinction. These communities, NHRC said, are helpless. They face a hopeless situation.\n\nThe most affected communities are in Ogun, Oyo, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, Kogi, Osun, Cross River, Rivers, Bayelsa, Edo and Delta states. In the northern states, most hit are Plateau, Nassarawa and Benue states.\n\n\u201cThe main actors in this fraud are the Chinese, Koreans and Lebanese who have no other jobs than to invade the forests, cut down the trees for export in the most ignoble, vicious and callous manners. There is no Environmental Impact Assessment, EIA, no prior and informed consent of affected indigenous communities while the desperate hunt for those precious forest reserves continues.\n\n\u201cIt may interest Nigerians to know that these precious forests trees that cost fortunes are never replanted by these foreigners who feast on them. Their main targets are Rosewoods, Araria, Mahogany and Iroko.\n\n\u201cAnnually, some 3.5 percent (approximately 350, 000-400, 000 hectares) are destroyed per year in Nigeria with these activities linked to the Chinese, Koreans and Lebanese cartels. The destruction of these forest reserves by these foreign interests has serious implication for sustainable livelihood in the country,\u201d the conference declared.\n\nThe implications are damage to the local economy and natural habitat; increase in local timber prices leading to shutdown of factories, thereby forcing many out of jobs. Additionally, local manufactures cannot get logs to run their factories.\n\nOther consequences include destruction of the local industry; increase in timber prices leading to increase in cost of construction \u2013 housing, roads, drainages, flood works, etc.; violation of indigenous rights as communities resist the destruction of their lands leading to conflicts.\n\nObviously, increase in timber prices will increase cost of manufacturing \u2013 pallet prices, packaging and transportation cost. Excessive and illegal deforestation will affect natural habitats and pose as threat to food security across the country.\n\nDEMANDS\n\nThe NHRC therefore calls on President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly and the 36 governors of states in Nigeria to immediately carry out the following without delay:\n\nThe Chinese, Lebanese, Koreans and all foreigners involved in illegal exportation of Nigerians\u2019 precious wood resources should be banned.\n\nA presidential probe panel and judicial commission of inquiry should be set up in all the affected states to identify, punish and sanction all the foreign interests and their collaborators involved in this illegal business.\n\nIn line with the provisions of Nigerian law, the Nigerian Prohibition List which states that timber cannot be exported in rough and sawn form (which is the form these illegal exporters move the woods) and in line with the Convention on International Trade Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, CITES, the perpetrators must be brought to book.\n\nNHRC vowed to embark, from the day of the conference, on a local and global campaign against all the individuals and foreign interests in these illegal deals:\n\n\u201cWe shall embark on petitions to government institutions, the Chinese, Lebanese, Korean governments and the United Nations to stop these criminal acts and bring the perpetrators to book without delay,\u201d they said.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Prisca Sam-Duru\n\nFor four years now, little Leah Sharibu has been missing in her schools\u2019 Children\u2019s Day celebration. Not only that she has been transformed against her will into a teenage mother of two as we heard in the news, she has also been forcefully converted to Islam by her captors.\n\nFriday, 14th May, 2021, was the 18th birthday of the ambassador of Christ- Leah Sharibu. No one will be surprised if she didn\u2019t even remember her special day due to obvious reasons. But as the world marked the 2021 Children\u2019s Day last Thursday 27th May, we remembered Leah and every other child both those who have fallen and those still in captivity, hoping and praying that one day, they will reunite with their families and friends.\n\nLeah\u2019s story is not just a modern-day Christian martyr narrative, but also, that of modern-day slavery. Young Leah is just one out of thousands of black Africans, mostly Christians who have been enslaved by terrorists and trafficked in Libya, Sudan, Nigeria, Algeria etc.\n\nREAD ALSO Bloggers lied about my EFCC arrest \u2015 Comedian Pankeeroy\n\nWhile the prayers for their freedom intensify, renowned Minister of God and iconic gospel singer, Dr Panem Percy Paul, has through his soul-inspiring means of communication, released a song of hope for Leah.\n\nIt is entitled \u201cHero of Faith\u201d. The song, with very powerful lyrics in the semblance of \u201cUSA for Africa\u201d, featuring late hip-hop legend, Michael Jackson and several music stars, is a message of hope, faith in God and a prayer for freedom.\n\nIt captures the mood of concerned individuals on the vulnerability of our children in the face of daunting level of insecurity bedevilling Nigeria.\n\nRecall that it was during a kidnap incident on February 19, 2018, involving 109 Government Girls\u2019 Technical College students, Yobe state, that the heroine of faith -Leah was left behind because she refused to renounce her faith in Christ Jesus. Five of her classmates died in the process while others were later released. Leah has remained in captivity without any effort from authorities to see to her freedom.\n\nFrom Leah Sharibu, to Benjamin Habila of Government Science College, Niger state; and Michael Nnadi of Good Shepherd Seminary Kakau, Kaduna state who were both murdered during terrorists\u2019 onslaught on their schools, the emotion laden song extols the virtue of these heroes who exhibited so much faith and strength in their maker. It is disheartening that government has failed woefully to rescue Leah, the remaining Chibok Girls and many others.\n\nThe song released recently, is performed by Dr Panem Percy Paul, and an international group of musicians including legendary Christian musicians such as Lou Fellingham, Noel Robinson, Sinach, Steph MacLeod etc.\n\nIn the music video, Dr Panem Percy Paul begins his lines with his usual melodious voice; \u201cWho would have thought that the faith of Leah Sharibu, would make a nation struggle for survival, who would have thought that the light from her Bible, would be stronger than the rifle, and make this girl choose to die, than to deny, she is a hero, the hero of faith\u201d\n\nAnd then the chorus goes, \u201cHeros of faith, scares from the battle, is their greatest title, not silver or gold, Heros of faith, their greatest reward, is the cross and the word not riches untold, when all is said and done, their light keep shinning on\u201d. These lines offer a peep into the state of mind of young Leah and Michael Nnadi who even with death staring them in the face, maintained a strong faith in Jesus, reminiscing the Biblical gallant trio of Meshach, Shedrach and Abednego.\n\n\u201cWho would have thought, that four years would go by, the nations would stand by in silence and pretend no wrong was done, who would have thought that no amount of darkness can quench the smallest light, oh daughter of Zion keep shinning on, you are the hero of faith, the hero of faith\u201d, make up the second stanza. It is heart-wrecking that while authorities have paid ransom to terrorists to release their victims, Leah seems to have been forgotten. She is however encouraged to hang on. \u201cOh daughter of Zion keep shinning on, you are the hero of faith\u201d\n\nLines in the third stanza: \u201cSomething about the Lord, His love is His power, and there is no lover, that can give his life and die for His friends, something about the Lord, His Kingdom is forever, He will rule the world with power\u2026\u201d, is proof that irrespective of who is involved, God\u2019s love is for everyone. But surely, evil will slay the wicked!\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu & Fortune Eromosele \u2013 Abuja\n\nA coalition of Civil Society Organisation, CSOs, Joint Action Civil Society Coalition, and Nigeria Mourns Secretariat, Friday, called on President Muhammadu Buhari, to urgently rise and stop incessant killings, bloodletting, and kidnappings across the country.\n\nThe group made the call during a march to the National Assembly, NASS, tagged \u2018A National Day of Mourning and Remembrance for all Victims of Violent Killings Rally\u2019, demanding that justice should be served to those who have lost their lives to terrorists, bandits, and other criminal elements.\n\nThe protesters were clad in black T-shirts, carrying placards with inscriptions such as #NigeriaBleeds #StopTheKillings #EnoughIsEnough #NigerianLivesMatter and #NigeriaMourns.\n\nThe peaceful protesters in their numbers also marched to the Federal Ministry of Justice and National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to register their anger over how the federal government has failed to be proactive in dealing with those who kill and get away with their evil deeds and had also developed boldness and impunity in perpetuating their crime against humanity.\n\nAddressing the protesters, the Country Director, Global Rights, Biodun Baiyewu, blamed the federal government for not responding to the killings of innocent citizens in the country as well as not punishing the perpetrators of violence and terrorism in the nation.\n\nBaiyewu said: \u201cThere is a surge in atrocities against women, children, learners, teachers, and the most vulnerable. Schools and institutions of learning have been targeted for elimination and the government appears to be unable and unwilling to take urgent actions to protect these demographics.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary is vital to ending impunity but today makes it the 52nd day since courts all over Nigeria have been shut down by executive disobedience of court orders on judicial autonomy. While the courts remain shut, there can be no accountability for atrocity violence.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces are deployed in 36 states of Nigeria on internal security operations, thereby retrenching the constitutional role of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). This is a constitutional anomaly.\n\n\u201cThe rise in fatalities from military operations shows that the military is over-stretched, poorly trained for this role and without proper rules of engagement for it. This cannot continue.\n\n\u201cWhile these atrocities continue, the government, rather than enlist citizens in united opposition to it, seeks to divide the country with clear patterns of nepotism and persecution of civic actors and the independent media. Far from helping, these actions deepen the crisis in the country.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Programme Manager, Yiaga Africa, Ibrahim Farouk, lamented that the federal government is not doing enough in ensuring the security of lives and properties.\n\n\u201cAs Civil Societies, it is our role to make sure the government plays their part in governance, therefore we are here to put the federal government on their toes to put a stop to the spate of killings in the country\u201d, Farouk stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the group called on governments at all levels to provide leadership and ensure that the security and welfare of all Nigerians are preserved as enshrined in Section 14 (2 )(b) of the constitution.\n\nIt said, \u201cSince we issued those positions, we have observed what appear to be responses from various levels of government. We note, in particular, the outcome of the meeting of the Southern Governors in Asaba, Delta State, on 11 May 2021 as well as the statements that have emanated from the governors of Kano, Katsina, and Plateau states. We are not unaware of statements also from the presidency in response to the Southern Governors.\n\n\u201cThese responses from the government have been neither sufficient nor adequate to stem the growing violence across the country. In particular, President Buhari remains indifferent to the growing toll of massacres, industrial-scale abductions, and lawless abuse of Nigerians all over the country.\n\n\u201cThis week alone over 130 people were massacred in two separate incidents in Benue and Plateau states, without drawing a response from the president. It continues to appear as if the president is both indifferent to the suffering of Nigerians and unwilling to provide leadership in addressing it.\n\n\u201cAs citizens, we cannot sit by and watch this happen. In 2018, we got together a coalition of concerned citizens to commemorate the lives and sufferings of victims of violence in our country in the first National Day of Mourning. Since then, we have marked 28 May of every year as a National Day of Mourning to remember all those whom we have lost to violence and also show solidarity with their families and communities.\n\n\u201cAs #Nigerianbleeds we have come together on this fourth National Day of Mourning to ask the president to take urgent steps to #securenigeria by addressing these priority areas that we have identified above. There is no time to waste; the time to act is now.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

And how do we integrate them with what is existing already?\n\nWhile describing traditional rulers as critical stakeholders in the implementation of the outcomes of the Summit, Governor Ikpeazu directed chairmen of the 17 LGAs of the state to also take ownership of security within their various geographical coverage.\n\nHe noted that the over-centralization of the security architecture of Nigeria has been counterproductive.\n\nThe number one citizen of Abia also suggested that the office of the National Security Adviser summons trustees of the various cult groups registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to impress on them the need to rein in their youth wings that are terrorizing secondary and tertiary institutions in the country or face sanctions.\n\nIkpeazu commended law enforcement officers in the state for their gallantry but expressed concern over the unchecked movement of armed herdsmen into farms and communities leading to recurring herders-farmers clashes.\n\nHe also noted that the latest robbery incident leading to the loss of the life of security personnel along Mission Hill in Umuahia was a product of the activities of criminal elements who took advantage of the ungoverned space created by the activities of unknown gunmen who are working on destroying existing institutions of civil order.\n\nMeanwhile, a former Chief of Army Staff, General Azubuike Ihejirika (rtd) assured Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of his preparedness and that of his colleagues towards coming up with implementable resolutions that will help address the prevailing security situations in the state.\n\nGeneral Ihejirika while assuring that Abia State has a formidable security council comprising of all security agencies in the state comprising of highly qualified and competent senior law enforcement officials, noted that Abia is sure of improving its security architecture through the roundtable discussions christened Abia security summit.",
          "summary": "The Governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu says his administration is fine-tuning the existing Abia State Vigilante Law to complement efforts of the Abia State Homeland Security in readiness for deployment to strategic security operations.\nIkpeazu reiterated his firm commitment to implementing workable and responsive recommendations for improved security in the state.\n\u201cThe ongoing exercise of flushing out criminals from our forests will be steady until the state gets rid of criminal elements from across our bushes and forests in Abia\u201d.\nThe Abia Governor pointed out that remarkable success has been made in the efforts towards deploying ICT in the fight against crime through the Abia CPAMS Initiative conceptualized to take records of criminals through the use of Apps on internet-enabled phones.\nGeneral Ihejirika while assuring that Abia State has a formidable security council comprising of all security agencies in the state comprising of highly qualified and competent senior law enforcement officials, noted that Abia is sure of improving its security architecture through the roundtable discussions christened Abia security summit.",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nThe Rivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, recently fielded questions from journalists in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nAnd the governor reacted to a recent interview by former governor of Niger State, Dr Babangida Aliyu, saying that some of the allegations made by the ex-Niger governor were directed at him. Excerpt from the encounter.\n\nIn his recent interview, a former governor of Niger State, Dr. Babangida Aliyu, said that you are the cause of the crisis in PDP because you want to be a godfather, or a dictator. Are you a dictator?\n\nThere is no political dictator in Rivers State as far as PDP is concerned. That is why if there is any part of the country that PDP is sure of winning, should there be election today or tomorrow, that state is Rivers. That is not the case of Niger State. Babangida Aliyu is a political liability to PDP. He is not an asset. This is a man who came out to the public to say that he worked against the PDP in 2015. He went ahead to say \u2018we Northern governors worked against President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015\u2019. But people like Jonah Jang of Plateau State and Sule Lamido of Jigawa State came to say it is a lie, we never worked with you against our party. Babangida is what they call a chronic liar, a serial betrayal. So, I am not aware of any problem in my state. If there is, it would be reported and the state leadership will take it up. The same Aliyu Babangida in 2017 was one of those who opposed Uche Secondus to be chairman of the party. Aliyu has no job. Can you see what we are doing here working very hard to see that we do not allow APC in Rivers State. Ask Aliyu Babangida whether he can do the same in Niger State? Today, if they hold election in Niger State, can he make PDP to win in the state? As I talk with you now, no state congress of PDP has been done in Niger State. Niger State is one of the states that have not held congress of the party. Why? It is because of the dictatorial tendencies of Aliyu. The people that the masses want he does not want them. This is the character that you compare with me. All he does is to seek for committee meetings to attend. He has no job. He said he is a PhD holder. What he should have done is to offer himself to a university and say take me I want to contribute to the development of education. But, he will not do that. He has come to become the Spokesman of NWC. A man who betrayed his party. Now he is saying the party should suspend me, I will be happy. It is not to bulge out eyes, what does he have in stock to offer the party? If Aliyu Babangida leaves PDP today, nobody will even bother. But, if I decide to leave the party today, you know its consequences. Upon the PhD he claims he has, he cannot understand English. I did not say all NWC, I said some members of the NWC are acting as tax collectors. Ordinarily, I don\u2019t even have time to talk about Aliyu. When Aliyu was the governor of Niger State, many of you have been to Niger, let him show you one concrete thing he did. All he knows when I invite people to come and commission projects in my state he gets angry that I don\u2019t invite him. Why should I invite him when he does not merit it? In 2015, he was governor, PDP lost woefully. In 2019, PDP lost woefully in the same state, no House of Assembly, no senator, no council chairman, no House of Representatives. What is the impact of such a person to the party? In 2019, even with the federal might against us, we were able to deliver all the assembly seats, all the Senate candidates. So, who is more useful to the party? Is it the person who cannot win his immediate constituency? It is unfortunate. People are working to ensure that PDP takes power in 2023, he is here talking. People like Aliyu Babangida are the moles we have in PDP. He is a mole in PDP. These are people who get information and ignore the vital part of the information. If I say something today against PDP, of course, you know the consequences of that. What I am saying is that he is a political liability to PDP. If I leave PDP, I will win election in any party I join today.\n\nIs there a problem between you and the National Chairman of your party, Uche Secondus?\n\nWe must always disagree. Is that what people see as crisis? When we got to the local government, we said look we can\u2019t continue to be this way; there is need to go the other way in order to carry everybody along. You may agree, you may also disagree. If I have a problem with you, you and I know that I will not hide my feelings, I will tell you. If there is anything tomorrow that Secondus is not doing well I will tell him. Is he God? Everybody who knows me knows that I don\u2019t need to use another person to fight anybody. Just like I am telling you that Aliyu Babangida is a liability and a mole in the PDP. Then I will go and use some other person to say so? There is no one born of a woman that I cannot say that before him. So, you don\u2019t need to insinuate, you know me very well. I am not in the category of Aliyu Babangida; he knows that very well. If he is telling me that I have problem with Secondus, well Secondus has not come to the state to tell us that we have problem. If we have problem, we say, yes.\n\nDo you think that the National Working Committee of PDP is actually playing the roles expected of a party in opposition?\n\nMany people have said that it is very clear that it is easy for the PDP to take over in 2023. We have heard it. We said look, our party is not playing the real opposition role they are supposed to play. I don\u2019t need to wait for this Federal Government to do something before we start criticizing, I don\u2019t need to wait. I am not speaking for the party. I speak as somebody who is in opposition. It is left for the party to say whether our national working committee is doing well. You are the public. Assuming I come out to say they are not doing well, you will say because I have interest somewhere. It is left for you, the observers, to say whether we are doing well or not as opposition party. It\u2019s you! If I say we are not doing well, it is easy to say he is not in tune with them. It is you what will judge. You will judge where PDP is doing well as opposition. I cannot set examination for myself as well mark it.\n\nAre you in support of the vote of confidence passed in the NWC by the party\u2019s Board of Trustee (BoT)?\n\nNow, that is what you see when people don\u2019t even know anything. What does the constitution of PDP provide for? That was an emergency meeting. Where is vote of confidence coming from? A vote of confidence you have to send motion to people and then it will appear on agenda of the meeting. You don\u2019t call for an emergency meeting, probably to pass a budget, for example, and you begin to pass vote of confidence. It is the handiwork of the same Aliyu Babangida, who will always come to meeting first to sit in the front. If the meeting is at 4:00p.m, he will come at 2:00p.m, so that he will sit in front to bulge out his eyes. If I was in that meeting and there was such an application, I would have said don\u2019t do this, what is the vote of confidence for? That people made allegation, so what. Who are those that made this allegation? Call them, why are you making such allegations? Don\u2019t you know you are embarrassing our party? You don\u2019t rush things. When something happens, there is panic in you, let us do this, and that is why we will continue to make mistakes.\n\nDo you think Aliyu has the capacity to boast that the PDP would reclaim Ebonyi and Cross River states?\n\nNow, he is talking about PDP will recover Ebonyi and Cross Rivers states. What will be his contribution? What is the strategy for them to recover it? A man, who even in his place cannot provide votes is telling you that PDP will recover; recover your own first. Show the capacity first. You will first of all recover your own first. I can say so, because people have seen it. I don\u2019t think if in his own state federal might had come the way it came here that he would even get two votes; he would have run away. But, I stood there. Nigerians saw everything that happened. I can say, Cross Rivers State and Ebonyi are PDP states, PDP will take them back. Why will I say so because I know what is on ground. He does not know what is on ground. It is not to talk for people to hear you talking. Go and conduct congress in your state. In 2019, what happened to him? He insisted that his boy would be the governor and PDP lost. Who is then a dictator? Up till now, the state congress cannot take place because they want to dictate who becomes chairman of the party. You can now imagine a pot calling kettle black. Look at me I am the governor of Rivers State. If tomorrow I say I want to leave the party, for instance, I am not like any other people you think of, no. I am not a sycophant. I will tell you how I feel about it. The day I say I want to fight anybody in PDP, I will come out and fight the person. I am not going to hide. I will come out. I don\u2019t hide under any umbrella. For what?\n\nDon\u2019t you think there is a need for an appraisal of your party\u2019s NWC instead of calling for its removal?\n\nAliyu should be man enough to say that this person is calling for the removal of the NWC. Who did that person call? Was he one of those persons that was called? If I say, for example, that an officer is not doing well, or you are corrupt. Is that his interpretation of saying they should get rid of NWC? For grace sake, if anybody says NWC should be removed, the person should give reason, why it should be so. And there is nothing wrong if somebody holds such opinion and we can begin to justify that opinion. That is what they call democracy. He is not man enough. It is not to wear \u2018agbada\u2019 that makes you a man. What makes a man is coming out to speak your mind before anybody in the morning, afternoon and in the night. What you say in the morning, should be what you say in the afternoon and night. Not when you say this in the morning, tomorrow you wear another \u2018agbada\u2019 and change your position. In the night you wear jeans, you change. That is the kind of character Aliyu Babangida is. In everything you do you examine and re-examine. Even as a government, you do appraisal. Where have we not done well, where have we done well. That helps you to move on. As I am speaking today, we have given timetable of the activities we are to do. We will give account of stewardship at the end of the day. Having given that stewardship, we will have to reappraise ourselves. In education, are there things we did not do that we ought to do. In health, have we done well compared to where we were. In infrastructure, where are we today, where were we yesterday. If anybody calls for reappraisal of the NWC today, it does not mean that the person does not want the party to move forward. In fact, the person, who says let\u2019s have appraisal of what they have done, should be given credit. Aliyu Babangida is doing that because he thinks that the NWC will give him the chairmanship of the party at the state level, which he cannot win. So, he has to do anything to manoeuvre. To be sychophantic is not to be a servant. You said he is a servant? If he has been using that to deceive people, go to Niger State and see the level of development under Aliyu Babangida. Remember that in 2015, the same Aliyu Babangida was one of those going round to bring down PDP and, of course, he was happy he did that. Today, look at the consequences. That is the kind of man that has the temerity, the audacity to talk to a governor, whose state produced the highest vote for the party in 2015; 1.5 million votes. The ruling party never had 25 per cent in Rivers State. In 2019, the same state provided the highest vote for PDP, and the APC did not get 25 per cent. Ask Aliyu Babangida, the man that failed, whether we got 25 per cent in Niger State. Look at us making PDP proud everyday. That the PDP is surviving in this country is because of us, the governors. So, what makes your party to win is by providing the dividends of democracy. You see, he is now in Abuja. He cannot even go home. I challenge him, let him go and do congress in his state. He only attends every NEC meeting. When the meeting is by 3:00p.m he comes by 1:00p.m. He doesn\u2019t like staying at the back, he stays in front. They call him Aliyu Babangida, PhD, then he is talking like a small boy.\n\nDo you have a presidential ambition or do you want to be a vice president?\n\nWhen somebody has an ambition, you must see him going from one place to another. Have you ever seen me? I have challenged all of them, if I want to run for presidency nobody can stop me. Nobody. They are so timid. They are so intimidated. Sometimes you hear that he is running for vice president, does anybody run for vice president? Sometimes, they query themselves, this his performance why is he doing it? This is his second tenure. If it is not for presidency why must he be performing like this? Is performance only for the first tenure? What kind of a country are we? Was I elected only for first tenure? I have not told anybody I want to be president. Like I hear Aliyu that does not have strength that I want to be a godfather. Godfather to whom? Aliyu was bold to say that he worked against President Goodluck Jonathan and you still allow such a character to be in your highest decision-making body. It is unfortunate.\n\nWith all these attacks from some leaders of your party, are you still committed to rebuilding the PDP?\n\nIf I am a member of the party, to show that I am one, commitment must be there. Just like when Benue and Bauchi states had some crises, as a man, who loves the party, I said, look we can\u2019t be here and allow the crises because that will affect the chances of the party. I came out and said to them, gentlemen, we will resolve the problem. But, Aliyu from the North Central, never called the governor of Benue to see how that matter would be resolved with the governor of Bauchi. That is why I said when these things happen, it makes them happy because they are moles in the party. If they truly believe in PDP, why will they not continue to work for the party? So, why am I in the party? If I am not in the party, then, I will not work. But, if I am in the party, I will work.\n\nHow do you react to Aliyu\u2019s statement that you are trying to control the party by throwing money around because your state has the money?\n\nThat is to tell you his level of stupidity, with all due respect. I did know him as an auditor. He is so empty. You try to support the party he said you have money to buy the party. I am not the first governor of Rivers State under PDP. But he should also know that when PDP was nearly killed, he was running around Sheriff and the rest of them. That has been his lifestyle. What is the money? Have I gone to him one day to offer him money to do this for me. Okay, we have agreed, since he doesn\u2019t have money, let him run the party and let us see where the party will go to. I cannot be in a political party and I cannot support the party. If I am in PDP, I will continue to support PDP. But people like Aliyu for Christ\u2019s sake, what does he have to offer the party? Is it to come and show how big your eyes are. Will that make PDP to win election? What is his strategy for PDP in Niger State and Nigeria to win election? Let him come and I will challenge him to a debate on how PDP can win election. If I call him tomorrow now to come and commission project in the state, will he not come? I will send him global express now he will run down. But, I will not invite him because he did not do anything in Niger State. He does not qualify as somebody I should invite to commission projects because he never had any project. With due respect I invite those who offer something to their states. How did he come to be governor? A civil servant. Who didn\u2019t know how he became governor of Niger State. Some people should stop thinking that because they have some privileges that they are special people. What special people are they? Who is Aliyu Babangida, who is he? In the politics of this country, who is he?\n\nAliyu also suggested that you want Secondus out of the way to enable you produce your successor?\n\nOh, my God! Can Secondus produce my successor? What kind of talk is that? Is Secondus trying to produce my own successor? Am I going to produce his own successor? So, that is what they have been planning. So, Secondus told him that I want him out, so that I will produce my successor. So, if Secondus is there, I cannot produce my successor, how will he do it? I think he should not put PDP into trouble. They want to sit down in Abuja and produce my successor. Where will they come and campaign? They will campaign in Abuja. Which venue in Rivers State will they campaign? The Wike you know, just tell me the truth, how will they survive it? How many of them have been to a political war before? Is it to stay in Abuja and talk? What I will give you, you will run. They will be in the hospital because their BP (Blood Pressure) will be very high. How can you talk about successor? I have said I will not impose anybody on Rivers people. I have said that. If I say I will not do that which national chairman will do that, who is the person? How can anybody dream of that? I don\u2019t think Secondus told him that; I don\u2019t think so. Is it me that is an asset to PDP. Compare me and Aliyu, who will PDP take? They should try it and see whether they will not lose 60 per cent. So, don\u2019t talk about Aliyu saying this. He is a noise-maker. He is a perpetual blackmailer, that is how he survives. No work for him now. He should better take his PhD to go and lecture students and be happy.\n\nWhat do you make of the Saraki\u2019s reconciliation committee?\n\nAliyu Babangida is an empty head. Bukola Saraki and Shema, former governor of Bauchi State, came to see me on Friday and they left on Saturday and a liability is talking that the NWC should have suspended me. Such characters are they the ones that can help PDP? Okay, I have now surrendered myself; so, tell NWC now, ask police to come. If they do it, I will be very happy that some of the burdens are now out. I have confidence not like that liability in Niger State causing unnecessary distractions.\n\nWhat is your take on the issue of zoning?\n\nI can\u2019t air my views now. If I do, what will I say when I go to the meeting? I will not air my view now. I don\u2019t owe anybody. I will speak my mind anyday, anytime. I am not slave to anybody. So, I speak my mind that is who I am. There is nothing this government has not done to me. So, who am I going to be afraid of?",

          "title": "Nigeria heavily challenged \u2013 Olisa Agbakoba (SAN)",
          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nHuman rights activist, legal giant, and former President of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Mr Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) is worried on how Nigeria is drifting by the day.\n\nHe,therefore, warned that unless very urgent actions are taken, Nigerians may not have a country to call their own again.\n\nIn his bold and courageous manner, he blamed this on leadership failure while pointing out the way forward.\n\nHe spoke with Sunday Sun in an exclusive interview. Excerpt:\n\nMost analysts have come up with a damning conclusion that Nigeria is now a failed state. What is the true position given your legal background?\n\nWell, I can only refer to the index that is published on an annual basis by the Freedom House and it is entitled: \u201cThe Index of fragile states\u201d and out of about 200 countries, Nigeria is about 14, so that is the status of the nature of Nigeria\u2019s ranking by hopefully, independent neutrals who use certain criteria to determine how fragile a state is or can be. That is where Nigeria ranks. Across, we see in Nigeria a lot of tension around the question of insecurity across the country. In the Northeast you have Boko Haram, in the Northwest is the question of kidnappings and banditry, in the Southwest, not much of insecurity, but a stir in large scale of unemployment, something like about 70 million Nigerians are technically unemployed or unemployable, so that is a vulnerable and willing mass of people that can be deployed for misbehaviour, in the Southeast, there is a question of IPOB and the sovereignty issues around Biafra, in the North-central there is the herdsmen and the farmers\u2019 issue, in the South-south, the issue of environmental degradation has been replaced by the world\u2019s most dangerous seas. Nigeria is now number 1 as the most dangerous area of piracy, as rated by the International Maritime Bureau. So this is already a cocktail of insecurity and it is something that I think that the government needs to tackle very seriously and whether they are doing that effectively has been the subject of public debate. I think the governors of the South who had a meeting recently have shown how serious the issues are if they are calling for state police so that they can better control their security apparatus. On the whole, one will say that Nigeria is very heavily challenged.\n\nNigeria seems to be at a tipping point. Where do you locate the mistakes that brought us to this sour situation?\n\nLeadership, yes, leadership is the main problem and Chinua Achebe has said that in his book \u201cThe trouble with Nigeria\u201d. Leadership is the reason we have been in trouble. This is because leadership means recognizing and diagnosing issues and resolving them promptly. If you allow matters to fester, for instance, the nature of Nigeria\u2019s federal structure has festered for not less than 20 years and each government creates a National Conference without resolving the problem. And so it is carried from Obasanjo to Yar\u2019Adua to Jonathan and it\u2019s still unresolved, so it means we have been living in a process that has not been stabilized and when that process is not stabilized the likelihood of releasing our fullest potential will be affected.\n\nDo you think that with restructuring but still with bad leadership controlling the clutches of power that we can still get it right?\n\nNo, no, no, not at all, we wouldn\u2019t. I have always said to the annoyance of those who feel that I should be a core restructurist that restructuring alone is not enough. There is a lot more than restructuring and they ask me: \u201cWhat more?\u201d There is the leadership, there is the maturity and sagacity of the political parties, there is the honest intents of even Nigerians, the followers, etc, there are a lot that you put on the table to release the sort of energy that will make Nigeria turn around, but if the thinking is that merely to restructure, it will resolve the problems, that is a big, huge joke, it wouldn\u2019t. if you look at the governors who are calling for restructuring, generally in the states the level of bad governance is very high because they stifle the local governments, and when they stifle the local governments, the base of Nigeria where people live they create problems there too. I don\u2019t live in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I live in Lagos State, the Federal Republic of Nigeria is just an expression. I can\u2019t say I live in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, but I can say, I live in Lagos State and I live in Eti-Osa Local Government, so it is Eti-Osa Local Government that influences the quality of my life. So, if local governments are stifled around Nigeria and they cannot deliver services, then there is a big problem. So, restructuring has nothing to do with providing autonomy for local governments to deliver basic services on refuse collection, education, inspection of hospitals to make sure people are not dying there, water supply, roads, etc, these are the little things expected from the local governments. So, if already governors are not able to allow freedom of say, the judiciary and the parliaments in their states, why will restructure suddenly be a magic wand to change things? So, that is not correct. Leadership, I think is crucial in how Nigeria can go forward.\n\nIf you look at your political zone, the Southeast area seems to be boiling. Can you hazard out what exactly is building up?\n\nThe perception of exclusion and marginalisation is fuelling the impetus for political instability. In any process where the family excludes one brother, he is not invited to the table to take part in the meal then he will go away feeling unwanted and the tendency to misbehave is high, so there is a strong feeling that the Southeast has not been at the centre and has not taken part in the collaborative process of what\u2019s going on in Nigeria, in particular, the question of Igbo presidency or not. Such neglect or exclusion fuels people who feel that the time has come to be out of Nigeria, that they want to be Biafrans. But the tension between those who want to remain in Nigeria like me and those who want to leave creates the necessary frictions that you see and recall I told you that the high level of unemployment means that it is very easy to mobilise a troop of people willing to cause grievous harm, so that\u2019s the reason the Southeast is boiling \u2013 the perception of the people that they are excluded in the scheme of things.\n\nYou just mentioned the issue of presidency of Igbo extraction. Do you think it\u2019s feasible in 2023?\n\nI am not a prophet so I cannot tell whether it will be feasible, but I think the more important question beyond whether a president of Igbo extraction is a possibility is the need for political stability because if you don\u2019t have a country then talking about a president from any part of the zones is meaningless. So, I think the more important question now will be: \u201cHow we can pull back and ensure that there is political stability across the six zones that are now engaged in serious insecurity and conflict so that we can have a peaceful transition from President Buhari to whatever president that will take over in 2023\u201d, but if it is not possible then where a president comes from becomes irrelevant. So, I think the more important question between now (2021) and the next one year (2022) will be the real need to resolve all the communal tensions that we are looking at. There is a need to engage very seriously, all the conflict flashpoints, some of them, of course, involve the issue of restructure, we need to identify the problems and resolve them because where problems are unresolved you can\u2019t carry out political or economic activity. So, I will hope that the call by the governors of the South should be a rallying point for beginning to resolve the clear insecurity situation that we are faced, it\u2019s very vital, we have less than 12 months to do that, that is the timeline.\n\nDo you see this government having the capacity to undertake what you are recommending?\n\nI am not sure it is about President Buhari or this government, it is about the collective responsibility of leadership around PDP, APC, in particular, because these are the parties that are struggling for power and in the struggle for power they must put Nigeria first. If both parties agree to resolve all these issues we see around us, 80 per cent of the problem is resolved because President Buhari is part of a political party, so I don\u2019t separate the party from the government process. All the 36 governors have a role, that is why I identify the role that governors can play in resolving the crisis, it\u2019s very important. It is not just one government, it is the 36 governments and the federal government, and the political parties put together. In addition to this will also be the role of traditional institutions, religious institutions, etc, they have a role; they can\u2019t stand back because when things go bad it consumes everybody. The traditional and religious institutions must be involved, between the traditional institutions and religious institutions, largely have more membership than the parties combined and they have a lot of influence, so they must have a voice, everybody must be part of this national peace process where we will address the conflict flashpoints in an honest and genuine way. So whatever the grievance that we have, we put it on the table and see how it can be resolved and they are so many of them as I said earlier, restructuring, of course, is one of them, good leadership is another one, governance, economic development, the question of poverty, unemployment, etc, they are many issues. There is a whole cocktail of issues that are bogging Nigeria down and then what you see blow out is the Boko Haram, IPOB, Sea piracy, kidnappings, banditry etc, these are the side effects of the huge problem. So, all this insecurity is the effect of a failure of leadership. If the leaders, both state leaders and non-state leaders agree to work together, that is where the intention must be channeled, if they agree that there is a problem here then the problem can be resolved. But if everyone stays in his own ethnic or religious corner there will be no resolution.\n\nYou are also talking about coming together like a conference to deliberate on the issues, but Nigeria has had a lot of conferences, including that of 2014 National Confab during President Jonathan adjudged to be comprehensive and on consensus in submissions. How optimistic that another conference will be taken seriously?\n\nAgain, I am not a prophet, I don\u2019t know, but it is like a medical doctor looking at a patient and saying, here is what you need to do because these are the things I find wrong in you, whether you now follow my prescription is up to you, so the problem with Nigeria is that there has been a lot of talking, we know what the problems are, but the energy to resolve them has been the problem and, therefore, I don\u2019t say, it\u2019s the president, the onus is on everybody because religious and traditional institutions are part of Nigeria, they are also part of the elite, so they cannot abdicate their role, we need to hear them speak up more strongly, they are not doing that. Even the business community we need to hear all of them speak up louder because it is when they speak up that the governors who are the head of political leadership listen and say oh there is a problem, but if they are silent and nobody is talking then there isn\u2019t that realization that things are very bad. I want to hear our traditional rulers, our religious leaders speak to the problems more forcefully and more urgently, it\u2019s very important. They must speak truth to power.\n\nYou and some members of your group like Femi Falana (SAN) are coming up with a new movement. What new things are you people bringing on board as to give hope to Nigerians?\n\nIt\u2019s almost these things that I have just been describing; how we can mobilise the political elite into a consensus of saying, here is what the problems are and these are the solutions that we feel that we can offer. So, part of what we are doing is to assist to identify some of the constitutional constraints in the 1999 Constitution and then to suggest how if those constraints are removed it might make the process more settled. For instance, the question of state police, if we have only one central police force there is no way the IG of Police can superintend Nigeria, it has shown to be impossible, which was why you now have regional security networks. So, it will make more sense if governors of states have the power to administer the security situation in their states. I think it will promote peace and good order. So, those are some of the things that we are calling for. We also talk about the need to resolve the large unemployment problem because if you have unemployed people you have angry people and you have people who can easily get into misbehaviour. It is a problem that Nigerian state needs to tackle. These are the sort of things that we put on the table for consideration by those who can take the actual decisions because we feel it is best to say these things than keep quiet. That potentially is the role we are playing.\n\nHow will you rate President Buhari leadership so far having been there for six years?\n\nThe challenge is that the Nigerian federation is crippled with inconsistency and it is those inconsistencies that trap the ability of the government to deliver. So, I am not so keen to say, how do I rate the government as in asking the question of what can be done to improve governance. The problems of ethnicity, the problems of religion are so dividing us that the outcomes we see are not unexpected because we have refused to place the issue of governance and the constraints before us and tackle them. It is like if you have bad roads and you drive the bad road in your car and the car is damaged. You do not blame the car, but you should talk about the bad roads, so the Nigerian situation is so terribly crippled that the possibility of any good outcome is so difficult. Electricity is not there, water is not there, there are no jobs, there are no roads, etc. The question is why are these things playing out? It is playing out because we cannot look towards a national identity, everybody is in an ethnic enclave and that has impeded the ability of any leader to responsibly deliver the dividends of democracy. So, if we keep asking the wrong question, what is the scoring of government? I will rather ask the other question; let us fix our problems. Do you know how many years this has been going on? Bola Ige asked a question and I sent it on the platform. There is nothing wrong in calling your wife in a meeting to say: \u201cThis union of ours is not working, so let us separate.\u201d Those are the hard questions we need to ask. Bola Ige said there are two questions. First, do we want to be in one Nigeria? If yes, how? If no, how do we amicably split? That is the central question, if we don\u2019t answer it we can never have good governance. That is what has pinned us down. What we have in Nigeria today is certainly not working because there is no common national objective. If we are 11 football players on the pitch with different strategies to play the game, they will lose, so we need to forge a common identity, so rather than pretend, we need to ask ourselves do we really want to be in one country? That is the central question if we answer yes, then the second question will be: In what form? So, that different parts of the country will put their grievances on the table and issues are amicably resolved.",

          "title": "I\u2019ve never had a crush on a colleague -Jane Obi, actress",
          "text": "By Rita Okoye\n\nBeautiful actress, Jane Obi, has come a long way. As a greenhorn, she had been on location from morning till night without food and money only to end up losing her role to another person.\n\nShe switched from acting to producing, but it has not been a bed of roses.\n\nIn this interview, Obi narrates how she became depressed and almost gave up until help came her way. Enjoy it.\n\nHow did you cope with the COVID-19 restrictions?\n\nThe restrictions are still there, but not so strict. However, I produced two movies last year just before the pandemic. I was targeting ROK TV for one and the other for Africa Magic, but as you know, everything went on hold. It was really frustrating because I intended shooting and selling outright.\n\nHow has the journey evolved from acting to producing, was it an easy one?\n\nIt is still a work in progress. The movies are not yet out. Being a producer is another level that I wish to explore, but definitely it\u2019s not an easy one.\n\nWhat were your challenges as a greenhorn in Nollywood?\n\nThe major challenge was working and not getting paid. Although, it was one or two scenes then, most times you stayed morning till night without food and money. There was a time I went for an audition and passed the first and second stages. I got the role and was invited to come on set one morning. I was so excited and I decided to get there so early. I stayed from morning till 6:00p.m, and when it got to my turn to shoot, suddenly a girl appeared from nowhere and I was asked to remove the costume and give to her. The director said it was order from above. Later, I learnt the executive producer had sent her. That day, I went home hungry and with nothing. I cried for over a week, you can\u2019t imagine the pain I went through.\n\nAfter this experience, what kept you going?\n\nI almost gave up at that time. I felt maybe this wasn\u2019t for me. I was depressed. But one day, I came across Uche Jombo\u2019s interview where she talked about how a director humiliated her and she vowed to make it not just as an actor, but also a producer. That conversation pulled me out of depression. I have not met Uche Jombo, but I know I will meet her someday and let her know she was the reason I didn\u2019t give up.\n\nLooking back, do you have any regrets?\n\nNo regrets, I\u2019ve just learnt some lessons and had necessary experiences.\n\nWere there some roles you wished you didn\u2019t play back then?\n\nI didn\u2019t play many roles back then, but they all prepared me for where I am today.\n\nWhat were your parents reactions to your choice of career?\n\nIt was a no, no for my mum initially, but at some point, she understood that being on screen doesn\u2019t make me promiscuous. I see her smile now every time she watches my movies or receives compliments from people about me. She keeps calling to get the name of any new movie I do.\n\nWould you say the kind of childhood you had prepared you for this?\n\nNo way! It was the opposite. I come from a disciplined Christian home and I was raised to just finish school, get married and be a good wife. But I wanted more from life. I feel a woman\u2019s highest achievement shouldn\u2019t be just a good wife and mother; women can be great too. I want to inspire young ones to grow up the way I did, to realize on time that they can be more and should aspire to be more.\n\nDid you at some point experience sexual harassment? If yes, how did you deal with it?\n\nSexual harassment is something every young, pretty girl can\u2019t really escape from, both in and outside the industry. I just try not to expose myself to it. I avoid anything that might put me in such condition. I just take it one step at a time. I have never really been desperate for anything. However, in a world like ours, you can never be too careful, but I will prefer not to call anyone out.\n\nHow have you been handling society and family pressure to get married?\n\nCan that ever be handled? The pressure is seriously there both from family and society. My key is determination and focus. One thing I have promised myself is that I will get married, but in my own time and to the right person. I am not going to allow the pressure push me. Although, sometimes I wonder if there is ever going to be the right time or right person (for marriage). I mean what\u2019s the guarantee that after waiting I will make the right choice? There is no formula in life, so I leave it in God\u2019s hand to make it right in his own time.\n\nSo, you\u2019re are still officially single, no boyfriend, no dating?\n\nYes! I am officially single.\n\nAside acting, what else do you do?\n\nActing is a very jealous profession that shouldn\u2019t be combined with any other thing. But in a country like ours, you definitely need lots of side hustles. I am an entrepreneur-in-general.\n\nWhat are your career projections?\n\nI want to be a great filmmaker someday and give soft landing to young ones. I admire great women like Mary Remy Njoku, what she is doing with ROK TV is amazing and inspiring. Funke Akindele is superb, and then Kemi Adetiba is setting standard. They all inspire me greatly.\n\nIf given an opportunity, what would you change in Nollywood?\n\nOne major thing I would like to change in Nollywood is market and finance. Nollywood really needs investors and a strong governing body. A few filmmakers mostly in Lagos are doing big movies with big budgets, and they go to cinema and Netflix, leaving the local markets for the low budget filmmakers. But what if we join forces in such a way that high budget movies, after selling in big screens, still get to local markets?\n\nHave you ever had a crush on a colleague?\n\nI\u2019ve never had a crush on a colleague. It\u2019s always business as usual to me.\n\nDo you see yourself marrying from the entertainment industry?\n\nThere is no formula or any particular process for that in life. If the universe designs that, then who am I to say no?\n\nWhat turns you on or off in relationship?\n\nFor me, disrespectful and insecure guys are a huge turnoff. Paying attention does it for me. I don\u2019t think I can marry a much older man; I want someone to grow up with me.\n\nOn what condition would you accept to be a second or third wife?\n\nI can\u2019t imagine the condition for that yet.\n\nWould you say you were born with a silver spoon?\n\nI wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon. My mum is a teacher and my late father was a businessman.",

          "text": "\u2022El Rufai: Bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives\n\n\u2022We paid N180 million, received no help from govt, say parents\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nAll the remaining abducted students of the Greenfield University, Kaduna, have been released after spending harrowing 40 days in captivity, the authorities of Greenfield University, confirmed this in a statement last night.\n\nThe registrar of the University, Mr. Mohammed Bashir, in the said statement stated that all the remaining students and non academic staff that were abducted by the bandits were released and had been reunited with their families.\n\nAlso, confirming the news, the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai assured the studentsthat, \u201cthe bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives, as he wished them well for the future.\u201d\n\nBut some of the parents of the released students have expressed disappointment in the government at all levels for allegedly leaving them to their fate, saying they had to cough out a whopping N180 million to the bandits before they released their children.\n\nHowever, part of the statement by Greenfield stated thus: \u201cAs you are aware that on Tuesday, April 20th, 2021 armed bandits attacked Greenfield University and abducted 20 students and three non academic staff. Five out of the abducted students and a Male warden were grossly murdered by the bandits.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that, today, being Saturday, May 29, 2021 that all the remaining students and non academic staff have been released by the bandits and they have already been reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Board of Trustees, University Council, Management, Staff and Students of our university, we wish to thank all Nigerians and well wishers all over the world for standing by us during this trying times\u201d.\n\nBandits had on April 18 invaded the university located along the dreaded Kaduna-Abuja road about 8:30pm and abducted 23 students. Few days after the abduction, the bandits, who had demanded N800 million as ransom, killed five of the students, when negotiations were still going on.\n\nOn April 23, the bandits killed three of the students, five days after their abduction. Their remains were found in Kwanan Bature village, close to the university. On April 26, two more students were killed and security personnel recovered their corpses in the bush.\n\nOne of the parents was said to have paid a ransom of N20 million for the release of her son.\n\nOn its part, the Kaduna State Government said in a statement by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, \u201cThe kidnapped students of the Greenfield University, who had been held hostage by armed bandits, have been released by their abductors.\n\n\u201cThis was reported to the Kaduna State Government by security agencies. According to the reports, about 2pm today, Saturday, the hostages were found released along the Kaduna-Abuja road. Fourteen persons were released in total, comprising students and staff.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that they were abducted by armed bandits in April and had been in captivity since then. Five students were gruesomely killed by the bandits in the period.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufai welcomed the news of the students\u2019 release, and conveyed solace and encouragement to them following their harrowing ordeal.\n\n\u201cHe assured them that the bitterness of the last few weeks, now over, would set the backdrop for positive achievements in their lives, as he wished them well for the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in a short video that went viral last night, two of the parents of the abducted children, a man and a woman, who were bitter about their experience so far despite the release of their children confirmed that they paid some N180 million before the release that was later celebrated by government and security agencies.\n\nThe parents, who alleged neglect by the government both confirmed that neither the state nor the federal government participated in the process that led to the release of the children, particularly, that the security agencies refused to help in whatever form of shape.\n\n\u201cN180 million, that\u2019s what we paid; that\u2019s what they collected. One hundred and eighty million, that is they collected from us \u2013 from the parents without the help of a government. None of the government officials that has come to our aid since the 20th of April that they took these children. No single one policeman that the government has released to go after them,\u201d the male parent told a reporter, shortly after the children were released.\n\nSimilarly, spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, Mohammad Jalige, also confirmed the release of the 14 students, when contacted by telephone. Jalige, who said the students were released Saturday evening, added that three of them were still being held.\n\n\u201cYes, 14 of the students of the Greenfield University were released from captivity this evening (Saturday), remaining three of them still in captivity,\u201d Jalige explained. He did not give details of the students\u2019 release and why three were still being held.\n\nWhen contacted, Registrar of the university, Mr. Mohammed Bashir, said he was busy and promised to confirm later. \u201cYes, we are still on it. I am very busy right now. You can call me back later to confirm,\u201d Bashir said by telephone.\n\nOne Sani Idris Jalingo, who claimed to be the leader of the bandits that abducted the students, had in an interview with the Voice of America (VOA), Hausa Service, on May 3, threatened to kill the students if a ransom of N100 million in addition to 10 new Honda motorcycles were not provided the following day.Jalingo had disclosed during the interview that the families of the abducted students paid N55 million.\n\nHowever, in a statement on May 14, the spokesman of parents of the students, Mr. Marcus Zarmai, said the parents contributed N60 million as ransom for the release of the students but failed to secure their release.\n\nAfter series of negotiations, the bandits were said to have demanded the sum of N10 million from each of the parents of the students for their release.\n\nIt could not be immediately established how much each parent paid for the release of the students and why three of them are still in captivity.\n\nThirty-nine students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna, had also be kidnapped on March 11 in a similar manner, when bandits invaded their school about 11: 30pm. The last batch of 27 of the students was released about two weeks ago after spending 56 days in captivity. Their parents were said to have paid millions of naira before they were released.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Troops kill 17 insurgents, IPOB members in Borno, Rivers\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, said yesterday that the armed forces would not relent in their onslaught against terrorists until the enemies of the Nigerian state were defeated. Irabor said despite the risk of paying the supreme price, the security personnel remained unrelenting in their resolve to keep the peace in Nigeria and deal with the security challenges facing the country.\n\nHis position came as troops killed 17 insurgents and members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Borno and Rivers states.\n\nAddressing a group, God Bless Nigeria, which organised a solidarity march to the Defence Headquarters complex in Abuja, the defence chief vowed that enemies of the state would be brought to their knees.\n\nThe marchers carried banners with the inscription, \u201cArmed Forces Appreciation Day\u201d, in support of the country\u2019s security forces.\n\nThe defence chief, who was represented by the Director, Defence Information (DDI), Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said the military was committed to defeating the adversaries.\n\nNwachukwu stated while receiving the group, \u201cI welcome the God Bless Nigeria group on behalf of the Chief of Defence Staff, service chiefs and the entire military. We thank this very important group for taking time to appreciate the armed forces of Nigeria, to appreciate the conduct of operations we are carrying out around the country and the sacrifices our men are making in the conduct of those operations.\n\n\u201cRound the clock, our troops are engaged. We are not resting on our oars because we want to surmount this contemporary security challenges even though we are to pay the supreme price.\n\n\u201cWe can, of course, take a cue from what happened recently when the late Chief of Army Staff and a group officers were on a visit to Depot Nigerian Army (Kaduna) when they had the unfortunate mishap.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cLives were lost, families were orphaned, wives are widowed. We are paying expensively to ensure that we have peace in this country.\n\n\u201cI want to seize the opportunity on behalf of the Chief of Defence Staff and the leadership of the armed forces to assure Nigerians that we will not rest on our oars until we bring our adversaries to their knees.\u201d\n\nEarlier, spokesman of the God Bless Nigeria group, Mr Eric Ogolo, said, \u201cNo duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. We have come together to express our profound gratitude for the sacrifices, contributions, strength and commitment that you all display every single day.\n\n\u201cWhenever this country calls, you all are the ones who answer, no matter the circumstance, no matter the danger, no matter the sacrifice, and this you do with high morale.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian armed forces is not only our pride but also our super heroes, who fight all those hostile enemies, both external and internal.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, just hours into the tenure of the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, Boko Haram fighters attempted an audacious attack on troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Rann, the headquarters of Kala Balge Local Government Area of Borno State. An army statement said the terrorists came in their numbers with gun trucks and attempted to infiltrate the main entrance to the town.\n\nThe statement signed by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Mohammed Yerima, said, \u201cThe highly spirited troops were right on hand to counter the move and inflicted humiliating defeat on the terrorists who abandoned their evil mission and took to their heels.\n\n\u201cThe troops chased the retreating terrorist and ensured there was no further threat to the town and its residents. Troops successfully destroyed one of the gun trucks and recovered multiple weapons, including one anti aircraft gun, two machine guns and eight AK-47 rifles, neutralising 10 terrorists in the process.\u201d\n\nIn Port Harcourt, troops of 6 Division Garrison, Port Harcourt, and 29 Battalion in conjunction with operatives of Nigeria Police, Directorate of State Services (DSS), and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) conducted a clearance/raid operation at suspected IPOB/ESN enclaves at Agbomchia Forest along Pipeline Road, Ogali/Komkom Boundary, between Eleme and Oyigbo local government areas of Rivers State.\n\nAn army statement said, \u201cIn the fire fight that ensued during the clearance/raid operation, seven IPOB/ESN members were neutralised while five suspects arrested.\u201d\n\nIt also said, \u201cVarious items belonging to the criminals, including arms and ammunition, were also recovered by the security forces. The camp was promptly destroyed while suspects and corpses were handed over to the police for further action.\n\n\u201cThere was no casualty on own troops and other security operatives as they have returned back to base in high morale.\u201d\n\nThe army urged members of the public to help the troops with accurate and timely information that would assist them in tracking down and neutralising the criminal elements.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The argument, the source said, was that an election from ward to states and eventually, national convention in the party would further divide the party at a time when it should be consolidating in the states\n\nIt was against this backdrop that some committee members, albeit with the consent Buni were considering presenting to the NEC that he should rather resign as governor and continue at the national convention, where he would be affirmed as the substantive national chairman of the party.\n\nThe source hinted that Buni did not spend up to four days a week in the state as he stays in Abuja most of the time..\n\nBefore winning the election to become the governor of Yobe State, he was the national secretary of APC, when Adams Oshiomhole was the national chairman.\n\nAlthough this has not been tabled before the NEC, members of the party, who should know were already protesting against the idea of members self-perpetuating themselves under any guise. Some of the members that did not want be quoted said they had concluded plans to seek legal action against any plans by the committee members to self-perpetuate in office\n\nAnother member told THISDAY that the Buni committee had already overstayed its welcome.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cWe were appointed to right the wrongs of Adams Oshiomhole, but this idea of not announcing the dates for the wards, local government, states and national convention.\n\nAnything outside announcing the dates of the national convention and other dates for the states congresses is outside our mandate. If by the next month, there is no date announced for the elections, I will speak out and also resign. What is happening is not our mandate.\n\n\u201cWe were appointed in June 2020 and our mandate was renewed in December to end in June.

          "title": "Osinbajo: FG Deploys Significant Resources to Address Challenges in Human Capital Devt",
          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\nThe federal government has over the years deployed significant resources to address challenges in education and healthcare, in its efforts to address human capital development and related issues in the country, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has said.\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President,\n\nLaolu Akande, quoted Osinbajo to have stated this yesterday in his keynote address at the Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola Leadership Colloquium 2021 themed: \u201cGovernment and Big Development: Realities & Solutions for Nigeria\u201d. The event was organised to mark the birthday of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nExplaining circumstances where governments may need to intervene directly, including in human capital development, the Vice President said, \u201cdirect state (government) intervention is crucial. You cannot have such conditions (such as in the country) and not have some direct interventions from government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe point is that, for many of the challenges that face a developing economy, there is very little, immediate term profit for private actors in addressing those challenges, but of course, there are huge medium to long term social and economic gains to be reaped.\n\n\u201cIn order to fill that gap, government must come in, government must intervene. This intervention in my view, are the issues of big development. How do you educate the largest youth population in Africa?\n\n\u201cHow do you ensure healthcare for that large number of people, and all of the various issues? These are the big development issues that confront us. And we must be able to find solutions to them,\u201d he added.\n\nMaking reference to some specific interventions of the federal government, Osinbajo said, \u201cin our first budget, we devoted for N500 billion to our Social Investment Programme. 500,000 young graduates were engaged in the N-Power programme, and 9.5 million children being fed daily in the school feeding programme (just before COVID-19) across 34 states.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the programme employs well over 135,000 cooks, and over 100,000 small-holder farmers linked to the programme, supplying locally sourced ingredients.\n\nAt some point, this, he said translates to 594 cattle, 138,000 chickens, 6.8 million eggs, 83 metric tons of fish, that are procured, prepared, and distributed every week.\n\nThe higher outcomes for enrollment of pupils in school, retention and performance of students have all been empirically verified, he added.\n\n\u201cThere was also the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) \u2013 TraderMoni, MarketMoni initiatives where micro credits were offered to traders (about 2 million traders in all),\u201d the Vice President added.\n\nHe further explained that, \u201cthese programmes are important because they are in many ways government efforts at directly creating opportunities. A country such as ours clearly require a social welfare programme, a situation where those who cannot work and those who have no work and the vulnerable are provided with one way of earning something and provided with opportunities.\u201d\n\nIn the health sector, the Vice President said \u201csince the inception of this administration, we have done a few other direct social investment-type things aimed at human capital development.\n\n\u201cAfter the National Health Act was passed in 2014, the Federal Government in 2018 began including the one per cent minimum portion of the Consolidated Revenue Fund \u2013 amounting to N55 billion to fund the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF). The Fund is designed to deliver a guaranteed set of health services to all Nigerians, through the national network of Primary Health Care Centers.\u201d\n\nIn education, Osinbajo noted that, \u201csince 2015 also, the Federal Government has disbursed more than N170 billion in matching grants to States and the FCT under the Universal Basic Education Programme, N8 billion in Special Education Grants to states and private providers of Special Education, and N34 billion from the Teachers Professional Development Fund to States and the FCT.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Vice President added that the interventions were in line with the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment of lifting 100 million people out of poverty,\u201d noting that, \u201cwe recognise the threats posed by social immobility and deprivation.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on the cost of running the public service, the Vice President said the focus should be, \u201con people being in the right place in the public service. We have a large public service but you still have huge shortages in, for example, health and education sectors. So, there are massive shortages in many parts of the public service whereas you find redundancies in other aspects of the public service.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that, \u201cwe should be training and engaging more teachers, nurses, doctors and several other participants in the public service, and we may end up with more or less the same cost. But my view is that those costs themselves, so long that we are spending them right, so long as they are spent on the right quality of public servants, are costs that we should bear.\n\n\u201cI am not certain that just a willy-nilly cost cutting is the solution, long term. Of course, we find within the public service, so many who are not qualified, many whose jobs are replicated, huge redundancies, we need to correct those redundancies, we need to ensure that those who are not qualified are either retrained or we let them go.\n\n\u201cBut we must ensure that we do not allow ourselves to be trapped in a way of thinking that suggests that the problem is really just the cost of governance, so that if we just downsize, everything will be alright. I think the problem is a bit larger than that. I think we have to look at really, the professionalisation of our public service, ensuring that we have the right quality of people in the right jobs,\u201d Osinbajo added.\n\nCommending the efforts of Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, as governor of Osun State, and describing him as \u201ca repentant Marxist\u201d, the Vice President said, \u201che stands out as a reason why one should at least have some socialist blood in them while recognising the fundamental role of markets and the public sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOsun State which Ogbeni governed for 8 years received the lowest in federal allocations but was for those years, the State with the lowest poverty rate. The incidence of poverty for the State of Osun was 10.9 per cent in 2017 as against 37.5 per cent in 2010.\n\n\u201cA sharp drop in the incidence of poverty between 2010 and 2018. As of early 2020 the incidence of poverty has fallen further to 8.2 per cent. Why would a State with one of the least revenues record lowest levels of poverty?\n\n\u201cTo a large extent, it is arguable that the social intervention policies he initiated and implemented were largely responsible. The State launched several job creation efforts \u2013 Osun State Youth Empowerment Program (OYES) hired about 20,000 young people.\n\n\u201cThere was also the school feeding programme, the precursor to our National Homeschool Feeding Programme, serving 155,000 children at inception to over 250,000 children in all 1,382 public elementary schools in the State. 7000 jobs were directly created and 3700 cooks, most of them women.\n\n\u201cThe programme led to an increase of 60 per cent in primary school enrollment and all meals served were from farms and suppliers of food items benefitted from the programme.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), yesterday, announced that it had concluded arrangements to issue award letters to successful investors in the 2020 marginal field bid round programme.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Head, Public Affairs of the organisation, Mr. Paul Osu, it noted that the award ceremony has now been officially scheduled to hold on Monday, May 31, in Abuja.\n\nThe oil and gas industry regulator stressed that successful investors, who will be receiving their award letters are companies that have fully satisfied all requirements listed in the marginal field bid round guidelines, including full payment of signature bonuses within the specified time frame.\n\nThe process, which culminated in the presentation of award letters, commenced in June 2020 with 57 marginal oil fields on offer for investors with the objective of deepening indigenous participation in the oil and gas industry as well as adding to the country\u2019s production and reserve.\n\nThe marginal field bid round programme, the DPR stated, is also geared to provide technical and financial partnerships for investors.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Petroleum Resources will continue to provide transparent regulatory oversight for the oil and gas industry to enable business and create opportunities for investors,\u201d the statement noted.\n\nRecently, Director of the DPR, stated that the country was expected to net $500 million from the signature bonuses on the fields, the first marginal field round since 2002.\n\nAuwalu said DPR had narrowed the list of bidders to 161 and would mark the first first time Nigeria would allow companies to pay oilfield acquisition costs in naira.\n\nHaving received the expected revenue, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, penultimate week revealed that the regulatory agency \u201crescued\u201d Nigeria from a financial crisis by remitting the funds to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) in April.\n\nSylva explained that since the DPR collected royalties on behalf of the federal government, it was able to fill the vacuum left by the NNPC in contributing to the federation account.\n\nThe minister, who did not mention the exact amount the DPR provided, said revenues from marginal field programmes were of use, when the nation was in dire need of funds to share among the federating units.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say what the figure is, but the DPR has always contributed to the federation revenue, because they collect royalties, so they\u2019ll continue to contribute.\n\n\u201cBut as to filling the gap, it\u2019ll not always be there, because NNPC has not said after not being able to contribute in May, it\u2019ll stop entirely.

He also expressly asked them to ignore the rules of engagement- including observing the principle of proportionality in the use of force and firearms, with assurances that nothing will happen to them if they abuse human rights.\n\n\"Following the said IGP's reckless, unprofessional and dangerous directive, the police in Imo State have gone all out on indiscriminate mass raids, arresting, parading and killing people labelling them IPOB without evidence. We have received disturbing reports about the invasion of markets and other public places by police officers who engage in sporadic shooting and indiscriminate arrest of young men, some of whom are stabbed with daggers and taken away in police vehicles undisclosed destinations.\n\n\"Raids and indiscriminate mass arrests of no less than 107 persons from various locations in Owerri have also been reported and kangaroo mass trials conducted in a police car park and other locations outside the courtroom based on frivolous charges and remanded in prison thereby complicating the problem of prison congestion.\"\n\nThe civil societies added that the Nigeria Police has a Code of Conduct and Rules of Engagement but the IGP discarded them and directed police officers to act in blatant violation of those.\n\nThey said, \"Based on the Acting IGP's reckless and dangerous utterances and directives to police officers to disregard the Code of conduct and rules of engagement, we hereby convey our opposition to his confirmation as substantive IGP. We call on the Police Council and the Senate to, in the public interest, muster the courage to decline confirmation of Acting Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, as substantive IGP.\n\n\"He is unfit and unsuitable to be appointed to head a country's lead security agency. He is indeed a threat to public safety and security. We call for an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the arrest of no less than 107 residents of Owerri Imo State who were also alleged to be IPOB members and arraigned on the preposterous allegation of attempts to overthrow President Buhari and Governor Hope Uzodinma.\n\n\"We also call for investigations into all other killings in Imo State by both the military and police and an end to predatory policing tactics.\"",

I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin : personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\n: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin. There are the warranty papers but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for is it? Thought as much. Onward!\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm. She has in previous years worked on providing digital and holistic security support to various marginalized communities and NGOs across Nigeria and Africa at large. She also collaborated on creating digital security guides to such organisations and communities to stay safe.\n\nNick Maxwell is a cybersecurity and networking industry professional with a passion for learning, working and creating a better understanding of the concerns and needs of clients and partners, across several regions in a variety of verticals. He has over 13 years experience in the technology industry and has worked for multinational, leading technology companies.\n\nAttendees will be able to ask the speakers questions in an interactive session.\n\nRegister here to join the event.",

          "title": "GovTech In Nigeria: From Regulatory Maze to Models of Good Practice",
          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "title": "How GOtv Nigeria Built the Widest Coverage in Nigeria with Investments in Local Infrastructure",
          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings. With \u201cStop at Nothing\u201d as its brand essence, TECNO is committed to unlocking the best contemporary technologies for progressive individuals across global emerging markets, giving them elegantly designed products that inspires consumers to uncover a world of possibilities.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would retire the Internet Explorer (IE) on June 15, 2022.\n\nLaunched globally in August 1995, Internet Explorer became the most widely used web browser with about 95% market share between 2002 and 2003. And in 2015, it was already one of Africa\u2019s most used web browsers.\n\nDespite being the pioneering Internet browser, its security, speed, and reliability have been the butt of jokes for a few years now. Maybe that\u2019s why Microsoft has decided to pull the plug on the browser\u2019s life support.\n\nDue to its longevity, no other software has had more security bugs than Internet Explorer before 2019. Its users are prone to get tricked by hackers into opening malicious websites from search queries or clicking on an email link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Microsoft reportedly confirmed a security flaw in January 2020, the company said it had no immediate plan to fix the defect used by hackers on IE until they released a new update in February of that year.\n\nIn January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 after announcing that it wouldn\u2019t offer security updates for Windows users in January 2019.\n\nDespite the patches rolled out almost every month, its security and low network connectivity, which make it unreliable, do not inspire confidence.\n\nThat explains why some users started looking for alternatives.\n\n\u201cInternet Explorer was the go-to to download Chrome back in the day. I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity. Approximately 7 people (5.8%) stopped because of security bugs, and about 29 people (24.2%) said they never used it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it appears some Nigerians won\u2019t miss the browser when Microsoft eventually puts it to rest.\n\nNonetheless, while Internet Explorer was going through its steady decline in market share, and Google Chrome dominated other browsers with 69% market share, Microsoft was building Microsoft Edge to replace IE.\n\nWhat about Microsoft Edge?\n\nWith the Microsoft Edge browser launch in 2015, the software giant revealed plans to kill off Internet Explorer, though it would continue working until the end.\n\nRecall that on August 17, 2020, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Teams web app would no longer support IE. And on November 30 of the same year, Microsoft Teams stopped endorsing IE.\n\nFrom August 17, 2021, Microsoft services like OneDrive and Outlook will no longer support IE.\n\nInterestingly, Edge has an IE mode despite being touted as faster, more secure, modern, and reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThe IE mode is built in to access the legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications directly from the browser.\n\nMicrosoft also claims that Edge is its solution to the security issues faced on Internet Explorer over the years.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, approximately 579 password attacks are attempted every second. And with reportedly the highest-rated protection against malware and phishing attacks, Microsoft Edge seems to be up to the task of protection.\n\nAccording to browser statistics, Edge can identify 98% of phishing sites while Chrome and Firefox can successfully recognise 96%.\n\nMicrosoft Edge promises to give out security patches for instant vulnerabilities within hours compared to the monthly security patches on IE 11.\n\nAccording to research, Edge can immediately block 89% of phishing sites, outperforming Chrome (79%) and Firefox (77%). This suggests that Edge is more secure than Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.\n\nIn the blog post released on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, Microsoft said, \u201cthe future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge.\u201d\n\nBut how much of this do users believe?\n\n\u201cI enjoy using Microsoft Edge, and it\u2019s better than Chrome because it helps me retrieve my previous tabs whenever I log in again. Also, whenever I want to read, I can use the Immersive Reader. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading on AnyBooks,\u201d says Damilola*, a Microsoft Edge user who never used IE.\n\nAccording to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies, Chrome ranked first with 69.28% market share, while Microsoft Edge ranked second with 7.75% between November 2019 and April 2021.\n\nNew Edge Features\n\nOn Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Microsoft announced two new features for version 91 of the Edge browser at its annual Build conference.\n\nStartup boost allows Edge to start up almost immediately. The second feature \u2014 sleeping tabs \u2014 puts your tabs to sleep so that they don\u2019t use up memory and the CPU cycle.\n\nWith the new Edge features and the retirement of Internet Explorer in June 2022, Microsoft might finally build a reliable brand known for speed and security and probably overtake Chrome some years down the road.\n\nIn Africa, according to Browser Usage Statistics, 68.37% use Chrome while 1.26% use IE and Edge, respectively. However, chrome is still the most vulnerable web browser in 2019, with 177 vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThat is, even with its vulnerabilities, people still chose Chrome over Edge.\n\nSo, what might prompt Africans to use Edge more? The reliability of a browser that hasn\u2019t passed the test of time? How much work do you think Edge has to do to catch up with Chrome? We are also asking the same questions.\n\n* Not real name\n\nFeatured Image by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity. Approximately 7 people (5.8%) stopped because of security bugs, and about 29 people (24.2%) said they never used it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it appears some Nigerians won\u2019t miss the browser when Microsoft eventually puts it to rest.\n\nNonetheless, while Internet Explorer was going through its steady decline in market share, and Google Chrome dominated other browsers with 69% market share, Microsoft was building Microsoft Edge to replace IE.\n\nWhat about Microsoft Edge?\n\nWith the Microsoft Edge browser launch in 2015, the software giant revealed plans to kill off Internet Explorer, though it would continue working until the end.\n\nRecall that on August 17, 2020, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Teams web app would no longer support IE. And on November 30 of the same year, Microsoft Teams stopped endorsing IE.\n\nFrom August 17, 2021, Microsoft services like OneDrive and Outlook will no longer support IE.\n\nInterestingly, Edge has an IE mode despite being touted as faster, more secure, modern, and reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThe IE mode is built in to access the legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications directly from the browser.\n\nMicrosoft also claims that Edge is its solution to the security issues faced on Internet Explorer over the years.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, approximately 579 password attacks are attempted every second. And with reportedly the highest-rated protection against malware and phishing attacks, Microsoft Edge seems to be up to the task of protection.\n\nAccording to browser statistics, Edge can identify 98% of phishing sites while Chrome and Firefox can successfully recognise 96%.\n\nMicrosoft Edge promises to give out security patches for instant vulnerabilities within hours compared to the monthly security patches on IE 11.\n\nAccording to research, Edge can immediately block 89% of phishing sites, outperforming Chrome (79%) and Firefox (77%). This suggests that Edge is more secure than Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.\n\nIn the blog post released on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, Microsoft said, \u201cthe future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge.\u201d\n\nBut how much of this do users believe?\n\n\u201cI enjoy using Microsoft Edge, and it\u2019s better than Chrome because it helps me retrieve my previous tabs whenever I log in again. Also, whenever I want to read, I can use the Immersive Reader. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading on AnyBooks,\u201d says Damilola*, a Microsoft Edge user who never used IE.\n\nAccording to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies, Chrome ranked first with 69.28% market share, while Microsoft Edge ranked second with 7.75% between November 2019 and April 2021.\n\nNew Edge Features\n\nOn Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Microsoft announced two new features for version 91 of the Edge browser at its annual Build conference.\n\nStartup boost allows Edge to start up almost immediately. The second feature \u2014 sleeping tabs \u2014 puts your tabs to sleep so that they don\u2019t use up memory and the CPU cycle.\n\nWith the new Edge features and the retirement of Internet Explorer in June 2022, Microsoft might finally build a reliable brand known for speed and security and probably overtake Chrome some years down the road.\n\nIn Africa, according to Browser Usage Statistics, 68.37% use Chrome while 1.26% use IE and Edge, respectively. However, chrome is still the most vulnerable web browser in 2019, with 177 vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThat is, even with its vulnerabilities, people still chose Chrome over Edge.\n\nSo, what might prompt Africans to use Edge more? The reliability of a browser that hasn\u2019t passed the test of time? How much work do you think Edge has to do to catch up with Chrome? We are also asking the same questions.\n\n* Not real name\n\nFeatured Image by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations?

He admonished ACGs to design\n\nempathy maps to help them in understanding how people experienced a problem in their communities and their perspectives about finding solutions or responding to requests for proposals, whether solicited or unsolicited.\n\nIn the functions of Resource Mobilisation, he stated that finding \u201cnew business opportunities\u201d is same as proposal development, and after action, review process followed before project implementation. He however cautioned that service provision to clients should not be discontinued but that organisational sustainability will help scale up goods and services the organisation currently provides.\n\nHe listed resource Mobilisation sources to include members contribution, sale of goods and services for user fees, foundation contributions, government contracts, grants, national and international donors, amongst others.\n\nDr Emonena noted that there were certain truths about resource Mobilisation, and they included that organisations are not entitled to supports but that it depended on what organisations bring to the table, and that gaining trust/confidence will aid search for supports.\n\n\u201cSuccessful Resource Mobilisation requires a lot of work and takes a lot of time. Organisations need to be thoroughly prepared. If your organization needs additional revenue in one year, start today!\u2019 he stated emphatically.\n\nHe admonished participants to be ready, willing and able to sell the programme they are raising fund for and be sure that fund mobilisation efforts are in alliance with organization\u2019s mission, objectives and strategic plans. He however noted that fundraising is also about the needs of the prospective donor.\n\n\u201cYou must understand the needs of your constituents or markets and apply an evidence-based research on what works. Your organisational performance today impacts on your ability to generate resources tomorrow.\u201d\n\nOrganizational, programmatic, industrial and financial sustainability, according to Dr Emonena, are key for organizational optimal performance.\n\nOn his part, Dr Jude Obasanmi took participants through an organizational development\n\nchecklist, which includes need for self assessment, action planning, development of Resource Mobilisation Plan and the internal/external Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats(SWOT), including\n\nLeadership and Governance, stating that organisations must be governed by documented constitution, constituted CSO Board and meeting, visible NGO vision, mission and value statement, organizational chart, NGO strategy plan, and so forth.\n\n\u201cSocial Innovation has a new formula for success, and it is combining capital with a do- good mentality.\u201d Dr Obasanmi stated.\n\nThe training also considered the process of proposal development from formation of team and calendar, technical approach, methodology and project description, monitoring and evaluation plan, among other sub-titles, including the Theory of Change,\n\nNetworking and referral systems.\n\nHighpoint of the training was the distribution of a sample of an Organization Resource Mobilisation Plan, 2021-2023 to participants, and it included Projected Resource Needs for FP/AYSRH, 2021 to 2023, a three-year planning map.\n\n...",

The western Region government also established DAILY SKETCH and SUNDAY SKETCH in 1964, while the Midwestern State government set up the Midwest Newspapers Corporation under an edit of December 2, 1967 to produce THE Nigerian OBSERVER newspapers which was first published on May 29, 1968.\n\nThe idea of publishing a government owned Newspaper in the state was first conceived by Colonel Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia\u2019s predecessor, Governor David Ejoor while in office.\n\nThe name of the paper originally planned for the state was \u201cMidwestern Nigeria Sentinel\u201d which was to be a weekly newspaper. The plan to set it up did not materialize before Colonel Ogbemudia was posted to take over as Governor of the then Midwest State.\n\nWithin a brief period of conception, ogbemudia invited Mr Abiodun Aloba in 1967, whom he entrusted the task of helping to set up a state-owned newspaper. Mr Aloba later became the pioneer General Manager of The Nigerian OBSERVER. He had come from Lagos on holiday to Benin City to see his relations. On his way back to Lagos, he was held back by some soldiers, who told him the Military Governor wanted to see him.\n\nOn meeting the Governor, after a brief on the proposal, Aloba was taken to several locations in Benin City with a view of choosing a befitting location for the newspaper company.\n\nHowever, after much search, the governor personally zeroed in on the present site, No. 24 Airport Road, then No. 18 Airport Road; a site which originally belonged to the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nToday, The Nigerian OBSERVER remains the longest surviving government owned newspaper in the country after series of re-launching and re-designing to meet industry standard.\n\nThe Nigerian OBSERVER in 1972 was circulating about 95,000 copies of its editions daily, a number which today has reduced to less than 1000.\n\nLate Fred Opubor, a one time chairman of the company\u2019s Board of Directors blamed the fall in circulation of government owned newspapers on interference on editorial policy.\n\nThe Nigerian OBSERVER was a child of political necessity published as a document for daily circulation that would inform the public on activities of government of the then Midwestern State Fifty-three years after establishment, The Nigerian OBSERVER has to its credit, three editions: Daily, The Sunday OBSERVER and The Weekend OBSERVER on October 6, 1990.\n\nWhile the Sunday OBSERVER was established on October 27,1968, the Sporting OBSERVER (now defunct) was established in 1974 and the Weekend OBSERVER in October 6,1990.\n\nAs at the 4th anniversary of the establishment of the corporation, the daily circulation of The Nigeria OBSERVER throughout the then 12 states of the federation has risen to 95,000, while The Sunday OBSERVER maintained a steady circulation n of 180,000 copies weekly.\n\nFollowing the creation of Edo and Delta States from the then Bendel State in 1991, and subsequently sharing of assets and liabilities by the two states. Edo retained Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL).\n\nThe government of Delta State, on its part, set up Delta Printing Press on August 8, 1994 to produce a state owned newspaper.\n\nThe newspaper which was later known as THE POINTER first appeared on the news stand in October 25, 1994.\n\nIt was set up basically to accommodate staff of the Bendel Newspaper Company Limited who were displaced from the company following the sharing of assets and liabilities by the two states. It was also a newspaper meant to project Delta state with its people to the outside world, as well as bring the world closer to Delta people.\n\nThe publication which started as weekly newspaper that was published every Sunday later added Thursdays and Saturdays (weekend) editions while it is presently a daily publication.\n\nThe basis for establishing THE POINTER newspaper was developmental journalism and grass root enlightenment, specifically patterned along the line of regional newspaper.\n\nWithin the first decade of its existence, the name Midwest Newspaper Corporation was subjected to geo-political changes that affected the political structure at the federal level.\n\nFirstly, it was Midwest Mass Communication Corporation and following the creation of more states, including Bendel from the defunct Midwest State, the corporation\u2019s name was changed to Bendel Newspapers Corporation.\n\nAfter several reforms, in January 1, 1989, in a bid to accentuate its news value and determination, the corporation\u2019s name was changed to Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL), a name which is retained till date.\n\nThe decision to change the name was taken at management level as a means to deliberately strip the company of all elements that made it a parastatal. It was subsequently registered under the Company Allied Matters Act.\n\nDespite the change in the legal status of the company, it is today still owned by government which retained every element of control and management.\n\nAt the inception of Midwest Newspapers Corporation in 1968, the then governor of the state, Colonel Ogbemudia observed that if The Nigerian OBSERVER publication is to discharge its sacred function effectively and efficiently too, it should be free from government control as to what it should write and not write. It should be free to criticize any aspect of government policy which it considered worthy of criticism in public.\n\nNevertheless, The OBSERVER Newspapers thrived in the face of challenges and competitions from privately owned newspapers, to emerge as the longest surviving government owned newspaper in the country.\n\nThe newspaper also had its fair share of unfavorable moments, both during the military regime and civilian government.\n\nA case in point was the case between one Mr. Amakiri Minere (now late) and the then River State governor, Alfred Diette Spiff (now a traditional ruler in Rivers State) in July 1973. Amakiri was the River State correspondent of the Benin \u2013Based The Nigerian OBSERVER. He wrote about an impending Teachers\u2019 strike in River state and had it published on the Military Governor\u2019s birthday anniversary. Diette Spiff felt insulted about the reportage and saw it as well calculated news to embarrass his personality.\n\nThe governor\u2019s ADC, ASP Ralph Micheal Iwowari intervened to pacify his paymaster (Diette) and sent for the reporter. Ignorantly, the reporter appeared at the gate of the governor\u2019s house and was received and detained by soldiers until further orders. The governor ordered and supervised the soldiers shaving of Amakiri\u2019s head with a broken bottle and caned 24 times publicly.\n\nThere was public outcry over the insult and injury caused Amakiri by Governor Diette Spiff and his aides to the extent that Amakiri\u2019s case is today a case study in any discuss on Press Freedom both in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nIn July 22, 1993, General Ibrahim Babagida closed The N igerian OBSERVER newspapers and some other national newspapers for their reportage on the June 12 crisis which he considered as a criticism against his administration.\n\nAside these, in the 1980s, the Newspaper house began to experience some difficulties principally among which was declined readers into the hands of privately owned newspaper until recently when the Editorial appeal was reignited by a vibrant youthful journalist, Mr. Eddy Akpomera. The daily product won back a high number of readers and advertisers who appreciated quality product.\n\nPrior to this period, situation became worse when the then Military Administrator of Edo State, Group Captain Baba Adamu Iyam introduced self- sustenance policy where BNCL and other parastatals were asked to fend for themselves through a Self- Sustenance. Workers of the company started going on incessant strikes as management could not afford workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nThis ugly experience continued until Governor Lucky Nosakhare Igbinedion came to the aid of the company. He cleared off the company\u2019s backlog of 13 months\u2019 salary arrears and employed the services of consultants made up of the duo of Emeka Ogbeide and Orobosa Omo-Ojo who revived the company and put it back on a sound footing.\n\nOn the note of advancing the newspaper house, Edo state Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki after paying an unscheduled visit to The Nigerian OBSERVER, revealed his intention of revamping the state owned media, including The Nigerian OBSERVER with the installation of a state of the art Printing Machine.\n\nHowever, it is on record that the 53 years old Newspaper produced notable journalists some of who made marks in journalism profession, including Mrs. Adekumbi Ero, Nosa Igiebor of TELL magazine, Osa Director, Emma Niboro, Nduka Obaiggbena, publishers of THIS DAY Newspaper.\n\n...",

          "title": "Governor Oyetola and the Chinese fable, by Charles Adeyemi",
          "text": "Before the rinderpest, I came across a well-known fable from Chinese mythology about the virtues of willpower and perseverance as a regular adherent of the Confucian doctrine of social co-existence. Wikipedia would discover that the tale first appeared in Book 5 of the Liezi, a Daoist text of the 4th century BC, and was retold in the Garden of Stories by the Confucian scholar Liu Xiang in the 1st century BC. It was also used by Chairman Mao Tsetung, the first premier of the people\u2019s republic of China in his famous speech of 1945.\n\nThe myth concerns an Old Man of 90 years who lived near a pair of mountains in the Yu Province. He was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains and sought to dig through them with hoes and baskets. To move the mountain, he could only make one round trip between the mountain and his home in a year. When questioned as to the seemingly impossible nature of his task, the Old Man replied that while he may not finish this task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children, and their children, and so on through the many generations, some day the mountains would be removed if he persevered. The gods in Heaven, impressed with his determination, hard work and perseverance, ordered the mountains separated.\n\nDrawing the Nexus, it takes an unusual willpower ganished with brilliance and a total believe in the miracle working God to lead a state like osun in 2018. The last Administration has given their best but majority of Osun people and spectators of Governance of Osun doesn\u2019t see the state rising from the toga of issues it was confronted with prior to the Advent of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nFor instance, Osun was a state popular with all sort of complications ranging from reactions to different policies and initiatives of the system, from school merger, to single school uniform policy, to avoidable religious crisis, attempt at building of a cargo airport which many believe was a white elephant adventure. for a protracted period of time, workers were subjected to modulated salary option which was popularly reffered to \u2018Afusa\u2019, funny as it was then, the senior staff of government were collecting half salary, the brutal situation is not even the half salary but that all status quo deductions were implemented to the full from the supposed modulated salary. Bank deductions never stopped, gratuity payment for pensioners were also modulated, cooperative deductions were used by the system of that time leaving an average workers with empty pocket.\n\nOf course, the sad effect was conspicuous and felt in the entire state, it made the narrative popular that Osun is a civil service state. By the time the last Administration was winding down, it became obvious that a new approach must be explored, a new agenda must be sought for, yet premised on the continuity mantra. Ogbeni Aregbesola, the former Governor and current minister of interior accented to this when he publicly told osun people to expect a new approach and probably a reversal of some of his policies should they felt it\u2019s necessary, they can tell the party and the party will relate to Ilerioluwa. He admonished them to expect Ilerioluwa to do things differently. A prophecy that would come to pass sooner.\n\nTalking of willpower and determination, the alpha shock started when the current Governor started telling people of Osun that he will pay full salaries as and when due to the workers of osun.\n\nTruth be told, even top members of the party hierarchy both in the state and federal dispell this promise as a mere campaign contents to sway votes, what was clear to all then was that osun has bitten more than she can chew and future generations will continue to pay for it with obvious punishment such as \u201cAfusa\u201d and it\u2019s attendant hardship on the people of Osun. The second category of people that doubt this campaign promise by candidate Oyetola were the workers! Yes they are the worst hit by the \u2018Afusa\u2019 tsunami, imagine working for a month and collecting half of your normal salary with full deductible deductions.\n\nGovernor Oyetola has not only fulfill his promise of paying full salaries, he has went further to approve minimum wage for all levels of Osun workforce, isn\u2019t this a miracle? An illustration of dry bone rising again, yet infrastructural development hasn\u2019t stop for a single day!\n\nPeople begin to wonder how the man of the moment is doing it, questions like what\u2019s the secret? the magic and whatever is it should be shared for younger generation to learn. An economic expert, Dr Ogunyemi said it takes a miracle worker to do what Oyetola is doing. Is this hard to know?\n\nI find out it\u2019s about prudence in Public Financial Management (PFM), a process by which money comes into the purse of the government and the process by which goverment expend the money through implementation of project and services.This is the premise on which the financial encyclopedia based his fiscal governance on.\n\nOsun Government under the leadership of Governor Oyetola has been able to develop Medium Term Sector Strategy (MTSS) and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which has been assisting the state in preparing realistic budget since 2018.\n\nThe budget performance of the state government of osun is available on the state website (www.stateofosun.gov.ng). Both national and international partners in the area of public finance has credited osun as one of the states that has developed and signed into law virtually all financial management laws.\n\nWithin two years of his Adminstration, the payment system of internally generated revenue has been digitalized, this is in line with blocking all loopholes and thus remitted IGR skyrocketed in an ever increasing scale. To solidify this system, State of Osun Audit law of 2018, which provides the legal backup for the office of the Auditor General for the state and Auditor Generals for the local governments was signed into law and later within the same first two years, Osun Public Financial Management law 2020 was also accented.\n\nThe Administration has invested heavily on ICT via State integrated financial management information system (SIFIMIS) which assist the administration in Setting realistic budget. The Gboyega Oyetola Administration has put in place a robust procurement system and auditing institutions has also been repositioned.\n\nIn recognition of all this fiscal efforts, SFTAS (State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Project) rated Osun among the top in public financial management in Nigeria. This is a world bank funded project alongside federal government of Nigeria. At the end of their fact finding mission accross the country which includes but not limited to evaluation of Budget Preparation process, budget performance process, public procurement process, financial accounting process, auditing process and even revenue collection process. They declared osun one of the best in the entire country.\n\nAnother project that played a key role in osun fiscal governance is SLOGOR (State and Local Governance Reform Project). Under Governor Oyetola leadership, SLOGOR has repositioned the fiscal space in the State of osun and can compete with comity of performing States, it has been adjudged by the World Bank Assisted State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Project as one of the best in Nigeria. The project has open the State Of Osun to budget support from international development community.\n\nGovernor Oyetola has repositioned the fiscal governance of osun than before. Within the armbit of international development organizations like WORLD BANK, UNESCO, European Union (EU), United Kingdom Department for International Development ( DFID) and others, they are now seeing osun as a state they can partner with. They are more willing than before to support the government. These are development partners that can\u2019t inject their money into a system that\u2019s not transparent.\n\nAll osun audit reports are on the osun website and this has raise the level of confidence of donors and development partners. It can only happened when you have a thourougbred professional and technocrats in power. There\u2019s more to be done and osun people are willing to give a man with Will power, determination, and perseverance in the thoughts that things can be better.\n\nOsun couldn\u2019t have Achieve so much with so little if not for financial mastery and prudence of the Governor. A Bantu proverb situates that \u201cWhen money realizes that it is in good hands, it wants to stay and multiply in those hands.\u201d this is the testimony of our grass to grace fiscal reality in osun, the reason why we must insist on retaining Governor Gboyega Oyetola to continue this frugal display of financial mastery, discipline and brilliant fiscal governance.\n\nForward With Governor Gboyega Oyetola forever!\n\nCharles Adeyemi writes from osogbo.

(I Want to Read! in Hausa) \u2013 to 157,000 primary grade learners in Adamawa and Gombe states.\n\nThe USAID Strengthening Education in Northeast Nigeria (SENSE) activity, implemented by the American University of Nigeria (AUN), developed the packages for the two states, which contain more than 5.2 million copies of educational reading material produced with USAID\u2019s evidence-based early grade reading methodology using global best practices.\n\n\u201cThrough years of conflict, education in the northeast has been decimated,\u201d USAID Mission Director Anne Patterson said. She added that \u201cWorking with AUN, we are helping to rebuild the system by providing materials that employ evidence-based methods to start thousands of children off on a lifetime of reading.\u201d\n\nAt ceremonies in Gombe on May 26 and Yola on May 19, each learner received a take-home booklet that contains up to 30 different stories and books at varying levels designed to help them advance their reading competence over a whole academic year. SENSE has encouraged parents to ask their children to read the stories to them after school to further improve their reading proficiency.\n\nOver three years, SENSE will reach more than 200,000 learners, and train and provide teaching materials to 5,000 teachers to improve reading in the Hausa language. SENSE helps enable the education systems in Gombe and Adamawa to deliver accessible high-quality education that responds to the needs of all children.\n\nThe SENSE approach to encouraging reading is supported by research on effective methods of teaching reading in the early grades. A USAID-supported study by the American Institutes for Research identifies that the availability of plentiful reading materials in different forms relevant to the reader\u2019s background, language, and interests for independent reading results in significantly higher results.",

          "text": "Chelsea have won the Champions League for the second time in their history as a Kai Havertz goal was enough to see off Manchester City 1-0 at the Estadio do Dragao in Porto on Saturday.\n\nThe match marked the London side\u2019s first appearance in a final since their dramatic 2012 triumph over Bayern Munich in Munich, and third overall.\n\nThe win gives Thomas Tuchel \u2014 who took over the club in January \u2014 his first as manager after guiding Paris Saint-Germain to the final last season.\n\nThe all-England decider was the eighth time clubs from the same country have matched up with a European Cup on the line, and handed the country its 14th crown overall which is only behind Spain for most all time.\n\nA lively first-half rife with chances for both sides looked set to head into the break scoreless. Chelsea defender Thiago Silva came off in the 39th minute with an apparent leg injury and seemingly left the Blues\u2019 defence vulnerable with substitute Andreas Christensen replacing him at centre-back. But it was City whose back-line was split open three minutes later.\n\nFrom a goal kick, Ben Chilwell played on Mason Mount who found a streaking Kai Havertz racing into a massive gap between City defenders.\n\nEderson charged out of his goal but couldn\u2019t clear the ball from the Germany international who calmly rounded the keeper and slotted home into an empty net.\n\nCity were dealt another blow when star midfielder Kevin De Bruyne was taken off at the hour mark after an ugly clash with Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Rudiger, who received a yellow card for the foul.\n\nUnited States midfielder Christian Pulisic made history in the 66th minute, becoming the first American male to appear in a UCL final when he was subbed on for Timo Werner, and nearly made an immediate impact but saw his stretching shot with only Ederson to beat bounce wide of the far post.\n\nAnd despite seven minutes of added on time and Phil Foden going close, Pep Guardiola and City were left to rue an opportunity missed, as Chelsea celebrated their triumph.",

          "text": "A former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan will on Sunday brief at least ten African Presidents of countries in the ECOWAS region on his fact-finding mission to Mali where he had gone to assess the situation and explored opportunities for the resolution of the crisis that has engulfed the West African country.\n\nMr Jonathan is ECOWAS Special Envoy and Mediator for Mali.\n\nThe ECOWAS extraordinary meeting is aimed at restoring constitutional order in the West African country following the May 24 \u201ccoup within a coup.\u201d\n\nAlso expected at the summit is junta leader Col. Assimi Goita, who assumed power after the sacking of the Transition Government\u2019s President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane.\n\nA statement on Saturday by Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, Minister for Foreign Affairs and regional integration on the extraordinary session of the authority of Heads of state and government on the situation in Mali noted that the Summit will also enable the authority deliberate and take consequential decisions on the evolving political and security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIn line with the ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance, the President of the Republic, H.E. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, in his capacity as Chair of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government, following due consultations with his peers decided to convene this Extraordinary Summit,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the Summit is to enable the Authority deliberate and take consequential decisions on the evolving political and security situation in the Republic of Mali.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, the past few days have witnessed some worrying developments in Mali. The arrest and detention of the President and Prime Minister of the Transition Government by the military has necessitated a re-evaluation of the strategies adopted by ECOWAS to bring normalcy to the country.\n\n\u201cAt the behest of the President of the Republic, an ECOWAS Mediation team, led by H.E. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, ECOWAS Special Envoy and Mediator for Mali, embarked on a fact-finding mission to Mali from 25th to 26th May, 2021 to assess the situation and explore opportunities for the resolution of the crisis. H.E. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan will, therefore, report to the Summit on the outcome of the mission.\n\n\u201cMay I indicate that the convening of the Extraordinary Session demonstrates the unwavering commitment of the President of the Republic towards addressing the political situation in Mali.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that barely a week after his assumption of office as Chair of the ECOWAS Authority, H.E. the President, convened an emergency Summit, held at Peduase, in response to the military intervention, which saw the ousting of the then President H.E. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on 18th August, 2020. That meeting took important decisions, including a demand on the Malian authorities to ensure that the Transition Government was Civilian-led and should last for a period of eighteen (18) months, with effect from 15th September, 2020. The Summit also affirmed that once a civilian-led transition government had assumed office, ECOWAS within the context of its protocols will assist Mali to return to democratic governance. It is important to note that H.E. the President has since been at the centre of efforts, including mediation initiatives, to bring lasting peace and stability to Mali\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that all the political actors in Mali will support the outcome of the Extraordinary Summit to be held tomorrow in order to restore constitutional order in our sister country as soon as practicable. The outcome of the Summit will be critical to sustaining the momentum for the return of democracy and stability in Mali.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
