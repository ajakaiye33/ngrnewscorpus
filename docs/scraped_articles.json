Igboho has not committed any offence and he can\u2019t be sent to jail for committing no offence. We advise the Federal Government to pay the N20bn damages.\n\n\u201cWe also have a plan to file counter-charges for Igboho\u2019s aide arrested and paraded. They damaged their reputation and that has affected their means of livelihood. We trust the judiciary and they have people of high integrity.

Reducing poverty and empowering our citizens in the areas of Agriculture, Education, urban and rural infrastructure among others.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructure also helps to make people efficient, it creates competition and leads to productivity. Currently, the Federal Government is executing 895 contracts in 795 projects spanning over 13,000 km of roads and bridges nationwide.\n\n\u201cAcross all of these, engineers, geologists, surveyors, lawyers, bankers, suppliers, artisans, and laborers are involved in an ecosystem of enterprise from which they earn a daily, weekly or other periodic income.\n\n\u201cBut that is only part of the story, the employment. The other parts include improved asset value, because everywhere a new road or bridge is built, the land value appreciates by up to 30 per cent creating enormous capital gain.\n\n\u201cOn the completed sections of the roads, journeys that used to take days now take only a few hours, journeys that took hours are now reduced to minutes; and if it is true that time is money, clearly reduced journey times currently being delivered across Nigerian roads is money either through savings on journeys and fuel cost, or utilisation of time saved for other productive activities, not to mention the health benefits attributable to shorter travel time and reduced stress.\n\n\u201cSo when President Buhari committed on June 12, 2019, to taking 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years, his vision was not a Federal Government vision but a national one, which has started with the work being undertaken in all states and FCT and to which the Federal Government is contributing through infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIn the pursuit of this National vision, I urge all of us to embrace the more holistic view and definition of poverty as not only the number of jobs, or amount of cash, but also well-being, efficiency, and the lack of access.\n\n\u201cFor example, if a one-hour journey takes six hours even in the best car, or land value is stagnant because it lacks an access road, the reversal of these situations by improved journey time or provision of access roads are steps towards prosperity.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, all those employed in the process of building the roads, surveyors, contractors, engineers, bankers, artisans, suppliers, and lawyers have certainly been impacted on the income side.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we cannot build forever and so when the infrastructure project is completed, most of those employed in the building must leave the site to look for new opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is the heart of the matter and this is the message that the theme of this council seeks to focus on. What should we do in addition to building infrastructure, in order to keep the jobs on.\n\n\u201cThe answer, Ladies and Gentlemen is simple. We must maintain the infrastructure we built.\n\n\u201cThis is important for many reasons, the first of which is that we preserve the life of the infrastructure and get the best value for the money we spent on it.\n\n\u201cThe second reason is that a maintenance economy is a critical contributor and driver of GDP in many economies around the world.\n\nYou will notice that I have spoken about a \u201cmaintenance economy\u201d not a \u201cmaintenance culture.\u201d This is because maintenance is not a cultural thing, it is an existential matter of survival, bread and butter and income.\n\n\u201cAvailable data shows that in the \u201cbuilt industry\u201d only about 30 per cent of the manpower is employable by design and construction which lasts until the project is completed; while the remaining 70% are employed in the process of \u201coperation\u201d and \u201cmaintenance\u201d of the infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThese are the reasons why the development of a maintenance economy must commend itself to all of us here and why we must all return home not only to think about it, but to do something about it.\n\n\u201cThe question is what needs to be done? My answer is that we must develop policies to stimulate the economy of maintenance.\n\n\u201cAll that we need to do is take a look at the state of existing infrastructure, and we are likely to see bridges with damaged expansion joints and bearings, buildings with broken windows and leaking pipes, doors that do not lock properly, toilets that do not work well and so much more.\n\n\u201cIf we reflect on what we see, we will realize that these are jobs for plumbers, carpenters, printers, foundry workers and many more skilled and unskilled people in our country and it is our responsibility to connect these people to the opportunities that infrastructure in disrepair represents for sustainable employment.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has already initiated such a policy in 2019, and we are now at the implementation stage.\n\n\u201cThis has seen the Head of the Federal Civil Service approve the creation of the Department for Federal Public Asset Maintenance.\n\n\u201cIn nine facilities that we assessed the conditions of fittings such as fans, air conditioners, light fittings, toilets and wash hand basin, we found that out of 41,800 installations 12,459 representing 29.8 per cent were not functioning. These are people\u2019s jobs to repair, supply, replace and install as the case may be.\n\n\u201cThe development of the maintenance plan and the procurement plan leading to invitation to tender and award of maintenance contracts for rehabilitation and facility management is a sure pathway to job creation.\n\n\u201cCurrently we are undertaking maintenance works on 41 bridges that has employed 1,157 people directly and created 3,309 indirect jobs and we have facility management contracts for 25 federal secretariats across Nigeria after we completed renovation works. Each facility manager employs at least 40 people.\n\n\u201cThis is only a tip of the iceberg because the supply side that supports maintenance involves the purchase and supply of paint, bleach, rakes, brooms and other tools which create employment for small and medium-sized enterprises which is another activity of economic empowerment.\n\n\u201cWhen we started the office of Facility Management in Lagos State, I recall one day when we awarded contracts for the facility management of 600 schools. This was employment not only for 600 small contractors but also for the people that were employed to do the job.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Joseph Adegbesan, and two other suspects have been arrested by the police over alleged threat to the life of the former Deputy Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Oludare Kadiri.\n\nAdegbesan, a close associate of the Secretary to the State Government, Tokunbo Talabi, was nabbed Thursday by operatives of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Force Headquarters, Abuja, alongside one Muibi Olufodun and another suspect identified as Samson.\n\nThe policemen had stormed Awa in Ijebu North Local Government Area of Ogun State to pick up Adegbesan, while the others were arrested in Ago-Iwoye, it was gathered.\n\nThe former Deputy Speaker, who is representing Ijebu North II State Constituency, had instructed his counsel, Oludare Adejare to petition the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, alleging threat to the life of his life.\n\nAccording to the petition, Kadiri had called for \u201cdetailed, speedy and expeditious investigation and subsequent prosecution\u201d of the suspects.\n\nThe petition partly read: \u201cWe have been briefed by our client who is a member of Ogun State House of Assembly, representing Ijebu North II State Constituency, Ijebu North Local Government Area of Ogun State that one Muritala Babatunde (aka Muri etee) who was alleged sometimes in 2018 of being a member of Aye Confraternity and killing of two (2) students of Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye of Ogun State stated that Honourable Joseph Adegbesan, who was a former member of Ogun State House of Assembly purchased him a gun, ammunition and that he is a major sponsor of the Aye Confraternity. The said ammunition that were purchased by Honourable Joseph Adegbesan for the Aye Confraternity to kill the two (2) students of Olabisi Onabanjo University.\n\n\u201cOur client further informed us that the situation of things has taken a new turn in his constituency as he got discreet information that the same Honourable Joseph Adegbesan and his cohorts namely Muibi Moibi Olufodun and Gbenga Suberu among others have sponsored cult members of the Aye Confraternity to kill him.\n\n\u201cWe are further apprised that one Sule Ganiyu, Lekan Ojulopesi and one (1) other came fully armed to the House of Assembly on the 3rd of February, 2021 on the invitation of Honourable Joseph Adegbesan.

          "text": "Governor Aminu Bello Masari of. Katsina State, has said that danger looms for northern children if northerners fail to wake up from their slumber.\n\nAccording to Governor Masari, the lifestyle of citizens from the region coupled with the looming population explosion is bound to escalate the plight of children in the area if nothing is done urgently.\n\nWhile drawing comparison with their southern counterparts, using two key demographic variables, marriage and birth rate, Masari said about 80 per cent of men in the south stick to one wife while the same percentage of men in the north marry two to four wives.\n\nGovernor Masari made the remarks while declaring open the \u201cKatsina Future Summit\u201d organised by a coalition of non-governmental organisations known as \u201cSave Katsina Group\u201d to orchestrate a dependable future for people of the state.\n\nSimilarly, according to the Governor, the average number of children a person from the south is likely to have is three while the average in the north is about nine.\n\nConsequent upon this, Governor Masari warned that to continue walloping in the old order may worsen the living standard of people from the north, particularly children and by implication, the entire nation.\n\nTo that effect, Masari is calling on his fellow northerners to rise up to seek and apply the required knowledge to tame the menace of the looming population explosion.\n\n\u201cIn 1987, when Katsina was created, the population was about 3.8 million. How many years today, we are talking about 8 million.\n\n\u201cThat land of Katsina that was 500 years ago is still the same land. It has not increased in size but has increased in population.\n\n\u201cSo, how do we conquer the situation, accommodate ourselves, our future children and grandchildren without the requisite educational knowledge?\n\n\u201cGentlemen, we need to sit up. The challenges of the future with population explosion and with the character and nature of Hausa man which is totally different from the culture and traditions of our southern partners.\n\n\u201cWhat is the average of a person per child if you go to Lagos and other southern parts? It is an average of 3 to 1.\n\nWhat is the average here in the Northwest, Northeast and others? A woman gives birth to the average of 9 here in the North.\n\n\u201cWhat is the average age of marriage? 80% marry one wife in the south while in the North, 80% percent marry from two to four. Multiply the numbers and see for yourself.\n\n\u201cIf we continue in this way obviously out of school children and abandoned children are going to be much more,\u201d Governor Masari queried.\n\nIn the same vein, Masari further admonished youths to \u201cwork very hard against the menace of drugs and other intoxicants\u201d which he said is one of the major factors fuelling banditry in the north.\n\n\u201cEveryone of us, we owe a debt to the society that we come from: to the villages, to the communities, to the houses, to the families and even to ourselves.\n\n\u201cThe society belongs to all of us. Leadership is about the wisdom of the old and the energy of the youths blended together that is what makes a very good progressive, enterprising, developmental community or society.\n\n\u201cWhat is fuelling banditry in our communities? What is fuelling criminality in our communities? We must stand up against the evil criminality of drugs\n\nFrom the experience we have gathered within the last six years, we have seen the role of drugs influencing some of these bad behaviours and actions to the youths. We must work very hard against the misuse of drugs and other intoxicants,\u201d Governor Masari added\n\nThe Coordinator of Save Katsina Group in the state, Comrade Hamza Umar Saulawa speaking with Journalists at the two days summit, held at the state\u2019s Local Government Service Commission\u2019s Conference Hall said the summit was necessitated by the alien challenges the state is currently experiencing.\n\n\u201cWe decided to come up with the summit after a long brainstorming discussion and identification of problems.\n\n\u201cYou know Katsina is one of the true pillars in Nigeria when it comes to education, hospitality, peace and security.\n\nBut unfortunately, for some couple of years now, we\u2019re at the back. That\u2019s why we say let us all come together and identify the problems, where and how it started.\u201d\n\n\u2014",

Even this writer has suffered horrid descriptions from FFK in many write-ups.\n\n\u201cBuhari showed him mercy, dropping like gentle rain from heaven, when he could have otherwise spat into the sky, collecting the spittle with his own face. Was that not what me and you would have done? Confess.\n\n\u201cWe would have told FFK to go to hell, and stay there. But Buhari didn\u2019t.

The grand finale of the march has been fixed for today, when President Buhari will address the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).\n\nThe group is demanding the conduct of a regional referendum so that indigenous people from the southern and Middle Belt can decide on their nationhood, describing the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as a fraud having been enacted without the consent of the people. The million-man march is also targeted at showcasing to the world the crimes against humanity, attacks on press freedom, free speech and other criminalities allegedly aided by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\nAkintoye alleged that an unnamed top Nigerian government official and a popular Lagos journalist were hired to pay foreigners of African descent to masquerade as \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d protesters to counter the NINAS march.\n\nHe, however, assured that no matter how the Federal Government tried to scuttle the NINAS march, the will of the people would prevail and urged all people of the South and Middle-Belt in the US and Canada to troop out in their numbers for the protest against what he said was the \u201crape of our ancestral land and hijack of our assets and sovereignty by the Fulani-controlled Nigerian government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Friday grand march in New York shall be historic, hence, the Nigerian government is jittery. The ring leader of government officials from Kwara State and a top Lagos journalist are now in New York to start hiring black people who will pretend as Nigerians to stage a pro-Buhari and One Nigeria Protest to counter NINAS on Friday. But we refuse to be rattled. We shall not be intimidated. No oppressor has ever triumphed against the collective will of the people. The people are the government and power belongs to the people.

          "text": "From Geoffrey Anyanwu and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nBenue Governor, Samuel Ortom, yesterday said only justice, equity and fairness will end Biafra and other agitations by various ethnic nationalities in Nigeria.\n\nHe lamented the trend where those who demand for equal rights and freedom, and an end to injustice and marginalisation, were hurriedly declared terrorists by the state, while those who kill innocent citizens were pampered.\n\nThe governor said the South East has been at the receiving end of such levels of injustice, impunity and marginalisation. He also flayed the President Muhamamdu Buhari-led government for lopsided appointments, nepotism and other acts of sectionalism, particularly from 2015 to date, alleging these have divided Nigeria now more than at any other time in its history.\n\nOrtom stated this in Enugu while delivering the keynote address at the 3rd Lecture Series/Service Award and inauguration of executives of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN) Chapter, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Enugu State Council.\n\nThe Benue governor whose address was on \u201cEmerging security situation in the South East: the place of good governance,\u201d said the Federal Government had the capacity to tackle the country\u2019s security challenges, but had chosen not to.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that the Federal Government has chosen to play double standards in its handling of security situation as it affects some regions, especially the South East, North Central, South South and South West, while at the same time treating with kid gloves, the menace of killer Fulani herdsmen, bandits and other terrorists in the North East and North West.\n\n\u201cThe speed with which the leader of Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho, were arrested confirmed the fact that the Federal Government has the capacity to tackle insecurity with determination and commitment. We live in a country today where those who demand for equal rights and freedom to end the wave of injustice and marginalization are hurriedly declared terrorists, while real terrorists who invade communities and kill hundreds of innocent people are pampered and given government protection.\n\n\u201cThe South East has been at the receiving end of such levels of injustice, impunity and marginalization. Let me make myself very clear. I am not a supporter of violence in any form, neither am I here to justify the violence being witnessed in parts of the South East. This is why I condemn in strong terms, the destruction of Federal Government properties such as INEC offices, attacks on police stations, law enforcement operatives and even traditional rulers. Such attacks and destruction do not make a positive case for freedom fighters and campaigners for justice. Dialogue remains the best option in any dispute.\u201d\n\nOrtom said ongoing agitations by youths of the South East were as a result of years of neglect, injustice, unfairness and lack of equity by leaders of the country.\n\n\u201cI, Samuel Ortom, will never keep quiet as long as injustice and marginalisation prevail in the affairs of our country. I want peace that is anchored on equity, fairness and justice. The lopsided federal appointments, nepotism and other acts of sectionalism, particularly from 2015 to date, have divided Nigeria now more than at any other time in the country\u2019s history. The Federal Character Principle as enshrined in the Constitution has been abused and abandoned by the present administration. This is where leadership has failed Nigerians and good governance has also been relegated to the back seat.\n\n\u201cEastern Nigeria, like other parts of the country, deserves equal attention with the provision of critical infrastructure and development projects, as well as allocation of resources and key appointments at the federal level. No section of this nation is more Nigerian than another. My definition of democracy is doing what the people want the way they want things done. As leaders, we owe the people who voted us a duty to serve them without prejudice and sentiments on account of region, religion, ethnicity, language and political affiliation.\n\n\u201cThe present administration has introduced selective persecution and prosecution of perceived political opponents. Its fight against corruption is only targeted at those who hold alternative views.They have been intimidating members of other political parties with EFCC and other anti-corruption agencies. For instance, in Benue State, no day passes without one or more appointees of government being invited and intimidated by EFCC simply because I have refused to bow to the strings of threats and harassment from Abuja to betray my people.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThe police force headquarters in Abuja, Thursday paraded three suspects said to be the mastermind in the kidnap of 136, students of Bethel Baptist school, in Kaduna State.\n\nThe suspects Adamu Bello, Isiaku Lawal and Muazu Abubakar, dressed in military camouflage were arrested by operatives of the Tactical Squad(STS). The suspects who confessed to the crime, said that 25 of them took part in the kidnap of the students from their hostel. They said they embarked on the deadly operation out of poverty.\n\nThe suspects were paraded by the force public relations officer Frank Mba.\n\nOne of the suspects, Abubakar said \u201ctwenty five of us carried out the operation. We kidnapped 136 students and I got N100,000 as my own share from the money.\u201d\n\nThe Special Tactical Squad (STS) commanded by DCP Yusuf Kolo also arrested a fake army captain from\n\nNasarawa state, Monday Akawu who specialised in stealing musical instruments from churches in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nAkawu, 39, and member of a dreaded criminal group who specializes in robbing churches, is said to have robbed over 16 churches within Nyanya and Karu axis of the federal capital territory, FCT.\n\nAkawu, was paraded alongside his accomplice and buyer of the stolen church equipment, Joseph Orazulike, 35, resident of EFAB Estate, Maraba, Karu.\n\nparading the suspects, Mba, said, the suspects have committed a \u201csacrilegious act\u201d and thereby urged church leaders to provide \u201cmore security around their churches.\u201d\n\nAkawu confessed that, he has participated in the burglary of at least 16 churches located in Nasarawa and some parts of Abuja. He listed some of the churches he had robbed to include The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) and Mountain of Fire Ministries (MFM).\n\nWhen going for the operation, he said he usually dress in Army uniform for east passage beat security check points after each robbery.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI am here because I stole from the church. I have so far stolen from sixteen churches, which includes Mountain of Fire and Redeemed Church of God.\n\n\u201cWhen I break into a church my boss taught me to bring those instruments out while a vehicle comes with Nigeria Army uniforms; I change into the uniform in order to bypass security on the road.\n\n\u201cI usually sell each piano keyboard between 60,000 to 90,000 naira depending on how neat they are.\u201d\n\nAlso paraded was one Monday, an ex-convict who was jailed at Kuja Prison over a rape case while Joseph was also arrested before for receiving stolen items.\n\nBriefing newsmen further on some of the recent operations and investigative breakthroughs by operatives of the special Tactical squad in Abuja, Mba said fifty suspects comprising 48 male and two females were arrested.\n\nThe suspects, he said have been indicted for different offences ranging from murder, kidnapping, cattle rustling, armed robbery, car theft, illegal possessions of prohibited firearms, possession and distribution of illicit drugs among other offences established against them.\n\nMba, listed items recovered from the suspects to include: 26 assorted firearms, made up 13 AK 47 rifles, four soft machine guns, four locally made pistols, four dane guns, 2, 701 live ammunition of AK 47, 20 live GPMG ammunition, 12 Piano Keyboard and other electronic appliances stolen from churches.\n\nThe FPRO, who said investigations conducted so far showed how Monday Akawu, the principal suspect has had a long pathway with crime. He however assured that the suspect has reached the end of the road as the force would do everything possible within the law to ensure that he spent the remaining years in jail.\n\nHe called on Church leaders in Abuja and across the country to ensure physical security in and around their church premises. He said the suspect during interrogation told detectives that most churches do not have secure guards thus making their premises vulnerable for criminals to operate without confrontation.\n\nHe said \u201cencourage church operators and leaders not just to provide human guards but also install cameras in their churches and ensure sufficient lighting in and around your churches.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we are also calling on all church leaders in and around Abuja that might have been affected in recent time to visit STS office with means of identification to recover their stolen items.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nChairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, has taken a swipe at his Kaduna State counterpart, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, for castigating southern governors over their anti-open grazing stance.\n\nGovernor El-rufai, during a visit at the headquarters of the All Progressives Congress (APC), had warned his southern counterparts that it was unhelpful politicising anti-open grazing law and passing legislation that they know cannot be implemented.\n\n\u201cThe northern state governors forum has already taken a position that open grazing is not a sustainable way of livestock production. And we must move towards ranching. But moving towards ranching cannot be done overnight. We have to have a plan, we have to have resources and we have to implement it sensibly. It is not a matter of populist legislation or saying tomorrow this or that. It is not a solution.\n\nBut Akeredolu said the comment by El-Rufai was devious and showed his support for banditry. He said southern governors were against open grazing and no amount of threat would make them change their position.\n\nThe Ondo governor stated this in a statement by his Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo.\n\n\u201cFrom all indications, Governor Nasir el-Rufai, if he was properly quoted and his views not misrepresented, is struggling hard to export banditry to the south under an expressed opinion that is laced with mischief. In these days and times, anyone who makes statements such as that allegedly made by the governor belongs to a class of an unenviable ilk masquerading as leaders.\n\n\u201cThere is no wisdom in condemning or banning open grazing, prohibiting inter border movement of cattle in the north, including Kaduna, with an accompanying disapproval of a law that gives bite to same, in another part of the country. Perhaps, it is apt to state clearly that the likes of Governor el-Rufai are already in a hysteric \u2018mode\u2019 of escalating and indeed, externalising banditry, especially as the military onslaught against criminal elements and other terror variants suffices in the north. For emphasis, any such comment like that of the Kaduna Governor, if indeed he made that statement, merely seeks to encourage anarchy under the guise \u201cof resentment of a law by affected stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order words, it is a cleverly crafted path towards replicating in the south, the most despicable situation in the north that Nigerians of goodwill daily pray to overcome. It\u2019s a ploy beyond the ordinary. It must, however, be noted that the Anti-Grazing Law, especially in Ondo State, has come to stay. It shall be zealously guarded and conscionable deployed to protect all residents of Ondo State, notwithstanding their ethnic and religious biases. Those who have nothing evil to perpetrate have nothing to fear as regards the Law.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Osun State government has began the sensitisation of herdsmen on the recently-passed anti-open grazing law.\n\nThe sensitisation, which had heads of herders groups in the state in attendance, was organised by the state\u2019s civic centre.\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola had signed the Bill into law on September 15.\n\nSpeaking at the sensitisation, Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement, Mr. Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, said the programme was put in place to sensitise herdsmen on the content of the law.\n\nHe said the programme was to let the herdsmen understand that the law was not meant to witch-hunt or segregate them in the state.\n\n\u201cThe programme is also to educate them to operate within the ambit of the law and not to claim ignorance of it,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "Over 300 suspects arrested by the Nigerian government for funding Boko Haram terrorists have been released, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSaharaReporters had in April reported how over 400 persons were arrested by security agencies during a nationwide crackdown on the suspected financiers of terror in Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nThe operation was said to have been approved by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2020.\n\nConfirming the report a few days later, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) had said the Nigerian government embarked on \u201ca wider and far-reaching investigation\u201d into terrorism financing after the conviction of Boko Haram financiers in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSee Also Politics Why Buhari Government Will Not Name Sponsors Of Boko Haram Now\u2014Justice Minister, Malami\n\nBut on Wednesday, Malami, who is in the United States as part of Buhari\u2019s entourage to the United Nations General Assembly, said his office had reviewed over 1,000 case files out of which 285 had been filed before the Federal High Court.\n\nMalami was reacting to public criticism over the secrecy surrounding the identities of the alleged financiers of Boko Haram as Buhari\u2019s government has shunned all calls to name the terror sponsors.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates recently listed the names of 38 sponsors of terrorism, which include six Nigerians.\n\nHowever, sources told SaharaReporters on Thursday that while Nigerians were clamouring for the identities of the terror sponsors to be released to the public, Malami had already facilitated the release of many of them after collecting bribes from the most powerful ones among them.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier on Thursday published a list of 45 names out of the 400 suspects said to have been sponsoring terrorists.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Names Of 45 Out Of 400 Suspected Boko Haram Sponsors Buhari Government Is Hiding From Nigerians\n\nBut according to a source, the 45 suspects are the \u201cinsignificant foot soldiers of terror financiers\u201d being detained by an ex parte order while others have been released.\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively obtained documents including an affidavit in support of a motion filed by the prosecution (Nigerian government) to seek the continued detention of the suspects at \u201cWu Bassey Barracks, Asokoro, Abuja for 90 days pending the conclusion of investigations by the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Intelligence Corps\u201d.\n\nThe affidavit deposed to at the Federal High Court Registry by a litigation officer in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Federation says: \u201cThe suspects were arrested by troops of Operation Lafia Dole in Kaduna, Kano, Niger, Borno, Lagos and Zamfara states in relation to terrorism activities in the country.\n\n\u201cOngoing investigation revealed that the suspects have links with the Boko Haram Terrorist Group. That the investigation is advancing and suspects have access to legal practitioners of their choice. That it is in the interest of justice that the suspects be remanded pending conclusion of investigation as there are chances that the investigation will be compromised if the suspects are released on bail. That the court has the power to grant the application.\u201d\n\nThose detained as earlier exclusively published by SaharaReporters include Saidu Ahmed, Ibrahim Sani Bello, Mustapha Musa Adamu, Abubakar Sadiq Garba, Hussein Adamu, Muhammed Sani Adam, Abdulrahman Ibrahim, Ghazali Yusuf, Yusuf Ali Yusuf, Abubakar Adamu Yellow, Zahuraddeen Bashir, Haruna Garba Garo, Ibrahim Aliyu Usman, Hassan Idris, Musa Emma, Alhashim Mohammed Almashim, Baba Samaila, Bulama Tahir, Abubakar Ali, Mohammed Ambare, Danlami Hassan Nadabo, Danladi Talle Inuwa, Bashir Ali, and Mansur Muhammad Usaman.\n\nOthers are Musa Tasiu Ya\u2019u, Auwalu Ali Alhassan, Sadi Saidu Abdullahi, Suraj Adamu, Muhammed Auwalu, Ismaila Abdullaziz Mohammed, Munzali Ashiru Gambo, Yazid Muhammad Usman, Nabil Zakari, Gambo Auwalu, Muhammed Abba, Bashir Idris Shuaibu, Mohammed Yahaya, Auwalu Ibrahim, Abdullahi Umar Usman, Dahiru Umar Mohammed, Abdullahi Mohammed, Abubakar Yahaya, Hussaini Lawali Idrisu, Ladann Ibrahim, and Nurudeen Gani Aliyu.\n\nA security source told SaharaReporters on Thursday that Malami ordered the release of the \u201cbig fish\u201d or prominent and powerful ones among the 400 suspects initially arrested after collecting bribes from them.\n\nThe source added that those being detained are \u201cinsignificant foot soldiers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe arrested about 400 of them but he collected bribes from the most powerful ones and they have since been released. Yesterday (Wednesday), he claimed there were 275 of them left, in an interview he had in New York. Most of the 275 he mentioned have also been freed.\n\n\u201cSome powerful Northern Emirs intervened on their behalf. Only an ex parte order to detain were filed against these 45 persons before Justice Anwulika Chikere of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Unfortunately, she was a vacation judge and has now travelled.\n\n\u201cShe is retiring in about three months\u2019 time. Only about 45 names were submitted to her instead of 275 the Minister claimed yesterday. These are all the strategies being used by Malami who has already left the big terror financiers off the hook.\n\n\u201cThe 45 persons are insignificant foot soldiers of terror financiers. And if you check the documents very well, most of them have already filed fundamental rights challenge against the government and are billed to be granted bail anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThat Honorable Justice Anwulika Chikere handling the case was born on 28th December 1956, so she is bound to take a bow on December 28, 2021, which is just three months from now.\u201d\n\nAnd going by documents exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters, most of the suspects currently being detained have already filed Fundamental Rights challenges and are billed to be granted bail.\n\nThough the documents also contain a list of the names of 45 suspected sponsors of terrorism, there is nothing to show that any charges have been filed against them since their arrest.\n\nConfirming that even the suspects currently being held will also regain their freedom, another source said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that no one has been charged according to the documents; the ex parte filed contained zero evidence they carried out anything. They are billed to be granted bail.\u201d",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",
          "summary": "Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\nBut one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams.\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021.\nThat\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.",

          "text": "In June 2016, Ventures Platform launched as an innovation hub where tech enthusiasts, freelancers, startup founders, and professionals in Nigeria could meet, network, and co-create. The 1,200-square-meter hub in Abuja also served as a residential base for technology entrepreneurs on the continent selected to go through the VP accelerator programme.\n\nOver the past five years, Ventures Platform has changed its investment strategy from the accelerator model to become one of the leading early-stage funds in Africa while it spun off the innovation hub business, now managed by its subsidiary Ventures Park.\n\nWith the recent surge in fundraising, tech activity, and uptake of remote freelance jobs in Nigeria, Ventures Park has seen its community of active users nearly double from just over 100 in early 2021 to almost 200. In response to the increase, the company has launched a bigger campus, in Abuja, to provide greater support to its community.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria has the highest number of startups in Africa, according to findings by fDi Intelligence of Financial Times, in collaboration with Briter Bridges. As of August, a report by Disrupt Africa showed that Nigerian startups accounted for the biggest share of the $1.1 billion funding the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem had attracted this year.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, yet remote work shows no signs of going away. The social distancing rules, public gathering restrictions, and other lockdown measures that were imposed to curb the spread of the virus forced companies across the world to adopt remote work options to keep their businesses running.\n\nThat reality has also played out in Nigeria. While most people in the country still work from physical offices amid the health crisis, a few companies, such as Andela, Paystack, and Buycoins, have fully embraced the work-from-home idea.\n\nBut there are significant barriers to the success or long-term adoption of remote work; such as Nigeria\u2019s inefficient power grid and irregular electricity supply as well as poor network connectivity and high internet costs. Nigeria ranks among countries with the most expensive data in the world.\n\nImage credit: Supplied by Ventures Park.\n\nA shared workspace at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja. Image credit: Supplied\n\nInnovation hubs and co-working spaces like the new Ventures Platform campus in Abuja are equipped with power and internet amenities that help freelancers work and entrepreneurs build better.\n\nThe new 2,000-sq-meter hub is located in Wuse II, Abuja, and has the capacity to accommodate over 200 people. It has facilities such as private and shared offices, dedicated desks, restaurants, and spaces designed to host events, conferences, fun activities, and more.\n\nOn the walls of the new campus are displays of several contemporary Nigerian art, which help create a stimulating and stress-free work environment. \u201cAt Ventures Park, we believe fundamentally that the space people work in influences the kind of work they produce,\u201d Kola Aina, founder of Ventures Platform told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThe Chill Zone.

Oguchi explains that the company believes that talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn\u2019t evenly distributed.\n\n\u201cIf everyone continued to focus on Lagos, we\u2019d miss out on talents in other parts of Nigeria,\u201d she said. \u201cWe chose Abuja to cater to the community and build the ecosystem here and since we launched, we\u2019ve seen real progress in tech activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aina, Ventures Platform, since its launch, has been deliberate about wanting to provide opportunities in Abuja and the broader northern region of the country. \u201cMany years later, the ecosystem in Abuja and northern Nigeria has grown significantly and we\u2019re proud to have been part of that process.\u201d\n\nVentures Park offers different free and paid membership plans for people looking to make use of the campus, including low-cost options from as low as N1,500 ($2.7).\n\n\u201cWe understand how important it is for people to work with budgets,\u201d Oguchi said. \u201cCompanies can book a space for a two or three-hour meeting and we also have several membership plans for individuals and startups.\u201d\n\nThe training room at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja.

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never had much contact with deaf people. Of course, that is to be expected as I didn\u2019t know any deaf people.\n\nIn later years, I would come to \u2014 unconsciously \u2014 associate being deaf with being poor. Why? I only saw deaf people while travelling through Nigerian roads to or from school or during village visits to see my grandparents.\n\nThey had on old clothes and would constantly thrust or \u2014 if the paper was too big \u2014 display a note asking you to give some money to the deaf people or an orphanage or a motherless baby\u2019s home. Interestingly, they were always smiling, and I always wondered why.\n\nDuring the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, I had to reconfigure my perceptions when I met a young girl who we will call Mary. Big brown eyes, small \u2014 at least for a five-year-old her \u2014 funny, smart, beautiful, silent \u2014 at first \u2014 deaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I interacted with her, a lot of my misconceptions began to fall away. Poor? Nope. Beggar? Nope. Because she\u2019s hard of hearing, you have to speak really loud or use signs so she can understand.\n\nBut, I got really incensed after learning that her parents refused to acknowledge her deafness. They put her in a regular school with no access to sign language classes to help her communicate.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t entirely deaf, like Mary, basic technology like a hearing aid or an implant would make it easier to communicate and understand people.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of Sign Languages we talked to members of the deaf community. You can choose to watch the video or read down, or both. Happy International Day of Sign Language. #WeSignForHumanRights\n\nNigeria\u2019s deaf community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\n\nAccording to Oluwaseun Sosanya, a sign language interpreter, tutor, and deaf advocate, the deaf community \u201cis a collection of people that share the same idea, belief, and culture, and use sign language to communicate.\n\n\u201cThe community includes the two categories of deaf \u2014 pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf \u2014 parents of the deaf, sign language interpreters, and all users of sign language.\n\n\u201cPre-lingual deaf are people born naturally deaf, who\u2019ve spoken no language. And the post-lingual deaf are people who were once talking and hearing but later became deaf as a result of illness or accident.\u201d\n\nUsing Sosanya\u2019s explanation, Mary is a pre-lingual deaf person.\n\nBut beyond this is the rich history and culture of the deaf people and those who have accepted and are proud of this identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlaoluwa Bayonle, another sign language interpreter, says, \u201cIt is a community of people, I mean the deaf people and hard of hearing people, who have accepted their deafness, their inability to hear, and are proud of this identity. The community is established with a different culture from the hearing community.\n\n\u201cThe members of this community are the deaf people, the hard of hearing, the sign language users, and the friends of the deaf. The official language of this community is sign language.\u201d\n\nSign language is a huge part of the deaf community culture. It is the unique way in which the deaf and friends of the deaf communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\nFor the African deaf community, the prevalent sign language is the American Sign Language (ASL) which Andrew Foster \u2014 regarded as the Father of Deaf Education in Africa \u2014 brought into the continent.\n\nHe would go on to found West Africa\u2019s first School for the Deaf in Ghana and Nigeria\u2019s first, the Ibadan Mission School for the Deaf, in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHowever, many African countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Mali have created their own sign languages. Nigeria does have a sign language, but it is not officially recognised and as widely used as the ASL.\n\nInterestingly, there are currently over 300 recognised variations of sign language.\n\nOne thing I noticed is how accommodating and welcoming members of the community are. A fact which Seun Dosunmu, a disability inclusion advocate, echoes when he says, \u201cThe deaf community, the deaf persons majorly, are very accommodating and always willing to engage and participate in activities, especially when they are invited.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, they face a lot of stigmatisation and rarely is provision made for their inclusion.\n\n\u201cMany people do not consider inclusion, so they don\u2019t make interpreters available. And this is the major reason why there is a gap, and there is marginalisation as we have it.\u201d\n\nA tale of signs and inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\n\nMary\u2019s parents believe her hearing issues stem from a spiritual problem and take her for deliverance sessions, hoping to drive away the demon of deafness.\n\nThis is very common in the African setting, where many people view deaf people as sick, retarded, or demon-possessed.\n\nAs Treasures Uchegbu, Convener and CEO SpeakingFingers, says while talking about the challenges deaf people face, \u201cCommunication/Information, attitudinal (words and behaviours) barriers which I refer to as the cancer of all challenges \u2014 referring to the deaf as dumb. Then that one about putting a leaf in the mouth which could be perceived as calling them goats.\n\n\u201cOr an average primary four child whom I asked \u2018Who are the users of sign language?\u2019 In response, he said, \u2018mumu people!!!\u2019 I\u2019m sure he got that from his immediate environment. So I ask if this young boy grows into a policymaker, will he make policies to cover \u2018mumu people?\u2019 Of course not.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the Nigerian Federal Government passed the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act into law. The Act established the National Commission of Persons with Disabilities and includes several provisions such as accessibility aids in public places and better inclusion of the disabled in workplaces, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\nHowever, the curve is pretty steep. According to a 2018 study by Emmanuel Ihenchi Asonye and two others, about 23% of Nigeria\u2019s population are deaf people. Most of that number live below the poverty line, with little to no access to healthcare, education, and employment.\n\nAnd as Douglas Izuchukwu, President of the National Association of Deaf Students, says, \u201cthe biggest challenge, communication barrier.\u201d\n\nDosunmu recalls having to intervene in the case of a deaf person who had been living with tuberculosis for a while. After taking him to a specialist hospital, they faced another challenge, none of the doctors or nurses understood sign language, and there was no interpreter.\n\nThis inability to communicate is a common occurrence, leading to either an untreated patient or a wrong diagnosis. Thankfully, they were able to get an interpreter in time.\n\nIn so many ways, the capacity to communicate is hindered, and a lot of the time, privacy is compromised on the hill of interpretation.\n\nFor the hearing community, technology enhances communication. Social media networks like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Discord serve to bring people together.\n\nA lot of this tech is mainly geared towards what the hearing community needs, with little to no thought, if any, for the needs of deaf people. Some, like the live-audio craze which began with Clubhouse, do not even have any provisions for them.\n\nBut, in some ways, technology is trying to bridge the communication gap.\n\nCommunicating in a tech-enabled world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights\n\nAccording to Izuchukwu, \u201cTechnology is now doing well, trying. On YouTube, we have automatic captions, time to control the captions, and time to control how the speakers speak. That is what technology is doing. And again, Google Meet too has automatic captioning.\u201d\n\nBut he wants technology to do more.\n\n\u201cFor example, on WhatsApp, when someone sends voice notes, there should be a place on WhatsApp where one can click to turn on automatic captions, for deaf people to read and benefit. Same way it is on YouTube, I wish WhatsApp too has the feature. And the feature applies to other applications like Zoom and others.\u201d\n\nIzuchuwku, speaking from the perspective of a deaf person, really just wants inclusion.\n\nAnd technology has already done so much.\n\n1. The use of social media to spread awareness and advocate for more inclusion.\n\n2. Assistive technology like Speech-to-Text, which helps translation from spoken words into text.\n\n3. Hearing aids and cochlear implants, which enable deaf or hard of hearing people retain some part of all parts of their hearing ability.\n\n4. Mobile apps that provide sign language tutoring for beginners, such as the ASL American Sign Language and the Ghanian Sign Language app.\n\n5. Automatic captions on YouTube and Google Meet, which use artificial intelligence to automatically transmit what is being said during webinars or in online videos.\n\nThere have also been technology mishaps, such as the sign language hand glove that translates sign language into words. The deaf community believed it to be more accommodating of the hearing community without regard to the deaf people \u2014 who it was purporting to help.\n\nAlso, assistive technology like Speech-to-Text and automatic captioning have limits as they do not always provide an accurate translation, which is doubly worse in the African scenario.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Funmi Ogunro, Head of School, Friends of the Deaf Academy, says they had to move the school online, using WhatsApp and Facebook groups. Eventually, they received support from Gradely, a personalised e-learning platform for 300 students.\n\nDosunmu suggests that more people learn sign language or at the very least make more interpreters available in public places such as banks, hospitals, courts, etc. Some apps help people learn sign language on both Android and iOS stores. Although, there seems to be a dearth of Nigerian made or focused apps.\n\nHowever, despite technological advancements, deaf people still face discrimination and exclusion, especially regarding information. Dosunmu says that most deaf persons have little to no access to computers and do not even have smartphones. How then do they access the technology?\n\nInternational Day of Sign Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sign for human rights\n\nThe International Day of Sign Languages is observed annually on September 23 as part of the International Week of Deaf People.\n\nThis year, the World Federation of the Deaf has given daily themes for the Week \u2014 Monday, September 20 to Sunday, September 26.\n\nMonday: Cherishing Deaf History\n\nTuesday: Sustainable Deaf Leadership\n\nWednesday: Sign Languages for All Deaf Learners\n\nThursday: We Sign For Human Rights\n\nFriday: Intersectional Deaf Communities\n\nSaturday: Deaf Culture and Arts\n\nSunday: Human Rights in Times of Crisis\n\nEach theme represents an important topic in the deaf community, with inclusion as the central theme.\n\nBeyond their disabilities, deaf people are human beings who have rights \u2014 the right to fair treatment, employment, and the right to inclusion.\n\nWhat\u2019s common to Ludwig van Beethoven, Helen Keller, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Foster.\n\nDeafness and partial or complete hearing loss. But there\u2019s more. Despite their disability, considered a hindrance by many, they accomplished remarkable things.\n\nAnd Opeoluwa Sotonwa \u2014 a deaf Nigerian American attorney, disability rights advocate, and literary writer \u2014 has borrowed a leaf from these greats.\n\nBeing deaf is not a curse. The deaf should not be segregated. They shouldn\u2019t be made to feel stupid or unworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Speaking Fingers Network\n\nNGOs like Friends of the Deaf Foundation, Collaboration of Deaf and Hearing Adults (CODAH) Enterprise, and Speaking Fingers Network provide helpful resources like free hearing aids, including persons with disabilities in their programmes, build inclusive private schools, and provide life skills to support learning and development.\n\nHowever, in the search for inclusion, we all have a part to play. Among other things, we can design sign language learning apps, inclusive audio/video with subtitling and automatic captioning. It can, and should, be done.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCDC Group\u2019s $50.9m commitment\n\nZOLA Electric\u2019s digital energy\n\nFlutterwave and 9PSB\u2019s partnership\n\nCDC\u2019s $50.9m commitment to Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick O\u2019Donohoe, CDC Group CEO. Image source: Nairametrics\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? CDC Group, a UK-based development finance institution (DFI) and impact investor, has announced a $50.9 million commitment to Africa\u2019s digital infrastructure.\n\nAccording to the CDC Group website, the commitment is to \u201cexpand digital infrastructure, boost rural connectivity and accelerate digital technology access for rural and underserved communities across sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the amount, $40 million will go to the Convergence Partners Digital Infrastructure Fund (CPDIF), an investment management firm that\u2019ll invest the fund in data centres, fibre networks, 5G technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of things (IoT).\n\nThe remaining $10.9 million will go into expanding Africa Mobile Networks\u2019 (AMN) infrastructure. AMN is the fifth-largest independent tower company operating in Africa. This investment will help expand its mobile network to more rural areas.\n\nWhy does this matter? According to CDC Group\u2019s Managing Director and Head of Private Equity Funds, Clarisa De Franco, digital inclusion will create many opportunities in Africa.\n\nPer Global System for Mobile Communications Association\u2019s (GSMA) mobile Internet connectivity 2020 fact sheet, 270 million out of 1.1 billion people in sub-Saharan Africa are connected to mobile Internet, leaving 930 million without a mobile Internet connection.\n\nWill CDC Group\u2019s $50.9 million commitment close this wide gap soon?\n\nDigitising energy with ZOLA Electric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage source: Digest Africa\n\nWith about 600 million people out of 1.07 billion in sub-Saharan Africa without access to electricity, lack of power in Africa continues to impair economic growth.\n\nAlthough some parts of the continent have high connection rates to a power grid, they don\u2019t translate to a constant electricity supply.\n\nNigeria is a good case in point. According to Afrobarometer, the country has a 90% connection rate, but the rate of power supply stands at 17%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrica-focused ZOLA Electric wants to solve this problem with its smart batteries. They not only store power from sources including solar and power grids but also manage power and give real-time information on consumption.\n\nThe idea for the company, which currently serves over 1.5 million people in Africa, was conceived in a Malawian fishing village\n\nRead the story here: Tesla-backed ZOLA Electric is solving Africa\u2019s energy shortage by digitising energy\n\nFlutterwave and 9PSB partnership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? African payments gateway company, Flutterwave, has partnered with 9PSB, a Payment Service Bank (PSB) and a subsidiary of 9mobile, to facilitate seamless financial services in Nigeria.\n\nPer Flutterwave\u2019s blog, companies will launch a \u201csuite of products\u201d together. Branka Mracajac, 9PSB\u2019s CEO, says, \u201cexisting agents, partners, and customers will have a single point of entry to enjoy various products and services provided by Flutterwave.\u201d\n\nShe adds that both companies are committed to delivering financial solutions to the unbanked, under-banked, and underserved.\n\nSpeaking of the unbanked, 9PSB was one of the three PSBs the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) approved in August 2020 to boost financial inclusion. The others are Hope PSB and Moneymaster PSB.\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), as of September 18, 2021, only 50 million of Nigeria\u2019s adult population of 105.8 million had their Bank Verification Number (BVN).\n\nWhile the introduction of PSBs by the CBN was meant to deepen financial inclusion, the entry requirements and limitations for PSBs, according to the current guidelines, makes it difficult.\n\nYou might want to revisit: Why Payment Service Banks could face an uphill battle in the Nigerian market\n\nAlso: Why Payment Service Banks might not impact Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion drive\n\nFlutterwave and 9PSB\u2019s partnership might be a way to circumvent the limitations of PSBs as they look to impact Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion drive.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\niPad Mini 2021 Review: Pocketable Power!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is the flagship project of the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 which was founded via a comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade agreement with the principal aim of integrating Africa\u2019s market.\n\nRemarkably, AfCFTA is potentially the largest free trade area in the world with the capacity to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty by connecting over 1.3 billion people across 55 countries having a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of about US$3.4 trillion.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement establishing AfCFTA (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) was signed on 21st March 2018 but came into force on 30th May 2019 following the deposit of the instruments of ratification by 24 countries. As of April 19, 2021, 54 countries have signed the Agreement while 36 countries (including Nigeria) have deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union Commission (AUC) Chairperson. Notably, trading under the AfCFTA Agreement officially commenced on January 1, 2021, subject to negotiations on protocols and instruments of trade.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement has three layers comprising the AfCFTA Agreement itself which serves as a framework agreement, the Protocols and the Annexes, Guidelines, and Schedules to the Protocols. The Agreement had two phases of negotiations. Under Phase I negotiations, the Protocols on Trade in Goods, Trade in Services, and Dispute Settlement entered into force concurrently with the AfCFTA Agreement. Phase II negotiations on the other hand will birth the Protocols on Investment, Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) and Competition Policy.\n\nIt was initially hoped that Phase II negotiations would be completed by January 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timeline has been delayed.\n\n\n\nThe Agreement (PDF) summarises AfCFTA\u2019s goals into eight objectives which includes, creating a single market for goods and services, creating a liberalised market for goods and services, contributing to the movement of capital and people and facilitating investment, creating a continental customs union, promoting sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development and gender equality, enhancing competitiveness of economies of State Parties and lastly resolving challenges of multiple memberships while expediting regional and continental integration process.\n\nBeyond the objectives listed in the Agreement, AfCFTA seeks to boost Africa\u2019s economic output to around $29 trillion by 2050 and increase intra-African trade by 52.3%.\n\nAfCFTA and the Nigerian IP market\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Nollywood by Aimee Corrigan via Wikipedia Commons.\n\nIn recent times, the international and global economy has been driven by innovation, creativity, knowledge, and technology each of which is fundamentally supported by intellectual property (IP) and intellectual property rights (IPR).\n\nResearch has shown that countries with the largest economies are largely driven by IP. For developing countries, IP can be used to promote economic development by encouraging innovation. To encourage innovation, there must be an enabling environment safeguarded by a robust IP Policy that will ensure that creatives and investors recover the cost of investment and maximise the benefits generated from their innovations or creative work.\n\nA typical example is Nigeria which is home to a rich and dynamic creative sector, star among them the Nigerian film industry, also referred to as Nollywood. According to a 2016 IMF report, the Nigerian film industry currently accounts for \u20a6853.9 billion ($7.2 billion), or 1.42 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP and arguably the country\u2019s second-biggest source of employment after agriculture.\n\nNigeria\u2019s creative and innovative industries, however, stretch far beyond the film industry and include activities ranging from music and publishing to computer software and the manufacturing industries; each with enormous potential for growth.\n\nDespite the obvious economic possibilities in Nigeria\u2019s creative and innovative industries, Nigeria does not have an IP Policy to facilitate the mainstreaming of the economic value of IP into the government\u2019s National Economic Plan. Consequently, the value of IP and IPRs are not adequately recognised and harnessed by policymakers as an important tool for national development that needs to be promoted and protected.\n\nRemarkably, the facilitation of the flow of knowledge-rich goods and services across borders have become integral considerations in development and trade policy, which is the underpinning of World Trade Organisation\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\n\nThe Protocol on Intellectual Property Rights (\u201cIPR Protocol\u201d) which will be negotiated during Phase II of AfCFTA has vast possibilities for IP which must be explored. According to the World Bank, the IPR Protocol can serve as a catalyst for technology transfer, technology diffusion and the economic transformation of Africa\u2019s economy from one that is primarily resource-based, to one that is driven by knowledge, information, and ideas.\n\nWith AfCFTA, creatives and investors can have access to a larger market by extending the territorial recognition and protection of IP to its 54-signatory member territories. With an extended territorial recognition and protection of IP, creatives can exploit and maximise the value in IP by benefiting from the use of IP beyond its national territories. More so, the extension of territorial recognition and protection of IP will reduce the cost of registering and safeguarding IPR in territories of signatory members.\n\nAfCTA\u2019s extensive reach and influence can be utilised to achieve the standardisation and unification of IP policies in Africa by including a robust IP policy in the IPR Protocol which will be applicable in signatory members countries upon adoption. The IPR Protocol may also be used as a vehicle to establish a centralised and integrated IP registry (possibly with branches in member countries) for African Countries.\n\nIn conclusion, AfCFTA is a laudable initiative that can potentially expand Africa\u2019s fiscal opportunities and significantly improve the economy of African countries. However, to fully achieve its objective, AfCFTA must unlock the economic value of IP in Africa by ensuring that while goods and services are being transferred freely across African territories, the underlining IPRs are protected.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "MultiChoice Nigeria Limited said Thursday that it has paid N8 billion in two tranches to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) account as required by the law guiding disputes over tax evasion.\n\nMultiChoice, the parent company of popular subscription-based platforms in Nigeria- DSTV and Gotv, made this known at the resumption of the tribunal hearing over a tax evasion dispute with the FIRS.\n\nThe FIRS claims that MultiChoice owes back taxes worth N1.8 trillion, a claim the company disputes.\n\nThe company is however required by Paragraph 15(7)(c) of the fifth schedule of the FIRS Act, 2007, to pay 50 percent of the tax paid the previous year plus 10 percent mark-up as security before prosecuting an appeal.\n\nAt the last hearing, the Tax Appeal Tribunal had upheld the FIRS submission and directed MultiChoice to deposit with the FIRS an amount equals 50 percent of the assessment under the appeal plus a sum equal to 10 percent of the said deposit as a condition for further hearing of the appeal.\n\nThe directive had generated confusion among stakeholders as FIRS had asked the company to pay 50 percent of the disputed sum (N900 billion) under assessment.\n\nMultichoice insists the amount is \u201carbitrary.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo science to it and respondent (FIRS) contrived the numbers,\u201d MultiChoice said of the N1.8 trillion tax claim.\n\nRead Also: Multichoice denies receiving notice from FIRS amid \u20a61.8trn tax fraud allegation\n\n\u201cThe reality of the appellant\u2019s (MultiChoice) business is far from what the respondent fixes in its office,\u201d the company told the tribunal at the resumed hearing.\n\n\u201cIn respect of this dispute, N8 billion has been paid in the case pursuant to paragraph 15(7) of the FIRS Act. And N2bn in respect of VAT in another matter here before your honour,\u201d Multichoice said.\n\n\u201cWe provided two options for the tribunal to work with. Either for 2010 as a preceding year for 2011 or 2019 because we want it to expedite actions. The N1.8trn burden is resting on our finances and our auditors will look at our books if we did not get it out quickly,\u201d the company added.\n\nThe FIRS however urged the administrative court to discontinue the hearing of the appeal and enter judgment against MultiChoice if the company fails to fully comply with the directive of 50 percent of the N1.8 trillion tax assessment for the years under review.\n\n\u201cWe make this submission on the basis that the appellant while they have filed certain affidavit in which they purport to verify that they have complied with the tribunal\u2026 those documents are self-contradictory, lacked value. The duty is for the appellant to prove they have complied with the tribunal order,\u201d FIRS said.\n\n\u201cOur prayer is made on the basis of the provision of paragraph 15 sub 7 of the 5th schedule of FIRS Establishment Act.\n\n\u201cWe urged the tribunal to refer to paragraph 3 of the appellant\u2019s owned amendment notice of appeal, particularly paragraph 3. 4, dated and filed July 27, 2021.\n\n\u201cIf this tribunal would look at the language of paragraphs 3 and 4 of appellant notice of appeal and provision of FIRS Act, it will see the accounting years which is the subject of assessment from 2011 to 2020.\n\n\u201cA preceding year of each of this assessment will require this tribunal to expect the appellant to deposit the charge for each year preceding their accounting year.\n\n\u201cWhat they have done is to selectively pick and choose the preceding year to reckon with.\n\n\u201cThey chose 2010 and made a deposit.\n\n\u201cAnd they turned back to chose 2019 as another preceding year of N5.3bn.\u201d\n\nThe FIRS urged the tribunal to ask MultiChoice to make payment for all preceding years under appeal.\n\n\u201cOur submission is that there are 10 consecutive years, and 2010 or 2019 cant be proceeding years to 2011,\u201d the tax authority said.\n\nMultiChoice FIRS Tax\n\n\u201cThe preceding years under appeal begin from 2010 and ends in 2019. They picked and chose 2010 and 2019 and forget 2011,12,13,14,15,16,17, and 2018. And that is why they have two affidavits of compliance.\n\n\u201cOur submission is that the assessment under appeal ought and should be confirmed by this tribunal.\n\n\u201cWe urge you the Chairman, and other members to please direct that this appeal is foreclosed on the basis of non-compliance in view of the absence of clear evidence on the order of August 2021.\u201d\n\nAB Ahmad, the tribunal chairman, noted the arguments of both parties and adjourned to October 20, 2021, for the ruling, asking all parties to submit necessary notices before the date.",

          "title": "What to expect as Nigeria pushes for tax on digital transaction",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s cash crunch problem is pushing the government to fast-track plans to tax digital transactions carried out across the country.\n\nEssentially, the focus is to increase the national revenue by taxing the close to 300 million electronic transactions the country has recorded so far. Data from the Nigeria Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) show that electronic payment has grown to N171.99 trillion between January and August 2021, representing an 85.52 percent increase year-on-year from 2020 when it recorded N92.7 trillion.\n\nNIP transactions rose by 89.79 percent from N89.90 trillion in 2020 to N167.93 trillion in 2021. Point of Sale (PoS) transactions are up by 44.85 percent from N2.81 trillion in 2020 to N4.07 trillion in 2021.\n\nBoss Mustapha, secretary-general of the Federation (SGF) while speaking at the 17th General Assembly and 10th anniversary of the West Africa Tax Administration Forum (WATAF) in Abuja on Tuesday, said the order came from the President to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). The tax authority would need to ensure digital transactions were taxed digitally, and the goal of their efforts was to achieve seamless digital collection and remittance of tax revenue accrued from the digital economy.\n\nRead Also: Digital payment boosts 81% of women-owned businesses in Nigeria \u2013 Visa\n\nHence, the FIRS needs to, as a matter of urgency, deploy technology to ensure the mandate was achieved.\n\nTaxing digital transactions has been a long pursuit of the government.\n\nIn 2019, the country kicked off plans to become a digital economy within a period of 10 years from 2020 to 2030. The plan is partly informed by a boom in digital adoption and the influx of digital services and investors in the country. Nigeria, not only has the largest tech ecosystem in Africa, but companies in the digital space have also repeatedly attracted big investments from foreign investors necessitating the emergence and growth of segments such as ecommerce, fintech, health tech, among many others.\n\nThe growth of fintech in the country, in particular, has led to the adoption of different payment channels by many Nigerians. Many fintech companies now boast of millions of transactions recorded weekly and monthly, many of which run in multi-billion naira. The Nigerian government has often expressed the desire to tax revenue from these transactions.\n\nIn 2019, Ali Ndume, chairman, Senate Committee on Army, proposed a communication tax bill that would substitute the 7.5 percent increase in Value Added Tax (VAT), which the Federal Government was planning then.\n\nAlthough the VAT increase was not stopped, the communication tax bill is still in the Senate. The communication tax bill plans to impose and collect communication services tax (CST or levy) on charges payable by consumers of electronic communication services in Nigeria (excluding private electronic communication services) at the rate of 9 percent.\n\nWhile the communication tax bill awaits action from the Senate, the government earlier this year proposed a tax on airtime recharges. At a World Bank event, Ben Akabueze, director-general, Budget Office of the Federation, said the government last year found that Nigeria was lagging behind most of Africa in implementing the excise tax on the sector.\n\nHowever, current realities in which it desperately needs to raise additional revenues may make imposing the tax an inevitability.\n\n\u201cLast year, we found that 51 countries in Africa have excise on airtime charges, so we are looking at that as well as an area (to tax),\u201d said Akabueze.\n\nWhile explaining the tax on digital transactions, the SGF said the mandate was supported by the amendment to the tax laws and empowering the tax authority to deploy technology in tax.\n\nThe law that empowers the FIRS to tax digital businesses is the Finance Act of 2020 signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari in January 2020.\n\nFirst, the Act provides that telecoms services provided in Nigeria shall be charged with duties of excise at 5 percent rates.\n\nIt also introduces a new session 89A, which imposes a levy referred to as the Electronic Money Transfer Levy, on electronic receipts or electronic transfer for money deposited in any deposit money bank or financial institution, on any type of amount, to be accounted for and expressed to be received by the person to whom the transfer or deposit is made.\n\n\u201cThe levy shall be imposed as a singular and one-off charge of N50 on electronic receipts or electronic transfers of money in the sum of N10,000 or more,\u201d the Act read.\n\nThe Act also empowers the FIRS to deploy any proprietary or third party payment, processing, or other digital platforms to collect and remit taxes due on international transactions in the supply of digital services to and from a person in Nigeria, in the case of transactions carried out through remote, digital, electronic or other such platforms.\n\nThe legal hurdle to the collection of the digital transaction tax referred to by the SGF may lie in the definition of what constitutes a transaction. The Finance Act does not use the phrase \u2018digital transaction\u2019 rather there are phrases like \u2018Electronic Money Transfer Levy\u2019, \u2018telecommunication services\u2019, and the tax on \u2018international transactions\u2019.\n\nThe scope of digital transactions is wider than what is contained in the Finance Act 2020. For example, is the government proposing to impose taxes on money transfers, ecommerce transactions, PoS transactions, etc? These transactions already attract different charges from banks and operators.\n\n\u201cOur definition of what to collect- whether we call it income tax, Digital Service Tax or Value Added Tax, must address the issue of redefining who a taxable person or entity is, to accommodate the fact that digital transactions side-track the ordinary and traditional understanding of jurisdiction,\u201d Mustapha said\n\nIndustry operators say they require more clarifications on the tax. However, they expressed concerns that it could amount to multiple charges on consumers and their operations.\n\nThe telecoms industry, for instance, currently has to pay about 21 different taxes. These include Right of Way charges, National Information Technology Development Fund Levy (NITDEF), National Cybersecurity Fund, Annual Operating Levy in addition to existing statutory taxes like Companies Income Tax, Tertiary Education Tax, Value Added Tax, etc.\n\nAn additional tax on digital transactions could also negatively impact the adoption of cashless payments. While the number of transactions through digital channels is on the rise, the country needs to do more to attract more people to use them. For example, while the number of Nigerians with a bank account is just 47.6 million of the 106 million adults in the country representing 45 percent of the population, according to EFiNA 2020 Survey. 36 percent of the population still remain unbanked. This unbanked population can easily swell if those already banked feel dis-incentivised to continue using cashless transactions due to increased cost.\n\nNigeria is not the only country that is yet to figure out an effective way to tax digital transactions. Kenya has amended its digital tax laws three times since 2019 it was introduced in the Finance Act. South Africa has also been tweaking the digital tax bill and has yet to pass it into law as of 2021. For Nigeria, it goes beyond the FIRS deploying the technology. The tax authority faces a herculean task in defining what constitutes a digital transaction and what is considered reasonable as the rate.",

Minister of State for Health, Senator Olorunimbe Mamora; Group Managing Director of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kolo Kyari, among other notable Nigerians have emerged winners, in various categories, of the 2020 edition of the prestigious Zik Prize in Leadership Awards, instituted in honour of Nigeria\u2019s first president and African statesman, late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nAlso listed as recipients of the year\u2019s accolades are such other prominent personalities as Dr Akinwunmi Ayodeji Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group; Mr U.K. Eke MFR, Group Managing Director of FBN Holdings; Her Excellency, Mrs Ekaette Unoma Akpabio, Former First Lady of Akwa Ibom State; Mr. Uche Orji, pioneer MD/CEO, of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Dr Bashir Jamoh, Director General and CEO of the Nigerian Maritime and Safety Agency (NIMASA).\n\nAnnouncing the winners on behalf the Board of Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), organisers of the award scheme, at a virtual press conference on Wednesday, Professor Pat Utomi, chairman of the selection committee, said the winners were chosen after a rigorous review process by the board.\n\nProfessor Utomi said since the institution of the award scheme in 1995, it has held consistently, annually and has now evolved to become one of Africa\u2019s most respected award schemes.\n\nHe gave credit to Board members over these years who, according to him, have shown uncommon zeal and commitment to building and encouraging true leadership across the face of the continent.\n\nUtomi used the occasion to mourn the death of one of the past winners of the award, an accomplished industrialist and notable philanthropist, Alhaji Abdulazeez Chivuzor Ude who passed away last week, as well as the late ace bureaucrat, Alhaji Ahmed Joda and Professor Ayo Ibidapo-Obe, both of whom also passed away recently.\n\n\u201cMuch as it gives me great pleasure addressing you this morning as we set out to formally unveil winners of the Year 2020 Zik Prize in Leadership Awards, it saddens me to also recall the passage, only recently, of a member of the Advisory Board for the Zik Prize in Leadership, Alhaji Abdulazeez Ude,\u201d Utomi said.\n\n\u201cA great man, a rare breed, a true leader and himself, a recipient of the Zik Prize in Leadership during the inaugural edition, it is incontrovertible that this country has lost a gem.\n\n\u201cThe year also saw the demise of some other past recipients of the Zik Prize. They are Alhaji Ahmed Joda OFR, CON, CFR and Professor Ayo Ibidapo-Obe OFR. We commiserate with the families of the deceased and pray that God grant them the fortitude to bear these painful losses.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a more positive note, I am delighted to inform you that since 1995 when The Zik Prize in Leadership Award scheme started, A cursory look across our continent shows that the issue of leadership remains a critical challenge in our body polity. We fully understand this and thus remain committed to this noble venture of encouraging and nurturing the most beneficial leadership that can be found on the continent as an embodiment of the leadership values of the Great Zik of Africa in whose honour this award was instituted.\u201d\n\nUtomi who gave brief profile of the awardees and the categories won, said Senator Anyim, a lawyer, politician and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, emerged winner of Year 2020 Zik Prize in Political Leadership.\n\nAnyim, he said, is an accomplished lawmaker who first came to political prominence in 1998 when at 37 he won election as a Senator under the United Nigeria Congress Party.\n\n\u201cWhen that process was aborted, he returned to the same Senate in 1999, and was in August 2000 to be elected Senate President, the youngest in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cAnyim could easily be credited with laying the foundation of the operational structure and frame of the National Assembly. He remains a treasure trove of service and experience. He is recognized for his many years of service and commitment to forging a greater Nigerian ideal.\u201d\n\nMamora, Minister of State for Health, also emerged winner in the same category as Anyim.\n\nA medical practitioner and an activist politician, Utomi said the minister, has since venturing into politics in the early 90\u2019s as a delegate of the National Republican Convention, NRC, never looked back.\n\n\u201cHe was Speaker of the 4th Lagos House of Assembly in 1999 and was elected Senator in 2003 where he served meritoriously in various committees for two terms. He was once described as master of parliamentary procedures in the senate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA founding member of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Senator Mamora has a very wide and diverse experience in the political arena and has a history of undying commitment to the entrenchment of democratic ideals in the polity.

That is not to say that it is enough because it is not close to the 23 per cent of UNESCO provision.\n\n\u201cBut it is important not to isolate the ministry of education as to what government is spending on education. There are other areas and we will continue to provide opportunities to fund education. However we must understand that resources are lean and things are not how they used to be in terms of resources.\u201d\n\nIn his goodwill message, the British Deputy High Commissioner, Ben Llewellyn-Jone, urged the country to spend more on education and health rather than on fuel subsidy. Noting that universal healthcare and universal basic education has been the foundation of the development and growth in the United Kingdom over the last 500 years he said, \u201cat a time of fiscal challenge it may be right to look again at expense and indeed fuel subsidy for example takes so much.\n\nIn her keynote address, the deputy Vice-Chancellor of the Pan African University, Lagos, Prof. Enase Okonedo, noted that there is a need for the curriculum used in all levels of education in the country to be revised as the current one being used has not been useful in turning out employable graduates.",

          "text": "SaharaReporters received a list of 45 people arrested by the Nigerian authorities for allegedly funding the Boko Haram insurgency in the country.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates had previously named and prosecuted 38 accused terrorist sponsors, including six Nigerians, according to SaharaReporters.\n\nGarba Shehu, the presidential spokesman, announced in March 2021 that the Nigerian government had detained 400 Bureaux De Change operators for allegedly aiding the Boko Haram insurgency in the country, alleging that the defendants were sending funds to the terrorists.\n\nNigerians have been pleading with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government to reveal the suspects\u2019 identities, but the government has continually refused.\n\nFemi Adesina, Shehu\u2019s colleague, stated on Tuesday that the Buhari-led administration is more concerned in prosecuting terrorist financiers than in naming and humiliating them.\n\nOn Wednesday, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who is accompanying Buhari to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, said the government will not name and shame alleged terrorist financiers until they are prosecuted and convicted.\n\n\u201cNaming and shaming of suspects is not embarked upon as a policy by the federal government out of sheer respect the constitutional rights of Nigerians relating to presumption of innocence,\u201d Malami had said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is a product of constitutionalism and the law. It is rooted in the law and the names of the suspects will accordingly be made public at the point of judicial arraignment while the. Trials are judicial processes and not about media sensations. Naming and shaming in the Nigerian context must be rooted in constitutionalism. We must strike a balance between constitutional presumption of innocence and evidential proof of reasonable ground for suspicion in making disclosures associated with terrorism funding and financing.\n\n\u201cWhere reasonable grounds are established, suspects must be naturally taken to court at which point their identity must be disclosed and the naming becomes apparent. Shaming, on the other hand, is the product of conviction at which point the public is equally judicially put on notice. In essence, naming and shaming within the context of Nigerian law are judicial functions which commence with arraignment and terminate with convictions.\u201d\n\nThough the Minister claimed 285 suspects have been charged before the Federal High Court, sources told SaharaReporters that only over 40 are being prosecuted by the government before the court based \u201con prima facie cases of terrorism.\u201d\n\nThey include Saidu Ahmed, Ibrahim Sani Bello, Mustapha Musa Adamu, Abubakar Sadiq Garba, Hussein Adamu, Muhammed Sani Adam, Abdulrahman Ibrahim, Ghazali Yusuf, Yusuf Ali Yusuf, Abubakar Adamu Yellow, Zahuraddeen Bashir, Haruna Garba Garo, Ibrahim Aliyu Usman, Hassan Idris, Musa Emma, Alhashim Mohammed Almashim, Baba Samaila, Bulama Tahir, Abubakar Ali, Mohammed Ambare, Danlami Hassan Nadabo, Danladi Talle Inuwa, Bashir Ali, Mansur Muhammad Usaman.\n\nOthers are Musa Tasiu Ya\u2019u, Auwalu Ali Alhassan, Sadi Saidu Abdullahi, Suraj Adamu, Muhammed Auwalu, Ismaila Abdullaziz Mohammed, Munzali Ashiru Gambo, Yazid Muhammad Usman, Nabil Zakari, Gambo Auwalu, Muhammed Abba, Bashir Idris Shuaibu, Mohammed Yahaya, Auwalu Ibrahim, Abdullahi Umar Usman, Dahiru Umar Mohammed, Abdullahi Mohammed, Abubakar Yahaya, Hussaini Lawali Idrisu, Ladann Ibrahim, Nurudeen Gani Aliyu.\n\nSaharaReporters had in April, reported how over 400 persons were arrested by security agencies during a nationwide crackdown on the suspected financiers and collaborations.\n\nThey were reportedly arrested in an operation being coordinated by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), and in collaboration with the Department of State Services (DSS), Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe operation was said to have been approved by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2020.\n\nThey were reportedly being kept in military and DSS facilities in Abuja and other places.\n\nConfirming the report a few days after, Malami said the Nigerian government embarked on \u201ca wider and far-reaching investigations\u201d into terrorism financing after the conviction of Boko Haram financiers in the United Arab Emirates.",

Olga Mokhireva, the mayor of Palana, was among the passengers, the TASS agency quoted local authorities as saying.\n\nThe weather in the area was cloudy at the time the plane went missing, Russian news agencies reported. TASS said the aircraft involved had been in service since 1982.\n\nRussian aviation safety standards have improved in recent years but accidents, especially involving ageing planes in far-flung regions, are not uncommon.\n\nThe Soviet-era plane type, still used for military and civilian flights in some countries, has been involved in dozens of deadly crashes since it entered service around 50 years ago.\n\nAn Antonov-28, a similar plane, slammed into a Kamchatka forest in 2012 in a crash that killed 10 people along the same route.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe federal government Wednesday restated that no stone would be left unturned in its quest to prosecute Boko Haram financiers and the fight against terrorism in the country.\n\nThe government also explained reasons it was yet to name and shame the alleged financiers of terrorism in the country.\n\nThe UAE list\n\nLast week, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) listed six Nigerians and 32 other nationals as terrorism sponsors.\n\nThe Nigerians named are Abdurrahaman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad.\n\nThe report was contained in the state-owned news agency, WAM.\n\nThe country said the listed individuals and entities, including their affiliates, were being monitored.\n\nThe report read: \u201cThe UAE Cabinet has issued Resolution No 83 of 2021, designating 38 individuals and 15 entities on its approved list of persons and organisations supporting terrorism (Local Terrorist List).\n\n\u201cThe resolution underscores the UAE\u2019s commitment to target and dismantle networks that finance terrorism and its related activities.\n\n\u201cThe resolution demands that regulatory authorities monitor and identify any individuals or entities affiliated with or associated with any financial, commercial or technical relationship and take the necessary measures according to the laws in force in the country in less than 24 hours.\u201d\n\nAGF assures\n\nBut Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) assured all terrorism sponsors would be brought to justice.\n\nHe spoke in an interview with journalists at the ongoing 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States of America.\n\nMalami\u2019s media aide, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, who disclosed this in a statement, also hinted that the government was currently investigating the alleged sponsors with a view to prosecuting them.\n\nHe said investigation had reached an advanced stage and a statement in that direction would be made in due course.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cTime is not ripe for holistic disclosures so as not to pre-empt the investigation process. The prime object remains the attainment of peace and security of our dear nation.\n\n\u201cAs far as terrorism funding and financing is concerned, we have succeeded in identifying those that are allegedly responsible for funding same and we are blocking the leakages associated with funding while embarking on aggressive investigation that is indeed impacting positively in terms of the fight against terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that investigation is ongoing and advancing. For the purpose of investigation, I would not like to be pre-emptive in terms of making disclosures that will have effect of undermining the successes we are recording.\n\n\u201cOne thing I can tell you for sure is that whatever we do in terms of detention and arrest is indeed backed-up by judicial processes. We have acquired and obtained legitimate court orders, taking into consideration the facts and material proof of evidence presented before the court on account of which the court eventually exercises its discretion in terms of granting orders that we can have the suspects in custody pending the conclusion of the investigation.\n\n\u201cNaming and shaming of suspects is not embarked upon as a policy by the federal government out of sheer respect to the constitutional rights of Nigerians relating to presumption of innocence. It is a product of constitutionalism and the law.\n\n\u201cIt is rooted in the law and the names of the suspects will accordingly be made public at the point of judicial arraignment while the shaming remains a consequence of judicial conviction. Trials are judicial process and not about media sensations.\n\n\u201cWhere reasonable grounds are established, suspects must be naturally taken to court at which point their identity must be disclosed and the naming become apparent. Shaming, on the other hand, is the product of conviction at which point the public are equally judicially put on notice.\n\n\u201cIn essence naming and shaming within the context of Nigerian law are judicial functions which commence with arraignment and terminate with convictions. Naming and shaming is not unguided and unregulated process. It is not like a discarded ship left at the mercy of winds and tides,\u201d the statement further said.\n\nReview of case files\n\nBlueprint reports that the OAGF is currently reviewing over one thousand Boko Haram case files out of which 285 were filed before the Federal High Court based on prima facie cases of terrorism against them.\n\nThe delay witnessed in prosecution process, according to the AGF, was occasioned by COVID-19 lockdown, Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) strike and court vacation.\n\n",

Attacks against children must stop immediately.

Even before the migrant expulsions from the small Texas border town of Del Rio, the career diplomat was known to be deeply frustrated with what he considered a lack of urgency in Washington and a glacial pace on efforts to improve conditions in Haiti.\n\nFoote wrote Secretary of State Antony Blinken that he was stepping down immediately \u201cwith deep disappointment and apologies to those seeking crucial changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not be associated with the United States inhumane, counterproductive decision to deport thousands of Haitian refugees and illegal immigrants to Haiti, a country where American officials are confined to secure compounds because of the danger posed by armed gangs to daily life,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur policy approach to Haiti remains deeply flawed, and my policy recommendations have been ignored and dismissed, when not edited to project a narrative different from my own.\u201d\n\nTwo U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed the resignation on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nOne official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters and spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Foote had consistently sought greater oversight of Haiti policy and that the administration did not believe his requests were appropriate.\n\nFoote\u2019s sudden departure leaves a void in U.S. policy toward Haiti and adds another prominent, critical voice to the administration\u2019s response to Haitians camped on the Texas border. The administration\u2019s U.S. ambassador, Michele Sison, another career diplomat, is expected to depart soon after being nominated to serve as the State Department\u2019s assistant secretary of international organization affairs.\n\nThe camp has shrunk considerably since surpassing more than 14,000 people on Saturday \u2013 many of them expelled and many released in the U.S. with notices to report to immigration authorities.\n\nThe White House is facing sharp bipartisan condemnation. Democrats and many pro-immigration groups say efforts to expel thousands of Haitians without a chance to seek asylum violates American principles and their anger has been fueled by images that went viral this week of Border Patrol agents on horseback using aggressive tactics against the migrants.\n\nThe expulsion flights to Haiti began Sunday and there were 10 by the end of Tuesday, according to Haitian officials. U.S. officials say they are ramping up to seven flights a day, which would mark one of the swiftest, large-scale expulsions from the U.S. in decades.\n\nFoote served previously in Haiti as deputy chief of mission and is a former ambassador to Zambia. In new role, he worked with the U.S. ambassador to support Haiti after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise.\n\nFor weeks, he had been quietly pushing in Washington a plan to boost U.S. security assistance to Haiti to pave the way for presidential elections. But Haiti watchers said he became increasingly disappointed with the pace of decision-making in the administration.\n\n\u201cWhen someone who is tasked with Haiti policy at the highest level resigns because \u2018recommendations are ignored and dismissed\u2019 it\u2019s not only troubling, but shows you this administration does not tolerate anyone who won\u2019t go along with their distorted view of the facts,\u201d said Damian Merlo, a Republican strategist who has worked for years on Haiti policy and is now a registered lobbyist for the country\u2019s government. \u201cDan Foote is a world class diplomat who refuses to be told what do. I wish more foreign service officers had his courage to stand up and call out their bosses\u201d",

          "title": "NNPC Says Global Gas Crisis May Push Oil Prices $10 Higher in Three Months",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Wednesday said the global natural gas crisis, which has resulted in rising prices, could push up oil prices by as much as $10 a barrel over the next three to six months.\n\nWholesale gas prices have surged by 250 per cent since the beginning of the year, including a 70 per cent rise, disrupting food supplies in parts of Europe and putting several energy suppliers out of business.\n\nIn Nigeria, the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), or cooking gas, has increased by more than 100 per cent in the last few months due to under-supply, according to NNPC. Although, marketers have also attributed the increase to the introduction of a 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) and rising dollar value to the naira.\n\nOver 60 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s domestic gas needs are sourced internationally, while the rest is sourced locally, even though the country sits atop a 206 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) proven quantity of the commodity.\n\nSpeaking in a conversation monitored on Bloomberg Television, Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated that in the next three to six months, the current distortion in the market could lead to an increase in oil prices by at least $10. With Brent crude hitting $76 on Wednesday, the increase could actually be about $86 during the period.\n\nKyari noted that soaring gas prices would most likely seep into the oil prices because consumers would be forced to seek fuel alternatives to natural gas in the nearest future because of rising prices, as demand for oil could be boosted by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd).\n\n\u201cIt will absolutely hit crude prices as energy consumers are forced to shift from gas to other fuels,\u201d the NNPC GMD stated. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be very wrong if you said you would see an additional $10 on a barrel maybe three months, maximum six months,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the world is presently in a potential crisis because last year, a number of things were not done right, including under-investment in the gas sector, particularly.\n\nKyari said, \u201cThe implication of that is that we\u2019re going to see the effect coming up in a year or two maximum. And that will also affect the gas supply all over the globe and, particularly, in Europe.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to show up in a number of gas-rich countries and gas supply projects are being stalled, a number of midstream gas projects are being stalled or delayed, and the net effect will be that there will be an impact on pricing coming very shortly.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that there was still clearly a supply gap, stressing that in the country, supply to the Nigeria LNG plant has been beset by several challenges in recent times.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cThere are a number of things going on now to improve on the gas supply. We surely have issues around gas supply to the LNG plant, in particular, and even into the domestic market and the net effect is that you will see some slippages in cargos in 2022 and even in 2021.\n\n\u201cAnd the implication of that is that you have to do something pretty quickly and we have lost time, we have lost investment and for us, what must happen is a very quick return to a pre-Covid-19 level investment and that, of course, is being adjusted and I know that this is a key challenge for the industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kyari, since in many jurisdictions, including Nigeria, gas production is tied to oil production and much of the production is associated, prices may spiral in several areas.\n\nHe stated that closing the global oil supply gap in three, four months\u2019 time might not be feasible, but noted that Nigeria\u2019s underperformance in the last few months in relation to the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be halted by the end of October this year or mid November.\n\n\u201cFrom everything we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ll get back to the OPEC level, probably, by the end of October and maximum middle of November. We\u2019re not far from that,\u201d he assured.\n\nThe GMD pointed out that the national oil company was going through a transformation that would see it invest more in renewable energy sources, going forward.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe are undergoing a transformation and what this means is that we\u2019re going to lead a company that will become the biggest company in Africa, not just the company that will lead the transition into renewables as we go forward to zero carbon situation.\n\n\u201cAnd what we have to do is to focus on gas development, as everybody else is doing, and also focus on the reality, which is that you need to go electric and to do this, you need a number of things done as quickly as possible to make this company completely commercial and completely profitable. It already is.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the OPEC Secretary General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, said current conversations around the transition to a carbon-free world were driven by sheer emotions, rather than facts and science.\n\nSpeaking on the side-lines of Gastech, an industry expo in Dubai, Barkindo stated that there were many distortions in discussing of a world without fossil fuels, with the planned focus on renewables.\n\nBarkindo said, \u201cI have also in my contribution, in my panel, talked about the distortion of facts, and the science, the misrepresentation of these facts in the conversation, which is not healthy because climate change and the energy transition are supposed to be guided by the science.\n\n\u201cThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is supposed to be the most authoritative body with regard to both climate change and the transition. And we in OPEC, we believe they are doing a great job; they are producing very important seminal reports.\n\n\u201cBut, unfortunately, these reports are being set aside, and the discussions ensuing at the moment, more or less, are being driven by emotions rather than by the great work that the scientific body is producing for all of us.\u201d\n\nOn the energy transition, Barkindo emphasised the vital role of oil in meeting the growing demand for energy, adding that predictable investment is required to address the increasing global needs, highlighting the need to address energy poverty and meet global commitments to expand energy access.\n\nReferencing OPEC\u2019s release of the World Oil Outlook 2021, the secretary general noted that oil and natural gas would continue to supply more than half the world\u2019s energy needs in 2045, with oil around 28 per cent, followed by gas at 24 per cent.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Ondo Governor Akeredolu Says Kaduna Governor El-Rufai Inciting Herders to Flout Anti-Open Grazing Law",
          "text": "The Ondo State Governor and Chairman, Southern Governors\u2019 Forum, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Wednesday, took a swipe at his Kaduna State counterpart, Nasir El-Rufai, for criticising the legal approach adopted by the southern governors in handling the open grazing crisis, saying his statement was a ploy to externalise banditry in the country.\n\nAlso while speaking on ARISE News, Akeredolu, who told his Kaduna counterpart that the southern governors had the capacity to deal with anyone who contravened the laws, accused el-Rufai of inciting the herders against them, even as he reiterated the resolve of the South that the presidency must come to the region in 2023.\n\nEl-Rufai had while speaking to newsmen on Tuesday after a visit to the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja, insisted that the anti-open grazing law being passed by some Southern states was not implementable, but that ranching and not open grazing was the solution to the ongoing farmer/herder\u2019s clashes.\n\nBut, Akeredolu, first in an official statement by his Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, said, \u201cGovernor Nasir el-Rufai, if he was properly quoted and his views not misrepresented, is struggling hard to export banditry to the South under an expressed opinion that is laced with mischief.\u201d\n\nThe statement read: \u201cIn these days and times, anyone who makes statements such as that allegedly made by the governor belongs to a class of an unenviable ilk masquerading as leaders.\n\n\u201cThere is no wisdom in condemning/banning open grazing, prohibiting inter border movement of cattle in the North, including Kaduna, with an accompanying disapproval of a law that gives bite to same, in another part of the country.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, it is apt to state clearly that the likes of Governor el-Rufai are already in a hysteric \u2018mode\u2019 of escalating and indeed, externalising banditry, especially, as the military onslaught against criminal elements and other terror variants suffices in the North.\u201d\n\nThe Ondo governor noted that, \u201csuch comment like that of the Kaduna Governor, if indeed he made that statement, merely seeks to encourage anarchy under the guise of resentment of a law by affected stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIn order words, it is a cleverly crafted path towards replicating in the South, the most despicable situation in the North, that Nigerians of goodwill daily pray to overcome. It\u2019s a ploy beyond the ordinary.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu, further added that, \u201cThe Anti-Grazing Law, especially in Ondo State, has come to stay. It shall be zealously guarded and conscionably deployed to protect all residents of Ondo State, notwithstanding their ethnic and religious biases. Those who have nothing evil to perpetrate have nothing to fear as regards the Law.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Arise, Akeredolu, who wondered why anyone would think the region was playing politics with the issue, warned that the south did not take the wellbeing and the livelihood of its people lightly and would do anything to protect them.\n\n\u201cThere is no politics about the anti-open grazing law. We say people are destroying the livelihood of our own people and we say we are not going to allow it to continue and it is certain.\n\n\u201cAnd if he says it is not a law we cannot enforce, let him wait or let him bring his herders here, they will go back to inform him whether we are able to enforce the laws, he will get to know. There is no need for him to be in a hurry, the people will go back to him to tell him that it is being enforced and we are going to enforce it\u201d.\n\nMore on the issue of capacity, Akeredolu noted that the law was already in operation in Ondo, because those who were infringing on the law were paying for it.\n\nAccording to him, the state has established a process to ensure any herder, who destroyed any farm was made to pay repatriation before the cattle would be released to such a herder, adding that, \u201cas a second time offender, you are going to prison.\u201d\n\nWhile observing that Miyetti Allah and other herders in Ondo State were already cooperating with the government, he lamented that the Kaduna governor and those who speak like him were only inciting herders against the people of the south and therefore warned that anyone, who broke the law in the state would be punished in line with the law.\n\n\u201cI am happy that Miyetti Allah people are willing to imbibe it; they are not waiting to be incited as my brother want to think. Maybe they should flout the law, that is why he is saying it is not implementable or whatever his words are, that is like wanting to incite the people.\n\n\u201cYou are trying to incite the people, who say they are going to oppose this law and we are saying that if you oppose this law, you will face the consequences. The law is there and has been passed by our own House of Assembly and the Houses of Assembly of every state that has passed the law and every state that has passed the law will implement the law to the letter,\u201d he maintained.\n\nThe Ondo governor queried why southern governors should consult with their northern counterparts before passing a law that was in the interest of their own people, adding that the southern governors could not \u201cbeg\u201d northern governors before passing a law that was in the interest of the people.\n\nHe held that the northern governors met regularly and even met with the president after their meeting and the southern governors have never made any fuss about it.\n\nAkeredolu argued that even the northern governors knew that open grazing was not in the best interest of their people but only wanted to continue to oppress them by allowing them to take their cows from one region to another, adding that that their mode of life was anachronistic and not going to hold.\n\nHe commended Katsina State for its decision to embrace ranching, noting that they were ready to support the state and give it necessary patronage, when operational.\n\nAddressing the 2023 presidential election, the chairman of the Southern Governors Forum said, \u201cThe only way we can continue to remain united as a country is that there must be fairness, there must be equity and there must be justice and the only thing that is fair in this country today is that if we have had a northern president for eight years, it must come down to south this time. That is what we are saying, we are not forcing it on people. We are going to go out and campaign about it, this is politics, it is a game of number\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that Chief Olusegun Obasanjo became president in 1999 because everybody agreed that the president must come from the south and after Obasanjo, everybody also agreed that it should go to the north and Alhaji Umaru Yar\u2019Adua also emerged as president.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong in it, that is understanding\u201d, he said, adding that the north has no choice but to be fair to the south and support the push for a southern president.\n\nHis position on the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which was just returned to the National Assembly for amendment, was that the governors would continue to push for the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), which belonged to both the federal g and the state governments, rather than the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which did not represent their interest but that of the federal government.\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan, Fidelis David in Akure, Alex Enumah in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos",
