          "text": "Tells British PM, Johnson, he won\u2019t seek another term\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nABUJA\u2013PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari, has told the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson that there have been apprehension in admitting on bail detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu because he jumped jumped bail the previous time he was granted bail.\n\nPresident Buhari stated this on Thursday, when he held a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister of Great Britain on the margins of the 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\nThe President at the meeting reiterated his resolve to respect the maximum term limit in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe PM, obviously not quite familiar with the maximum two terms limit, had asked if President Buhari would run for office again. To which the latter responded:\n\n\u201cAnother term for me? No! The first person who tried it didn\u2019t end very well.\u201d (General laughter).\n\nOn the leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, not being allowed to see his lawyers privately, the President dispelled such insinuation, saying the detained separatist was being given every opportunity under the law \u201cto justify all the uncomplimentary things he had been saying against Nigeria in Britain.\u201d\n\nSaid President Buhari: \u201cHe felt very safe in Britain, and said awful things against Nigeria. We eventually got him when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court. Let him defend all that he has said there. His lawyers have access to him. Remember he jumped bail before, how are we sure he won\u2019t do it again, if he\u2019s admitted to bail?\u201d\n\nOn the keenness expressed by the PM to help Nigeria in the area of security, the President said helping to stabilize Libya could be an initial good step, as the fall of Muammar Gadaffi after 42 years in power unleashed his armed guards on countries in the Sahel, \u201cand they are causing havoc everywhere, as the only thing they know how to do is to shoot guns.\u201d\n\nOn Boko Haram insurgency, President Buhari said there was serious effort to educate the people on the fact that only an unserious person could kill innocent people, \u201cand say Allah Akbar (God is Great). God is justice.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take innocent souls, and ascribe it to God. And the education process is working, the people now understand Boko Haram as anti-God, and not about religion.\u201d\n\nPM Johnson said he was delighted about the good news on trade between the two countries, adding that the UK was further reducing tariffs on some goods going to Nigeria.\n\nHe described the relationship between the countries as \u201cvery strong attachment,\u201d adding: \u201cI just want to be sure that we are doing enough. It\u2019s a massive partnership for us, and we need to capitalize on it.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister offered condolences on some recent attacks in Nigeria, particularly on churches.",

          "text": "The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) yesterday accused the Federal Government of doing nothing to stop Products Depots Operators (PDOs) from selling fuel to its members above the official template of N145 per litre.\n\nIt, therefore, called on the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC) Limited to intervene because the PDOs were profiteering from the scarcity of fuel in parts of the country.\n\nPrivate depots are owned by members of the Depots and Petroleum Products Marketers Association, (DAPPMA).\n\nThe association also listed high freight costs, especially outside the coastal areas, as one of the major challenges facing its members.\n\nThe association, however, said in a statement yesterday by its National President Debo Ahmed and National Publicity Secretary, Chinedu Ukadike, that they would continue to sell fuel at N165 per litre in spite of the fact that they buy from the private depots between N169 and N170.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe government is doing nothing about the private depots that are violating the system by selling higher.\n\n\u201cIPMAN members have suffered a lot in the hands of private depot owners. We appreciate the efforts of NNPC Limited to make the product available but you cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered a lot of setbacks based on the cost of diesel.\n\nRead Also: Petrol scarcity worsens\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t saying there is non-availability of petroleum products, but what is available isn\u2019t sufficient. The cost of diesel has also increased.\u201d\n\nThese factors, according to the association, \u201chave led to a situation \u201cwhereby marketers buy petroleum products at the rate of N169 to N170 above the government-controlled pump price.\n\n\u201cThis non-availability has led to profiteering from the hands of Products Depots Operators along the coastal areas. We are also finding it difficult to move products from Lagos-Kano-Kaduna since we are heavily dependent on PDOs since they are located along the coastal areas.\n\n\u201cSo, after looking at all these factors, it costs close to N700,000 to move petroleum products from Lagos to Kano since we are at the mercy of the PDOs.\n\n\u201cIt is easy for marketers to move products from NNPCL depots to sell at N165 but since we aren\u2019t getting at N148 which is the government template for private depot tank farm owners to sell to marketers, we are getting at N160 there is no way a marketer will use N5 to sell petroleum products.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t viable, considering the cost of maintenance of the filling station and also cost of fund. A litre of Automotive Gas Oil (diesel) is very huge and we are borrowing these funds from commercial banks.\n\n\u201cWe want to use this opportunity to tell the NNPC Limited on behalf of marketers to ensure that we have sufficient products. These products are being sold to private depots at government-approved rates, not above N148.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t stick to the approved template, they should close down those tank farms selling above what government has stipulated.\u201d",

While 4G is H2M interaction, 5G is M2M interaction.\n\nHe said 1ms latency is a unique feature of 5G when compared with the human brain that takes 10 ms to process information. For example, he said doctors can do a CT scan remotely, watching AR/VR based entertainment, while it is good for factories using instant data to tweak production processes.\n\nDriverless cars, he said, can avoid obstacles almost instantly with the technology.\n\nAn MTN official reiterated the readiness of the telecom firm to roll out in line with the NCC directive.\n\nThe official, who identified himself as Chinedu, said the company has submitted a report to the NCC to eschew interference from other regulatory agencies, adding that MTN will switch on using non-stand -alone policy with 4G, adding, \u201ccome August 24, we will be live on 5G.\u201d",

          "text": "Seventy thousand ghost workers have been \u201celiminated\u201d from the Federal Government payroll through the Integration Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS).\n\nWith their removal from salary list and hitherto wrong management of the IPPIS, government has been able to save N22O billion, said the Director-General, Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR), Dasuki Arabi.\n\nArabi also disclosed that the government saved N10 trillion following the introduction of the Single Treasury Account (TSA) 10 years ago.\n\nHe put the current number of federal civil servants to 720,000.\n\nArabi disclosed these while giving an update on the activities of the BPSR to reporters at the weekly ministerial briefing organised by the Presidential Communication Team in Abuja yesterday\n\nAccording to him, the government has also been able to save more than N220 billion hitherto wasted on the wrong management of the IPPIS on payroll by Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nHe said: \u201cThese are some of the benefits that we think government or Nigerians have benefited out of the work that we have been doing in collaboration with other agencies of government, where they with the introduction of IPPIS about 70,000 ghost workers have been eliminated from the payroll.\n\n\u201cWe have a one-shot opportunity to look at IPPIS and say, as of today, we have 720,000 public servants working for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to reduce more than N220 billion wastage through wrong management of IPPIS on payroll by MDAs. We have reduced the budget deficits and changed the budget composition.\n\n\u201cWe have succeeded in getting the Treasury Single Account deployed in all MDAs. Challenges have come in that implementation at the initial stage, but we are overcoming that and government is able to save over N10 trillion over the years because whatever you\u2019re generating now goes into a Treasury Single Account that is managed by somebody else, not you.\n\n\u201cAnd the government, especially at the top is always able to see what has come into our Treasury Single Account today and what has gone out of that. So planning has been simplified. Budgeting has been simplified.\n\n\u201cOur distribution and allocation of resources have been simplified and streamlined.\u201d.\n\nOn deductions blamed on the IPPIS, which has been a source of friction, especially between government and university unions, Arabi affirmed that they (deductions) just do not occur on their own except where loans had been obtained.\n\nHis words: \u201cYou know we have just started with six pilot ministries, We later went to 10 then because of the push by the international community, especially our development partners, who are really eager to get Nigeria at that level at par with other nations.\n\n\u201cFor every deduction that is done, there is justification for it. Quite a number of our colleagues may have taken loans and deductions are being made.\u201d\n\nArabi revealed that the government was silently implementing some aspects of the Oransanye Report on Civil Service Reforms, adding that an announcement will soon be made on its implementation.\n\nHe said as part of the reforms in the service, the Government Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIGMIS) has made government business paperless thereby reducing man-to-man contact, processing and payments in MDAs.\n\nThe director-general said: \u201cTransparency has been improved. A lot of things are done even outside the office. But the most important thing is the ability given to central agencies- office of Accountant- General of the Federation- and Ministry of Finance to see what is happening in all MDAs.\u201d",

          "text": "It was an unusual sight yesterday at the Supreme Court in Abuja.\n\nJustices, who came into the courtroom to begin the day\u2019s proceedings, ended it abruptly.\n\nThe justices, lawyers and litigants were shocked by the appearance of a lawyer who dressed like a god of river to the apex court. His lawyer colleagues and court workers were also taken aback\n\nMalcolm Omirhobo sat on the front row without shoes. He tied a red wrapper on top of his black trousers that were rolled up to his knees. He also had a gourd tied around his neck with a red piece of cloth. There was also a feather attached to his wig and he encircled one of his eyes with a whitish substance.\n\nBut Omirhobo had a mission \u2013 he did all that to draw attention to the verdict of the apex court that allows pupils and students to appear in hijab in public schools.\n\nThe Justices, who came into the courtroom for the day\u2019s business about five minutes after Omirhobo\u2019s arrival, felt uncomfortable with the lawyer\u2019s attire.\n\nThe Presiding Justice John Okoro promptly suspended proceedings after Omirhobo ignored entreaties by security officials to vacate the courtroom.\n\nExplaining his action, Omirhobo said: \u201cI am very grateful to the Supreme Court. Just last week Friday it made a very resounding decision that promotes Section 38 of the Constitution, that is, our right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; that we are free to express our way of worship in our schools and in our courts.\n\n\u201cThat decision was reached on Friday and that has encouraged me because I am a traditionalist and this is the way I worship.\n\n\u201cBased on the decision of the Supreme Court, this is how I will be dressing henceforth in court, because I am a strong adherent of \u2018Olokun\u2019 \u2013 the god of rivers.\u201d\n\nTo Omirhobo, the implication of the judgment was that every Nigerian, including doctors, police, military students and journalists can now wear their worship robes or regalia in public places.\n\nThe lawyer said he has no objection to the verdict but is at peace with it because it has strengthened and enriched the rights of all Nigerians as enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nAccording to him, his action was informed by last Friday\u2019s judgment of the court in the appeal filed by the Lagos State Government. The court okayed the wearing of a head cover (hijab) in public schools by female Muslim students.\n\nIn a split decision of five to two, a seven-member panel of the Supreme Court had in its majority judgment, dismissed the government appeal.\n\nJustice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun wrote the lead judgment in the appeal marked: SC/910/2016. Justice Olukayode Ariwoola (who headed the panel) along with Justices Uwani Abba-Aji, Mohammed Lawal Garba and Tijani Abubakar agreed with the lead judgment.\n\nJustice Emmanuel Agim wrote the minority lead decision which Justice Inyang Okoro agreed.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nIndications emerged, yesterday, that more senators elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), may defect in the coming days.\n\nThis is coming despite Wednesday\u2019s intervention by APC\u2019s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, who pleaded with the lawmakers to halt further defections to the PDP.\n\nAdamu, at the meeting with APC senate caucus had expressed worry over the wave of defections rocking the party in the National Assembly.\n\nMultiple sources told Daily Sun that about 20 senators predominantly from the APC have concluded plans to defect to the PDP, New Nigeria Progressive Party (NNPP), and other opposition parties.\n\nThe current configuration of the Senate shows that the APC has 61 lawmakers; PDP, 38; NNPP, three;Young Progressives Party (YPP), two; Labour Party, one; while All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has one. There are three vacant seats, vacated by APC national chairman, Adamu and two other APC lawmakers.\n\nLast week, Senate Leader and Kebbi Senator, Yahaya Abdullahi resigned his membership of the APC and defected to the PDP. His counterpart from the State, Adamu Aliero, also dumped the party for the PDP.\n\nAt plenary last Tuesday, three APC senators defected to the PDP. They are, Isa Kaita (Katsina North); Lawal Gumau (Bauchi South) and Francis Alimikhena (Edo North) citing internal crises within the local chapters of their party for the action.\n\nA senator who spoke to Daily Sun in confidence said despite Adamu\u2019s intervention, those aggrieved were unwilling to jettison their plans to defect to the PDP.\n\nHe said the lawmakers were miffed that during the recently-concluded primaries, the leadership of the party took sides with governors to deny them return tickets to the Senate.\n\nHe wondered why Adamu who didn\u2019t intervene during the primaries, has suddenly woken up mounting pressure on unhappy senators to remain in the party.\n\nThe source said the fear was that the defections, especially by Northern senators, may affect the chances of the party in next year\u2019s presidential elections.\n\n\u201cThe APC is bleeding. APC lawmakers are defecting. These senators begged APC to be fair to them during the primaries. It didn\u2019t listen; now, it is begging us to stay back. Stay back and do what exactly?\n\n\u201cIf the party doesn\u2019t stop this drift, APC will not win the presidential election in the North. PDP appears to have managed the aftermath of their primary better. So, the defections are minimal. But the APC didn\u2019t do that\n\n\u201cAnother problem is that, if APC loses its majority in the Senate to the opposition, there maybe a leadership change. It means the PDP may take over the leadership of the Senate. We must guide against this. For now, we just have to wait and see how the leadership of the APC will manage these crises. But it is not looking good at all. Too many people are angry and APC will be badly affected.\u201d",

No! The first person who tried it didn\u2019t end very well.\u201d\n\nOn the leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, not being allowed to see his lawyers privately, the President dispelled such insinuation, saying the detained separatist was being given every opportunity under the law \u201cto justify all the uncomplimentary things he had been saying against Nigeria in Britain.\u201d\n\nBuhari said: \u201cHe felt very safe in Britain, and said awful things against Nigeria. We eventually got him when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court. Let him defend all that he has said there. His lawyers have access to him. Remember he jumped bail before, how are we sure he won\u2019t do it again, if he\u2019s admitted to bail?\u201d\n\nOn the keenness expressed by the PM to help Nigeria in the area of security, the President said helping to stabilize Libya could be an initial good step, as the fall of Muammar Gadaffi after 42 years in power unleashed his armed guards on countries in the Sahel, \u201cand they are causing havoc everywhere, as the only thing they know how to do is to shoot guns.\u201d\n\nOn Boko Haram insurgency, President Buhari said there was serious effort to educate the people on the fact that only an unserious person could kill innocent people, \u201cand say Allah Akbar (God is Great). God is justice. You can\u2019t take innocent souls, and ascribe it to God. And the education process is working, the people now understand Boko Haram as anti-God, and not about religion.\u201d\n\nPM Johnson said he was delighted about the good news on trade between the two countries, adding that the UK was further reducing tariffs on some goods going to Nigeria.\n\nHe described the relationship between the countries as \u201cvery strong attachment,\u201d adding: \u201cI just want to be sure that we are doing enough. It\u2019s a massive partnership for us, and we need to capitalize on it.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister offered condolences on some recent attacks in Nigeria, particularly on churches.",

He said Olaniyan\u2019s response would be read at the plenary next Wednesday.\n\nHis response was said to have been sent by his legal counsel the clerk of the Assembly four days to the expiration of the seven-day ultimatum given to him by the lawmakers.\n\nThe impeachment move was initiated after Olaniyan, a retired permanent secretary, defected from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state for the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) as a result of purported frosty relationship between him and Governor Seyi Makinde.\n\nThe Office of the Deputy Governor has, however, been moved to the Ministry of Environment, where he is expected to discharge his duties.\n\nThe letter that initiated the impeachment move was dated June 9, 2022, and was received same day in the Office of the Speaker, Adebo Ogundoyin. It was entitled: \u2018Petition and Notice of Allegations of the Deputy Governor of Oyo State, His Excellency Engineer Rauf Olaniyan.\u2019\n\nThe letter surfaced barely two weeks after Olaniyan dumped PDP for APC. In the petition read during the plenary, 24 lawmakers levelled five allegations against Olaniyan, bordering on gross misconduct, abuse of office, financial recklessness, abandonment of office and official duty, and insubordination and other offences.\n\nSpeaker Adebo Ogundoyin said the petition met the two-third requirements to initiate the impeachment process against the deputy governor. He said the lawmakers would give the deputy governor a seven-day \u2018grace period\u2019 to respond to the allegations, which would end on Wednesday June 22.\n\nHe, however, warned that failure to respond to the allegations within seven days could lead to the commencement of impeachment move.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nA Lagos-based human rights lawyer, Malcom Omoirhobo, caused a stir at the Supreme Court yesterday when he appeared in the full traditional attire of an \u201cOlokun priest\u201d to attend court proceedings.\n\nHe explained to the bewildered public that his mode of dressing was in exercise of his fundamental human rights, following the judgment of the Supreme Court that allowed Nigerians to express their ways of worship and the use of hijab in schools and public places.\n\nThe Supreme Court had, last Friday, given approval to female Muslim students to wear hijab to school in Lagos State.\n\nFive out of the seven members of the court\u2019s panel which sat on the case ruled in favour of hijab, while the two members dissented.\n\nThe lawyer, who arrived at the court at about 9:05am, created a scene in the courtroom when other lawyers, who had been seated, were taken by surprise to see him robed in traditional attire, like a herbalist.\n\nThe lawyer, who gained entry into the court, was barefooted with feathers attached to his wig. He was also wearing a gourd on his necklace with cowries and a red wrapper tied around his waist.\n\nHe dared the police officers and security guards who asked him to go out, saying that he has the right to come to the court in his traditional regalia without any harassment, in line with the judgment.\n\nThe court proceedings were abruptly stopped when the presiding justice suddenly announced that they would be going for a short break, though it could not be immediately ascertained what was responsible for the short break.\n\nThe situation attracted a large crowd who thronged the courtroom to catch a glimpse, as people were seen using their mobile phones to take his pictures.\n\nMalcom, who addressed journalists, said: \u201cI am very grateful to the Supreme Court; just last Friday, they made a very resounding decision that promotes Section 38 of the Constitution. That is our right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.\n\n\u201cThat we are free to express our way of worship in our schools and in our courts. That decision was reached on Friday and that has encouraged me.\n\n\u201cI am a traditionalist, and this is the way I worship. Based on the decision of the Supreme Court, this is how I will be dressing, henceforth, in court, because I am a strong adherent to \u201cOlokun\u201d the god of rivers.\u201d\n\nMalcom said the implication of the judgement was that every Nigerian, including doctors, police, military students, and journalists, can now wear their mode of worship in public places.\n\nHe added that he was not against the judgement, rather he was happy with the decision, because it strengthened and enriched the rights of Nigerians as stipulated in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.",

That is certainly why we are starting with one boat and we are going to expand. It is a sustainable idea, we already run ambulance services, we are only expanding to include the waterways and we have the human resources to run it,\u201d Ogboye added.\n\nAccording to him, residents in riverine communities can access the services of the floating clinic through the Lagos State Emergency Services numbers, saying \u201cOnce you contact the emergency numbers, the clinic will be deployed.\n\n\u201c LASWA can also deploy the clinic during emergency responses on the waterways. If there is a call about an emergency on the waterways, remote and riverine areas, the emergency process will be activated,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the General Manager, LASWA, Mr. Damilola Emmanuel, envisaged that the initiative will further integrate emergency and rescue systems being put in place for commuter safety in riverine communities.\n\nEmmanuel said: \u201cAs you know, for us at LASWA, we have been gradually building emergency and rescue efforts and gradually seeing how the safety on the waterways keeps improving year after year. This is just another initiative to further add to the integrated emergency and rescue system\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Health, Dr. Oreoluwa Finnih, stated that one of the core tasks of the Floating Clinic Boat is medical outreach services to riverine communities for providing primary healthcare services including immunisation, disease prevention and health promotion to citizens.\n\n\u201cMost people have the impression that Lagos is a completely urban city but for us, we realise that Lagos has a lot of communities along the waterways, which are not necessarily connected to the city. Mr. Governor, recognising this, directed that medical services be taken to these areas as part of the mandate to achieve universal health coverage. When this initiative was brought to his attention, this was one of the factors that led to the quick acquisition of the boat to bridge the identified gap in health access\u201d, she explained.",

We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter.

Three decades ago he fought a lawsuit in which the US government accused him of laundering the proceeds of heroin trafficking and eventually reached a settlement.\n\n\"Atiku Abubakar, his chief rival, brought tens of millions of dollars of \u2018suspect funds\u2019 into the US when he was Nigeria\u2019s vice president in the 2000s, according to a US Senate report, and was implicated in a bribery case that resulted in the imprisonment of an American congressman. Neither episode resulted in charges against Abubakar.\n\nThe Spokesmen for Tinubu and Abubakar didn\u2019t respond to requests made by Bloomberg for comments.\n\nThe report noted that Nigeria\u2019s next president will face a daunting challenge to turn around Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nIt further noted that falling oil production threatens Nigeria\u2019s place as the continent\u2019s biggest crude producer.\n\nIt lamented how inflation is soaring in the country with more than half of the working-age population either unemployed or underemployed.\n\n\n\n\"The local currency has depreciated steeply under outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari, falling from around N220 to the US dollar on the widely-used parallel market when he was first elected in early 2015 to about N600 this week.\n\n\n\n\"Nigeria vies with India as the country with the highest number of people living in extreme poverty despite having a seventh of the population. Meanwhile, secessionists, Islamist militants and armed criminal gangs terrorize large swathes of territory.\n\n\n\nEfforts to restore security and fix the economy alone will likely fall short because there\u2019s an unavoidable connection between financial graft and government dysfunction in Nigeria, said Leena Koni Hoffmann, an associate fellow at Chatham House in London.\n\nCorruption \u201chollows systems out and cripples them from the inside,\u201d she said.\n\n\"The race will see the two wealthy septuagenarians mobilize impressive political machines built over more than 30 years pursuing power in Africa\u2019s most-populous country. Voters in Nigeria are often offered cash, food or clothing to persuade them to cast their ballots for particular candidates.\n\nThe report recalled how on the eve of the last election in 2019, two armoured bank vans were photographed driving into Tinubu\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cIf I have money to spend, if I like, I give it to the people for free of charge as long as it\u2019s not to buy votes,\u201d Tinubu told reporters when asked what the vehicles were transporting.\n\n\n\n\"Tinubu and Abubakar have cultivated deep systems of political patronage, according to Hoffmann. Both men excel at \u201cengineering and expanding political networks through co-optation, through channeling and redistributing money and positions and favors,\u201d she said.\n\n\"Tinubu, 70, who lives in Lagos\u2019s wealthiest neighborhood, says he made his fortune before going into politics by investing well and working as an accountant for companies including Deloitte LLP.\n\n\u201cAbubakar, 75, who splits his time between Nigeria and Dubai, spent two decades working for the government\u2019s customs department and co-founded a large logistics and oil services firm that has operated concessions at Nigerian ports,\u201d the report added.\n\nIt recalled a report published in 2010 by the US Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which said one of Abubakar\u2019s wives helped her husband bring more than $40 million in \u201csuspect funds\u201d into the US while he was Nigeria\u2019s vice president.\n\nThis included at least $1.7 million in bribes paid by Siemens AG. Abubakar and his then-spouse previously have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nFormer US Representative William Jefferson was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2009 for taking bribes from American companies interested in doing business in Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nIn July 2005, Jefferson told a cooperating witness that Atiku Abubakar had also agreed to accept a bribe in exchange for his assistance, according to the Louisiana congressman\u2019s indictment.\n\nAtiku, however, denied the allegations, saying he had no personal or business relationship with Jefferson.\n\nAbubakar\u2019s hopes of succeeding President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007 were torpedoed when the EFCC declared him unfit to hold public office and a Nigerian Senate panel recommended his prosecution for allegedly diverting government funds.\n\nBut Atiku has described it as political persecution.\n\nBoth Tinubu and Atiku will focus on issues other than corruption while campaigning, said Hoffmann. \u201cThey know it\u2019s not part of their political image,\u201d she said.",

Both men excel at \u201cengineering and expanding political networks through co-optation, through channeling and redistributing money and positions and favors,\u201d she said.\n\n\"Tinubu, 70, who lives in Lagos\u2019s wealthiest neighborhood, says he made his fortune before going into politics by investing well and working as an accountant for companies including Deloitte LLP.\n\n\u201cAbubakar, 75, who splits his time between Nigeria and Dubai, spent two decades working for the government\u2019s customs department and co-founded a large logistics and oil services firm that has operated concessions at Nigerian ports,\u201d the report added.\n\nIt recalled a report published in 2010 by the US Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which said one of Abubakar\u2019s wives helped her husband bring more than $40 million in \u201csuspect funds\u201d into the US while he was Nigeria\u2019s vice president.\n\nThis included at least $1.7 million in bribes paid by Siemens AG. Abubakar and his then-spouse previously have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nFormer US Representative William Jefferson was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2009 for taking bribes from American companies interested in doing business in Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nIn July 2005, Jefferson told a cooperating witness that Atiku Abubakar had also agreed to accept a bribe in exchange for his assistance, according to the Louisiana congressman\u2019s indictment.\n\nAtiku, however, denied the allegations, saying he had no personal or business relationship with Jefferson.\n\nAbubakar\u2019s hopes of succeeding President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2007 were torpedoed when the EFCC declared him unfit to hold public office and a Nigerian Senate panel recommended his prosecution for allegedly diverting government funds.\n\nBut Atiku has described it as political persecution.\n\nBoth Tinubu and Atiku will focus on issues other than corruption while campaigning, said Hoffmann. \u201cThey know it\u2019s not part of their political image,\u201d she said.",
          "summary": "The presidential candidates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar, have been described as unfit to end corruption in the country.\nAccording to the report, the history of graft allegations surrounding the two candidates means neither is likely to curb corruption in the run-up to February\u2019s vote.\nThe report noted that Nigeria\u2019s next president will face a daunting challenge to turn around Africa\u2019s largest economy.\nIn July 2005, Jefferson told a cooperating witness that Atiku Abubakar had also agreed to accept a bribe in exchange for his assistance, according to the Louisiana congressman\u2019s indictment.\nBoth Tinubu and Atiku will focus on issues other than corruption while campaigning, said Hoffmann.",

          "text": "The Indigenous People of Biafra has alleged that the Nigerian government through the various security agencies unlawfully arrest and detain Igbos particularly the youths, and transport them to military facilities in the Northern region where they are killed and their organs harvested.\n\nIPOB, in a statement by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful said majority of the atrocities are committed at Wawa military barracks at Kainji in Niger State.\n\nAccording to the statement, the victims were arrested since over a year ago, from their homes in the South-East region and taken to the far north, after which the security operatives deny them access to legal services and cut them off from their families and friends.\n\nIPOB called on the international community to prevail upon the Nigerian government and its security agencies to release every Igbo person who is being detained without trial.\n\nIt further warned the Nigerian Police, operatives of the Department of State Services and others to stop attacking Igbos who have committed no crime stating that there's nothing the government can do to stop the actualisation of the Biafran nation.\n\nA statement from the group reads, \u201cWe wish to condemn the continued and unlawful detention of Igbo youths, fathers and mothers in Imo State, Anambra State, Enugu State, Abia state and Ebonyi State detention facilities in the North more especially in Wawa military barracks at Kenji (Kainji) Niger State.\n\n\"The people were unlawfully abducted and moved to the military facilities in North and some of these people were killed and harvested their important organs in the military barracks camp.\n\n\"The people were unlawfully abducted and moved to the North since one year ago, they were being detained incommunicado, all efforts made by their lawyers, family and associates were rebuffed by Nigeria Government and her security agents in Wawa military barracks of Niger State.\n\n\"We hereby bring to global consciousness the attitude of the Nigerian police/Military in whose custody our Igbo people are denied of their fundamental human right.\n\n\"Both old and young men, women and ladies since their unlawful abduction without being charged to court, they are being prevented from contact with their families, friends and colleagues, they also been hidden away from lawyers and denied access to legal services, human rights agencies assistance.\n\n\"We appeal to the International community to prevail on Nigeria Government and its security agents to discharge all the Igbo people unlawfully arrested without trial from the above-mentioned States because this act is a pure \"human rights violation of a particular race\" \"racial profiling, violation of freedom of worship, discrimination and persecution\".\n\n\"The Nigeria Military, DSS, Paramilitary and Police must ensure that our Innocent Igbo citizens languishing in God-forsaken dungeon called Nigeria detention facilities in the Niger State of Nigeria be released and in good and sound health.\n\n\"We have a pertinent question that requires an urgent answer. We want to ascertain why the Nigerian army, police and DSS agents like to arrest only Igbo in Nigeria, is it because they are looking forward to achieving Biafra freedom through nonviolent posture and passive resistance? We need them to answer this question?\n\n\"Why do Nigeria Army, Police and DSS agents always create or manufacture false reasons to profile, kill and kidnap any person of \"IGBO RACE\" in a discriminatory manner or better still, steal from them with wielding heavy arms, but dare not harass other tribes in Nigeria, steal with arms, kidnap, kill Igbo and mount revenue-generating checkpoints in every 1-kilometre road in Igboland? This begs for an urgent answer.\n\n\"IPOB now watches with keen interest going forward on discriminatory treatment and crimes against Biafrans and Igbos in particular. We are everywhere and our eyes and ears are everywhere as well.\n\n\"Igbos are the most law-abiding race within our space, we are Fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters that has high regard for lives, therefore we warn the Nigerian Armed forces and Police desist from killing Igbos untimely otherwise it will bounce back to them harshly.\n\n\"The Biafra restoration project has crossed the Rubicon and can no longer be stopped and it would be achieved in no distant time. Nigeria military should dignify themselves by releasing the Igbos under incarceration in various confinement facilities including those in Wawa military detention centre in Niger State and other Northern states in Nigeria.\n\n\"We call on well-meaning Igbos to exercise the spirit of \u00f3n\u00far\u00fa ube nwanne agbala \u00f3s\u00f3 (he who hears the agonising cry of his sibling should not run away) to facilitate within ones means the process to release all innocent Biafrans citizens detained in the Military Barracks in Niger State and all Northern states.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "The impact of exchange rate volatility in Nigeria is spreading across sectors such that in real estate, it has created what experts call \u2018naira and dollar economy\u2019 in the premium segment of the market.\n\nIn Ikoyi, Banana Island and Victoria Island, which are home to premium real estate, there is an increase in tall structures in the pipeline, under construction, and nearing completion and each development falls under the dollar or naira economy.\n\n\u201cDue to the fluctuation around the naira, there is a dichotomy between naira and dollar initiatives, with the result that intelligent investors tend to drift towards the dollar economy in order to enhance their return on investments,\u201d Udo Okonjo, CEO, Fine and Country West Africa, told BusinessDay.\n\nOkonjo noted that working with naira-based projects was dangerous for investors, especially in the elite luxury market. She added that top developers in the luxury real estate business have been sticking with the dollar economy in the past five years.\n\nIn the luxury real estate market, there are micro divisions that are sometimes referred to as affordable luxury real estate. Developers in this segment, according to Okonjo, frequently work in the luxury real estate naira-based sector. \u201cDespite being tall buildings, these constructions are priced in naira and range in height from 8 to 12 storeys,\u201d she said.\n\nShe pointed out that the more complex the construction and the investment necessary, the higher the cost of the building, which is reflected in the pricing, disclosing that average residential space prices in the luxury segment range from $2500 to $4500 per square metre, with more affordable options falling somewhere between $2850 and $3500 square metres. The more exclusive spaces, such as the penthouse, cost around 4500 per square metre and up.\n\nUnlike other house-types, the development of luxury real estate takes time which is why Okonjo said \u201cdesperation does not fit with luxury.\u201d She said that developers of luxury real estate are willing to wait and collaborate with their intended/target audience. \u201cThe delivery time frame for these developments is typically 4\u20137 years,\u201d she noted.\n\nOkonjo listed a few things potential buyers and investors in luxury real estate ought to know about that exclusive market. According to her, the luxury real estate market is often reserved for long-term investors, adding that industrialists, financial institutions, and some corporations that have capital in the country that is dedicated to the Nigerian market are among these investors.\n\n\u201cOne strategy to diversify is to invest in luxury residential real estate, as this is an area where the fund\u2019s worth can be preserved. Multinationals, public-private sector (Kanti Towers was sold to Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) for $17.47 billion in 2021), corporate, and ultra-high net worth investors are among the commercial segments\u2019 investors,\u201d she said.\n\nRead also: Why real estate is soft target for investing laundered money\n\nThe Famfa Oil and Dangote skyscraper are set to deliver in 2022, adding to the stock of Grade A office space in the city, although these investors aren\u2019t typically thought of as developers.\n\nThey plan to use these high-rise buildings for themselves or for a portion of their use, while others are looking for up-takers. These investors are patient and selective in who they allow inside their properties.\n\nThey would sometimes keep the property for a long period until they find the right kind of client to occupy this space. In the commercial luxury market, this might cause market distortions in terms of vacancy rate, supply, demand, and conversion rate.\n\nInvestors anxious about their naira stack and not being able to convert it to dollars or take it out of the country are increasingly turning to real estate as a safe haven. They may not have all of the finances, but they are willing to work together on large commercial and residential luxury space projects in terms of collaboration.\n\n\u201cIn terms of commercial figures, it varies depending on the location, from Ikoyi to Victoria Island, which is reflected in their rates. Grade A, B and other categories exist for office spaces, but at Fine and Country, we focus on Grade A office spaces,\u201d Okonjo said.\n\nSome of these office space developers, investors, and landlords weren\u2019t as flexible a few years ago. However, with the downsizing and giving back of office spaces in the previous three years, particularly with COVID, landlords have become more practical, offering concessions such as rent-free and fit-out periods as a sort of discount.",

          "text": "As the summer travel season is picking up, the air fares paid by travellers from Nigeria to other destinations have risen by 100 percent as foreign airlines\u2019 trapped funds in Nigeria hit $450 million.\n\nForeign airlines operating in the country have blocked almost all low ticket inventories on their websites, making it difficult for passengers to buy affordable tickets.\n\nThis, according to BusinessDay findings, is in order to mitigate the current difficulties experienced by them in accessing their funds from tickets sold in Nigeria as a result of foreign exchange scarcity.\n\nThe airlines are forced to source for dollars in the parallel market at the cost of N590 to a dollar against the official rate of N418 to a dollar.\n\nFor instance, the average cost of N350,000 for the lowest economy class inventory for a return ticket on British Airways, Virgin Atlantic or Emirates on the Lagos-London route has been removed, and the available tickets cost at least N650,000 on Wednesday.\n\nThe Lagos-US return ticket is also seeing a sharp increase across airlines from N500,000 to about N950,000.\n\nThe lowest economy class inventory for a Lagos-Canada return ticket, which used to cost an average of N550,000, cost above N1 million as of Wednesday.\n\nSusan Akporiaye, president of National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies, told BusinessDay that the trapped funds of foreign airlines have risen in a space of a few weeks from $300 million to $450 million, adding: \u201cThis is making the airlines so scared and we hope they don\u2019t stop operating in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this continues, foreign airlines may restrict travel agents in Nigeria from selling tickets, except tickets emanating from their own countries where passengers have to pay in foreign currencies. Already, all the low inventories have been taken away from the airlines\u2019 websites and they only sell higher inventories,\u201d Akporiaye said.\n\nRead also: Global summer travel to get boost with return of 737 MAX\n\nAccording to her, if the issue is not addressed and the funds keep increasing, what happened in 2016 when airlines had to exit the country as a result of their $700 million trapped funds may happen again.\n\nShe called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to intervene in the issue by releasing the funds to the airlines.\n\nIn 2016, when airlines funds were trapped in Nigeria, many airlines reduced frequency into the country while United Airlines and Iberia Airlines suspended flights into Nigeria and till date, Iberia Airlines has not returned.\n\nBankole Bernard, group managing director at Finchglow Group Nigeria, a travel management company, also confirmed to BusinessDay that foreign airlines had closed all lower ticket inventories and started selling tickets that cost more.\n\nHe said: \u201cI feel for summer travellers during this period. I wonder how they are going to cope. CBN has to do something to salvage the issue. Funds have been released to other sectors, and I am wondering why a sector as important as travel is not included.\n\n\u201cThe travel agents in Nigeria together sell $1bn worth of tickets annually. The travel agents are currently doing about 85 percent of what they were doing pre-COVID era. So, almost all airlines want to come into Nigeria. This is a sector that should not be neglected.\u201d\n\nKingsley Nwokeoma, the president of Association of Foreign Airlines and Representatives in Nigeria, said if everyone keeps holding on to funds that should be repatriated, there would be no operations.\n\nAccording to Nwokeoma, the funds are supposed to be used for maintenance, payment of salaries and aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe aircraft foreign carriers deploy to Nigeria are purchased with payment structures. If airlines start to sell tickets in dollars, they won\u2019t be having these issues but Nigeria\u2019s regulations do not allow them to sell tickets in dollars. We hope it won\u2019t get to a point where the airlines will start to leave,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the airlines had tried to use diplomatic channels to address the issues, adding that the government, the aviation minister and the CBN should look for ways to resolve the issue.\n\nRead also: Tourism: can Europe save its summer?\n\nBusinessDay gathered that the troubles of travellers have worsened as Nigerian banks put a $20 limit on Nigerian debit cards. This means travellers cannot spend more than $20 daily on their debit cards, making it very difficult to pay for tickets or visa fees using the Nigerian debit cards.\n\n\u201cI wanted to travel to Egypt and I was told that I have to pay for the visa fee in dollars. After sourcing for dollars to pay for my visa, the embassy still didn\u2019t give me a visa. How can the federal government make travellers go through these difficulties because they want to travel?\u201d a traveller who craved anonymity told BusinessDay.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026insists continuous strike action by varsity unions injustice to students\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said the government\u2019s decision to suspend all union activities across state-owned institutions of higher learning is not aimed at witch-hunting anyone but to protect the interest of students in the state.\n\nThe decision followed the protest by students of Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma, over the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), after which the government directed all cadre of staff to report to their duty posts immediately.\n\nObaseki, while addressing veteran labour leaders who were on a courtesy visit, at the Government House, Benin City, said the workers\u2019 decision to down tools was not justifiable given that the state government has been up and doing in meeting her financial obligations to the school and its workers.\n\nHe noted that their action amounts to injustice against the students whose peers are having unbroken academic calendar in private and other state-owned universities across the country.\n\nObaseki said, \u201cWe don\u2019t play politics with education. We will not compromise education because we are who we are today because of the quality of education that we received. As a government, we are committed to improving education as the reforms we are putting in place are in the long-term interest of the staff of AAU.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur students cried to us begging us to help them go back to school, resume classes and graduate, and we approached the lecturers to go back to class, but they said no. What do you want us to do?\n\n\u201cIf ASUU has a problem with the federal government, how is that our problem in Edo State? This is a deliberate effort to give private universities an edge and advantage over government-owned institutions. If ASUU has a problem with the federal government, why should we suffer in Edo?\u201d he queried.\n\nObaseki added, \u201cWe have done so much in AAU and have embarked on several reforms and wonder why a school like AAU that is about 45 years old with over 30,000 students can\u2019t pay their bills.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to discuss but don\u2019t put someone\u2019s problems on us as we are a small state and want to build modern institutions ourselves, and expect everyone to cooperate and not to fight us for providing quality education to your child. Even some of these union leaders have their children abroad.\u201d\n\nThe governor also appealed to the former labour leaders to intervene by reaching out to the union to reconsider their position as the state government is willing to discuss and resolve any lingering issue.\n\nHe further stated, \u201cWork with us and let us stop this confrontation. We are ready to talk, but go and appeal to them. The state government is not fighting them. It\u2019s time to sit across the table and make sacrifices to improve the educational system. Please, appeal to them; we are not the federal government. If they are fighting the federal government, they should go and do it in Abuja. We are in Edo and want to manage our resources and get the best in the interest of the students.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted that his administration is labour-friendly, adding, \u201cThis is why in almost seven years, there has not been any serious labour issue in the state.\u201d\n\nOn his part, leader of the group and a former chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress in the defunct Bendel State, Comrade Olu Aderibigbe, hailed the governor for increasing the minimum wage from N30,000 to N40,000.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo employer of labour in Africa will increase wages without negotiation but you have achieved this. Thank you for the building of the Edo State Civil Servant Secretariat, the John Odigie-Oyegun Training Academy, and the construction of Labour House.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are one of the most labour-friendly governors in the country,\u201d the former labour chair added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 Some folk nitpick about the disconcerting growing culture in some African societies on the \u201ccelebration of life\u201d of people at funerals.\n\nWhy do we people spare birthday parties or appreciate our loved one while alive but give \u201dbefitting burials\u201d when the person has journeyed beyond and cannot hear or feel anything? They quiz.\n\nBirthdays normally offer us that special moment to honour people who have impacted our lives positively. To let the celebrants and the whole world know how grateful and proud we are for the their lives and legacies.\n\nRecently, social media platforms go agog with birthday celebrations of users but most times the celebration stops at the virtual space with only flowery words and pictures. Only few people travel miles to attend birthday parties but no so with funerals.\n\nSo when Benin City was painted red on Sunday for the eighty-two birthday bash of Dcns. Ayo Eguavoen, it dimmed posthumous and sometimes hollow funeral tributes that our society has become so engrossed with.\n\nNow, the worthy mother and grandmother will live to savour the sweet memories of her birthday celebration which was quite magnificent with over one thousand dignitaries far and near looking in their finest styles to honour Iye, a Benin name for Matriarch.\n\nDcns Ayo\u2019s children all attributed their successes in life to the sacrifices of their mother whom they all described as \u201cvirtous woman\u201d. They recalled how their mom would go extra miles to ensure that they were well fed and went to school.\n\nEven after their dad was ill for over a decade and eventually passed on, their \u201cwonderful mother remained a strong pillar for the family\u201d.\n\nThe party also presented an opportunity for them to specially thank their mom for looking after their late dad for the many years he was down with paralysis. \u201cOnly a virtous woman who\u2019s caring, compassionate and hard-working\u201d can do what she did. One of daughters said.\n\nA peep into Dcns. Eguavoen\u2019s biography tells a story of \u201can industrious young woman who is also selfless in relating with people\u201d. Born in 1940, Iye understood early in life the dignity of labour and the benefits of industry.\n\nIt was this quest for self reliance that made her a keen learner when she was enrolled in seamstress training under the direction of Mrs. Uhunnamen Ologboso of blessed memories. She recalled how she was loved by her mistress due to her \u201cdedication to work and being responsible for the different task that was given\u201d.\n\nThe seamstress certificate Dcns. Ayo Eguaveon earned as a teenager remains the only educational qualification of her life that she never stops telling her children and grandchildren about.\n\nWhile paying tribute to her mother, Pastor (Mrs) Gladys Ohenzuwa who is the second child and first daughter of Dcns. Eguavoen said: \u201cthough you never had a former education, you hold PhD in smartness because as a seamstress, you can take measurements of twenty women, never write them down yet will never forget them\u201d\n\nA marvelled Gladys recalled that her excellent seamstress mother hardly made amends to clothes she made for her clients. \u201cMy mother still makes her own clothes. Sometimes I just wonder how she does those things so effortlessly\u201d, she said.\n\nOn a special day set aside to honour to a well deserved Matriarch whom her offsprings said their stories can not be complete without a recurring respect to the great roles she played, they minced no words to tell guests how they felt.\n\nCharles Eguaveon who is the octogenarian\u2019s first child described her as \u201d the rock that I know I can always lean on without hesitation and doubt\u201d. With a reassuring smiles, he said \u201cnothing can separate me from my mother, she\u2019s paid her dues and it\u2019s our time to give her the due respect\u201d.\n\nOtasowie Eguaveon, another son was particularly excited \u201cthat am not here to pay funeral tribute but to celebrate my beloved mother alive, a virtuous woman who has done well for her children and her family at large\u201d. He remembered the sacrifices their mother made to give them good education despite she was not so privileged.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s children are a crown to the aged, and parents are the pride of their children.\u201d said the Holy Bible. Dcns Eguaveon no doubt has the rare crown of a fufilled motherhood whose children are proud of.\n\nAt 82, Iye\u2019s \u201cchildren rise up and call her blessed\u201d and was her husband alive today, he would rightly say of her: \u201dMany women have done excellently, but you surpass them all\u201d\n\nThis is the honour of a lifetime accorded a Nigerian mother whose sacrifices for her four sons and two daughters have yielded fruits and today are proud dual citizens of United States of America and Nigeria.\n\nIf the \u201cJoys of Motherhood\u201d a novel written by Buchi Emecheta in 1979 include being taken care of in old age, being surrounded by grandchildren, and being honored as a wife and mother, then Dcns. Ayo Eguaveon has rightly reaped them all in abundance.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The foundation was set up by a former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Solomon Arase, who celebrated his 66th birthday.\n\nCommending Arase and other residents for their support in tackling insecurity in the state, the governor expressed satisfaction that \u201ccitizens of Edo State on their own spend time to rethink the security situation of the State, task themselves and raise resources to complement the government\u2019s efforts at tackling the security challenges in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki further charged leaders across the country on selflessness, urging them on the need to give back to society, contributing effectively to the development of their communities.\n\nHe said leaders must invest in giving back to the society that made them, ensuring the empowerment of the less-privileged in society.\n\nCommending the philanthropic gesture of former Inspector General of Police, Arase, the governor said, \u201cWe thank you for your support and leadership. You are not one of the wealthiest of public officers but rich in terms of spirit. It\u2019s not how much you have received but how much you have given back to society.\n\n\u201cOur society requires so much from us. What is important for us now as elites is what we can give back to society. You are one of the best, finest, and most intelligent police officers ever produced in this country. We are proud of your achievements as you are passionate and in love with the profession of policing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sole responsibility of the government is to provide security. Without security, we have no need for the government. This shows the importance of security in Nigeria. I am glad you are now in the vanguard of pushing for citizens\u2019 policing in the country,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, Arase said, \u201cThe people must come together to fight insecurity, which is our common enemy. This should be the model we must use and leave behind for Edo people. We have to team up as there are a lot of ungoverned spaces in this country. We must galvanise our youths to deepen security in the state and ensure the safety of our people.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe items donated include one sienna vehicle, 500 motorcycles, over 1,000 customised T-shirts, face caps, raincoats, torch lights, and ant whistles. These kits should be judiciously utilised to improve the security situation in the state. This foundation was set up in 2016 when I was retiring from the police force.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecurity is capital intensive and we all need to support the government to combat crime in our society as the government cannot do it alone unless through our collaborative efforts,\u201d Arase added\n\nReassuring of improved security in the state, the Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro pledged, \u201cWe will fight crime and criminality to the highest level in Edo State. We will not be reactive but proactive in fighting crime. We will take the fight to them and ensure the state is uncomfortable for criminals.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, has said that industry collaboration is essential to the successful deployment of 5G services in Nigeria.\n\nDanbatta, while speaking in Lagos at the 90th Edition of the Telecom Consumer Parliament (TCP) hosted by the Consumer Affairs Bureau of the commission on Wednesday, urged industry stakeholders to stand with the commission to explore the prospects and potentials of the new technology, which is enormous.\n\nThe NCC boss said the policy framework for the deployment has come into place and will facilitate deployment of services by the recent winners of the 3.5GHz spectrum auction, MTN Nigeria Communications Ltd and MAFAB Communications Ltd.\n\nHe said the Commission has set out the regulatory instruments needed for fast deployment of the new versatile technology for the benefit of the consumers and the stakeholders.\n\nProf. Danbatta, therefore, invited the support of all stakeholders to ensure that 5G technology is deployed in Nigeria in a manner beneficial to all telecom consumers and to support the emergent Digital Economy Policy of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nHe highlighted the potential use cases for 5G networks as broadly categorised by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to include Enhanced Mobile broadband (eMBB), Massive Machine-type Communications (mMTC), as well as Ultra-reliable and Low-latency Communications (uLLC)\n\n\u201cWe will continue to collaborate with stakeholders across sectors to ensure faster deployment of 5G services, and accelerate the growth of Nigeria\u2019s broadband infrastructure,\u201d he said.\n\nHe identified some challenges in the deployment to include limited frequencies with the required spectral efficiency, skilled professionals with requisite knowledge of the technology, fewer number of 5G-enabled devices, and cost of deployment but stated that the industry must work to turn the challenges into opportunities rather than seeing them as obstacles.\n\nProf. Danbatta said the issues that should militate against or slow down the deployment of 5G technology are themselves opportunities that can potentially create new revenue streams or new subsectors in the industry.\n\nIn the panel discussion on the presentation titled \u201c5G Networks: Opportunities and Challenges\u201d by Director, Technical Standards and Network Integrity, Bako Wakil, the Executive Commissioner, Stakeholder Management of NCC, Adeleke Adewolu, who chaired the panel session, urged all participants to exploit the opportunities offered by the 90th TCP to contribute to the deployment of 5G Network in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe must conclude this Telecom Consumer Parliament with solutions to challenges that are associated with 5G deployment in countries that had deployed the services ahead of Nigeria. We must also have a clear roadmap on how the opportunities offered by the technology can be maximized for the benefit of Nigerians\u201d Adewolu said.\n\nThe event was attended by representatives of Mobile Networks Operators (MNOs), the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), Association of Telecom Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Consumer Advocacy and Empowerment Foundation (CADEF), Association of Telecoms Cable TV and Internet Subscribers (ATCIS), and other key stakeholders in the telecom industry.",

          "text": "Reuben Muoka, an innovative journalist and consummate public relations practitioner has been appointed as Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC)\u2019s new director of public affairs (DPA).\n\nHis appointment was announced in a statement on Thursday, by Prof. Umar Danbatta, the commission\u2019s Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMuoka takes over from Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, who has assumed duties as the Director of Special Duties Department of the Commission.\n\nThe new NCC\u2019s spokesman was recently promoted a substantive director, alongside Ismail Adedigba, now Director of Research and Development (R&D); and Gwa-Tobi Mohammed, who has also assumed duties as Director/Secretary to the Board of the Commission.\n\nMuoka was in 2021, appointed to head the Special Duties Department, which superintends the International Relations Unit; Emergency Communication Centres Unit; the Public Private Partnership Unit; and the Security Services Unit of the Commission. He was promoted as Director of the Department before his current redeployment to lead the Public Affairs Department, the arm of the Commission mandated to manage the image and visibility of Nigeria\u2019s telecom regulator and a leading light of the Nigerian public service.\n\nMuoka is expected to bring his rich and versatile experience in both specialized and traditional journalism, public relations, integrated marketing communications (IMC), corporate communication and people management, to bear on the Commission\u2019s vision to expand the frontiers of its public goodwill and the impact of its reputational assets.\n\nA former Deputy Communications Editor of the Vanguard Newspapers, former Deputy General Manager at MTS First Wireless (Nigeria\u2019s first mobile telephone operator), Muoka joined the NCC in 2007 as a Principal Manager, and was deployed to the Public Affairs Department where he headed the Media and Public Relations Unit. He later rose from the rank of Principal Manager to the position of an Assistant Director in 2010, and by 2015, as a Deputy Director, appointed to head the re-engineered Public Relations Unit of PAD. In 2017, he was redeployed to the Policy, Competition and Economic Analysis Department to head the Economic Analysis unit of department.\n\nMuoka earned M.Sc. degree in Mass Communication from the University of Lagos, specialising in Public Relations and Advertising, where he had earlier successfully completed a Postgraduate Diploma (PGD) in the same field of Mass Communication. Much earlier, he had obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in Performing Arts at the University of Ilorin.\n\nAs a mark of his distinctive journalism career, Muoka received a fellowship of the Egyptian Embassy in Nigeria to undertake a Pan-African training and tour of Egypt in 1999, leading to an award of a continental Diploma Certificate in Journalism at the instance of the Egyptian Ministry of Information, and the African Journalists Union (AJU) in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nThe focused, innovative and illuminating coverage and analysis of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in the pre and immediate post liberalisation period of telecom industry in Nigeria is credited to the insights of visionary journalists like Muoka, whose pioneering initiative led to the establishment and institutionalisation of the Hi-Tech Desk in Vanguard Newspapers in late 1990s. As the Chairman of the League of Communications Correspondents (LECCO), Muoka led his colleagues to give voice and focus to the advocacy for the liberalisation and deregulation of the telecom industry in Nigeria in the 1990s.\n\nDuring his active days in journalism at Vanguard Newspapers, Muoka served concurrently as Africa\u2019s contributing editor to the London-based CommunicationsWeek for four years beginning from 1998, during which he undertook copious reportage of the African telecom landscape. The London-based magazine shared Muoka\u2019s work to an enthusiastic global audience in a rare showcase of Africa\u2019s promise as a flourishing point for the emergent converging telecommunications industry.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2001, Muoka leveraged his expertise to provide part-time public relations consultancy to notable companies and institutions in the telecommunications industry, including the Nigerian Mobile Communications Limited, Abuja; Multi-links Telecommunications Limited, Lagos; Satellite Telecommunications Limited, Lagos; Pulse Marketing Communications Ltd, Lagos; and the Nigerian Communications Commission, Abuja, years before he joined the Commission as a staff.\n\nReuben Ejike Muoka is a member of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ); a full member of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (mnipr); and an associate member of the Registered Practitioners of Advertising (arpa), regulated by the Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON).\n\nOn behalf of the Board and Management of the Commission, I heartily congratulate Reuben on his new role and look forward to working closely with him and his team in Public Affairs Department, as key internal stakeholders in the Commission\u2019s re-engineering processes to meet and surpass Federal Government\u2019s expectations for a robust telecommunications sector and a remarkably emergent digital economy.",

          "text": "More details have emerged about the arrest earlier today of a former Deputy Senate President of Nigeria, Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice by the Metropolitan Police over a plot to harvest the kidney of a 15-year-old boy.\n\nIke Ekweremadu, a People\u2019s Democratic Party politician for 19 years and Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu both of whom appeared in court today, are accused of trying to traffic the 15-year-old to the UK from Lagos.\n\nThe court heard the couple, who have four children and a house in Willesden, North London, hoped to transplant the boy\u2019s organs to their daughter who suffers from kidney failure.\n\nPolice were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery laws last month.\n\nThey arrested the couple two days ago at Heathrow Airport as they attempted to board a plane to Turkey \u2013 where it was suggested that the procedure could take place \u2013 the court heard.\n\nEkweremadu, 60, is said to have had \u00a320,000 on him at the time of his arrest, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe child is now under the care of safeguarding authorities and the Metropolitan Police, officials say.\n\nEkweremadu and accountant wife Beatrice, 55, are charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation, namely organ harvesting.\n\nThe senator was wearing a grey sweater while his wife was wearing a black and white knitted cardigan at Uxbridge Magistrates\u2019 Court today.\n\nProsecutor Damla Ayas said: \u2018It is conspiracy in relation to human trafficking offences for the purposes of organ harvesting. The victim in this case is 15 years old\n\n\u2018They the couple were interviewed at the police station. Both of the defendants have provided a prepared statement.\n\n\u2018Mr Ekweremadu in his prepared statement denied allegations of human trafficking.\n\n\u2018He said at no stage has he arranged transport for anyone with intention to exploit them.\u2019\n\nHis wife similarly denied the allegations in her prepared statement, the court heard.\n\nGavin Irwin, representing Ekweremadu, said: \u2018There is no question this is a serious allegation. Mr Ekweremadu is a member of the senate in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018He has previously held an even more senior role as deputy president of the senate.\n\n\u2018He is a member of the bar in Nigeria. He is a principal in a law firm that bears his name.\n\n\u2018Those issues taken together go way beyond him being a person of good character\u2026rather that he has led a blameless life as a public servant.\u2019\n\nMr Irwin added that the allegations were \u2018nothing short of preposterous\u2019.\n\nAntonia Gray, for Mrs Ekweremadu, said: \u2018She has never been complicit or involved in any alleged illegal trafficking of any young person.\n\n\u2018She is a financial accountant\u2026with an unblemished record.\u2019\n\nThe couple have an address they could stay at in Willesden, northwest London, the court heard.\n\nThe prosecutor made an application to adjourn matters for 14 days.\n\nMs Ayas said: \u2018In respect of these offences Attorney General consent is required and the Crown require 14 days for that to be obtained.\u2019\n\nMagistrate Lois Sheard said: \u2018These are serious allegations and these matters are now adjourned until 7 July back here at Uxbridge.\u2019\n\nMs Sheard remanded both defendants into custody ahead of their hearing next month.\n\nThe Ekweremadus are charged with \u2018conspiring to arrange or facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation\u2026.between 1 August 2021 and 5 May 2022 within the jurisdiction of Central Criminal Court\u2019.\n\nThe investigation was launched by the Met\u2019s Specialist Crime team after detectives were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery legislation in May 2022.\n\nThe Met Police has confirmed that the boy is safe and being looked after. Mr Ekweremadu was held with Nwanneka Ekweremadu in Britain this month.\n\nMr Ekweremadu has been an elected senator at the Abuja-based parliament since 2003 after moving into politics after years as a lawyer.\n\nHis wife, five years his junior, is an academic and doctor and also a major public figure in Nigeria. They are believed to have four adult children.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said the child, who is under the age of 18, at the centre of the alleged plot is in care.\n\nOrgan harvesting involves removing parts of the body, often for cash and against the victim\u2019s will.\n\nEkweremadu has been in the UK for at least the past fortnight having met with members of the Nigerian community in Britain in Lincoln around ten days ago.\n\nHe tweeted: \u2018It was a pleasure and an honour to receive a letter of appointment by the University of Lincoln, UK, as Visiting Professor of Corporate and International Linkages. I also got a highly treasured gift \u2013 a copy of the Magna Carta. It was created in 1215, about 807 years ago\u2019.\n\nThe investigation was launched after detectives were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery legislation in May 2022, the force said.\n\nIn 2017 a former Nigerian government minister claimed that migrants from his country were having their organs harvested after being sold into slavery.\n\nFemi Fani-Kayode, a onetime aviation minister in Nigeria, claimed that 75 per cent of slaves who have their organs harvested in North Africa are from his country.\n\nThe Cambridge University-educated lawyer added that the victims have their \u2018bodies mutilated\u2019 and are \u2018roasted like suya [shish kebabs]\u2019. He went on: \u2018Roasted alive! This is what Libyans do to sub-Saharan Africans who are looking for a transit point to Europe.\n\n\u2018They sell them into slavery and either murder, mutilate, torture or work them to death.\u2019\n\nSource: MailOnline",

Job vacancies were little changed in other provinces.\n\nCIBC\u2019s deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal doesn\u2019t see the job vacancy situation improving notably anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWages will have to rise and working conditions will need to improve in order to attract people back,\u201d he said.\n\nAverage hourly wages of all employees rose three per cent from a year earlier, while the Consumer Price Index increased 5.8 per cent during that period, according to Statistics Canada.\n\nBMO economist and macro strategist Benjamin Reitzes explains that Canadian workers are likely to see further wage increases across industries, not just in one or two.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some upward pressure on wages but nothing too substantial just yet and that could be taste of what\u2019s to come in the months ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, there could be a cool off in pay boosts later in the year, Reitzes notes.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not there just yet,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is evidence that the economy is already starting to slow as real estate prices fall, the stock market faces volatility and the technology sector cuts jobs, amid the backdrop of persistent inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nStatistics Canada will release its latest reading on inflation Wednesday. BMO says the annual inflation rate could hit 7.4 per cent, up from 6.8 per cent in April.",

The whole of the area is disturbed by the activities going on in this building.\n\n\u201d As you can see, it is a multi departmental operation headed by the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council (AMMC).\n\n\u201cAll departments are involved namely, Park and Recreations, Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), Department of Development Control, Enforcement Team from the office of the FCT Minister.\n\n\u201cWe received so many complains from whatever activities happening here and we followed all necessary processes.\n\n\u201cWe went to court and obtained a seal off order. Whatever we are doing here is enforcing what the court has directed.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the need for the owners of property to always ensure compliance with the land use of the area, adding that they must comply with the environmental and all necessary guidelines governing the operation either as residential, commercial or recreational in the FCT.\n\n\u201cWhatever we do here is that we must not allow any impunity to take place in the FCT.\n\n\u201d We have so many complaints and we gave many notices to the occupant of this property yet they proved to be very recalcitrant.\n\n\u201d And we have taken the necessary steps in order to sure that we rid this neighborhood of any nuisance that is emanating from this place.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Director of AEPB, Mr Osi Braimah, stated that the FCT was a creation of law, adding that all activities in the city were guided by law.\n\n\u201d If you are going to build a property, you must get approval from the Department of Development Control, if you want to change your land use you must get an approval.\n\n\u201d Also the noise level in the FCT is controlled. So clubs, gardens and all that must comply with the noise requirements.\n\n\u201d This is why we are forced to close this property because people living around this area can no longer sleep or rest because of the activities going in this building,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Director, Department of Development Control, Malam Muktar Galadima, said all development in the FCT are guided by the Abuja Master Plan.\n\n\u201d This plot in question was designed and approved for residential purpose but they have converted the land use and it has become a nuisance to the environment.\u201d\n\nMr Ikharo Attah, the Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to the FCT Minister, said that the minister insisted that all the legalities happening around the area must stop.\n\n\u201d If you look at the parking alone here , it is very disturbing and painful. But the beauty of it all and what we will be taking home from here is the fact that FCT agencies under AMMC are driving home a very strong message that you don\u2019t abuse and rape the Urban and Regional Planning Law and AEPB Act and go free.\n\nNAN reports that the illegal activities going on at the property include a restaurant, barbing saloon, club house, which is a violation of the original allocation of the plot meant for residential purpose.\n\n(NAN)",

What is the total number of all registered members of the party in the three wards?\u201d Sodipo queried.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is unfortunate that this is the kind of leadership that runs the affairs of a great state like Ogun.\n\n\u201cIn setting the records straight, it should be stated that only one member from Ward 4 who is currently undergoing punishment for disloyalty to the party and indiscipline; he could not conform with the rules of being of good character as provided by our party but found indulgence from their party, you know birds of same feathers will flock together.\n\n\u201cWe have no record of any of our standing and faithful members joining any other party, it is just one of their usual lies and propaganda.\u201d\n\nSodipo said further that the PDP is not bothered nor perturbed as the people of Ogun State are used to the usual lies and fake promises of this present government of APC by which they have destroyed and bastardized the economy, security and all other sectors.\n\nHe made reference to the ongoing seven-day ultimatum given by the workers of the state as a result of the fake promises and lies earlier made to them by the Governor Abiodun-led government.\n\nHe, therefore, advised the outgoing government to rather work on its image in the few months left for it and try to fulfil some of the previously bandied lies and fake promises to workers and the general public.",

          "text": "PRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari, has told the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson that there have been apprehension in admitting on bail detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu because he jumped jumped bail the previous time he was granted bail.\n\nPresident Buhari stated this on Thursday, when he held a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister of Great Britain on the margins of the 26th Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Kigali, Rwanda.\n\nThe President at the meeting reiterated his resolve to respect the maximum term limit in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe PM, obviously not quite familiar with the maximum two terms limit, had asked if President Buhari would run for office again. To which the latter responded:\n\n\u201cAnother term for me? No! The first person who tried it didn\u2019t end very well.\u201d (General laughter).\n\nOn the leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, not being allowed to see his lawyers privately, the President dispelled such insinuation, saying the detained separatist was being given every opportunity under the law \u201cto justify all the uncomplimentary things he had been saying against Nigeria in Britain.\u201d\n\nSaid President Buhari: \u201cHe felt very safe in Britain, and said awful things against Nigeria. We eventually got him when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court. Let him defend all that he has said there. His lawyers have access to him. Remember he jumped bail before, how are we sure he won\u2019t do it again, if he\u2019s admitted to bail?\u201d\n\nOn the keenness expressed by the PM to help Nigeria in the area of security, the President said helping to stabilize Libya could be an initial good step, as the fall of Muammar Gadaffi after 42 years in power unleashed his armed guards on countries in the Sahel, \u201cand they are causing havoc everywhere, as the only thing they know how to do is to shoot guns.\u201d\n\nOn Boko Haram insurgency, President Buhari said there was serious effort to educate the people on the fact that only an unserious person could kill innocent people, \u201cand say Allah Akbar (God is Great). God is justice.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take innocent souls, and ascribe it to God. And the education process is working, the people now understand Boko Haram as anti-God, and not about religion.\u201d\n\nPM Johnson said he was delighted about the good news on trade between the two countries, adding that the UK was further reducing tariffs on some goods going to Nigeria.\n\nHe described the relationship between the countries as \u201cvery strong attachment,\u201d adding: \u201cI just want to be sure that we are doing enough. It\u2019s a massive partnership for us, and we need to capitalize on it.\u201d\n\nThe Prime Minister offered condolences on some recent attacks in Nigeria, particularly on churches.",

          "text": "First Bank of Nigeria Limited has developed two different packages to support the growth of mortgage subsector in the country. AMAKA IFEAKANDU looks at the bank\u2019s commercial mortgage and joints mortgage financing and their impact on the industry\n\nThe housing need in Nigeria has over the years grown exponentially due to the increase in population while the affordability rate has continued to decline. Although, real estate construction and house acquisition are both capital intensive, hence the primary role of the mortgage market is to bridge the affordability gap by providing necessary funding under a system that allows a long term credit amortized periodically to suit a buyer\u2019s pattern of income flow.\n\nNigeria reportedly has about 22 million housing unit deficit- an indication that the performance of the mortgage sub-sector in bridging the housing gap has been quite poor. This required an urgent need for injection of more funds in the mortgage sector to enable it provide affordable housing unit for the citizens of this country.\n\nMortgage industry\n\nWithout doubt, the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN ) was established as the apex mortgage bank in the country to supervise and control the activities of the mortgage institutions in Nigeria, issue licences to secondary mortgage institutions, and collect, manage and administer the National Housing Fund, among others.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria has about 34 primary mortgage banks licenced by the Central Bank of Nigeria to undertake the activities of mortgage financing, real estate construction financing, financial advisory services, drawing from the National Housing Fund for on- lending, among others.\n\nAlthough the financial system of Nigeria has grown appreciably, the mortgage sub-sector has remained evolutionary for quite some time and still struggles to find space in a rather unwholesomely hostile environment of limited systemic exposure.\n\nContribution to economy\n\nAvailable data shows that the mortgage market in Nigeria has been consistently underperforming with a contribution of about 1.13 per cent to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, the Nigerian real estate sector contracted by -9.22 per cent. However, available data shows that in 2021, the sector contributed 0.6 per cent to GDP and mortgages account for less than 1 per cent of total banking assets.\n\nThe poor performance of the mortgage sub-sector is as a result of the contributory effect of an array of issues which include the macroeconomic variables, housing affordability index, collateral and title perfection challenges, access to long-term funding from the capital market, cost of fund, cost of mortgage refinancing at the secondary market, judicial system, knowledge gap among the stakeholders, risk sharing mechanism between the primary and secondary mortgage markets, less industry-friendly policies, and a host of others.\n\nAmong these militating factors, issues associated to proper Widows Day: NGO charges govt to abolish discriminatory culture against widows are at the forefront, posing great threat to the survival of the sub-sector.\n\nFirstBank supporting Mortgage financing\n\nIn a bid to ensure sustainable growth in the sector, First Bank of Nigeria Limited developed different mortgage packages to support the mortgage industry to enable it contribute its quota in the economic development of the country.\n\nThe bank offered two different packages namely commercial mortgage and joint mortgage.\n\nThe FirstBank Commercial Mortgage empowers small and medium scale enterprises to finance the acquisition of landed property for commercial purposes, while the FirstBank Joint Mortgage loan, enables you and your spouse or business partner to easily buy a property that either party can ordinarily not have been able to purchase as individuals.\n\nSo, Mortgages are instrumental in providing secured homes for millions around the world\n\nCommercial Mortgage\n\nFirstBank commercial mortgage loans are typically structured as a 20 or 25-year amortization with a 10-year maturity. The interest rate for commercial mortgage loans is set daily and is available from your FirstBank loan officer.\n\nThe bank understands that each loan applicant has different needs, and therefore does not have a \u201cone-size fits all\u201d loan structure. Instead, it focuses on listening to individual ideas and coming up with a solution, providing the one-on-one customer service you deserve.\n\nAccording to the bank, if one plans occupying 51 per cent or more of the property\u2019s space, he/she may qualify for an Owner-Occupied Real Estate loan. With loan package the individual business can enjoy lower rates and fees.\n\nIn addition, the bank offer an Owner-Occupied Commercial Line of Credit programme, which can provide flexibility and opportunities for growth by assisting with working capital needs, seasonal variations, and expansion opportunities.\n\nFirstBank offers up to 90 per cent Loan-to-Value financing for certain owner-occupied commercial mortgage loans. The SBA 504 loan structure typically allows a customer to borrow 90 per cent of the total acquisition costs of a property, plus other costs associated with necessary improvements to the property.\n\nTypically, FirstBank provides 50 per cent of these total costs via a commercial real estate loan and the SBA provides a loan for 40 per cent of total costs. The borrower is required to contribute the remaining 10 per cent of total costs.\n\nFeatures\n\nFor individual or company to access fund for commercial mortgage, the applicants must have been in their line of business for at least 5 years. Apart from having account relationship with FirstBank for at least 6 months, the source of repayment must be from business sales proceeds not rent.\n\nThe applicant will have Key Man Mortgage Protection Assurance + Comprehensive Insurance against Fire, earthquake and Tornado (FET). First Bank commercial mortgage loan is convenient means to finance working capital needs.\n\nOther Requirements\n\nThe applicant is expected to bring building plan approved by the relevant authorities\n\nvaluation report to be obtained for property to be financed.\n\nOffer Letter from developer in cases of outright purchase, audited financial statements of the company and any other documents that may be required by the bank.\n\nJoint Mortgage\n\nUnder joint mortgage financing, the loan is flexible as it reduces repayment pressure due to the way it is structured.\n\nThe loan repayment is distributed between the spouses easing up repayment pressure and it has competitive interest rates.\n\nAccording to the bank, applicants of the joint mortgage loan must be legitimate couples or registered partners and repayment capacity is on both applicants.\n\nLoan obtainable is N70 million with maximum tenor of 240 months with 20 years subject to 60-year retirement age. It has minimum equity contribution of 20-30 per cent depending on the location, and the applicants are financially committed and are joint and co-owners of the property\n\nRequired Documents\n\nFor applicants for secure joint mortgage loan, they require documentation which include Consumer loan request form, status enquiry of employer form, last three to six months\u2019 pay slips, three to six months\u2019 bank account statement, three passport-size photograph, means of identification- driver\u2019s License/international passport/national identification, utility bill of residence/company address, letter of recent remuneration, current account with FirstBank and letter of introduction from employer.\n\nUnder construction purposes, according to the bank, the party is expected to bring a copy of the approved building plan and the bill of quantities, provision of valuation report on the property and if there has been any construction on site, photographs of the property showing front, back and side views, equity contribution of 20 to 30 per cent of the property cost excluding cost of the land depending on the location, cash-flow projection on loan repayment.\n\nFor applicants applying for the outright purchase of the property, the bank said the applicants required vendor\u2019s offer letter, copy of the title documents to the property as ownership must be in the name of the vendor.\n\nApart from providing copy of the approved building plan and copy of the bill of quantities/cost estimates, if the property is to be renovated, valuation report of the property and photographs of the property showing front, back and side views will also be required. They need to provide equity contribution of 20 to 30 per cent of the property cost excluding cost of the land, depending on the location and provision of cash flow projection on loan repayment\n\nGovt\u2019s role\n\nIn all, the mortgage market thrives on the supply of adequate affordable housing for creation of risk assets while real estate market thrives on the supply of adequate funding for estate construction and for purchases, hence the indissoluble matrimony of the industries.\n\nThere is also need to strengthen the mortgage sub-sector through long-term funding and introduction of industry-friendly regulations geared towards the protection of investors. The government needs to consolidate, reduce all the land charges to encourage more title perfection, and enhance the operations of the real estate and mortgage markets. Charging of a fixed nominal fee for registration of interests of previous owners is encouraged so as to revive many dead capitals.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Simbi Kesiye Wabote, stated this at the 2nd Nigerian Women in Oil and Gas Conference.\n\nWabote said that the Board would work on the policy and communicate same to the industry as soon as possible.\n\nThe conference was organised by the NCDMB in partnership with the Diversity Sectorial Working Group of the Nigerian Content Consultative Forum, NCCF, which was set up by the NCDMB to advise it on policy directions.\n\nSpeaking on the $40m Women in Energy Fund which the NCDMB set up in partnership with the Nigerian Export-Import Bank, NEXIM Bank, the Executive Secretary indicated that 15 applications have been received and three have been approved and the disbursement of funds would soon start.\n\nHe added that the online portal for the fund was launched two weeks ago, and this would speed up the process and reduce human interface in the application and processing.\n\nHe commended the performance of women in various roles in the oil and gas industry and canvassed for their inclusion in the administration of the various Trusts and Funds that were established by the Petroleum Industry Act, PIA, 2021, notably the Host Community Development Trust, Host Community Development Trust Fund and Environmental Remediation Fund.\n\nSpeaking further, the NCDMB boss confirmed that the Oil and Gas Industrial Parks in Bayelsa State and Cross River state are getting ready for completion and will commence operations next year.\n\nHe noted that the Board had started inviting applicants for allocation of plots to set up manufacturing outfits in the park and encouraged women-owned businesses with workable proposals to apply as they will be given special consideration as part of the Board\u2019s commitment to mainstream women into the oil and gas industry.\n\nProviding an update on the administration of the Women in Energy Fund, the Managing Director of NEXIM Bank, Mr. Abba Bello explained that applicants would need to meet set criteria before they can access the fund.\n\n\u201cIt is a loan and not a grant and applicants have to meet the conditions, so we can achieve the intended purpose,\u201d he said.\n\nRepresented by the Head Specialised Products at the Bank, Mr. Mohammed Aumiz, the NEXIM Bank boss explained that it takes only 22 days for an application to be processed and an offer letter issued if the company met the criteria.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva commended the NCDMB for inaugurating the Diversity Sectorial Working Group under the NCCF as provided in Section 58 of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development, NOGICD Act.\n\nHe noted that women make up 48 percent of the global labour force, but they only account for 22 percent of the labour force in the oil and gas sector.\n\nQuoting a recent study by Global Energy Talent Index, the Minister said women occupy about 50 percent of non-technical positions at entry-level compared to only 15 percent of technical and field role positions, hinting that gender diversity and inclusion decreases with seniority, with only a tiny proportion of women in executive positions.\n\n\u201cThe percentage of women in the industry drops from 36 percent to 24 percent between the middle and executive level,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe confirmed that the Nigerian government has been deliberate in introducing gender-friendly policies aimed at increasing access to funding, award of contracts and support for research and development in the interest of women operators in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Minister harped on the need to be deliberate in getting more girls into Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics, STEM, which was a pathway to careers in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe also advised women in the Nigerian Oil and Gas industry to work together towards increasing participation of fellow women in the industry by engendering growth, building capacities and capabilities, identifying opportunities, mentoring and coaching.",

No! The first person who tried it didn\u2019t end very well,\u201d a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, said.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief also reacted to the travails of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nHe debunked insinuations that the separatist was being denied to see his lawyers privately, saying Kanu was being given every opportunity under the law \u201cto justify all the uncomplimentary things he had been saying against Nigeria in Britain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe felt very safe in Britain and said awful things against Nigeria. We eventually got him when he stepped out of the United Kingdom, and we sent him to court. Let him defend all that he has said there. His lawyers have access to him. Remember he jumped bail before, how are we sure he won\u2019t do it again if he\u2019s admitted to bail?\u201d\n\nOn the keenness expressed by the PM to help Nigeria in the area of security, the President said helping to stabilize Libya could be an initial good step, as the fall of Muammar Gadaffi after 42 years in power unleashed his armed guards on countries in the Sahel, \u201cand they are causing havoc everywhere, as the only thing they know how to do is to shoot guns.\u201d\n\nOn Boko Haram insurgency, President Buhari said there was a serious effort to educate the people on the fact that only an unserious person could kill innocent people, \u201cand say Allah Akbar (God is Great). God is justice. You can\u2019t take innocent souls, and ascribe it to God. And the education process is working, the people now understand Boko Haram as anti-God, and not about religion.\u201d\n\nIn his remark, PM Johnson said he was delighted about the good news on trade between the two countries, adding that the UK was further reducing tariffs on some goods going to Nigeria.\n\nHe described the relationship between the countries as a \u201cvery strong attachment,\u201d adding: \u201cI just want to be sure that we are doing enough. It\u2019s a massive partnership for us, and we need to capitalize on it.\u201d",

          "text": "European Union leaders granted candidate status Thursday to Ukraine and Moldova in a strong show of support against Russia\u2019s invasion, as the United States said it was sending Kyiv more high-precision rocket systems.\n\nThe West\u2019s latest attempts to rally behind Ukraine came as Russia closed in on key cities in the country\u2019s embattled east and prompted growing global concerns with restrictions in gas and grain exports.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the EU decision on his country and Moldova as \u201ca unique and historic moment\u201d, although the two former Soviet republics face a long path before joining the bloc and its benefits of free movement and a common market.\n\n\u201cUkraine\u2019s future is within the EU,\u201d said Zelensky, who had been working the phones for weeks.\n\n\u201cWe will win, rebuild, enter the EU and then will rest. Or probably we will not rest.\u201d\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that the decision by EU leaders sent a \u201cvery strong signal\u201d to Russia that Europeans support the pro-Western aspirations of Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin had declared Ukraine to be part of Moscow\u2019s sphere and insisted he was acting due to attempts to bring the country into NATO, the Western alliance that comes with security guarantees.\n\nEuropean powers before the invasion had distanced themselves from US support for Ukraine\u2019s NATO aspirations and EU membership is at least years away.\n\nUkraine and Moldova will have to go through protracted negotiations and the European Union has laid out steps that Kyiv must take even before that, including bolstering the rule of law and fighting corruption.\n\nWeapons to fight Russian gains\n\nThe White House announced that it was sending another $450 million in fresh weapons to Ukraine including new High Mobility Artillery Rocket systems, which have been at the top of Kyiv\u2019s wish list.\n\nThe so-called Himars system can simultaneously launch multiple precision missiles at an extended range.\n\nAn initial four units have already been delivered, with Ukrainian soldiers being trained to operate the equipment, after President Joe Biden\u2019s administration said Kyiv had offered assurances it would not fire into Russia.\n\nUkraine\u2019s needs have been increasingly urgent as Russia \u2014 which failed to take Kyiv immediately after invading on February 24 \u2014 advances in the east, tightening its grip on strategically important Severodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk across the Donets river.\n\nTaking the cities would give Moscow control of the whole of Lugansk, allowing Russia to press further into the Donbas region and potentially farther west.\n\nUkraine acknowledged Thursday that it had lost control of two areas from where it was defending the cities, with Russian forces now closer to encircling the industrial hubs.\n\nBritain\u2019s defence ministry said some Ukrainian units had probably been forced to withdraw \u201cto avoid being encircled\u201d.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s improved performance in this sector is likely a result of recent unit reinforcement and heavy concentration of fire,\u201d it said in its latest intelligence update.\n\nA representative of pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine told AFP the resistance of Ukrainian forces trying to defend Lysychansk and Severodonetsk was \u201cpointless and futile.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the rate our soldiers are going, very soon the whole territory of the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic will be liberated,\u201d said Andrei Marochko, a spokesman for the army of Lugansk.\n\nThe Russian army also said Thursday that its bombings in the southern city of Mykolaiv had destroyed 49 fuel storage tanks and three tank repair depots, after strikes killed several Ukrainian troops Wednesday.\n\n\u2018Only grannies left\u2019\n\nThe northeastern city of Kharkiv near the Russian border was nearly empty on Wednesday, AFP reporters said, a day after shelling by Moscow\u2019s forces killed five people there.\n\n\u201cLast night the building next to mine collapsed from the bombardment while I was sleeping,\u201d said Leyla Shoydhry, a young woman in a park near the opera house.\n\nRoman Pohuliay, a 19-year-old in a pink sweatshirt, said most residents had fled the city.\n\n\u201cOnly the grannies are left,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the central city of Zaporizhzhia, women were training to use Kalashnikov assault rifles in urban combat as Russian forces edged nearer.\n\n\u201cWhen you can do something, it\u2019s not so scary to take a machine gun in your hands,\u201d said Ulyana Kiyashko, 29, after moving through an improvised combat zone in a basement.\n\n\u2018Weaponising\u2019 grain and gas\n\nWestern officials have also accused Russia of weaponising its key exports of gas as well as grain from Ukraine, contributing to global inflation and rising hunger in the world.\n\n\u201cWe are very clear that this grain crisis is urgent, that it needs to be solved within the next month,\u201d British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on a visit to Turkey.\n\n\u201cOtherwise we could see devastating consequences,\u201d she said.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged African nations to pressure Russia for a safe route for grain.\n\n\u201cAfrican capitals matter and they do influence Russia\u2019s position,\u201d he told African journalists.\n\nA US official warned of new retaliatory measures against Russia at the Group of Seven summit being attended by Biden in Germany starting Sunday.\n\nGermany ratcheted up an emergency gas plan to its second alert level, just one short of the maximum that could require rationing in Europe\u2019s largest economy, after Russia slashed its supplies.\n\n\u201cGas is now a scarce commodity,\u201d Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters, urging households to cut back on use. Demand for gas is lower in the summer but shortages could cause heating shortages in the winter.\n\nFrance is aiming to have its gas storage reserves at full capacity by early autumn, and will build a new floating methane terminal to get more energy supplies by sea, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman reiterated its claim that the supply cuts were due to maintenance and that necessary equipment from abroad had not arrived.\n\nAFP",

It also means additional players are already following health protocols within the camp in Qatar rather than being brought from their home country.\n\nThe squad size change will send a total of 96 extra players to the World Cup, which is being played from Nov. 21 to Dec. 18.\n\nThe 28-day tournament compares to 32 days four years ago in Russia.\n\nMost of the extra players will likely come from European clubs whose domestic seasons must pause by Nov. 13 for the first World Cup held during the northern hemisphere winter.\n\nSquads will be together for just one week before the tournament kicks off instead of the usual preparation time of about two weeks. FIFA has created a $209 million fund from its World Cup revenues to compensate clubs with a daily rate of about several thousand dollars for releasing players to national-team duty.\n\nWorld Cup teams can also now use five substitutes in the regulation 90 minutes instead of three. What started as an interim rule in 2020 to ease player workloads in congested game schedules during the pandemic is now codified in the laws of the game.\n\nThe FIFA Bureau also set March 16 next year for a presidential election to be held in Kigali, Rwanda, during the annual congress of 211 member federations.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino is seeking a new four-year term to extend his leadership of football\u2019s world body to 11 years.\n\nNo potential opponent has yet emerged and the deadline to enter the contest is four months before the election.\n\nThat will fall in mid-November, days before the World Cup starts.",

          "text": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday declared for the first time that the U.S. Constitution protects an individual\u2019s right to carry a handgun in public for self-defense, handing a landmark victory to gun rights advocates in a nation deeply divided over how to address firearms violence.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling, with the court\u2019s conservative justices in the majority and liberal justices in dissent, struck down New York state\u2019s limits on carrying concealed handguns outside the home. The court found that the law, enacted in 1913, violated a person\u2019s right to \u201ckeep and bear arms\u201d under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment.\n\nThe ruling, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, declared that the Constitution protects \u201can individual\u2019s right to carry a handgun for self-defense outside the home.\u201d\n\nThomas added: \u201cWe know of no other constitutional right that an individual may exercise only after demonstrating to government officers some special need.\u201d\n\nThe ruling could undermine similar restrictions in other states and imperil other types of state and local firearms restrictions nationwide.\n\nGun rights, held dear by many Americans and promised by the country\u2019s 18th century founders, are a contentious issue in a nation with high levels of firearms violence including numerous mass shootings. President Joe Biden, who has called gun violence a national embarrassment, condemned the decision.\n\n\u201cThis ruling contradicts both common sense and the Constitution, and should deeply trouble us all,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIn the wake of the horrific attacks in Buffalo and Uvalde, as well as the daily acts of gun violence that do not make national headlines, we must do more as a society \u2013 not less \u2013 to protect our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nThe United States has experienced hundreds of deaths from dozens of mass shootings in recent years. Just in recent weeks, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24 at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and 10 people were slain on May 14 at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThe New York restriction is unconstitutional because it \u201cprevents law-abiding citizens with ordinary self-defense needs from exercising their right to keep and bear arms,\u201d Thomas added.\n\nLiberal Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in dissent that the court had expanded gun rights without wrestling with the \u201cnature or severity\u201d of firearms violence in a country where there are more guns per person than any other nation.\n\n\u201cI fear that the court\u2019s interpretation ignores these significant dangers and leaves states without the ability to address them,\u201d Breyer wrote.\n\nThe justices overturned a lower court ruling throwing out a challenge to the law by two gun owners and the New York affiliate of the National Rifle Association (NRA), an influential gun rights group closely aligned with Republicans.\n\nThe decision represents the court\u2019s most important statement on gun rights in more than a decade. The court in 2008 recognized for the first time an individual\u2019s right to keep guns at home for self-defense in a case from the District of Columbia, and in 2010 applied that right to the states.\n\nThe new ruling underscored how the 6-3 conservative majority on the court is sympathetic to an expansive reading of Second Amendment rights.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, called the ruling \u201cabsolutely shocking.\u201d New York City Mayor Eric Adams said officials will review licensing policies and how sensitive locations are defined, adding that \u201cwe cannot allow New York to become the Wild West.\u201d\n\nUnder the New York law\u2019s \u201cproper cause\u201d requirement, applicants seeking an unrestricted concealed carry permits must convince a state firearms licensing officer of an actual, rather than speculative, need for self-defense. Officials could also grant licenses restricted to certain activities, such as hunting or target practice.\n\nThe ruling said that New York\u2019s concealed firearm regime is at odds with the text and history of the Second Amendment and how gun rights were protected throughout U.S. history.\n\nFirearms safety groups and gun control activists feared the ruling could undermine gun measures such as \u201cred flag\u201d laws targeting the firearms of people deemed dangerous by the courts, expanded criminal background checks for gun buyers or restrictions on selling untraceable \u201cghost\u201d guns assembled from components purchased online. They also feared it could jeopardize bans on guns in sensitive places such as airports, courthouses, hospitals and schools.\n\nThe ruling will affect at least six states including New York, as well as the District of Columbia, that empower officials to decide whether people can carry concealed handguns in public even if they pass criteria such as criminal background checks. Three other states, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island, also give officials some discretion, according to the ruling.\n\nThe ruling acknowledged that states can prohibit guns in \u201csensitive places\u201d and that such prohibitions can likely go beyond what was historically considered a sensitive place, such as courthouses and legislative buildings.\n\nThomas wrote that courts \u201ccan use analogies to those historical regulations\u201d of sensitive places.\n\nBut Breyer asked: \u201cSo where does that leave the many locations in a modern city with no obvious 18th- or 19th-century analogue? What about subways, nightclubs, movie theaters, and sports stadiums? The court does not say.\u201d\n\nWayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, called the ruling \u201ca watershed win\u201d that resulted from a decades-long fight led by his organization.\n\nConservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh in a concurring opinion said states can still impose requirements on people seeking licenses to carry firearms including fingerprinting, background checks, mental health checks and firearms training classes.\n\nIn another concurring opinion, conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the court has said \u201cnothing about who may lawfully possess a firearm or the requirements that must be met to buy a gun. Nor does it decide anything about the kinds of weapons that people may possess.\u201d\n\nAlito disputed that gun regulations like the one in New York would deter mass shootings, mentioning the recent Buffalo massacre.\n\n\u201cThe New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator,\u201d Alito wrote.\n\nReuters",
