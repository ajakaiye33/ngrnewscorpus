          "text": "Oluwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nResearchers at Tulane University, United States, have cautioned against adding extra salt to food at the table, noting that it could increase the risk of untimely death and lower life expectancy.\n\nThe researchers made the call in a recent study they conducted.\n\nThe study, published in the European Heart Journal, found that those who continuously added salt to their food had a 28 per cent higher risk of dying too early, in comparison with those who never or hardly added salt.\n\nThe study lead, a Professor of Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Lu Qi said, \u201cAdding salt to foods at the table is a common eating behaviour that is directly related to an individual\u2019s long-term preference for salty-tasting foods and habitual salt intake.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, our study is the first to assess the relationship between adding salt to foods and premature death.\n\n\u201cIt provides novel evidence to support recommendations to modify eating behaviours for improving health. Even a modest reduction in sodium intake, by adding less or no salt to food at the table, is likely to result in substantial health benefits, especially when it is achieved in the general population,\u201d Prof. Qi said.\n\nThe researchers conducted the population-based cohort study comprising of 501,379 participants from UK biobank who completed a touch-screen questionnaire on the frequency of adding salt to foods at baseline.\n\nThe researchers noted that the information on the frequency of adding salt to foods did not include salt used in cooking.\n\nThey also factored in things that could affect the study outcome like age, sex, race, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity, diet and medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and blood vessel diseases.\n\nThe participants were followed for an average of nine years and untimely death was defined as death before 75 years of age.\n\nThe study also revealed that adding salt to food was linked to a lower life expectancy. At 50 years of age, life expectancy was reduced by 1.5 years in women and by 2.28 for men who always added salt to their food, in comparison to those who never or hardly did.\n\nThe researchers, however, noted that these increased risks tended to be somewhat lessened in individuals who consumed high intakes of potassium foods such as vegetables and fruits.\n\nProf Qi said, \u201cWe were not surprised by this finding as fruits and vegetables are major sources of potassium, which has protective effects and is associated with a lower risk of premature death.\n\n\u201cBecause our study is the first to report a relation between adding salt to foods and mortality, further studies are needed to validate the findings before making recommendations,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur findings indicate that higher frequency of adding salt to foods is associated with a higher hazard of all-cause premature mortality and lower life expectancy.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Educate yourselves to overcome poverty \u2014 Buhari challenges youths",
          "text": ".\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has charged the youth to seek education, not for government jobs which are unavailable but to arm themselves with skill and ability to fight poverty and meet the needs of the 21st Century.\n\nHe also implored parents to inculcate right values in children, including deep fear of God, respect for constituted authorities and living a purposeful life through continuous education.\n\nMalam Garba Shehu, the President\u2019s spokesman, in a statement, said the president made the calls at the Emir of Daura\u2019s Palace during Sallah homage, on Wednesday in Daura, Katsina State.\n\nHe said more time should be given to the coaching of the future leaders, with basic knowledge of moral values, as the fast changing world, driven by new technology, would be more competitive and demanding.\n\n\u201cI was locked up for more than three years, after leading the country. At that point, I realised and I told my children that your net worth is what is in your head, not what you have acquired in life.\n\n\u201cMy focus has always been on training the children to be relevant wherever they find themselves. I told my children, particularly the girls, that they can only get married after getting a first degree.\n\n\u201cThey already know that I am not leaving anything for anyone to inherit. My greatest legacy to the children is to ensure they are properly educated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president noted that the younger children should be guided and taught history, as they would find it hard to be patriotic, responsible and respectful, without a thorough understanding of their backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWhoever does not have a good sense of history will easily make mistakes.\n\n\u201cWe should ensure the children get proper education. The knowledge they acquire should not be towards getting government jobs.\n\n\u201dWe don\u2019t have jobs in government anymore. With technology, governments are becoming more smaller, nimble and efficient.\n\n\u201cEmphasis should now be on skills acquisition and competence in creation and deployment of technology.\n\n\u201dDuring the Covid-19, we asked all level 12 downward to stay at home, and surprisingly the systems worked effectively, the president noted.\n\nPresident Buhari told the Emir of Daura, Dr Umar Faruk, that he would be more regular in visits, preparatory to the handing over in May, 2023, adding that the prolonged absence was due to the demands of his office.\n\n\u201cThis is the longest I have been away from home. Infact, the Emir took to the court of public opinion at the prayer ground, when he openly told everyone that I had not visited Daura for close to a year,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said all Nigerians must make sacrifices to move the country forward, especially the public servants, calling for more selflessness and inclusion.\n\n\u201cAt the end, it is only God that can reward your efforts, not man,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Aminu Masari listed the achievements of the president to include social security, which was created to cater for the poor, and ensure that they received some money at the end of every month.\n\n\u201cNo government in the history of this country has done more to reduce poverty like President Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201dHe asked religious and community leaders to bring enlightenment to bear on successful government programs such as the Social Investment Programme, SIP through which 120,000 poor citizens in 12 Local Government Areas of the state receive a monthly payment of N5,000 and this is happening in all the states.\n\n\u201cToday, we have over 863,000 children in the state being fed under the school feeding programme.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, this has created 10,000 jobs for women cooks, while 14,000 young men and women enrolled in N-Power.\n\n\u201cWe have food vendors who are engaged and earning their livelihood. All the foolish talk on social media is by those who only think of themselves.\n\n\u201dOur elites are never happy or appreciative until something gets to their pockets,\u201d he said.\n\nMasari said security in the country had improved considerably, compared to when the President came into power.\n\nHe reminded the Daura Emirate Council, title holders, political leaders in the state and citizens across the entire federation to remember the bombings of mosques and churches before 2015 that had hindered worship, problems which no longer existed\n\n\u201cHuman beings forget easily. It is true that we have not reached where we want, but efforts are being made to ameliorate the situation.\n\n\u201dLook at the size of our security personnel compared to the population, you will know we all have to be involved in securing the country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Emir of Daura thanked the president for the infrastructural and institutional developments in the state, saying generations would remember and remain grateful to President Buhari.\n\nFaruk urged the President to increase his patience and tolerance as he begins to countdown, knowing that the ultimate reward for all his sacrifice would come from God.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians, both good and bad, know you are doing your best. In life you will have people who like you, and those who do not like you. If you have many wives, or many children, they will not like you equally.\n\n\u201cSome are insulting you and belittling your efforts now. Don\u2019t worry. They will do the same thing to the next president.\n\n\u201cKeep doing your best, and remain tolerant as a leader.\n\n\u201dIn Daura here, even the blind or the leader of all the blinds knows that you have made a great difference. We are grateful, and proud of you,\u201d the Emir said.",

          "text": "The Class of 1982 of Saint Maria Goretti Girls Grammar School Benin City have pleaded with the Edo State Government to consider returning the school to the Catholic Mission to enhance the education of the girl child.\n\nThe old students, under the auspices of Saint Maria Goretti Old Girls\u2019 Association (SMAGOGA), made the passionate appeal in Lagos recently where they marked their 40 years reunion after leaving school.\n\nThe event saw many old girls across the world from all walks of life gather to reminisce on their time at the school. The theme of the reunion was: \u201cWomen, Wealth and Winning.\u201d\n\nSpeaking during the programme, Mrs. Grace Bose Ojougboh, member of the alumni association and Deputy Director at the Nigerian Communications Commission, called on the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, to consider returning the School to the Catholic Mission towards reclaiming the school\u2019s age long glory.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever before, there is need to empower and raise girls who are pious, confident and equipped with the skill and capacity to function as leaders and nation builders in the 21st century and we believe our alma mater is poised to deliver on this even more with its management being under the Catholic Mission,\u201d Ojougboh said.\n\nShe stated that, the Class of 1982 has, over the years, joined hands with the national body of St Maria Goretti Old Girls Association to give the school a facelift as well as support the students through award of scholarships and skills acquisition.\n\nMrs. Ijeoma Isiolu, a seasoned banker and an old girl of the school, lamented on the very poor state of the school since it was taken over by the government. She said the association looks forward to the time when the school will be returned to the Catholic mission.\n\nHenrietta Iweze, a lawyer and member of the Class of 1982, spoke on the need for women to support women and the importance of winning and creating wealth. She emphasised that women should be open to change and stressed the need for women to always give value wherever they find themselves.\n\nMrs. Maureen Okoro-Sokoh, a human resource consultant and Managing Director, Estymol Group, called on her classmates to use the opportunity of the reunion to really come together and empower each other in different ways.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Mrs. Ononuju Irukwu, a financial expert and wealth adviser with First Bank of Nigeria who is also of the Class of 1982, stressed the need for women to be empowered through education and financial inclusion.\n\nIrukwu stated that financial literacy opens doors and more opportunities for women and helps them to make informed decisions.\n\nThe walk down memory lane by members of Class of 82 brought a lot of nostalgic feelings of joy and gratitude for the wonderful time spent together at the school and the training and discipline they received in their formative years which, they agreed, have molded them into women of excellence.\n\nThe Class of 1982 set also used the opportunity of the reunion to visit the Heritage Homes located in the Anthony Village of Lagos State to reach out to the less privileged in the society while plans are in the works to visit their alma mater in Benin City.\n\nSaint Maria Goretti Girls\u2019 Grammar School was founded on March 4, 1959, by the Catholic Mission. It was the first \u201cAll Girls\u201d Secondary School in Benin City. The School was named after St. Maria Goretti as it was established the same year Maria Goretti, a 12-year old girl, who stood for purity in mind and body was canonised by the Catholic Church.\n\nLate Rev. Sister Dr. Henrietta Powers, a member of the missionary order of the sister of Our Lady of Apostles, was the 4th Principal and the trailblazer from 1961 to December 1984 when she retired from service. She managed the affairs of the school and raised women, who have become excellent women, breaking barriers, changing and impacting their communities in all spheres of life.\n\nSt Maria Goretti Girls Grammar School in its heydays, under the Catholic Mission, was the school of choice for people, who wanted an all-round spiritual, moral, vocational and academic development for the girl child.",

          "title": "More trouble for APC over Muslim-Muslim ticket",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nThe storm is still raging across the country, especially within the Christian community four days after the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, southern Muslim, unveiled Senator Kashim Shettima, northern Muslim, as his running mate and barely 24 hours to the deadline set by the Independent National Electoral (INEC) for parties to submit their final list of candidates for the 2023 general polls.\n\nIn separate statements, yesterday, the two leading umbrella bodies for Christians, Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) rejected the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket being promoted by the ruling party.\n\nMeanwhile, Daily Sun gathered that a crucial meeting of top Christian leaders and Christian politicians from the North has been scheduled to chisel out a decision. A source privy to the arrangement listed the Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong; SGF, Boss Mustapha; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; Lawal and other Christian political leaders, as arrowheads spearheading the meeting.\n\nThe source said if the leadership of the APC decides to submit Shettima\u2019s name, they would be left with no choice, but to support other presidential candidates that will protect the interest of northern Christians.\n\nHe said the choice of a Muslim running mate, was the brainchild of Northern APC leaders, who insisted that it will be the only condition that will make them support Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cAPC took Christians in the North for granted. There are key Northern Christians who have incurred the anger of their people for supporting APC, yet, APC thinks no one is good among us to be Tinubu\u2019s running mate. This is an insult. We\u2019ve decided to meet and decide what\u2019s best for us. There are over 10 million registered Northern Christian voters. They\u2019ll use this strength to teach APC a lesson for undermining us. It is now obvious the APC is an Islamic party. One day, the same people promoting this will insist on North-North Muslim-Muslim ticket. If they succeed with this, they will try something more daring soon.\u201d\n\nThis is as CAN President, Rev\u2019d Supo Ayokunle, who spoke through his Media Assistant, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, said he would never encourage Christians to vote for it because it is discriminatory, unjust, unfair and unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cThey made reference to the 1993 presidential election. They said the \u2018Hope \u201893\u2019 has been resurrected. Fantastic. What was the outcome of that election? It was annulled. The winner of that election, we know what became of him. We are not making a mockery of him, but to let them know that the history that wants to repeat itself is not in the interest of this country.\n\n\u201cIn 1993 when people voted for Muslim-Muslim ticket, can you compare Nigeria of that time with Nigeria of today? Was there anybody called Boko Haram terrorist then? Was there anything called ISWAP in 1993? Was there anytime people were kidnapped with impunity? Was there anytime pastors could not drive on the road without being kidnapped? So, if people say what happened in 1993 would repeat itself, let it repeat itself. Those who fail to learn from history, they force history to repeat itself.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs a president that will unify us, bring us together. Everybody should be carried along and be given a sense of belonging and inclusiveness. Look at the three arms of government today, they are headed by Muslims as if Christians are nobody. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, who is the vice chairman of the second arm of government, is a Muslim. They are now saying the first two in the executive arm too should be Muslims. The judiciary is also in their hands. If Nigerians vote for Muslim-Muslim ticket, and they get to power, whatever happens, they ask for it; CAN has said its own. The bottomline is that Nigerians should reject Muslim-Muslim ticket.\u201d\n\n\u2022It portrays our country in bad light \u2013PFN\n\nChairman, Kaduna State chapter of PFN, Apostle Emmanuel Bako, said fielding flag bearers with individuals from one faith has the potency to polarise the country at a time citizens were searching for unity.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I declare the Muslim-Muslim ticket barbaric and unacceptable. We shall not let it stand because it showcases our great nation in bad light.\n\n\u201cThe new trend of fielding party flag bearers with individuals from one faith is not consistent with our federal system. It has the potency to polarise our beloved nation at this crucial moment that all true citizens are searching for unity.\n\n\u201cI have noticed with great dismay the consistent disregard for our heterogeneous nature in Nigeria by our political players. This is done in the face of increasing weakness of the bond of unity. It is not only against the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria but against the plan of God. I see this as irresponsible decision and a disregard for our diversities. I wish to state that it is not acceptable.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the decision is taken to cover up for the failure of government and to also spite other religions. Both Muslims and Christians are suffocating under the highest level of insecurity.\n\n\u201cThis has further reduced our life expectancy in Nigeria. Apart from this, the religious fault lines in the past seven years has been widened. The responsibility of all political parties at this moment should be on strengthening national integration and not otherwise.\n\n\u201cI call on all peace-loving citizens to reject this evil pattern that is gradually getting entrenched. Let\u2019s unite and build a society on the basis of respect for everyone\u2019s humanity. I see 2023 as an opportunity to open up our nation to real political civilisation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Dead on arrival \u2013Ex SGF, Lawal\n\nIn his reaction, immediate-past Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF) and Tinubu\u2019s close ally, David Babachir Lawal, described the action as an affront on Christians, saying it isdead on arrival.\n\nLawal, in a lengthy statement he personally signed, called on the leadership of the APC and President Buhari, to reject a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nHe further urged them not to forward Shettima\u2019s name to INEC.\n\nLawal said: \u201cWhy Kashim Shetima? He is an overambitious man who has a Machiavellian bent and has lots of money with which to procure a preferred-candidate status among Tinubu\u2019s lapdogs. And as we are beginning to see, to also procure bogus supporters, especially from among the Christian community, to help launder his not-so-good image.\n\n\u201cIt appears that the gods want to destroy the APC and its presidential candidate and have chosen the instrumentality of the northern Moslem governors and their super ambitious tool and Kashim Shettima for this purpose. Alhaji Kashim Shetima is a Greek gift from the Northern governors to Tinubu. I advise Bola to make sure Kashim\u2019s two hands are always in plain sight and empty.\n\n\u201cTrue, based on the advice of his new friends, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made his choice. And I am sure he thinks he is ready for the outcome of that choice. He has chosen to bring religion to the front burner of Nigerian politics. And being a Muslim, he has chosen to take sides with his own religion. For all he cares, Christians can go to blazes with their votes.\n\n\u201cBut he must also be told that there will consequences for this choice. Some of them are that Christians all over the country will revolt against the APC to put the chances of his election in serious jeopardy. It will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian-dominated areas in jeopardy. This could result in APC being a minority party in both the National and State Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cNow tell me which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau) e.t.c. APC the great!\n\n\u201cIt is a risk that will not play out positively for his presidential bid. But, were he to win and become President of Nigeria, it would be as a sectional president, an Islamic president, and he will surely face massive discontent and opposition even before taking off.\n\n\u201cBut, barring any last-minute change of mind, Bola has made his choice. He should be bluntly told that in this choice, Nigerian Christians clearly see a pending Islamic Republic of Nigeria in its infancy and are right to be severely anxious. There has been gloom among the Christian community all over the country since Tinubu announced Kashim Shetima as his running mate. Are the generality of the Muslim ummah happy with this? The answer is a resounding no.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari should exercise his powers as the Commander-in-Chief and as the APC Leader to revoke this nomination of a VP by Tinubu. The APC National Chairman should refuse to sign the nomination forms if not rescinded.\n\n\u201cI would love for Bola to be our next President. But I am afraid a Moslem-Moslem ticket will be \u201cDead on Arrival\u201d. And the arrival date according to INEC\u2019s election timetable is 25th February 2023. This ticket will drag down the whole APC members to the pit. We all should reject it.\u201d\n\n\u2022Kumuyi cautions\n\nPastor William Kumuyi, General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, has urged Nigeria\u2019s political leaders need to consult and conduct research before concluding.\n\nThe cleric, who gave the advice while addressing newsmen on Wednesday in Ilorin, shortly after he paid courtesy to Gov. Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara, said that presidential flagbearers of various political parties should look at the heartbeat of Nigeria and the desires of people before making their decisions.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian ticket is a difficult and slippery area. So, what I will say is that the political office holders should look at the heartbeat of the country as well as desires of the people.\n\n\u201cPoliticians should know that they are not there for themselves. They are there for all of us. They should ask and make their researches about what the nation wants. They should ask and make their researches on what the country wants, what the people want; if they listen to the people, we will be confident that they will listen to us when they get there.\u201d",
          "summary": "One day, the same people promoting this will insist on North-North Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\u201cIn 1993 when people voted for Muslim-Muslim ticket, can you compare Nigeria of that time with Nigeria of today?\nIf Nigerians vote for Muslim-Muslim ticket, and they get to power, whatever happens, they ask for it; CAN has said its own.\n\u201cTherefore, I declare the Muslim-Muslim ticket barbaric and unacceptable.\nLawal, in a lengthy statement he personally signed, called on the leadership of the APC and President Buhari, to reject a Muslim-Muslim ticket.",

It took the intervention of motorists and residents around the area before some other passengers in the vehicles could be rescued.\n\nMen of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in the state later arrived at the scene and moved the bodies of the victims to the mortuary. The accident caused a gridlock on the busy Akure-Ondo road for several hours.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said that last week\u2019s flooding which occurred in Lagos claimed seven lives.\n\nThe agency\u2019s Zonal Coordinator, South West, Mr Ibrahim Farinloye, made the disclosure in a statement in Lagos, yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe post-emergency phase assessment after the unprecedented rainfall of Friday, July 8 and Saturday, July 9, 2022 has revealed that about seven people \u2013 three children of the same parent and four adults \u2013 died.\n\n\u201cAbout eight lives were also saved during the period, as a result of the flooding that was witnessed during the two-day continuous rainfall,\u201d he said.\n\nFarinloye further stated that the three siblings who lost their lives were residing at a church building belonging to Mercy of Christ Apostolic Church, situated in an uncompleted building.\n\nHe said that the siblings, Michael, 18; Elizabeth, 17, and Timi, 14, were swept away while trying to relocate from their room to the main church structure.\n\nHe said that the youngest child, Tmi, who was said to be asthmatic, while trying to climb the plank linking their room to the church building, slipped and was overpowered by the flood.\n\nThe coordinator added that the remaining two, while trying to rescue their sibling, were also swept away by the flood.\n\nFarinloye said that the NEMA team, while on a condolence visit to the families, met with representatives of Progressive Community Development Area, who conducted the agency around the affected communities.\n\n\u201cThe bereaved parents were said to be somewhere, but the NEMA team had a brief meeting with the community leaders on the way forward.\n\n\u201cAn appeal was made to them that, for the rest of the year, the community must embark on awareness and sensitisation on safe actions, to avoid the situation that they experienced during the period.\n\n\u201cThe community leaders also informed NEMA that in the same community, four siblings were also swept away on the same day, but that the community members rallied round and rescued all of them,\u201d Farinloye said.\n\nHe listed the flooded communities as: Oke Isagun, Agbado Oke and Oko LCDA, all in Alimosho LGA.\n\nThe NEMA chief said that members of the Progressive CDA briefed NEMA that rainwater from Meiran, Abattoir, Alagbado, Agege and Toll gate converged in their community. Farinloye also gave an update on the flood at Oyatoki in Orile Agege, saying that two people died, while four were rescued.",

These events impose hardship on the health and livelihood of the people. It is expected that if Section 104(4) is implemented to the letter, it would provide funds to remediate the environment in order to cushion the effects of pollution occasioned by oil spills on the people.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I will advocate that the \u2018commission\u2019 and the \u2018authority\u2019 should be proactive in ensuring that degraded environments in host communities are well remediated and the ecosystem restored,\u201d the governor said.\n\nCommissioner for Power and Petroleum Development, John Etim, whose ministry organised the workshop, explained that most stakeholders of the host communities\n\nunveiling of the Upstream Petroleum Host Community Regulations on Tuesday, June 28, 2022, which our people have to know to enable them to make informed decisions.\n\n\u201cOil and gas companies operating in the state equally appreciated that there is a knowledge gap in understanding the provision of the Act among the people of the host communities and consequently, opted to collaborate with the ministry to ensure awareness be created the enable a smooth takeoff of the HCDTF,\u201d Etim said.",

          "title": "WHAT WILL SAVE NIGERIANS NOW? \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Monday Philips Ekpe urges the electorate to vote in effective and capable leaders who will remake the system\n\nThere is hardly any Nigerian who does not know that these are not the best of times for the fatherland. In the midst of overwhelming bad news, particularly the devaluation of human life and pervading insecurity, even persons who usually are optimists are moving rapidly to the opposite side. Many who had expectations for national rejuvenation have since succumbed to disillusionment and fear. The quest for salvation is, expectedly, going on actively in the minds of citizens. This title could easily have read, \u201cWho Will Save Nigeria Now?\u201d For most people, the answer would most probably be twofold: God and government officials.\n\nOnly very few Nigerians do not profess one or two of the three major religions in the country namely, Christianity, Islam and traditional African religion, with the first two being monotheistic. Evidences abound to demonstrate our devotion \u2013 at least nominally \u2013 to the Almighty. Ubiquitous and imposing structures that serve as places of worship, including government-sponsored National Ecumenical Centre and National Mosque in the heart of the Federal Capital Territory. Regular and expensive pilgrimages to Mecca and Jerusalem. Teeming crowds that attend services, Juma\u2019at and special programmes. Boisterous prayer meetings held at daytime and night. Palpable zeal to defend the faiths, sometimes violently. Clerics who have thrown away caution and added plenty of politics to their sermons. So, seeing God as the one who can deliver the country from its troubles is always in the estimation of the populace. But I am convinced that God does overtime here, often intervening even in matters that ordinarily should be resolved through the application of the intellect and other faculties he bestowed on mankind from the beginning.\n\nThe other leg is government as the entity empowered by the constitution to primarily enable the country for optimal welfare and protection of lives and property. In saner societies, it is the right of the people to look up to holders of political authority for their general wellbeing, having elected them in the first place. Here, however, accountability, sensitivity and selfless service in public offices have become vanishing virtues. Sadly, in many cases, those attributes have been replaced with cheap excuses, indiscretion, ineptitude, callousness and greed. The Nigerian now finds himself in a dilemma, a hole in which there appears to be no light. The present state of things has clearly worsened with time. And playing the ostrich cannot be a reasonable escape route.\n\nThe signs of the systematic deterioration of our social fabric are all there in the open for both the discerning and unschooled to see. These developments have coalesced into an acidic atmosphere that smells of blood and threats of more bloodshed. Going through a one-year chronicle of what could be considered as high profile, most audacious operations of bandits, kidnappers and terrorists would confirm that a once relatively peaceful nation has become besieged and, God forbid, overwhelmed. Unless one lives in incurable denial, the reasons to worry at this point are undeniable. In July last year, bandits who had already taken root in the north west gunned down a military aircraft in Zamfara State. The murderous gangsters were never found. In the following month, unknown gunmen invaded the elite Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna, killing two senior officers and abducting another one.\n\nIn March this year, bandits (it is difficult making distinctions between them and terrorists) forced their way into the Kaduna International Airport, leaving at least one fatality behind and obstructing activities there for long. It was in the same month that the Ansaru group bombed an Abuja-Kaduna train, causing the death of eight persons, wounding some and kidnapping others. Dozens of the abductees are still in captivity. Two months ago, the Prelate of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Samuel Kanu-Uche, was kidnapped in Abia State. According to him, it was God\u2019s grace that preserved his life. He was released after N100 million exchanged hands. Last month, it was the turn of Owo in Ondo State to witness the brazen brutality of the fearsome non-state actors when not less than 40 worshippers were murdered inside Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral on a fateful Sunday morning. Just before June ended, a battalion of soldiers and other security personnel were ambushed, sending majority of them to their graves early. Tuesday last week, the presidential advance team was viciously attacked in Dutsinma in Katsina State by these roving gunmen. That blatant rogue mission was only a preamble to the invasion of the Nigerian Correctional Service in Kuje, an Abuja suburb, clinically achieving death, destruction and jailbreak. The sheer magnitude and tactfulness of the operation that involved 300 men on motorcycles have compounded the apprehension of Nigerians about the readiness of the numerous military and para-military institutions to guarantee their safety.\n\nThe poser is, who has failed the people, God or government? Surely God has not. The administration? Many compatriots would respond in the affirmative. Never to be ignored, however, is the fact that successive governments, not only the current one, have failed to deliver in critical areas; except that the degrees differ. One aspect that is often overlooked is the mindset of the people. Marcus Garvey, legendary Jamaican political activist and leading light of the Movement for African Redemption in the last century, captured this condition in his historic speech in 1937 titled, \u201cThe Work That Has Been Done.\u201d It reads in part: \u201cWe are going to emancipate ourselves from mental slavery because whilst others might free the body, none but ourselves can free the mind. Mind is your only ruler, sovereign. The man who is not able to develop and use his mind is bound to be the slave of the other man who uses his mind\u2026.\u201d\n\nThose words on marble, popularised by Bob Marley\u2019s music, \u201cRedemption Song\u201d, should engage the hearts and minds of Nigerians, many of whom have continued to be enslaved by primordial sentiments and mediocrity. In the race towards next year\u2019s general election, nothing seems to have changed in the reasoning and actions of the people. Same old arguments and alignments and we expect true change. What stops the electorate from going for quality men and women who can lead the way out of the progressive mess the country is in? Virtually every component of life is affected by political leadership at various levels, including security decisions and tactics. Choosing those who occupy critical positions and making them accountable are, therefore, non-negotiable. Nigerians are not helpless, I insist. They may not have the liver to invade the seat of government the way Sri Lankans have just done but they have enough energy, largely latent at the moment, to act decisively in voting the right persons and ensuring that they stay on course.\n\nMy appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari, finally. He has a sense of humour, I hear. Last Monday, he heartily declared in Daura: \u201cI am eager to go. I can tell you it has been tough. I am grateful to God that people appreciate the personal sacrifices we have been making. By this time next year, I would have made the most out of the two terms, and (in) the remaining months, I will do my best. In 10 to 11 months, I will come here. I have a better house in Kaduna but it is too close to Abuja.\u201d Not so fast, Sir. While I do not agree with those who feel you have accomplished nothing, the nation indeed is in a desperate situation. Properly managing this transition period and giving Nigerians something to hope for should be your preoccupation now, not thoughts of retirement.\n\nDr Ekpe is a member of THISDAY Editorial Board",
          "summary": "This title could easily have read, \u201cWho Will Save Nigeria Now?\u201d For most people, the answer would most probably be twofold: God and government officials.\nOnly very few Nigerians do not profess one or two of the three major religions in the country namely, Christianity, Islam and traditional African religion, with the first two being monotheistic.\nUbiquitous and imposing structures that serve as places of worship, including government-sponsored National Ecumenical Centre and National Mosque in the heart of the Federal Capital Territory.\nSo, seeing God as the one who can deliver the country from its troubles is always in the estimation of the populace.\nProperly managing this transition period and giving Nigerians something to hope for should be your preoccupation now, not thoughts of retirement.",

          "title": "ON THE ONDO FAITH TRAVESTY \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Many church goers are increasingly being manipulated by their so-called pastors\n\nA total of 77 persons, including 26 children, were recently rescued by police officers from the basement of a church in Ondo State. Josiah Peters, assistant pastor of where the persons were discovered, said the decision to keep people in the church was in obedience to an instruction from God. \u201cWe were having seven days meeting on God\u2019s instruction, that we should lock the gate and be with him for seven days,\u201d he said. More distressing is that the highly indoctrinated worshippers reportedly refused to leave the vicinity of the police station where their pastor is being detained.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ondo incident raises questions as to whether there is a mental health aspect to some of the abuses being committed in the name of religion all over the country. The vice grip of ignorance is undeniable. The power of superstition transferred from our primordial cultures is equally a lingering curse. But there is also the more insidious criminal exploitation of these weaknesses by a new crop of crude faith merchants of all hues. In the process, vulnerable people are being stripped of cash, sexual favours and subjected to degrading and dehumanising treatment as qualifications for salvation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMass imprisonment of vulnerable citizens including children under the dubious pretense that they are on their way to heaven is an exploitation of faith to deny innocent citizens their freedom under whatever guise. This is a criminal infraction that deserves to be punished to the full extent of the law. The route to preventing more of this scope of infraction in the name of religion is basically one of increased public enlightenment. But the strategy needs to be carefully nuanced to straddle the delicate balance between discouraging criminal abuse and infringing on the rights of citizens to hold beliefs and worship freely. Yet we must stress that worship is different from willful mass submission to captivity based on foolish manipulation of faith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ondo State police command has its case clearly cut out in this matter. Child abuse on such a massive scale is criminal to that industrial scale as well. There is an additional aspect that seems to have escaped our scrutiny as a public. All sorts of architectural monstrosities have been allowed as church buildings. We doubt that the authorities have ever worried about the appropriateness of these structures for purely religious purposes. An expansive basement that can take as many as 77 people underground is somewhat suspect.\n\nHowever, we understand that the government may not have known about the basement. For years, building professionals have tried without success, to convince the National Assembly to pass the Bill for a National Building Code that will regulate the nation\u2019s construction sector. The absence of a building code is the reason states government charge fees for the conversion of buildings, including residential, to suit what the applicant wants. This is called \u2018Change of House Use\u2019. If we have a code in place, then it will be illegal to worship in a building not designed for use as a church. As it is, only the owners of the building, and the church leaders knew about the basement or catacombs.\n\n\n\nIn all, critical stakeholders must help to escort our society away from a mindset that accepts criminality in the name of religion. While men of God should do the duty of showing their congregations the right way to salvation, the state must remain vigilant in protecting the citizens from infractions and abuses of the rights of innocent people. Ultimately, the ends of a responsible state and those of organised religion coincide in the realms of order and respect for the sanctity of the human person as God\u2019s most magnificent gift and benefaction.",

          "title": "LAGOS, RAINS AND FLOODING \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "The culture of proper waste disposal and regular clearing of drainages could help in stemming the floods, writes Tayo Ogunbiyi\n\nOf late, the rains have been pouring ceaselessly in Lagos with attendant concerns. It is, thus, vital to put certain things into proper perspective to enhance residents\u2019 understanding of related issues and most importantly intimate them with helpful safety tips.\n\nThe first thing to consider is the topography of Lagos. A critical feature of Lagos topography is that it is essentially made up of low-lying terrain up to 0.4 percent below the sea level. Naturally, this constitutes a huge drainage challenge for the state.\n\nIf this is put alongside the volume of rain being experienced lately, it might be difficult to rule out flash flooding, especially in some areas.\n\nSecond is the fact that experts across the world have earlier declared that the intensity of this year\u2019s rains will be much more than what we had in the past. For instance, the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) had earlier predicted \u201cextended rains of three to eight days for areas in and around Adamawa, Ogun, Edo, Niger Delta and low-lying areas such as Lagos.\n\nRecent developments have authenticated this position, especially about the volume of rains being experienced across the country.\n\nThird is the challenge of global warming-deforestation, greenhouse gasses emission and its damaging effects on the world. In recent times, millions of people across the world have been affected by deadly floods resulting from torrential rains in China, Australia, Japan, United States of America, Indonesia and Brazil, among others.\n\nAll of these experiences are largely traceable to global warming-induced climate change, which is posing major threats to lives, food security and businesses across the world.\n\nUnderstanding the danger of global warming to its environment, the state government has been in the forefront of combating the challenge in the country. It has held several international global warming conferences in addition to making several advocacy campaigns on the subject in recent times.\n\nFourth, being a natural occurrence, flooding often defies scientific solutions. Clearly, public safety and good sense call for scientific response to flooding. However, while upgrading environmental infrastructure is important, engineering fixes alone will not suffice.\n\nAccording to renowned ecologists Donald Hey and Nancy Philippi, despite the massive construction of levees throughout the upper Mississippi Basin during the 20th century, annual average flood damage during that time more than doubled.\n\nConsequently, what is needed across the globe is a comprehensive plan to add ecological infrastructure to complement engineering infrastructure -specifically to expand wetlands and re-activate floodplains to mitigate future flood risks.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to emphasise that in-spite of government and other critical stakeholders\u2019 preparedness at mitigating the effects of heavy downpour in the state, the impact might not be fully felt except everyone shun negative practices that could promote flooding.\n\nFor instance, some illegal waste agents being patronized by a few residents indiscriminately dump refuse in canals and large drainage channels.\n\nThis often results in blockage of free flow of wastewater, resulting in flash flooding whenever it rains. This is often rampant in markets and other commercial centers as well densely populated areas of the state. Oftentimes, the effects of such poor sanitary habits on affected residents are unquantifiable and devastating.\n\nSome have been rendered homeless and miserable, no thanks to human induced environmental hazards. Thus, we all need to fully embrace the culture of proper waste disposal, comply with building regulations, tap into alternative energy use, and pay necessary attention to sanitation issues among others.\n\nIn order to appropriately educate the citizens on proper means of coping during periods on intense rainfall, NGOs, Community Development Associations, the media, members of the Civil Society and all well-meaning individuals and groups in the state need to collaborate with the state government to achieve the required attitudinal change towards the environment.\n\nAt present, the government is combining public enlightenment strategies to sensitize Lagosians on this development and has taken the time to proffer solutions so that the rains being currently experienced will not have devastating effects on lives and property.\n\nSimilarly, efforts are being made to pursue suitable policy on the environment in order to create and ensure a cleaner, healthier and sustainable environment that will promote economic growth as well as the citizenry\u2019s well-being.\n\nAs always, the government is committed to a cleaner environment and quality public health through implementation of community based solid waste management, flood control, vegetal control and high standard of home and personal hygiene, sanitation, control of environment pollution (air, water and noise), beautification and advertisement control.\n\nConsequently, its approach to tackling the issue of flooding in the state is multi-faceted and multi-dimensional. It includes dredging, massive construction and expansion of drainage channels, desilting and excavation of silts to dumpsites, regular repair, clearing and cleaning of drainages, canals and collector drains across the state.\n\nAs already stressed, being a coastal city, Lagos is naturally prone to flash flooding. It is thus advised that people avoid flood prone areas during the rainy season. Equally, it is also important for the citizenry, especially children and the aged, to stay indoors in order to reduce rain induced hazards to the barest minimum.\n\nIf it could be avoided, it is better not to drive while it is raining heavily. Similarly, we need to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene at all times to avoid being victims of water-borne diseases.\n\nAlso, to mitigate the effects of cold, we must ensure that children and the elderly are properly clothed with warm clothing during the rains. It is only when this is done that we will be able to curb the spread of rain-induced health hazards such as cough, cold and other related ones.\n\nAdditionally, this is the time to embrace the culture of taking plenty of thoroughly washed fruits in order to boost the immune system. This is in addition to drinking water from only trusted and well-tested safe sources.\n\nSince we now live in a hi-tech information age, it is also imperative that people listen to news reports and information on weather situations from various available credible media. This will really aid in planning movements and avoiding flood prone locations.\n\nIn addition, in view of likely destructive thunder strikes that usually accompany windy rainfall, residents are advised to always disconnect electrical appliances whenever they want to sleep or go out. This will go a long way in checkmating rain induced electrical debacles. Similarly, children should be discouraged from touching electrical equipment when wet.\n\nIn as much as it is beyond human powers to stop rains, being a natural phenomenon, we could do things that are in our powers to lessen its negative consequences.\n\nThis includes regular clearing of gutters and drainages in our areas, making use of suitable services to dispose of waste, reporting anyone dumping refuse in drains, gutters and canals to appropriate authorities and moving immediately to higher ground when flooding is imminent wherever we are.\n\nOthers include staying away from submerged electricity cables, cleaning and disinfecting everything that gets wet, staying away from canals and drainages evacuating or leaving danger zones immediately, calling 767 in case of emergency among others.\n\nOn a final note, the federal government and other critical stakeholders should regularly collaborate with states that have peculiar flooding challenges to determine areas of assistance.\n\nOgunbiyi is Deputy Director (Public Affairs) Ministry of Information and Strategy, Alausa, Ikeja",

          "title": "CHIDOKA: NO EASY MARK AT 51 \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Pat Onukwuli pays tribute to Osita Chidoka, former Minister of Aviation\n\nHe easily comes across as brilliant and urbane. This may not be the impression of everybody around him, especially those opposed to his politics. But it is well time to admit the fact because beyond the hubbub of resisting it, his genius is stark.\n\nOsita Chidoka is a cut above his peers. He is bold and decisive. He betrays deep intellectual appreciation of issues, most of the time. He is good at what he does and does not shy away from taking on challenges no matter how enormous. He brims with ideas and knows how to put them into practice.\n\nThere is sufficient proof of this with his appointment to the Federal Road Safety Corps and the Ministry of Aviation, especially the former. Barely one month to his 36th birthday, he was appointed to the headship of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) where he was saddled with responsibility of managing the safety of Nigerians on the road and contending with road hogs on the wheel. His assumption of duty did not come quite easy. The Corps Marshal \u2013 his predecessor in office declined handing over to the \u201csmall boy\u201d, Osita. He opted to assign that responsibility to his second in command. Not thinking differently from his boss, the Deputy Corps Marshal also hedged, calling in \u201csick two hours to the event\u201d. In the end, the handover was done and Chidoka buckled down to brass tacks.\n\nSeven years after, and with his nose to the grindstone, he did not just transform the Corps into a responsive and reputable organisation, but he had it shorn off placidity and squalidness. He had before this time, had a taste of management as a head of a national committee and member of many others, contributing significantly to national development through service. He had served as Team Leader, Committee for the Drafting of the National Policy on Non-motorised Form of Transportation in Nigeria, member Committee for Review of the Abuja Master Plan and Assistant Secretary Committee for the 1999 Military to Civilian Handover, etc. Prior to this, he was personal assistant to Minister of Works and Housing as well as Minister of Transport. He was also in the Presidency as Special Assistant to the Adviser to the President on Legal Matters.\n\nBy 2014, Chidoka\u2019s personal stock had gone up with the presidency and he came highly recommended. He was subsequently appointed Minister of Aviation. He held this position until 2015 when his party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party lost control of the central government to the All-Progressives Congress. His years in the FRSC were glorious and beyond his achievements there which included, but not limited to modernizing the organisation through digitalisation of its software, increase of the staff strength from 11,000 to 20,000, erection of the Lokogoma Housing Estate, establishment of Safeline Micro Finance Bank, building of the FRSC Academy, building of two new number plate factories, etc., he led the organization to win many awards.\n\nUnder his watch the FRSC became the first law enforcement agency to become ISO 9001 certified, won Prince Michael of Kent Award, National Productivity Award with the World Bank recognising it as the Best Example for Road Safety Management in Africa among others. With these achievements firmly in his kitty, interspersed occasionally with recognitions within and outside Nigeria, Chidoka was up for bigger responsibility, and it came with his appointment as Minister of Aviation. It is important to state here that all these happened within the period of his youth. And to his credit, even with all the idealism of youth he managed the two offices ably well, muffing neither and leaving both with his reputation intact.\n\nOn the surface, leaving an office or offices with untainted reputation may not provoke any interest after all \u201cwith enough courage\u201d, wrote writer Margaret Mitchell, \u201cyou can do without a reputation\u201d. However, in a clime where courage is rare among youths and keeping a good reputation a hard nut to crack, an ounce of the latter is priceless. Over the years, Chidoka has played issue-based politics, maintaining dignified stand on national question. Very few of his colleague ministers still command attention almost eight years after. With no want of ideas, he writes profusely on good governance and advocates for a liveable society. He cuts an image of an elder statesman \u2013 one who sets great store by experience even as he is still within the precinct of youth. As stated above even from his time as Corps Marshal and Minister no time did, he did not allow the idealism of youth or its twin spirit of adventurism to get in the way he handled both offices. He saw well ahead of his time and worked hard to improve his environment.\n\nIn 2017, he ran for the governorship election of his state. Though he lost to ex-Governor Willie Obiano, but not a few people still remember how he debated his colleagues. He has continued to impress his listeners with his speech delivery and captivates his readers with lucid writings. He is an advocate of the triple values of Uchu, Uche and Egwuchukwu which embody Igbo virtues of diligence, prudence and trustworthiness. These core values shape his political ideology that is founded on veracity.\n\nHe can be fiercely honest when articulating what he considers to be truth that liberates. Although some will argue that truth is relative and has many dimensions. However, Willard Mullins in his Reflections on Mannheim\u2019s Paradox argues that \u201ccontrary to mainstream views, truth and ideology can be interwoven and are neither antagonistic nor irreconcilable\u201d.\n\nThus, Chidoka is an inadvertent political scholar that is intensely ensconced in his perceptions and caught between saying it the way it is and being politically correct. Quite often he places truth above political consideration no matter how unpopular. An uncommon practice in the equally uncommon landscape of Nigerian politics, and which can be inimical to political advancement. Nevertheless, veracity is still a virtue in politics because it was its inexactitudes, dissimulations and denials that recently brought Boris Johnson\u2019s Premiership to an abrupt end. His moral high ground and promotions of universally recognised standards of justice whittled him as a conscientious agitator.\n\nChidoka is one of the few Igbo political leaders who openly endorse the rights of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to peaceful agitation. On the other hand, he holds the view that might not be popular with the people of his own extraction. Accordingly, he thinks the problem of Ndi Igbo is not marginalisation by the Nigerian state, but rather the failure of Local and State governments to be accountable to the people. He thinks that cries of marginalisation will fade into nothingness if governance at the local level is upped some notches higher. There is no doubt that Chidoka like a few others has a lot to offer Nigeria if called upon to do so. In a country of gerontocrats, he has not just the advantage of age, but also of knowledge and profundity. He should be most willing to avail the country his time, energy and immeasurable experience.\n\nAs he celebrates his 51 years on earth, he should proudly savour his numerous achievements. However, he should not waver, falter, or vacillate, but continue and double down on his commitment to a fairer Nigeria, and to truth, no matter the political risk.\n\nDr. Onukwuli writes from patonukwuli2003@yahoo.co.uk",

          "text": "The West African Examination Council (WAEC) said the abduction of over 250 schoolgirls in Chibok in April 2014 may not have occurred if the then governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, had heeded the advice of the examination body.\n\nShettima was on Sunday announced as the running mate of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nOn April 14, 2014, the schoolgirls were abducted when insurgents attacked the Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School (GGSS) in Chibok, Borno State.\n\nThe abduction of the girls in 2014 was followed by a global outcry that birthed the #BringBackOurGirls movement.\n\nAware of the poor security situation in Borno and worried about the safety of students, WAEC had declined to conduct its Senior School Certificate Examination in unsafe parts of Borno, including Chibok.\n\nBut that was until Shettima assured of adequate security measures.\n\nAccording to the then Head of WAEC National Office in Nigeria, Charles Eguridu, the body was initially reluctant to conduct its examination in Chibok and other troubled areas of the North-East because of the security challenges.\n\nIt, however, had to buckle when Shettima assured the Council, in writing, that adequate security would be provided.\n\n\u201cFollowing the previous experience, we were afraid to go to the North-East this year, yet we risked it and asked for extra security through the Minister of Education, Nyesom Wike,\u201d the official had said.\n\n\u201cWe also asked the various state governments to relocate all the centres to the state capitals where there would be adequate security.\n\n\u201cThe three governors did not respond to our request but instead said they had made adequate security arrangements. The Borno State government also refused to relocate the students from Chibok to safer places like Maiduguri.\u201d\n\nThe WAEC official also tendered the letters written to the governors of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe to prove his claim.\n\nHe added that another factor that influenced WAEC\u2019s decision to ask that all centres be moved to the state capitals was the death of three of its staff while conducting a similar examination in a school along the Yola-Maiduguri road in 2013.\n\nThe Borno governor, who initially declined transferring the final year students from centres in remote areas like Chibok to the state capital, finally agreed to do so after the kidnap, Eguridu said.\n\n\u201cBorno State government only agreed to relocate the remaining 189 pupils after the abduction of the girls,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What to look for in a startup lawyer",
          "text": "Startups often relegate non-technology roles to the background in a bid to ship products quickly. However, these roles are often as important in the overall success of the company as the technical roles, and one such important role is that of the startup lawyer.\n\nAt the beginning of the technology boom in Africa, the standard practice was for startups to outsource their legal processes to law firms. With the increase in funding in Africa, more startups have become aware of the importance of having an in-house lawyer focused specifically on their legal needs.\n\nBeing a relatively new development, it is not far-fetched to assume that startups might not know what to look for in a startup lawyer. To identify the unique qualities a startup lawyer should have, I asked 4 lawyers what qualities startups should look for in an in-house counsel.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi is a lawyer with experience working in-house for a fintech startup and providing legal advisory for early-stage startups.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi: I think startups need to begin their questions with, \u201cDo we need an in-house lawyer or a lawyer I can reach out to when needed?\u201d I say this because, while you always need a lawyer, a couple of factors determine if you need one employed with you or if you need one on a retainer. These factors include how regulated your sector of operation is. The regulations guiding fintech and food ordering companies are very different from one another. The size and stage of your startup\u2019s growth matter as well. A startup at the ideation stage has different needs from a startup that has begun operations.\n\nYou also need to be conscious and properly assess your options when engaging a lawyer due to the nature of the role. A proper assessment cannot be understated. Like with every other kind of service, there is the tendency to have a \u201cvalue mismatch\u201d if you do not engage on the terms that fit your needs.\n\nThe first thing to look out for in a lawyer is honesty, and it is the single most important feature, to me. The reason is that a lawyer holds the life of your startup in his hands. You need a lawyer that informs you of the whole reality every time a situation comes up. Brilliance is overrated; it\u2019s the law, and there will always be a solution. You want a lawyer that can tell you, \u201cI am not sure what the position of the law on this is, allow me to run some checks.\u201d Your lawyer should be comfortable enough to tell you, \u201cThis is outside my speciality, we need to bring this person in to handle this particular part of the issue.\u201d If you find a lawyer that can be this honest with you, you are in good hands, regardless of how convoluted the legal situation might be.\n\nEmmanuel Ido is an associate at Olajide Oyewole LLP (DLA Piper Africa).\n\nEmmanuel Ido: Almost every startup is unique, from its product to its people. The role of a startup lawyer is essential to support the startup from a legal perspective such that it can function at optimum capacity. Whether the startup is pre-seed, bootstrapped or VC-funded, a good startup lawyer is crucial for its day-to-day running. Aside from the practical skills, there are a few things to look out for when hiring a lawyer for your startup.\n\nFirst, the lawyer\u2019s sector knowledge is important. When hiring a lawyer for your startup, one should consider the level of sector knowledge. This will be handy when drafting and negotiating contracts, advising the startup, and general day-to-day operations. A good startup lawyer should be well-grounded in data protection, intellectual property management, labour and employment law, corporate governance, public policy, dispute resolution, etc.\n\nAnother thing to look out for is the lawyer\u2019s sector experience. A startup lawyer must have relevant experience within the tech sector. The experience will come from doing the work. For instance, a corporate and finance lawyer who has practical experience will be suited to advising a fintech company. A quick review of their deal sheet will give you an idea of the type of lawyer they are and how suitable they will be for your startup.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s regulatory interface is also very important because it\u2019s almost impossible to operate a startup without constant regulatory interface. To this end, your lawyer should be someone with sufficient knowledge of the regulators and the relevant contacts.\n\nThe 3 categories above roughly summarise what is needed in a startup lawyer. Of course, they must have the right soft skills and are good at working in a team in a dynamic environment, as most startups are.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan is a partner at Springwoods LP.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan: The first thing that I think a startup should look for in a lawyer is transaction experience and compliance experience. This is not to say that a lawyer with experience in other fields should not be considered. However, that lawyer should be adaptable enough to learn.\n\nA startup lawyer should also be able to work in a startup environment, which is not as rigid as a law firm. The lawyer should ideally be someone that can think on their feet and be able to prioritise. It is not all conflicts that require a court sitting; some legal matters require collaboration. The lawyer should have a multi-faceted approach to legal matters.\n\nThe lawyer should also be able to maintain and build relationships with regulators and your competitors. This is very relevant. A startup lawyer should be aware of regulatory developments ahead of the public to navigate these developments smoothly. Unlike law firms, a startup can\u2019t afford a lawyer that doesn\u2019t have attention to detail.\n\nLastly, as the startup evolves so too should its legal needs evolve. An early-stage startup requires basic things like incorporation and a founder\u2019s contract. However, as you scale, the legal demands greatly increase. At this stage, the startup should liaise with its lawyer to understand the next steps to take to meet these demands.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye is a lawyer at Banwo & Ighodalo, and a writer.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye: The first thing to look out for is technical expertise. Knowledge of the law is the whole basis of a lawyer in a startup. As such, the first and most important thing is for the in-house counsel to be highly technical in the knowledge and application of law to issues arising out of your business. Also, a necessary plus is more industry-streamlined knowledge and awareness of current market solutions that are needed for that startup.\n\nPerhaps more useful for the startup than the lawyer\u2019s technical expertise is the lawyer\u2019s creativity, business savvy, and solutions-oriented outlook. The lawyer mustn\u2019t be restricted to the legal side of the startup only, as this may negatively impact some of the creative solutions that the product and engineering team may want to bring on board. It is therefore important for the founders to look out for the creative flair in the lawyer candidates they are speaking to.\n\nLastly, cultural fit is very important. While lawyers are inclined to be more regimented in their approach, working in a startup will require the flexibility of whatever candidate you are looking to scoop up into your team.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Gideon Dada\u2019s guide for getting into venture capital",
          "text": "A few weeks ago, I sat down for a chat with Gideon Dada. A few minutes before the call, he had just returned from the gym, a daily ritual he adopted to stay fit while working remotely.\n\nDada is an Investment Associate at Metis Capital Partners, Nigerian businessman Hakeem Belo-Osagie\u2019s family office. He joined the firm in December 2021 after leaving Sankore Investments, where he was part of the wealth management team optimising the wealth management process.\n\nFamily offices help high-net-worth families to manage their wealth. Historically, family offices managed the wealth of one family; today, some family offices cater to more than one family.\n\nIn 2021, he got a LinkedIn message from someone at Metis Capital who was recruiting and wanted to know if he was interested in the role. After looking through the job description, he put in an application and took some assessments before landing the job.\n\nBut why would he leave a job in a structured environment for the murky waters of venture capital? For Dada, it was primarily the opportunity to work with his current bosses at Metis Capital.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was the opportunity to work with these guys and learn from them. No doubt, I had a good job in asset management, but when the opportunity came to learn from these guys with this consulting background, I just felt like it was the perfect opportunity for me. Honestly, I haven\u2019t been disappointed between when I started in December and now.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the unpredictability of venture capital was also a huge draw.\n\n\u201cComing to VC, it\u2019s much more flexible; you don\u2019t look through the same deck twice. So today, I\u2019m looking at something in Bitcoin wallet infrastructure. The next day I\u2019m looking at data infrastructure and fintech the next. You have to go out to get the knowledge for all of these opportunities you come across.\u201d\n\nLanding a role in VC\n\nHaving been headhunted for the role, Dada believes a few qualities helped him stand out.\n\n\u201cFirst, I think responsibility. It\u2019s a family office, so I pretty much lead conversations on the VC aspects. So you want someone you are not running after on Monday morning, midnight, or Friday. If you need something, you want to know that this person is available and taking responsibility for your task. [You want] someone you can rest assured would perform on your tasks.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks his LinkedIn profile helped show his experience and ability to manage expectations.\n\n\u201cI think my profile on LinkedIn just shows my track record of experience. So right from 200 Level, I\u2019ve always had a job on the side. And so that just shows the ability to manage your time.\u201d\n\nGideon Dada, Investment Associate at Metis Capital Partners\n\nFor students and recent graduates looking to get into the space, he disclosed that it is crucial to prove their value to potential employees and build their networks.\n\nLike many investors in Africa, Dada disclosed that Metis Capital could only invest in a handful of startups that they come across. However, they also pass on deals to other investors in their network.\n\n\u201cOne out of every four would be really interesting for us, but because of budgetary restrictions and the fact that it\u2019s still a new space, we\u2019re still taking it easy. We give small tickets between $10,000 to $25,000 and then bring in our value. We\u2019ve invested in about 10% of startups that we\u2019ve received.\u201d\n\nAs a sector-agnostic investor, Dada disclosed that Metis Capital invests in startups where they can add significant value, with regulatory guidance and market entry strategies two of their strengths.\n\n\u201cWe like to invest in companies where we think we can add substantial value. We\u2019ve done a couple of fintech deals because our chairman has a lot of experience in that space. We also look to help guys that are establishing outside Nigeria but also looking to penetrate the Nigerian markets. You find that when companies do their due diligence, they come back to us and are saying, \u2018Oh, whatever ticket size you\u2019re looking at, we\u2019re happy to have you on our cap table, even if it\u2019s less than the minimum ticket.\u2019\u201d\n\nGideon Dada\u2019s most exciting sectors\n\nWith technology upending several sectors on the content, three sectors stand out for Dada \u2013 fintech, healthtech, and eCommerce.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot of buzz around fintech, and it\u2019s still the most exciting sector on the continent; there\u2019s still a lot of space for growth. And I say that because we\u2019re only scratching the surface office right now; 95% of transactions are in cash, so only 5% of transactions happening on the continent have been digitised.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of innovation around healthcare as well, especially after COVID happened. So I like innovations that are coming up there as well. The last would be eCommerce, and I see a future where most of our basic necessities \u2014 groceries and all of that \u2014 would be delivered to our doorstep.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of entrepreneur should avoid VC money?\n\nAlthough VCs typically invest in tech startups, not all founders will be a good fit for investors. One reason for this, according to Dada, is a reluctance to communicate the state of the business to VCs.\n\n\u201cOff the top of my head, I\u2019m thinking, if you\u2019re a bad communicator or you don\u2019t do well with feedback and just keeping people posted, you should stay away from accepting investors\u2019 money because whoever is investing wants to know how their funds are faring, as often as possible, or at least have an idea of when to expect an update.\u201d\n\nHe also thinks part-time entrepreneurs should not look for VC investment.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not your full-time job, if you\u2019re not committing a hundred per cent to the product that you\u2019re building, stay away from collecting VC money. I mean, during due diligence, it would come up. I won\u2019t invest in you if you\u2019re not committing a hundred per cent to this.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, he explains that founders looking to raise from VCs need to be clear on what they want from these investors. For example, founders can have a mix of foreign and local investors to enable them to access capital and expertise.\n\nThe role of investors in building strong cultures\n\nStartups have been lauded for espousing what many consider to be a better workplace culture. However, culture goes beyond new MacBooks, gym memberships, and remote work options. But investors can help where many startups lack experience or examples of healthy work cultures.\n\nDada suggests that many questions about work cultures can be solved with repeated education.\n\n\u201cProper sensitisation of even experienced folks is very important, and continuously hammering on these things helps with that. For founders, it should be more around regular follow-up and checkup calls.\u201d\n\nWith venture capital relatively unknown to many Africans, Dada says the biggest misconception is that one needs to have it all figured out before getting into the field; he also shared that VCs are constantly learning.",

He attended the University of Lagos, where he earned a B.Sc. in Political Science in 1985. He later attended Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, where he obtained a master\u2019s degree in International Relations.\n\nOrubebe was supervisory councilor and later chairman of Burutu LGA. In July 2007, President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua appointed him Minister of Special Duties. He was later to become Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs when the ministry was created in December 2008.\n\nWhen he eventually became full fledged minister of that ministry, one of his key achievements was to drive the construction of the East/West Highway in a rapid fast track.\n\nUnder his watch, the ministry constructed 38 out of 42 bridges, and over 900 culverts of the 1000 designed for the road.\n\nOrubebe was also at the forefront of negotiating peace with Niger Delta militant groups which had brought crude oil production in Nigeria down to less than 400,000 barrels a day from over 2.5 million barrels, in protest of perceived social, economic and environmental injustice in the region.\n\nWorking with then Vice President, and later President Goodluck Jonathan, he shares the credit of instituting the Niger Delta Amnesty Programme, which successfully won the hearts and minds of most Niger Deltans and brought peace to the region.\n\nOrubebe resigned from office in February 2014 to contest for the governorship of Delta State in the build up to the 2015 general elections.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Hon. Lasun Yussuff emerges victorious in the coming election.\n\nObi who was in Osun at a mega rally organised by the party alongside the leaders of the party across the country, urged the citizens of the state not to leave their destiny in the hand of those that have put the nation in darkness for the past 22 years, saying it\u2019s the time for them to safeguard the future of their children by voting Labour Party .\n\nAccording to him, the major political parties that have ruled the nation\u2019s for 22 years have failed us.\n\nObi argued that, Labour party, being the party of the masses have come with a lots of goodies for the masses.\n\n\u201cSomebody said they will labour till death, when they talk like that, when they show you hatred, LP will show them love, there is dignity in labour, LP said we want to move Nigeria from consumption to production you cannot do production without labour, so there is dignity in labour and those who have laboured will get their reward, that is what we want to do in Nigeria, we don\u2019t want monkey to work again, baboon to chop.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody to die, we want everybody to live, we want the baboon to live, we want them to join monkey in working. We want the baboon to join the monkey to work, we want the two of them to live and chop so when they talk about dying, pray for them to live. We want Nigerians to be shown love, care, let nobody tell you he is from this place or that place, vote for competence.\n\n\u201cVote for LP, vote for the future of your children we are going to introduce you to a governor who will be committed to better Osun State; that is what we want. Don\u2019t collect money and vote incompetence. If you do, the next four years it will be worse, or as the chairman said collect the money and keep it, vote for your conscience.\n\n\u201cThey have no job, no food, your children are not in school, their children are schooling overseas, this is the time for you to recover Nigeria, this is the time for you to take back Nigeria they are owing salaries, they are owing pensions, those people that are working have not been paid,\u201d he noted.\n\nWhile speaking, the Labour Party governorship candidate, Hon. Yusuf said he is fully ready to govern the state with the support of the people of the state.\n\nHon Lasun who appealed to the teeming members at the rally said, \u201cwe are the one living here, we established companies here. I\u2019ll tell you how they are not humans. They came four years ago and said they are giving us a financial engineer. It\u2019s over three and a half years but the financial engineer did not engineer anything.\n\n\u201cAs if that is not enough, yesterday they said we can go and labour and die. Does a virtuous Yoruba person say such? I describe them as people of anonymous background. We don\u2019t know them. Their life is anonymous. They just want us to see that they have money. Yoruba, can money do all things?\n\n\u201cThis is the seat of Oduduwa. Anybody who calls himself a Yoruba man and has refused to imbibe the ethos of Omoluabi does not fit to be a Yoruba leader. How will you tell us to go and labour and die. They are only telling our parents that they have laboured in vain.\n\n\u201cMy father was a carpenter and my mother a kolanut trader and they trained me in school with their labour.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about your capacity to articulate your position and your intention to serve the people. But they are not serving us. Sound education, proper healthcare will be possible when I become the governor. The citizens will have at least one clinic that is accessible to all within the radius of 1km and that was the position of Olukoye Ransome-Kuti when he was alive.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know. The sitting governor said he has rehabilitated 332 healthcare centers, one in each ward. Are they accessible, did you see one close to you?\n\n\u201cWe will use agriculture to restore the economy. I will do targeted infrastructure. These people don\u2019t understand governance and budgeting, that\u2019s why they will go and do infrastructure that will stand alone. You borrow money to invest. You finance your budget from taxes. They don\u2019t know it. The other two that are important to me when I become the governor, I am going to create a data center at the headquarter of every local government. For the first time, we ought to know how many are we. At the data center, your details will be captured and your biometrics.\n\n\u201cBy July 16, I know Osun State will vote for me and it will shock them. Studies all over the world have shown that women are excluded from the economy and women are more than half of the population. So, when you exclude half of the population from the economy, poverty will definitely be huge\u201d Lasun added.",

I told my children, particularly the girls, that they can only get married after getting a first degree.\n\n\u201cThey already know that I am not leaving anything for anyone to inherit. My greatest legacy to the children is to ensure they are properly educated,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president charged Nigerians youth to seek education, not for government jobs which are unavailable but to equip themselves with skills to fight poverty and to meet the needs of the 21st Century.\n\nThe president, according to a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu who was at the Emir of Daura\u2019s Palace for the Sallah homage, said more time should be given to the coaching of the future leaders, with basic knowledge of moral values, as the fast-changing world, driven by new technology, would be more competitive and demanding.\n\n\u201cI was locked up for more than three years, after leading the country. At that point, I realised and I told my children that your net worth is what is in your head, not what you have acquired in life,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said children should be guided and taught history, as they would find it hard to be patriotic, responsible and respectful, without a thorough understanding of their backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWhoever does not have a good sense of history will easily make mistakes. We should ensure the children get proper education. The knowledge they acquire should not be towards getting government jobs. We don\u2019t have jobs in government anymore. With technology, governments are becoming more smaller, nimble and efficient.\n\n\u201cEmphasis should now be on skills acquisition and competence in creation and deployment of technology. During the COVID-19, we asked all level 12 downward to stay at home, and surprisingly the system worked effectively, the president noted.\n\nBuhari told the Emir of Daura, Dr Faruk Umar Faruk, that he would be more regular in visits, preparatory to his handing over in May 2023, adding that the prolonged absence was due to the demands of his office.\n\n\u201cThis is the longest I have been away from home. Infact, the Emir took to the court of public opinion at the prayer ground, when he openly told everyone that I had not visited Daura for close to a year,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said all Nigerians must make sacrifices to move the country forward, especially the public servants, calling for more selflessness and inclusion.\n\n\u201cAt the end, it is only God that can reward your efforts, not man,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Aminu Bello Masari listed the achievements of the president to include social security, which was created to cater for the poor, and ensure that they receive some money at the end of every month.\n\n\u201cNo government in the history of this country has done more to reduce poverty like President Buhari\u2019s administration. He asked religious and community leaders to bring enlightenment to bear on successful government programmes such as the Social Investment Program, SIP through which 120,000 poor citizens in 12 Local Government Areas of the state receive a monthly payment of N5,000 and this is happening in all the states.\n\n\u201cToday, we have over 863,000 children in the state being fed under the school feeding program. This has created 10,000 jobs for women cooks, 14,000 young men and women enrolled in N-Power.\n\n\u201cWe have food vendors who are engaged and earning their livelihood. All the foolish talk on social media is by those who only think of themselves. Our elites are never happy or appreciative until something gets to their pockets,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Emir of Daura thanked the president for the infrastructural and institutional developments in the state, saying generations will remember and remain grateful to President Buhari.\n\nFaruk urged the president to increase his patience and tolerance as he begins to countdown, knowing that the ultimate reward for all his sacrifice will come from God.",
          "summary": "President Muhammadu Buhari says he has told his children that he would not leave any inheritance for them.\nBuhari said, \u201cMy focus has always been on training the children to be relevant wherever they find themselves.\nI told my children, particularly the girls, that they can only get married after getting a first degree.\nAt that point, I realised and I told my children that your net worth is what is in your head, not what you have acquired in life,\u201d he said.\nThe Emir of Daura thanked the president for the infrastructural and institutional developments in the state, saying generations will remember and remain grateful to President Buhari.",

          "text": "Raheem Sterling has completed his sensational move from Manchester City to Chelsea, with Todd Boehly finally landing his first major signing since taking over the club from Roman Abramovich.\n\nThe 27-year-old England star has swapped the Etihad Stadium for Stamford Bridge in a move believed to worth \u00a350million.\n\nSterling has signed a five-year contract worth significantly more than the \u00a3300,000 a week he was paid by City. There is the option for an extension of a further season on a deal that takes him into the Premier League\u2019s top three earners.\n\nHe becomes the first signing of the Boehly era and will be followed by Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly after Chelsea agreed a \u00a334m move for the centre back on Wednesday. He will undergo a medical in Los Angeles on Thursday.\n\n\u2018First and foremost, it\u2019s a pleasure to be here,\u2019 Sterling said.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve obviously achieved a lot in my career so far, but there is still so much more to achieve and I\u2019m really looking forward to doing that in a Chelsea shirt, under Thomas\u2019s management.\n\n\u2018London is my home and where it all started for me, and it\u2019s amazing I now have the opportunity to play in front of friends and family week in, week out at Stamford Bridge. I\u2019m really looking forward to meeting the fans there soon.\n\n\u2018I do want to take the opportunity to thank Todd, Behdad, the ownership group, Thomas, and all involved in the process of getting me here.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t wait to get going now and continue to do my talking on the pitch.\u2019\n\nJoyous new co-owner Boehly added: \u2018Raheem Sterling is a serial winner and his signing is an important step in strengthening our squad.\n\n\u2018We are delighted for Raheem to return to London with Chelsea, and we look forward to seeing his world-class talent on display at Stamford Bridge.\u2019\n\nSterling had penned an emotional letter to City and their fans, in which he confirmed his exit earlier today.\n\n\u2018I arrived in Manchester a 20-year-old.

          "title": "Mining: Research, devt pivotal to achieving economic diversification- Asuquo",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General/ CEO, National Metallurgical Development Center, NMDC, Jos, Engr. Prof. Linus Asuquo has said that research and development should be given priority if the nation was bent on achieving its goals on economic diversification.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in an interview granted in Abuja, Asuquo noted that capacity building interms of training and retraining of human capacity was important for the growth and development of the economy.\n\nHe said that at the NMDC, there was need to renovate some of the structures to give it a conducive emblem for research and development and such efforts been put in place has ensured its effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nHe explained \u201cOn capacity building in terms of human capacity building, we have done enough to train our people for research and development, we need to train and retrain, we have done that locally and internationally, we have sent some of our staff to Australia, Japan and to South Africa for training, the essence of that is that our research and development must be productive. If you lack in training you can not go forward, and the people have stayed there for many years without adequate training, so they have now been trained.\n\n\u201cIf we are to go forward in this country for research and development, that is where our priority should be, if we really want to develop in this country. If we want to diversify our economy, we can not diversify without meaningful research and Development as a lot of research has to be done for us to go forward.\u201d\n\nThe NMDC boss who was appointed in July 2018 disclosed that the inability to analyze the materials used for building projects was one of the factors contributing to building collapse in the country.\n\nHe said that individuals and construction companies used scrap metal to produce metals without allowing NMDC to effectively carry out their job.\n\nIn his words:\u201dWe have to analyze even though we have SON, but we are the ones to analyze the type of materials , whether they are fit for building or not. So that has also been a challenge for NMDC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development of the Centre, he continued \u201cbecause I found out that the security of that place was very poor and incident of thefts was almost on a weekly basis; so I had to beef up security of the place by contacting security personnel, the Police, the SSS, and the Civil Defence and they were ready to cooperate and since then, the theft incident reduced to the nearest minimum.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there was need to restructure the management for effective and efficient running of the Centre, hence the restructuring of departments from nine to seven and placing the right people in the right places and this he confirmed has yielded dividends.\n\nAsuquo also said \u201cwith the very poor power supply in the country and for any meaningful research, power was necessary and there was no power. We were going with a small generator and we could not do any effective research, so I had to find an alternative power source by solar system so we had to install the solar system in all the laboratories for effective analysis and now people can analyse using our equipment.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the core mandate of the Metallurgical Center, the Director General, further explained \u201cstarting with exploration, let me say that in this country we have identified 44 strategic minerals in the country, in 500 locations and therefore, for us to be effective we have to analyze, NMDC has to work on mineral processing and then in the metal sector, we have to know the type of minerals we have in the country, the compositions, and so forth. So that was a challenge for us to have a laboratory ready.\n\n\u201cBut this place was established as far back as 1973, as a research laboratory for the then steel plant , so you believe that from 1973 till the time I came, the equipment were very obsolete, some of them were not useful again, therefore there was need to find the state of the art equipment to do meaningful research and we were able to procure state of the art equipment for research and Development.\n\n\u201cAnd am pleased to inform you that right now, NMDC, even though not sufficient because the recent development is capital intensive, we now have the state of the art equipment to analyze these minerals that we have: apart from that, we also have the methodology department for some analysis.\n\n\u201cNigeria has iron ore in Itakpe, which is of very high iron concentration but this was meant for Delta State Company because it has about 250 millions turns of iron but we have another iron ore in Akpaja about three billion turns that will take so many years, no research has been done on it to find whether is suitable or not , that is our own work in NMDC, to find out whether the Akpaja iron ore will be suitable, of course is suitable, I worked on that in 1990/ 1991, to find out ways that Akpaja iron ore could be used for our Steel plant by selective calculation which we have to use cassava starch to make flux sarage, even though it has some phosphorus, it\u2019s not a problem because that can be dephosphorised during the processing.\u201d\n\nOn coal, Asuquo revealed that, \u201cone of the materials that we use for iron making is Coal and a lot of work has been done in NMDC about coal and unfortunately most of our coal, even though we have in abundance like Enugu coal, they are not prime coating coal, that is you cannot have real coal, hundred percent coke from that coal, so what we have done in our research is to use the lavia Obi coal and blend with the imported coal to form our coke, that will reduce the cost of production, importation and thus, foreign exchange will be reserved. We have also worked sufficiently on our coal.\n\n\u201cJust last week, we have acquired scanning electron microscope which is the state of the art equipment for metal and mineral processing and two people had to come from UK to train our staff, which was a human capacity training. We trained about ten people which will be enough to train others in the place on how to use this.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development for its intervention in the development of the Centre which includes renovation of seven of its buildings, procurement of equipment such as the scanning electron microscope and a lapping polishing machine adding that \u201csome teams are coming from South Africa to train our staff on this lapping polishing machine. With such capacity building, we are set to do meaningful research and Development compared to what we saw before.\u201d\n\nOn the challenges confronted so far, the DG said \u201cthere are lots of changes, research and Development is capital intensive in any country, by the grace of God I have been able to in my span of sixty eight years to travel to more than fifty six countries of the world and I have seen that research and Development is capital intensive, the whole world is putting attention in research and Development, people are budgeting between three to four percent GDP for research and Development and I want to thank Mr. President because recently, he increase form zero point one to zero point five but that is still very inadequate.\u201d\n\nProjecting into the coming years, in the steel sector, Engr. Asuquo said: \u201cLike I said, if we have adequate funding and we pay attention to what we are doing, given priority we should be expecting development in the country. Let me say this, as I have repeated many times, we should not play with the Ajaokuta Steel company. A lot of politics has been toiling with it over the years, if you know the quntoms of metals imported into this country, then you know where we are. We are spending some billions of naira to important metals, now considering the railways we are constructing, if we have Ajaokuta Steel company working, I don\u2019t think we should have been importing these metals , we would have reserved our economy, we would have created more employment for our youths, there would be skill acquisition and so on, the benefits are numerous.\n\n\u201cSo, if we start doing research and development and the Ajaokuta Steel Company is working, there will be development, without Ajaokuta working, then we are just playing lip service. Also there must be a political will in this country for us to say this is our priority.\u201d\n\nReacting to the claim that the Ajaokuta Steel Company was outdated, he said, \u201cpeople who say that are not informed, if you do a lot of research, you will know that Russia cannot do without blast furnace, even Indian cannot do without blast furnace. I was in India in the year 2000 and they were producing hundred million tonnes of steel in that year and that was the method were they using there. We just seat down at home here and criticize that our Ajaokuta Steel Company is outdated.\n\n\u201cWhat are the new methods that can be used in the production of Iron and Steel except the blast furnace, a lot of people are saying nobody is using coal, Russia is using coal, China is using coal, so what are we talking about? Everyone wants to be an engineer now, Nigerians like to talk but when it comes to practical terms to proffer solutions they go silent.\n\n\u201cAny person that have seen the amount of money spent in Ajaokuta, to scrap that place will be a colossal waste, and suicidal. Even if it\u2019s outdated, we can modernize it into sections; that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Ajaokuta Steel Company. Starting from the blast furnace, where they will produce iron , after that you produce steel, from Steel, you have a continuous casting, where you produce rods.\u201d\n\nHe further added \u201cDid you know you can generate power from the Ajaokuta Steel Company to so many States , we should not just start at once, we can think big and start small.\u201d\n\nOn NMDC\u2019s collaboration with other MDA\u2019s for wealth creation, Asuquo further stated that in December 2020, it had collaborated with Defence Industry Corporation of Nigeria, DICON and has also signed an MOU with NASENI.\n\n\u201cDICON was importing armaments from China and I wrote to them that we have that capacity to produce their raw materials, instead of importing brass from China, we could produce for them, the DG visited us twice with his team and was excited with what he saw and what we were doing, and then sent a technician team to us to evaluate and the MOU was signed on December 3rd, 2020, to produce the raw materials for them, if such a thing is implemented, I can tell you that I may not need money from government because the billions they were using in importing, if they give that to us it will be sufficient for our research and development.

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

          "text": "Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has faulted the announcement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket by the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nLawal, in a note he personally signed on Tuesday, described the decision as a \u201cdisastrous error.\u201d\n\nMr Tinubu on Sunday announced former Borno State Governor, Kassim Shettima, as his running mate in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBoth men are Muslims.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tinubu, Lawan, APC Governors Campaign For Oyetola In Osogbo\n\nMr Lawal, who backed Tinubu during the APC presidential primaries, said the choice of Mr Shettima was a sign that the APC presidential candidate has \u201cbeen cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe northern governors and some northern Muslim elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them,\u201d Mr Lawal said.\n\n\u201cBut if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he should have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\u201d\n\nRead Mr Babachir\u2019s full note below:\n\nI thought I will be able to avoid commenting on the disastrous error by my very good friend, Sen Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his choice of a running mate.\n\nI will be the very last person to stand in the way of my very good friend Tinubu\u2019s path to the presidency. This is because since 2011 my consuming passion has been for him to succeed Buhari as President of Nigeria.\n\nIt will not be true if I say that I did not see it coming. I have often read his body language, picked up snippets from several discussions with his lapdogs (some of whom, sadly are Christians but most of whom are moslems) and I have conveyed my reservations to them against the pitfalls of a moslem-moslem ticket towards which I sensed they were drifting.\n\nAs part of my obligation to him, a close friend, I had on many occasions argued the merits and demerits of both ticket permutations to him. I have done so in both verbal and written form and I have likewise, done so with some of his close respectable associates and friends. In all instances I had left him with the sole responsibility for his final decision arguing that in the end the consequences of the outcome of any bad decision will be his to\n\nbear. There might be some collateral damages though. I have also on several occasions passed on to him counsels and messages from some well meaning Nigerians intended to alert him on the possible outcomes of the Presidential ticket permutations.\n\nTinubu is a very good man. He is a great listener. He has a very humble and friendly disposition to every one. He is very generous in both cash and kind, especially where it could advance his political interests. But I have realized that it is in the nature of power that sycophants and lapdogs have the most influence on leaders with such character traits. They will lie to him, malign and disparage others and generally do any thing to curry his favor and to also put well-meaning associates in bad light. I suspect this is what has\n\nhappened to my friend. He has been cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\n\nIt never used to be like this. While in his hay-days in Lagos, he surrounded himself with smart, street-wise guys that could tell truth to power. He had Rauph Aregbesola, Yomi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Dele Alake, Muiz Banire, etc.The Lagos days were the days of think-tanks, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, principles and ideologies. But\n\nthese people have since grown-up and moved up to establish their own systems living my friend stranded. Nature they say abhors vacuum.\n\nWelcome the Abuja equivalent. But the Abuja equivalent are people inflicted with the modern Nigerian diseases \u2013 religious bigotry, sycophancy and morbid tribalism. They are mostly political jobbers who are most times not averse to the application of diabolical means. Gone are the days of think-tanks, and strategic planning. Gone are the days of principles and ideologies. Try and call a meeting; they will not attend. Try and make a plan; they will sabotage it. Everything is ad-hoc, everything is chaotic because they excel in such environments. The result is that they have played on his longterm ambition to be President and have built it into a sort of desperation and a crescendo that easily justifies this satanic resort to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. This is the calamity that has befallen my\n\nfriend.\n\nAnd why Kashim Shetima? He is an overambitious man who has a Machiavellian bent and has lots of money with which to procure a preferred-candidate status among Tinubu\u2019s lapdogs. And as we are beginning to see, to also procure bogus supporters especially from among the Christian community to help launder his no-so-good image.\n\nBut as a popular proverb goes: \u201cThose whom the gods want to destroy they first make mad\u201d. It appears that the gods want to destroy the APC and its Presidential Candidate and have chosen the instrumentality of the northern Moslem governors and their super ambitious tool and Kashim Ibrahim for this purpose. Alhaji Kashim Shetima is a Greek gift from the Northern governors to Tinubu. I advise Bola to make sure Kashima\u2019s two hands are always in his plain sight and empty.\n\nTrue, based on the advise of his new friends, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made his choice. And I am sure he thinks he is ready for the out come of that choice. He has chosen to bring religion to the front burner of Nigerian politics. And being a Muslim he has chosen to take sides with his own religion. For all he cares, Christians can go to blazes with their\n\nvotes. But he must also be told that there will consequences for this choice. Some of them are that Christians all over the country will revolt against the APC to put the chances of his election in serious jeopardy. It will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian dominated areas in jeopardy. This could result in APC being a minority party in both the National and State Houses of Assembly.\n\nNow tell me which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau) e.t.c. APC the great! Wu na de try woh!\n\nThe northern governors and some northern moslem elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them. But if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he\n\nshould have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\n\nProof of a possible Islamic agenda was leaked when Governor Ganduje, the \u201cKadmul Islam\u201d, gave advance notice that Tinubu had assured them he would be nominating a moslem as his running mate. For those who might not know, Governor Ganduje has a foundation called \u201cGanduje Foundation\u201d which purpose according to its website is to \u201cprovide selfless service to humanity and Islam\u201d but whose primary purpose it appears is the conversion of Christians to Islam.\n\nSo if my very good friend Tinubu in a desperate bid to become President allows himself to made into a religious bigot or even a mujahideen, he is welcome. But it is a risk that will not play out positively for his presidential bid. But, were he to win and become President of Nigeria, it will be as a sectional President; an Islamic President. And he will surely face\n\nmassive discontent and opposition even before taking off.\n\nExpecting Nigerians to ignore this crass insensitivity to the country\u2019s diversity amounts to acceding to the perpetration of very grave injustice and discrimination against a huge segment of the society. No one who seeks to be president of Nigeria should ever deploy the tool of religious extremism and exclusivism as a tool to win elections. This is very very\n\ndangerous. And this is very sad.\n\nBut, baring any last minute change of mind, Bola has made his choice. He should be bluntly told that in this choice Nigerian Christians clearly see a pending Islamic Republic\n\nof Nigeria in its infancy and are right to be severely anxious. There is gloom among the Christian community all over the country since Tinubu announced Kashim Shetima as his running mate. Are the generality of the moslem ummah happy with this? The answer is a resounding NO.\n\nHow then do we respond? The decision as to how to respond to this deliberately senseless act of provocation is both corporate to each religious group and also personal to each voter that love peace, and hate injustice. Christians want to continue to leave peacefully with their moslem neighbors at home, at school, at the work place, in the markets and on the streets as we have always done or desired to do. And I am sure Moslems share this view too. No one person\u2019s ambition to rule over us should be allowed\n\nto set us apart and at war with one another.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu, should be compelled upon by whoever can do so to rescind this decision. President Mohammed Buhari should exercise his powers as the Commander-inChief and as the APC Leader to revoke this nomination of a VP by Tinubu. The APC National Chairman should refuse to sign the nomination forms if not rescinded.\n\nThere is a story in the bible on how some people responded to similar provocation: \u201cAnd when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king,\n\n\u201cWhat portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.\u201d So Israel went to their tents\u201d (1 Kings 12:16).\n\nI will love for Bola to be our next President. But I am afraid a Moslem-Moslem ticket will be \u201cDead on Arrival\u201d. And the arrival date according to INEC\u2019s election time table is 25th February, 2023. This ticket will drag down the whole APC members to the pit. We all should reject it.\n\nEngr. Babachir Lawal",

          "text": "British DJ Tim Westwood is facing allegations from a woman who says he first had sex with her when she was 14 and he was in his 30s.\n\nThe woman claims Westwood had sex with her on several occasions in the early 1990s, when the age of consent in England and Wales was, as it is now, 16. \u201cI sit here today and face what I\u2019ve been running from for a long time,\u201d she said.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nHer testimony forms part of a joint Guardian/BBC investigation that will raise fresh questions over the behaviour of the former Radio 1 DJ.\n\nThe woman, and several others, spoke to the Guardian and BBC after the news organisations published a story in April in which Westwood was accused of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour.\n\nThey make new allegations relating to separate incidents of alleged abuse, misconduct and inappropriate behaviour that date from 1990 to 2020.\n\nThe Guardian put all of the allegations to Westwood, who is now 64. He did not respond.\n\nHe strenuously denied the allegations of the seven women who featured in the original investigation in April.\n\nLawyers acting for Westwood said at the time that he was a well-respected and highly successful DJ. They said he denied in their entirety the serious allegations being made against him, saying they were false and defamatory, and he wanted to make clear that he did not behave in the manner described.\n\nIn 2020, Westwood said claims of inappropriate behaviour made against him at the time on social media were fabricated, false and without foundation.\n\nIn a statement, he said: \u201cI can categorically say that I have never had an inappropriate relationship with anyone under the age of 18.\u201d\n\nFour women who have decided to tell their stories after the first investigation say they were under 18 when the incidents they allege happened. A further six women say they were young adults at the time.\n\nThe woman who alleges she was 14 when the DJ first had sex with her describes herself as having been a vulnerable teenager, and says she had wanted to put the experience \u201cin a box and throw away the key\u201d. After hearing the testimony of others, she says, she felt compelled to tell her own story.\n\nNow in her 40s, she says she wants women with similar stories to feel less alone. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t their fault, they\u2019re not to blame that they got taken advantage of and there\u2019s no shame in any of that. None whatever,\u201d she said.\n\nA second woman says she was 16 in 1997 when when Westwood started a sexual relationship with her that she alleges was unhealthy and controlling.\n\nTwo other women accuse Westwood of sexually assaulting them when they were in their mid-teens. One says she was 15 and working for Westwood\u2019s promotional \u201cstreet team\u201d in 1999 when he kissed her, while another alleges she was in year 9 at school when the DJ grabbed her breasts at an under-18s club night he was performing at in 2006.\n\nA further woman alleges she was 20 when the DJ forced his penis into her mouth as she resisted in 2012. This appears to constitute a serious sexual offence.\n\nOther women say they experienced predatory sexual encounters when they were young adults. One woman who worked for the DJ when she was 18 in 2003 alleges that he took advantage of his position as her boss and a much older man to have sex with her. Another described two sexual encounters with the DJ after they met in 2019 as \u201cuncomfortable\u201d, because she was 19 and the DJ was in his 60s and older than her parents.\n\nFour further women allege other inappropriate encounters.\n\nAside from two friends, the 10 women are not known to each other and have never met. None of the women \u2013 who are all black \u2013 reported their interactions to the police. All but one have asked to remain anonymous and have been given pseudonyms.\n\nOne of the women said she thought racial discrimination meant that black girls and young women were too often treated like sexualised adults instead of children and young people.\n\nWestwood has been one of the best-known names in hip-hop and rap in the UK for the past 40 years. He began hosting BBC Radio 1\u2019s first rap show in 1994, welcoming the biggest rappers in the world \u2013 from Public Enemy to Jay-Z \u2013 on to his show.\n\nHe has courted a degree of controversy. In 1999, he was injured in a drive-by shooting, with one bullet going through his arm and another through a seat of the car he was in.\n\nAfter almost 20 years Westwood left the BBC in 2013. He moved to Capital Xtra, but after allegations against him surfaced in April his employer Global said he was stepping down from the show \u201cuntil further notice\u201d.\n\nLast week, the BBC/Guardian investigation revealed that the corporation was reviewing six complaints against Westwood, having previously said it had no records of any complaints. On Tuesday, it said it would publish an internal investigation into the allegations within the next two weeks.\n\nA spokesperson for Westwood said in April that there had been no official or unofficial complaints against him in his career.\n\nThe women\n\nEsther\n\nEsther* says she met Westwood in 1990, when as a hip-hop-loving 14-year-old she would go to the Arch nightclub in Vauxhall, south London. She says she and her friends became regulars and the DJ would let them in for free. She recalls him asking her age. \u201cI said \u2018I\u2019m 14\u2019 and he didn\u2019t look shocked or anything,\u201d she says. He said it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if she continued coming to the nights, she says.\n\nShe says he asked for her number, saying he would leave her name on the door. He called and asked her to meet him, she says, and she recalls being picked up from Hammersmith station and being taken to a flat. She says he got her a drink of juice, they talked and then he kissed her.\n\n\u201cI was like, OK, I don\u2019t have a problem with that. And then it progressed from there,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had sex.\u201d In England and Wales the age of sexual consent is 16.\n\nLooking back, Esther says she didn\u2019t feel she had the power to say no. At the time she thought it was \u201cnormal\u201d. \u201cI was a bit of a troubled teen \u2026 I just went through with it, basically,\u201d she says.\n\nShe says this happened several times, and the DJ would call her on her home landline after her mum left for a nightshift and arrange to meet her for sex, which she says felt like a \u201cdirty little secret\u201d.\n\n\u201cI kind of thought it was normal but that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t understand the gravity of the situation. It wasn\u2019t a relationship and it wasn\u2019t about love, it was just a thing, and a thing you couldn\u2019t discuss with anybody.\u201d\n\nWhen she was 16, she says, she started a relationship and subsequently cut contact with the DJ. Her ex-boyfriend has told the BBC that Esther told him about her alleged sexual encounters with Westwood when they started going out.\n\n\u201cI think when I got to the age where I knew it was wrong and I stopped, even though I\u2019d stopped \u2026 there\u2019s still a label that hung over you,\u201d Esther says. \u201cIf you thought about even addressing it, you know, you\u2019re scared \u2013 who\u2019s gonna believe you, who\u2019s gonna be on your side?\u201d\n\nShe says it feels like the DJ groomed her, and describes Westwood as a \u201cpredator\u201d and herself as his \u201cprey\u201d.\n\nShe says keeping this secret had a huge impact on her \u2013 she tried to kill herself three times. She decided to contact the BBC after seeing the documentary Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power on BBC Three.\n\nAsked how she feels now about her experience, she says: \u201cDisgusted. Angry. Upset. Dirty. Yeah, dirty. I wish I could pretend it never happened but it did.\u201d\n\nLydia\n\nLydia* says she was 16 and at sixth-form college in London in 1997 when she met Westwood at a club in Streatham. She says Westwood, then in his early 40s, asked for her number and called her the next day. \u201cI suppose when you\u2019re 16 and a half it all seemed really exciting,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had sex and things pretty much moved on from there.\u201d\n\nShe alleges she was in a sexual relationship with him for about 18 months. She says she was vulnerable and living on her own at the time and he knew she was under the age of 18 because she was at sixth-form college and he encouraged her to go to university.\n\nShe says she felt Westwood became controlling and claims he would ask for the code for her landline voicemails to listen to her messages, would comment on what she was wearing and would turn up unannounced.\n\nShe says he would take her with him when he travelled to other cities to DJ. \u201cThere was quite a lot of disruptions to my education,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd at the time I didn\u2019t feel like I could say no.\u201d\n\nShe says she would often go to the BBC, where Westwood started his rap show in 1994. A BBC spokesperson said that in 1997 it was standard procedure for people working in BBC buildings to sign in guests, and that the broadcaster introduced a regularly updated child protection and safeguarding policy in 2004 and a visitor policy in 2010.\n\nA spokesperson said: \u201cToday, the BBC\u2019s safeguarding arrangements have never been stronger and are regularly updated in line with best practice. Where under-18s are permitted access to BBC premises, under our safeguarding policy they will always be accompanied by a chaperone and are never left alone.\u201d\n\nLydia says that by the end of the relationship her mental health had deteriorated to the extent that she tried to take her own life. \u201cI was quite depressed, I wasn\u2019t spending any time really with my friends by then. Most of the time I\u2019d spend with him.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cI feel really sad for that 16-year-old girl. I feel I was very naive. I was just swept up by the whole thing \u2026 I wish the adults who were around him \u2026 had stepped in to do something because by the time the relationship had ended I was 18 years old, but I wasn\u2019t 18 when I met him and I was very vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHer brother has told the BBC that he confronted Westwood because he was angry about the relationship, while another friend has said she remembers the mental impact it had on Lydia.\n\nLydia says she wanted to tell her story after Westwood \u201ccategorically denied\u201d having any inappropriate relationships with anyone under the age of 18 in 2020. \u201cAt that point I thought: actually, that\u2019s a lie,\u201d she says. \u201cI was certainly under the age of 18 when he met me.\u201d\n\nLydia says she had believed Westwood was in his 20s, until she saw his passport. \u201cI opened it and \u2026 he was born in 1957 and I thought: oh, that\u2019s almost as old as my mother. And that was shocking. I felt really sick.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cHe didn\u2019t force me to have sex with him, it was by choice, but it didn\u2019t feel like a healthy sexual relationship because he was a grown man and I was a teenager.\u201d\n\nPaige\n\nPaige was in year 9 at school, aged 13 or 14, when she says she met the DJ in 2006. She had gone to an under-18s night at a nightclub in Cardiff where Westwood was playing.\n\nShe remembers the night being a \u201cschool disco\u201d night with everyone dressing up in uniforms. Paige says she won a dance competition and was told to go to the DJ booth. She says that when she asked Westwood to sign her shirt, he grabbed her breasts.\n\n\u201cHe, like, grabbed my boobs from underneath and went: \u2018Whoa, look at these!\u2019 and just continued to sign my shirt,\u201d she says.\n\nShe feels this sort of experience is common among black girls who are treated as adults despite their age. \u201cYoung black women are hyper-sexualised from a very young age. We\u2019re so used to it,\u201d she says.\n\nPaige\u2019s mum said she recalled picking up her daughter up from the club that night, and told the BBC that Paige told her about the alleged grope a few years later.\n\nEmma\n\nEmma* says she met Westwood when she joined his promotional \u201cstreet team\u201d in 1999, when she was 15. She was a huge hip-hop fan and would hand out flyers on nights that the DJ was playing, and work backstage.\n\nShe says that when Westwood asked her to hang out she didn\u2019t think it was a romantic proposition. \u201cHe\u2019s like an older guy, so just asexual to me in a way,\u201d she says. She says she remembers being picked up from her London home and the DJ saying he wanted to stop by his flat. They went inside and listened to music but the atmosphere changed and she started to feel anxious, she says.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel safe already and I was like I don\u2019t want anything else to happen, like I need to get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nShe says she made excuses to go home, and claims that when they were in the car he leaned to kiss her. \u201cHe leans [in] very fast, like he\u2019s talking to me. And then he sticks his tongue down my throat,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember \u2026 pursing my lips, trying to bring them together as tight as possible. [I] tried to be just non-sexual.\u201d\n\nShe told him she was only interested in working with him and needed to get home, she says. \u201cHe was in a strop. He just got quiet. It was the injured ego of the man, and you learn it very early on not to bruise that ego.\u201d\n\nShe says he dropped her off and she was not called on to work on the street team again.\n\nSophie\n\nSophie* was 18 and at college when she started working on Westwood\u2019s street team in 2003.\n\nShe says people would drink together after his show. One night she says he offered to take her home, but instead drove her to a flat and \u201cthings did happen\u201d. She says: \u201c[He] didn\u2019t, like, force me down and hold me down to do things; however, things happened that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with.\u201d\n\nSophie says her memories are fragmented, but she alleges that sex happened and that she wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. \u201cI even question myself: why did I go there? Because I\u2019m not the kind of person to go to a person\u2019s house. But at the same time, maybe because I worked for him. Maybe because I was intoxicated as well \u2026 I was young.\u201d\n\nShe says it seems obvious to her now that it was an abuse of power. Afterwards, she says, he dropped her off home \u201clike nothing had happened\u201d. She says she didn\u2019t work for him again.\n\nTalia\n\nTalia* says she was 20 when she met Westwood at the Oceana nightclub in Nottingham in 2012. She says the DJ pointed her out to his bodyguard, who came over and asked her to wait behind.\n\nShe says she and her friend were planning to go back to their university halls, and the DJ offered to drop them off. The plan changed and his driver drove back to the hotel the DJ was staying at, she has told the BBC.\n\n\u201cMaybe this was just me being naive,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause [my friend] and I thought it was just gonna be a chat and that would be it and, you know, I\u2019d go back to halls.\u201d\n\nTalia says she went to his hotel room alone and they talked briefly and then he kissed her. She says she was \u201cOK with\u201d this, but she says that very quickly he got naked and she started to feel uncomfortable, and she says she told him she didn\u2019t want to \u201cdo anything like that\u201d.\n\n\u201cI kept saying: \u2018No, you know we\u2019ve just met, let\u2019s just talk,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThen obviously the struggle started and I kept saying no.\u201d\n\nShe says he was then straddling her on the bed and was trying to get her to give him oral sex. She alleges her legs were pinned between his and he was holding one of her hands.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking: ah God, this can\u2019t be happening. Here is this tall man like just towering over me and I just felt, you know, caged, like I couldn\u2019t get out. And I was saying no. So I felt really, like, really powerless, I\u2019d say, in that moment.\u201d\n\nTalia remembers repeatedly saying no, and she alleges Westwood pushed his penis into her mouth. She says she said \u201cno, just let me go\u201d and shuffled from under him, grabbed her belongings and left.\n\n\u201cI was quite disturbed by the whole thing,\u201d she says. \u201cLooking back I just feel used and I feel disgusted in a way. I just feel like it\u2019s quite demeaning.\u201d\n\nShe says she thought of going to the police but she didn\u2019t think her complaint would be taken seriously. \u201cThe police would think, well, it was a night out, you\u2019re 20 years old, and they just wouldn\u2019t have taken it any further.\u201d\n\nTatiana\n\nTalia\u2019s friend Tatiana* has told the BBC she remembers the night in Nottingham in 2012 and going to the hotel. A month or two later, she says, she saw Westwood again in Nottingham. She says she mentioned Talia and was shocked when he said he didn\u2019t remember her. \u201c[He] said: \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t remember,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI was like: huh? How? Why don\u2019t you remember her?\u201d\n\nShe claims he then touched her bottom. \u201cI turned around to look and he acted like it wasn\u2019t him. But it was me and him and my two girls there. He was acting like nothing happened. I was in shock,\u201d she says.\n\nOther women have alleged to the BBC that the DJ groped or behaved inappropriately with them. Isla* says she met Westwood in August 2017 at Boxpark in Croydon, and alleges he rubbed his genitals on her behind. Josie* says she met Westwood in the summer of 2018, when she was 22, and that after she gave him her number he \u201cpestered her\u201d to come to his house and attempted to flash her on a FaceTime call before she hung up. She says he messaged afterwards to say he was sorry and that he had been joking.\n\nThe most recent allegation dates to 2020. Elizabeth* says she met Westwood in a nightclub in East Sussex in 2019 and that over the course of 2020 they had two sexual encounters, which she says were \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. She says she felt under pressure to drink, and notes that the DJ was older than her parents. She alleges that when she told Westwood she was about to turn 20, he replied: \u201cI wish I\u2019d had more time to fuck you when you were a teenager.\u201d\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nHip Hop\u2019s Open Secret: Tim Westwood airs on BBC Three at 10pm on Wednesday 13 July and will be on iPlayer.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed reaffirmed the federal government\u2019s commitment towards recovering the nation\u2019s stolen artefacts across the country.\n\nMohammed also revealed that the country recently signed an agreement for the repatriation of 1,130 Benin bronzes from Berlin in Germany.\n\nThe minister who disclosed this recently during the opening of The Art Hotel in Lagos, said the bronzes were looted from the ancient city of Benin in 1897, which was 125 years ago.\n\n\u201cLet me restate our commitment to recovering our priceless works of art which were looted from our country. Our efforts in this regard have started to yield fruits.\n\n\u201cLast week, in Berlin, Germany, we signed the agreement for the repatriation of 1,130 Benin bronzes which were looted from the ancient city of Benin kingdom in 1897.\n\n\u201cThis number represents the single largest repatriation of looted works of art anywhere in the world. There is no doubt that the return of the most coveted Benin bronzes to Nigeria will help to stimulate domestic tourism in our country,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed, however urged investors to work on promoting Nigerian as the choice destination for investors.\n\nHe said the new hotel, which attempts to promote Nigerian arts and crafts, accommodates a gallery with an extensive display of diverse Nigerian arts for public viewing in celebration of Nigeria\u2019s rich and vibrant culture.\n\n\u201cThe Art Hotel brand is a new offering associated with art, style, culture, sophistication and contemporary creativity that promises quality service and genuine guest experiences to deliver customer satisfaction in a distinctive environment.\n\n\u201cThis project had been strategically crafted to showcase our unique art, innovativeness and creative works. The choice of Lagos for siting this hotel is strategic, Lagos is Nigeria\u2019s economic hub where opportunities for expression abound and new stories of success and achievements unfold every day.\n\n\u201cStakeholders are also invited to package and promote Nigeria\u2019s destinations, goods and services. This will create direct and indirect employment through tourism, grow the economy, increase the national GDP, position Nigeria as an all year-round tourism destination and establish a worthwhile, acceptable and recognisable image of the country among tourists and travelers,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso Mohammed commended the owners and sponsors of the hotel for the huge investment in the project, saying it revealed a deep understanding of the role of arts and culture on nation building.\n\n\u201cThe domestic tourism industry in Nigeria has enormous growth potential with huge possibilities for bringing in Foreign Direct Investments, infrastructural development, tourism asset development and the creation of local, national and international awareness for our tourism assets.\n\n\u201cThe sustainable development of this industry will preserve our tangible and intangible tourism assets, support tourism stakeholders and celebrate our cultural diversity, tourism assets and destinations. Overall, our vision is to promote best practices in the tourism industry that will ensure its sustainability and make Nigeria a globally-accepted and acclaimed destination for all manners of visitors.\u201d\n\nDeputy-Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, said the government would continue to bridge the infrastructural gap in the state to support the private sector.\n\n\u201cGrowing Lagos is a partnership between the government and private sector. The state investment in building key road infrastructure within the location is to support businesses,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oniru of Iru land in Lagos, Oba Gbolahan Lawal, stressed that value would be consistently added to the property and every other property within the area.\n\nHe thanked the hoteliers for leveraging the infrastructure the state government and his predecessors had put in place in the area.\n\n\u201cThis is a beautiful edifice. I am happy to be the monarch on the throne today, I love arts and architecture. I have not seen anything like this in this area. I hereby commend the architect and builder. It is a beautiful hotel and I recommend it to everyone,\u201d he said.\n\nArts Hotel CEO, Tunji Abdul said: \u201cWe must stay loyal to Nigeria and believe that businesses can survive once you are resolute and determined to succeed in the country.\n\n\u201cThe past seven years was not easy, but we positioned ourselves to meet the demands of all art lovers and are certain that the industry will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nAlso the General Manager of the Art Hotel, Mr. Roderick Peck said the hotel would serve individuals with excellence and style \u201cas fantastic menu would always be available.\u201d\n\nOluchi Chibuzor",
