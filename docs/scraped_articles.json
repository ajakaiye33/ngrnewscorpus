          "title": "Vaginal hygiene: Adding cleanliness to beauty",
          "text": "It is the desire of every woman to have a clean vagina all year round because it adds to their allure, comeliness, sexiness, and self-confidence, so some women invest benightedly in a variety of vaginal hygiene products to achieve this. This is because many of them are oblivious or incurious about the vagina being a self-cleansing organ.\n\nThough there is a gamut of products purportedly said to be vaginal cleansing, but the fact is that it is unnecessary to go beyond the ordinary to achieve proper vaginal and even vulva care. But it is mandatory that any woman should meticulously monitor and maintain the healthiness and cleanliness of their vulva and vagina at all times.\n\nTo start with, the vulva is the outermost part of the female genitalia. It includes the opening of the vagina (vestibule) as well as that of the urethra, also the clitoris, the inner lips (labia minora), and the outer lips (labia majora). The vagina, on the other hand, is what connects the vulva to the cervix and ultimately to the uterus, it is the vagina that forms the canal for the passage of menstrual blood during menstruation and a baby/babies during childbirth.\n\nAs ludicrous as it may sound, the cleaning of the vulva and vaginal is a simple task that involves the use of the fingers (not a sponge etc.) to wash the vulva using either cold or lukewarm water (soap is optional but only gentle soap if soap must be used).\n\nNaturally, the vagina cleanses itself by producing some discharges, so there is no extra need to wash the vagina after washing the vulva. This is necessary so as not to end up altering the delicate pH balance of the vagina, which if done may lead to irritation and infection of the vagina and even of the vulva.\n\nThe vaginal canal, aside from self-cleaning itself, is also lined with mucous membrane and some bacteria known as the vaginal microbiome. These are both responsible for the protection of the vagina from infections. More specifically, it is the lactobacilli in the vaginal microbiome that maintain the ideal pH balance that discourage the growth of the bacteria capable of causing vaginal infections.\n\nThe use of vaginal hygiene products claiming to clean, freshen and balance the vagina are rather deleterious than achieving those unfounded claims that their manufacturers market them as having. Just imagine why there are no penile hygiene products, are men God\u2019s special creations?\n\nHence, products like vaginal washes, wipes, deodorants and douches are unnecessary and are the reason why some women, especially those that indulge in the practice of vaginal douching, are always having vaginal infections. Additionally, these products also hinder the God-given ability of the vaginal to clean itself.\n\nIt is not out of a place for a vagina to have an odor even when clean. This odor, though never as comely as in a rose garden but is characteristic of a normal vagina, albeit, there is no unique vaginal smell since vaginal smell changes with each stage of the menstrual cycle. This is because the vagina\u2019s bacterial make-up changes in response to pH and hormones. Hence, a vagina smells stronger during the ovulation period, when there is more cervical mucus produced, than during any other stage of the menstrual cycle.\n\nThe odor of a vagina may also be from the use of some certain contraceptives such as the combined contraceptive pill. Sperm (semen) coming in contact with the vagina may also alter vaginal smell because of the alkaline pH of the semen alters the pH of the vagina. Also, like the armpit having a pungent smell after sweating, sweat can also make the crotch smells pungently. Thus, it is only when the vagina is infected that the way it smells should become worrisome and medical help sought.\n\nIn conclusion, it is good to also point out that vaginal hygiene also encompasses some things to always remember. Remember! Change tampons every four hours.\n\nRemember!! Always wipe from front to back after going to the bathroom.\n\nRemember!!! Nothing that goes near the anus should ever come into contact with the vagina.\n\nRemember!!!! Urinate immediately after sex to prevent urinary tract infections.\n\nRemember!!!!! Always wear cotton underwear to prevent warm and damp conditions that are ideal for bacteria growth.\n\nRemember!!!!!! Avoid wearing sweaty clothes for too long.\n\nRemember!!!!!!! Always seek medical professionals\u2019 help when the vaginal infection is suspected.",

          "title": "Osun governorship poll should be free, fair",
          "text": "AS arrangements for the Osun governorship election scheduled for July 16 peak, all eyes are on the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure a credible and peaceful balloting. The commission had previously conducted similar off-season polls in Anambra, Edo, Ondo and Ekiti states. The Osun ballot will once again demonstrate the level of INEC\u2019s preparedness and capability for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThankfully, the Bimodal Verification Accreditation System deployed by INEC seems to have worked more efficiently during the recently held Ekiti election in June, as observed by the British High Commission and other election observers, unlike in Edo, Ondo, and Anambra states. However, the commission needs to improve on its logistics and perfect its IT tools. It also needs to strengthen its collaboration with the security agencies to ensure hitch-free voting.\n\nThe Ekiti election revealed a new and unprecedented level of vote-buying. How to prevent this in Osun, as well as the usual incidents of violence, ballot-box snatching and vote-rigging, should be key aspects of the strategies INEC and the police and other security agencies should work out.\n\nOf the \u201cfour key elements\u201d of democracy identified by the celebrated American political scientist, Larry Diamond\u2014free and fair elections, active citizen participation, human rights, and the rule of law\u2014it is the first, said USAID, that advances democratisation and encourages political liberalisation. Flawed elections alienate the people and delegitimise a government. INEC and the police have a duty to ensure free and fair elections on Saturday and beyond.\n\nThe Ekiti election was characterised by brazen and outrageous vote-buying and other electoral malpractices, putting to question the legitimacy of the entire process. The National Chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council, Yabagi Sani, stated, \u201cIt is obvious that the voters who sold their ballots for a mess of electoral porridge have inadvertently mortgaged their future for the next four years.\u201d\n\nVote-trading and other electoral malpractices compromise elections in Nigeria and deny the country of the most capable hands in public offices. A study by Open Democracy in 2016 found that \u201cnearly 80 per cent of voters from 36 African countries believe voters are bribed \u2013 sometimes, often, or always. Furthermore, 16 per cent of voters in African countries reported being offered money or goods in exchange for their vote.\u201d Monetisation of votes should have no place in a democracy.\n\nFor the people of Osun, their future lies in their own hands. They should not, like many voters in Ekiti did, sell their votes and consciences for measly lucre, or be enticed by bags of rice, and other edibles that cannot feed them for even a month. Doing so, they would thereafter have to endure poor governance for another four years. Voting decisions should be hinged only on the issues that affect the lives and well-being of the electorate and the perceived competence of candidates, not transient and paltry pecuniary gains.\n\nDuring the pre-election debate organised by Channels Television, the issues of security, education, and economic progress in the state were highlighted. The candidates made a divergent range of promises and intended policies, which call for much introspection from the electorate, as these will determine their future prospects. These should be the basis of choosing.\n\nThe police must prevent violence. Already, inter-party and intra-party rivalry in the state has witnessed multiple incidents of violence. This must not spill over into the polling. For too long, Nigeria\u2019s elections have been marred by violence. INEC has recorded over 41 attacks carried out against its offices across 14 states since the 2019 general elections. The human cost has been higher. INEC said no fewer than 1,149 persons, including electoral officers, police officers, and voters, were killed between 2011 and 2019 during post-election violence in various parts of the country.\n\nMajor political parties in Osun have been trading mutual allegations of planned violence. The police should take proactive measures, deploy their intelligence-gathering machinery and apprehend anyone plotting mayhem. They should beam their searchlight on leaders of the transport unions who have become the major perpetrators of political and electoral violence in the South-West. They and their sponsors should be ruthlessly dealt with.\n\nThe umpire and the security agencies should collaborate to ensure that electoral offenders are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. This will send a strong message to others that the 2023 elections will not be business as usual.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, has ordered the deployment of the supervisory Deputy Inspector-General for the South-West, Johnson Kokumo, four Assistant IGPs, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police for the election. They should also provide adequate security and aerial surveillance for the electorate via helicopters and aerial vehicles to prevent ballot box snatching, harassment of voters, attacks on electoral officials, INEC employees, and destruction of the commission\u2019s assets. Security agencies should ensure that the Osun election is peaceful and credible.\n\nThe police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission should apprehend the party foot-soldiers who distribute money, or make promises of the same at polling areas and punish the act when it occurs. The EFCC reportedly arrested some suspects who engaged in vote-buying during the Ekiti governorship poll. This is commendable. They should be prosecuted. Law enforcement agencies should go after those ferrying huge sums of money around on Election Day in violation of extant anti-money laundering laws no matter their political or social status.\n\nWith the sensitive nature of the Osun election, political party leaders should rein in their followers to ensure that there is peace and ensure that no one is induced, threatened, or lured to vote against their conscience. The registered voters should troop out to vote in exercise of their basic right. They also have a civic duty to choose their own leaders and thereby enthrone responsive and accountable governance. Their destiny is in their hands, they should vote wisely.",

          "title": "GLOBAL HEALTH: WHO calls for equitable expansion of genomics",
          "text": "By Chioma Obinna\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organisation, WHO\u2019s Science Council of experts, has called for equitable expansion of genomics for global health, arguing that, it is not justifiable ethically or scientifically for less-resourced countries to gain access to such technologies long after rich countries do.\n\n\n\nMaking the call in its first report on accelerating access to genomics for global health explained that the field of genomics uses methods from biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology to understand and use biological information in DNA and RNA, with benefits for medicine and public health \u2013 especially during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 as well as agriculture, biological research and more.\n\n\n\nThe report called for expanding access to genomic technologies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), by addressing shortfalls in financing, laboratory infrastructure, materials, and highly trained personnel.\n\n\n\nWhile the costs of establishing and expanding genomic technologies are declining making it increasingly feasible for all countries to pursue they can and should be further lowered.\n\n\u201cA range of tools to make genomic technologies more affordable for LMICs have been developed, including tiered pricing; sharing of intellectual property rights for low-cost versions; and cross-subsidisation, whereby profits in one area are used to fund another.\n\n\n\nSpeaking, WHO Chief Scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan said: \u201cGenomic technologies are driving some of the most ground-breaking research happening today. Yet the benefits of these tools will not be fully realised unless they are deployed worldwide. Only through equity can science reach its full potential impact and improve health for everyone, everywhere.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough convening and coordinating the world\u2019s leading minds, as we do through our Science Council, WHO acts as a global engine for analysis to address the world\u2019s most pressing health challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Science Council established in April 2021 by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus comprised of nine leading scientists and public health experts from around the world was to advise him on high-priority issues and advances in science and technology that could directly improve global health.\n\n\n\nThe Science Council identified genomics as the focus of its first study, given the significant implications for public health; its many successful uses in confronting infectious diseases, cancers, and other chronic diseases; and the new opportunities for implementing expensive technologies, even in LMICs.\n\n\n\nThe Council\u2019s Chair, Professor Harold Varmus, a Nobel Laureate and former Director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health said: \u201cIt is already clear that genomics can make enormous contributions to human health, from surveying populations for infectious agents, such as the virus that causes COVID-19, to predicting and treating a wide variety of diseases, such as cancers and developmental disorders. Attention to equity in deploying these technologies is essential for achieving the immense potential benefits to human health.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo promote the adoption or expanded use of genomics, the report\u2019s recommendations address four themes: advocacy, implementation, collaboration, and associated ethical, legal and social issues:\n\nAdvocacy for genomics is needed to persuade governments, as well as commercial and non-commercial organizations, academic institutions, and others, of the medical, scientific, and economic benefits of genomic technologies.\n\n\n\nOvercoming obstacles to implementation will require local planning, financing, expanded training of essential personnel, and the low-cost provision of instruments, materials, and computational infrastructure.\n\n\n\nGovernment ministries, funding agencies, and scientific organizations in academia and industry should collaborate to establish plans on how to use genomics and build and expand technical capacity. They should also look to pool resources through regional programmes if appropriate.\n\n\n\nEffective oversight \u2013 coupled with national and international rules and standards \u2013 is key to promoting ethical, legal, equitable use and responsible sharing of information obtained with genomic methods.\n\n\n\nTo take forward the recommendations and to monitor their applications across all four main areas, the report also recommends WHO create a Genomics Committee. A key responsibility proposed for the Genomics Committee is convening commercial organizations to develop and implement ways of making their products and technologies affordable in LMICs.\n\n\n\nThe report follows the release of WHO\u2019s 10-year strategy for genomic surveillance of pathogens.\n\n\n\nGenomic surveillance has played a crucial role in the global COVID-19 response, with countries like South Africa able to make crucial contributions in detecting variants, due to their capacities in this area. Recent data from WHO shows that the percentage of countries able to conduct genomic surveillance increased from 54% to 68% between March 2021 and January 2022, due to major investments made during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

After the 4th week, there is likelihood of escalation of this strike to magnitude of affecting health services adversely in Abia State. A stitch in time saves nine.\u201d\n\nHe noted, however, that Government had paid four months instead of six months bulk payment it had earlier agreed to pay for doctors in ABSUTH, but nothing had been done for those in HMB.\n\nOkwuonu said Government was also not forthcoming on payment of arrears of two months every month till the backlog was cleared, explaining that up till July 11, nothing has been paid to the affected doctors for the month of June.\n\nThe NMA boss decried the condition of health sector in the state and pleaded with the state Government to save the sector from total collapse.\n\n\u201cService delivery, residency training, teaching of Medical Students and research have been adversely affected by epileptic and sub-optimal services in the teaching hospital.\n\n\u201d The 18 General and cottage hospitals have been grossly under performing due to poor service delivery occasioned by low morale among our colleagues in the Hospital management board. All these have adversely impacted on our health indices as a state.\n\n\u201cWith our General hospitals not functional and the teaching hospital below its usual capacity to deliver services, the Federal Medical Centre Umuahia becomes overstretched and our colleagues in those areas become over burdened with work and burn out usually set in.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our members suffer untold hardships as a good number of us have no money to pay rent, school fees , settle family issues, not to talk of feeding our parents who invested so much in training us as Doctors.\n\n\u201cA Doctor who is owed such humongous amount of money is unhappy, cannot concentrate to take good care of another person\u2019s health and is a security risk if not paid on time.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

If Nigerians elect him based on his competency and pedigree as their new president, does it concern MASSOB? It\u2019s not our business.\n\n\u201cMr Peter Obi is not the first person to contest presidential election since September 1999 we started the MASSOB non-violence self- determination struggle. Why attaching him to us now?\n\nMASSOB, therefore, advised Shiekh Gumi to explain his role and other Fulani cabals in the terrorist attack and breaking of Kuje prisons in Abuja.\n\nThe group told the Islamic cleric not to use Obi and pro-Biafra agitation to divert attentions.",

          "text": "Rebecca Ejifoma\n\nThree months after feeding about 7,250 needy families in Lagos communities, members of the Order of Knights of Saint Mulumba (KSM) VGC sub-council at the weekend defied the indecisive weather to continue their humanitarian services in the sub-council of Lekki environs and across the state.\n\nThis time, however, they fed about 3,480 needy families from all religions, tribes and the physically challenged through the Feed The Hungry (FTH) initiative.\n\nThis was part of efforts to assuage the plight of the indigent residents with necessary succour in this time of economic turbulence and fall in naira.\n\nWhile the FTH initiative is in its second phase, this is the brainchild of the Lagos Metropolitan Council of KSM that acknowledges the existence of hardship among the vulnerable residents.\n\nThe Worthy Grand Knight (WGK) VGC sub-council, Sir Tony Ukairo expressed fulfilment that the initiative met its goal in its second edition. According to him, this little show of kindness will continue to be extended to the needy quarterly.\n\n\u201cThose of us who work still know how tough it is for us and our homes much less those who are underprivileged. So we need to share with them from our little,\u201d he added.\n\nHe sees the FTH charity apostolate as apt, capable of alleviating the living status of the average Nigerian family as prices of food items continue to surge while the cost of living is unarguably depressing.\n\nEchoing the words of Ukairo, Sir Don Ezeh the Lagos Metropolitan Grand Knight (MGK) of KSM, Sir Don Ezeh, emphasised that this move is designed for the needy and the hungry.\n\nThis time, however, they dished out packs of food items including rice, noodles, tomato paste, spices, beans, and beverages, among others. These were distributed with tons of love and prayers.\n\nWhile appreciating members of the KSM for their unwavering support, Don Ezeh encouraged them to raise the gear in their monthly contributions for the course.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s plan it and push our contributions to help feed the hungry people. Let\u2019s continue to give a thought to them,\u201d he interceded.\n\nIn his address, he cheered the members further, \u201cWhen you give you are saying \u2018Thank you, Lord, for making me a giver.\u201d Adding, he charged them, \u201cDonate with prayers. Give from your heart.\u201d\n\nDon Ezeh, however, tasked the members to spread the message to other council members on the need for cheerful giving. \u201cWe are not doing this because we are rich. We are doing this to show gratitude to God.\u201d\n\nFTH is a pleasant addition to the numerous philanthropic works by the KSM. KSM lawyers in synergy with the Lagos State Government judiciary will help facilitate the release of prisoners many of whom have spent longer time on awaiting trial list, prison ministration among others, paging for exam fees of repentant inmates alongside fellowshipping with them.\n\nThis way, the KSM is giving hope to them yet again. \u201cThis is just one of the many humanitarian acts we carry out nationwide.",

          "text": "Friends and families overwhelmed Princess Elizabeth Ogunbeku with encomium as she recently joined the septuagenarian club in grandeur. Rebecca Ejifoma captures her life\u2019s journey and widowhood trajectory\n\nIt was a mini yet delightful banquet birthday party at the Sheraton Restaurant in Lagos recently. For the guests, there was no perfect time to dine, wine, and dance with the latest septuagenarian, Princess Elizabeth Ogunbeku other than now. Hence, friends and families feasted with Ogunbeku, a Princess of Ilesa kingdom and daughter of the King of Osu in Ilesa, Osun State.\n\nAmong some of her challenging moments, she recounted that despite being a widow since 1990 after the death of her husband, an inspector of education and former Permanent Secretary of Lagos State, Mr. Joseph Ogunbeku, she has countless reasons to appreciate God. \u201cGod has been gracious to me and my four children. I really thank Him because it is by his grace that I\u2019m 70,\u201d she expressed excitedly.\n\nFor the mother and grandmother of four, the journey has been worth every while. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything other than to thank God,\u201d describing the journey as good, she narrated, \u201cLet\u2019s say from 1990 till now, I\u2019ve been a widow. It has just been my four children and I. They are all graduates now\u201d.\n\nOgunbeku also admitted that she filled the vacuum in her life with total service to God while keeping up with life as an entrepreneur. \u201cI sell petty things. And I\u2019ve been doing that since 1990 just to take care of my children. It was God that saw us through all the way.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with much ebullience and fulfillment, the celebrant shared the secret to basking in good life, as she has tested and tried it. \u201cThe secret to a good life is Jesus. He has helped me. I\u2019m a worker in the church in Deeper Life Bible Church. When my husband was alive\u201d, she recounted, \u201che was an inspector of education. He was once a permanent secretary in Lagos State, which helped the children to an extent. But all things you see today are the works of God,\u201d she said with teary eyes.\n\nOn what emboldened her faith in Christ, the Princess of Ilesa land acknowledged that even before the demise of her husband, she was a staunch follower of Christ, an unapologetic born again at that. She told THISDAY that she didn\u2019t let her financial or marital status define her existence. Rather she worked tirelessly in the vineyard of God, \u201cMy source of joy today.\u201d\n\nJust like any regular individual, Ogunbeku had several times felt like throwing in the towel. However the urge to languish in her agony, she chose to go on swinging. \u201cThere were a lot of times I felt like giving up after the death of my husband but I held on to God. After his death, I became an SU Deeper Life. That really helped me. And because I\u2019m one of their women leaders in the church, they were there for me.\u201d\n\nLending a voice to other women and widows, cheerful Ogunbeku said, \u201cFollow Jesus. Only Jesus can help,\u201d she encouraged boldly. \u201cIt\u2019s not by our power or our might but by the spirit of God. It is only Jesus that helped me. Because after the death of my husband, I decided to follow Jesus to the end. Yes, I was still young when he died. Some people came for my hand in marriage, but I declined all\u201d.\n\nShe also implored women who are helpless not to depend on any man or the church, but to look on to Jesus for anything. Ogunbeku conceded, \u201cHe has been doing it for me. Any time I ask Him for something, He helps me\u201d.\n\nAmong the guests at her bash was Prince Adebusoye Adekanye, her younger brother. He couldn\u2019t contain his joy, as he chanted her praises. \u201cI\u2019m happy she\u2019s 70 today. As children we had our trials and tribulations. But look at where she is now. I\u2019m very happy I\u2019m witnessing this day in her life.\u201d\n\nAs her immediate younger brother, Adekanye reminisced about their days of yore when they tracked down their many challenges and came out stronger. \u201cWe worked in a place we suffered for some years. I\u2019m happy how far she has come. I wish her the best of luck.\u201d\n\nAmong some of the virtues of her sister, he listed gentleness, patience, peace and tolerance. \u201cThose are some of her attributes. I\u2019ll advise her children to emulate these virtues.\u201d\n\nAs more guests found their way to the reception where they were warmly welcomed, the youngest child of Ogunbeku, Morolake Ogunbeku Bello, enthused, \u201cI\u2019m thankful to God for her life.\u201d Adding, she attested to her mother\u2019s pious life.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been doing a lot since she lost her husband, my father, in 1990. \u201cShe\u2019s passionate about God and all that has to do with Him. The most important thing I\u2019ve learnt from her is putting God first. She\u2019s all about God. God is enough.\u201d\n\nAlthough just a feast to clink glasses to her life at 70, friends, loved ones and well wishers of Ogunbeku didn\u2019t let a good photo session slip by. From selfies to group photos, it was, indeed, a memorable day for the septuagenarian.",

          "text": "Ifedolapo Oseni\n\nThere is no doubt that people in the tech ecosystem have gained a growing amount of societal respect. I am talking about the young talents setting up businesses and developing resources to tackle problems within and outside their communities. These are young people defying systemic odds and charting new courses for themselves.\n\nIt is a narrative many of us can connect with, and one that we at Enyata Inc. are proud to be affiliated with.\n\nIt has been my experience as the head of Communications to understand that facilitating growth with an ecosystem goes beyond what we claim or offer. We need to ensure that we provide value in everything we do. It is the only way to guarantee the impact we set out to achieve.\n\nOur community efforts at Enyata are motivated by a desire to effect change within the country. Nigeria continues to make significant strides within and outside the continent when it comes to building technological solutions, but we still are yet to measure up when it comes to the nation\u2019s development. This mismatch has consequently affected the country\u2019s economic growth as it is reported to have grown by a measly 3.4 per cent in 2021. This is why we do what we do at Enyata.\n\nIn my time here, a host of community-led campaigns have been successfully executed.\n\nThrough Project BuildUp 2.0, we rewarded 50 software and product developers with Macbooks to enable them along their professional journeys.\n\nWe also launched an educational hub through our Slack community. There, we offer a host of resources \u2013 webinars, workshops, articles; all these and more to facilitate the growth of over 3000 members.\n\nAlongside these initiatives, we host a free annual academy programme aimed at helping tech enthusiasts launch a career within the ecosystem. Enyata Academy creates a learning environment for anyone interested in becoming a tech player. Participants in the program get mentorship from senior engineers in Enyata, as well as the chance to shadow experts working on global projects.\n\nWe are currently in the consideration stage for the 6th cohort. Through this programme, the company hopes to foster community development.\n\nOf course, Enyata\u2019s impact isn\u2019t limited to the talent community we identify with. As an organization, our strategy is woven around effort \u2013 an effort to serve, and ensure development in all we do.\n\nIn line with the company\u2019s vision, we have been able to help businesses realize their ideas by helping them develop efficient products and offering them the tools needed to build said products. Up to this point, we have built a rich portfolio of web and mobile projects by partnering with companies around the world to build effective tech solutions.\n\nEven more commendable is our catalogue of management systems designed to help businesses run their affairs more efficiently. They are Instrail (Insurance Management System), Inventory by Enyata, and the recent HRMS, all built by our Nigerian and Ghanaian teams.\n\nOur efforts are an intentional and strategic move to keep providing value and upping the ante as an organization and a growing brand. Our CEO, Dayo Oyelade, regards it as an opportunity to give back to impact lives and influence the world while providing them with the necessary resources and support.\n\nIn his words, \u201cOur priority is ensuring that we take the needed steps to guarantee future growth within and outside of our community. The plan is to ensure Enyata helps broaden the tech space beyond Africa. We want to build a world where great ideas, products, and companies come to fruition quickly whilst achieving the required impact. Our work is to facilitate the process, however we can.\u201d\n\nSo far, our efforts have impacted the lives of over 5,000 people and businesses by providing them with the opportunities, skills, tools, and insights needed to propel them forward.\n\nThe work we do at Enyata is invaluable, profound, and dare I say, commendable. We want to build a world where great ideas, products, and companies come to fruition quickly whilst achieving the required impact.\n\nOur work is to facilitate the process, however we can. Ultimately, Enyata hopes to become, not only the preferred community for exceptional engineers in Africa but the biggest tech solution provider very soon.\n\n*Oseni is the head of Brand Marketing and communications at Enyata Inc.",

          "text": "As part of his strategic wealth creation in the SMART Agenda, the Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, initiated the Women Empowerment Skill Acquisition Programme. Chiamaka Ozulumba reports that recently, 280 beneficiaries including 12 persons living with disabilities, were empowered, bringing the total number of WESAP beneficiaries to 835 so far\n\nIt was another round of applause for Delta State governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa last weekend as another set of 280 ladies graduated from the state\u2019s Women Empowerment Skill Acquisition Programme (WESAP).\n\nGiven that strategic wealth creation is the first point in Governor Okowa\u2019s phenomenal SMART agenda, the governor\u2019s smile through the course of the graduation ceremony was well understood.\n\nAs the governor said at the graduation ceremony, the various wealth creation schemes of the administration had as at June 1, 2022 led to the creation of 128,813 direct and indirect jobs in the state.\n\nBesides the strategic wealth creation schemes, an additional one million direct and indirect jobs have also been created through the various infrastructural and urban renewal projects.\n\nIt was as such no surprise that Delta State was ranked the Best State in Human Capital Development in the 2017 states per review by the National Competitiveness Council of Nigeria.\n\nAlso significantly, in 2020, Delta was adjudged Second Least Poor State by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics.\n\nFor a national economy that has been reported to record an unemployment rate of 33 per cent in the year 2022, the direct impact of the Okowa administration in lifting the citizenry from the squalor of unemployment and underemployment is receiving applause from far and near.\n\nAmong those who have noticed the impact of the administration in that wise is the\n\nAmong the 280 ladies who graduated from the WESAP programme on Friday were significantly, 12 ladies living with one disability or the other who were trained in skill acquisition at the , at the expense of the state government at the Farm Craft Centre for the blind in Isheri, Lagos.\n\nFor an administration that has not left the disabled behind, it could well be understood the impact of the administration across board.\n\nIt was in that light that Governor Okowa said that the state is working toward becoming Nigeria\u2019s centre for Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSME).\n\nOkowa said that with the creation of more than 128,813 direct, indirect jobs through the various job and wealth creation programmes of his administration, Delta would become a hub for MSMEs in the next few years.\n\nThe governor said that with sustained growth of MSMEs, the issue of unemployment would become a thing of the past because people would become employers of labour rather than job-seekers.\n\nHe commended the state Ministry of Women Affairs and all the programme management for their dedication and consistency.\n\nAccording to him, WESAP is our platform to enhance social inclusion by equipping the womenfolk with the necessary knowledge, skills, and resources to be productively engaged.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that the programme has remained steadfast to its mandate since it was inaugurated in November 2020.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Heritage Bank for their current partnership, which had infused better financial management, transparency, and accountability into the programme.\n\n\u201cToday, we are empowering 280 women, including 12 persons living with disabilities who, at the expense of the state government, underwent a six-months training in arts and craft at the Farm Craft Centre for the blind in Isheri, Lagos.\n\nAccording to him, today\u2019s graduates bring the total number of WESAP beneficiaries to 835.\n\n\u201dThey have been resourced with the vocational skills to run various enterprises in fashion design, hairdressing, confectionaries, decoration, and makeover/head gear.\n\n\u201cAs of June 1, 2022, 128,813 direct and indirect jobs have been created through the various job creation, youth empowerment, and social investments delivery platforms of the administration.\n\n\u201cWhile this has impacted positively on the economy of multiplied thousands of households, I guarantee you that the maximum impact of these programmes will be felt in no distant future when Delta becomes the MSMEs hub of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo the ladies who begin their entrepreneurship journey today, it is my hope that you will follow in the footsteps of those who have gone before you and make good success of this opportunity of a lifetime.\n\n\u201cYou are among the privileged few who were enlisted in the programme from a long list of others who were equally qualified, but due to limited resources, we could only admit a limited number for now.\u201d\n\nOkowa therefore urged the beneficiaries to reciprocate the good gesture of the government by committing themselves to disciplined work ethic, prudent management, and excellent customer service.\n\n\u201cIt is now time to put to use, the knowledge you acquired in terms of personal effectiveness, sales and marketing, appropriate pricing, excellent customer service, and business management.\n\n\u201cThankfully, Heritage Bank is there to facilitate the opening of your business accounts, which will enable you to separate your personal finances from the company funds and place yourself on a monthly salary.\n\n\u201cThis will bring discipline into the running of the business, help to measure and monitor growth, as well as enforce accountability,\u201d he stated.\n\nEarlier in her welcome address, the State Commissioner for Women Affairs, Mrs Flora Alanta said the WESAP programme was established three years ago to ameliorate the economic hardship the COVID-19 pandemic unleashed on families.\n\nAlanta said that an empowered woman remained the bedrock for the economic emancipation of families adding that the future of families depended on the economic empowerment of women.\n\nShe noted that women needed to have skills that would earn them a living, adding that 280 women including 12 persons with disabilities were among the beneficiaries.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Heritage Bank Group Head of Edo/Delta region, Mr Charles Ojakovo lauded Okowa for his unparalleled passion for the growth of SMEs as a way to rescuing Nigerians form hunger and poverty.\n\nHe pledged the partnership of the bank to the job and wealth creation programmes of the state government.\n\nMeanwhile, the Niger Delta Peace Initiative, a group that has identified with the political aspirations of the governor has urged the governor to take his job creation formula to Abuja.\n\nThe group reacted in a statement issued on Tuesday, by its national coordinator, Emma Ekpe.\n\nNPDI while commending Governor Okowa on his job creation schemes urged him to as a matter of urgency to carry the job creation formula to Abuja for the benefit of the nation as vice-president.\n\n\u201cWe are proud of the latest graduation of 280 trainees under the Empowerment Skill Acquisition Programme (WESAP).\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable that such a scheme is coming out from Delta State and we can only pray that Governor Okowa should export the same scheme to Abuja to be replicated at the national level.\n\nContinuing, the group while noting that Okowa\u2019s job has been well cut out for him said: \u201cGovernor Okowa as vice-president will be the chairman of the National Economic Council, a platform for him to project the same successful scheme he has practiced in Delta State at the national level.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that we urge our people in the Niger Delta region and Nigerians at large to support the Atiku-Okowa project as it is the panacea to the unemployment and underemployment malaise that the nation is presently suffering.\u201d\n\nQuote\n\nWomen Empowerment Skill Acquisition Programme is our platform to enhance social inclusion by equipping the womenfolk with the necessary knowledge, skills, and resources to be productively engaged",

          "text": "The West African Examination Council (WAEC) said the abduction of over 250 schoolgirls in Chibok in April 2014 may not have occurred if the then governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima, had heeded the advice of the examination body.\n\nShettima was on Sunday announced as the running mate of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nOn April 14, 2014, the schoolgirls were abducted when insurgents attacked the Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School (GGSS) in Chibok, Borno State.\n\nThe abduction of the girls in 2014 was followed by a global outcry that birthed the #BringBackOurGirls movement.\n\nAware of the poor security situation in Borno and worried about the safety of students, WAEC had declined to conduct its Senior School Certificate Examination in unsafe parts of Borno, including Chibok.\n\nBut that was until Shettima assured of adequate security measures.\n\nAccording to the then Head of WAEC National Office in Nigeria, Charles Eguridu, the body was initially reluctant to conduct its examination in Chibok and other troubled areas of the North-East because of the security challenges.\n\nIt, however, had to buckle when Shettima assured the Council, in writing, that adequate security would be provided.\n\n\u201cFollowing the previous experience, we were afraid to go to the North-East this year, yet we risked it and asked for extra security through the Minister of Education, Nyesom Wike,\u201d the official had said.\n\n\u201cWe also asked the various state governments to relocate all the centres to the state capitals where there would be adequate security.\n\n\u201cThe three governors did not respond to our request but instead said they had made adequate security arrangements. The Borno State government also refused to relocate the students from Chibok to safer places like Maiduguri.\u201d\n\nThe WAEC official also tendered the letters written to the governors of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe to prove his claim.\n\nHe added that another factor that influenced WAEC\u2019s decision to ask that all centres be moved to the state capitals was the death of three of its staff while conducting a similar examination in a school along the Yola-Maiduguri road in 2013.\n\nThe Borno governor, who initially declined transferring the final year students from centres in remote areas like Chibok to the state capital, finally agreed to do so after the kidnap, Eguridu said.\n\n\u201cBorno State government only agreed to relocate the remaining 189 pupils after the abduction of the girls,\u201d he said.",

The Borno State government also refused to relocate the students from Chibok to safer places like Maiduguri.\u201d\n\nThe WAEC official also tendered the letters written to the governors of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe to prove his claim.\n\nHe added that another factor that influenced WAEC\u2019s decision to ask that all centres be moved to the state capitals was the death of three of its staff while conducting a similar examination in a school along the Yola-Maiduguri road in 2013.\n\nThe Borno governor, who initially declined transferring the final year students from centres in remote areas like Chibok to the state capital, finally agreed to do so after the kidnap, Eguridu said.\n\n\u201cBorno State government only agreed to relocate the remaining 189 pupils after the abduction of the girls,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Christian political leaders within the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the north say they cannot campaign for the party over the decision to field Muslims as presidential and vice-presidential candidates.\n\nOn Sunday, Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of APC, unveiled Kashim Shettima, former Borno governor, as his running mate for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe announcement has elicited mixed reactions from different groups across the country.\n\nThe Christian leaders across the 19 northern states, in a communique issued after a meeting on Monday, expressed reservations over the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs Christians within the APC, we cannot in all fairness to our consciences and faith, go to our various constituencies to campaign for a Muslim-Muslim ticket,\u201d the communique reads.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a multi-religious and a constitutional democracy and NOT a theocracy with religion as a major national fault line which cannot be whimsically manipulated without dire political consequences on our peaceful co-existence as a people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the communique, which was signed by Doknan Sheni, Ishaya Bauka and Saidu Ibrahim, the Christian APC leaders in the north said the current political atmosphere of the nation is different from what obtained in 1993 when MKO Abiola, who was a Muslim, chose another Muslim as running mate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also said the Muslim-Muslim ticket would make it hard for people to believe that the party is not pursuing an \u201cIslamisation\u201d agenda.\n\n\u201cThe selection of a Muslim running mate is a display of crass insensitivity to the complexity of modern Nigeria and the entire Church,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThat the APC has always come under the suspicion of the Church as pursuing an Islamisation agenda.

This will certainly result in a massive revolt against the party. Leadership is all about inclusiveness, justice and equity.\u201d\n\nThe group also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the matter in the interest of \u201cpeace and stability of the nation\u201d.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What to look for in a startup lawyer",
          "text": "Startups often relegate non-technology roles to the background in a bid to ship products quickly. However, these roles are often as important in the overall success of the company as the technical roles, and one such important role is that of the startup lawyer.\n\nAt the beginning of the technology boom in Africa, the standard practice was for startups to outsource their legal processes to law firms. With the increase in funding in Africa, more startups have become aware of the importance of having an in-house lawyer focused specifically on their legal needs.\n\nBeing a relatively new development, it is not far-fetched to assume that startups might not know what to look for in a startup lawyer. To identify the unique qualities a startup lawyer should have, I asked 4 lawyers what qualities startups should look for in an in-house counsel.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi is a lawyer with experience working in-house for a fintech startup and providing legal advisory for early-stage startups.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi: I think startups need to begin their questions with, \u201cDo we need an in-house lawyer or a lawyer I can reach out to when needed?\u201d I say this because, while you always need a lawyer, a couple of factors determine if you need one employed with you or if you need one on a retainer. These factors include how regulated your sector of operation is. The regulations guiding fintech and food ordering companies are very different from one another. The size and stage of your startup\u2019s growth matter as well. A startup at the ideation stage has different needs from a startup that has begun operations.\n\nYou also need to be conscious and properly assess your options when engaging a lawyer due to the nature of the role. A proper assessment cannot be understated. Like with every other kind of service, there is the tendency to have a \u201cvalue mismatch\u201d if you do not engage on the terms that fit your needs.\n\nThe first thing to look out for in a lawyer is honesty, and it is the single most important feature, to me. The reason is that a lawyer holds the life of your startup in his hands. You need a lawyer that informs you of the whole reality every time a situation comes up. Brilliance is overrated; it\u2019s the law, and there will always be a solution. You want a lawyer that can tell you, \u201cI am not sure what the position of the law on this is, allow me to run some checks.\u201d Your lawyer should be comfortable enough to tell you, \u201cThis is outside my speciality, we need to bring this person in to handle this particular part of the issue.\u201d If you find a lawyer that can be this honest with you, you are in good hands, regardless of how convoluted the legal situation might be.\n\nEmmanuel Ido is an associate at Olajide Oyewole LLP (DLA Piper Africa).\n\nEmmanuel Ido: Almost every startup is unique, from its product to its people. The role of a startup lawyer is essential to support the startup from a legal perspective such that it can function at optimum capacity. Whether the startup is pre-seed, bootstrapped or VC-funded, a good startup lawyer is crucial for its day-to-day running. Aside from the practical skills, there are a few things to look out for when hiring a lawyer for your startup.\n\nFirst, the lawyer\u2019s sector knowledge is important. When hiring a lawyer for your startup, one should consider the level of sector knowledge. This will be handy when drafting and negotiating contracts, advising the startup, and general day-to-day operations. A good startup lawyer should be well-grounded in data protection, intellectual property management, labour and employment law, corporate governance, public policy, dispute resolution, etc.\n\nAnother thing to look out for is the lawyer\u2019s sector experience. A startup lawyer must have relevant experience within the tech sector. The experience will come from doing the work. For instance, a corporate and finance lawyer who has practical experience will be suited to advising a fintech company. A quick review of their deal sheet will give you an idea of the type of lawyer they are and how suitable they will be for your startup.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s regulatory interface is also very important because it\u2019s almost impossible to operate a startup without constant regulatory interface. To this end, your lawyer should be someone with sufficient knowledge of the regulators and the relevant contacts.\n\nThe 3 categories above roughly summarise what is needed in a startup lawyer. Of course, they must have the right soft skills and are good at working in a team in a dynamic environment, as most startups are.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan is a partner at Springwoods LP.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan: The first thing that I think a startup should look for in a lawyer is transaction experience and compliance experience. This is not to say that a lawyer with experience in other fields should not be considered. However, that lawyer should be adaptable enough to learn.\n\nA startup lawyer should also be able to work in a startup environment, which is not as rigid as a law firm. The lawyer should ideally be someone that can think on their feet and be able to prioritise. It is not all conflicts that require a court sitting; some legal matters require collaboration. The lawyer should have a multi-faceted approach to legal matters.\n\nThe lawyer should also be able to maintain and build relationships with regulators and your competitors. This is very relevant. A startup lawyer should be aware of regulatory developments ahead of the public to navigate these developments smoothly. Unlike law firms, a startup can\u2019t afford a lawyer that doesn\u2019t have attention to detail.\n\nLastly, as the startup evolves so too should its legal needs evolve. An early-stage startup requires basic things like incorporation and a founder\u2019s contract. However, as you scale, the legal demands greatly increase. At this stage, the startup should liaise with its lawyer to understand the next steps to take to meet these demands.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye is a lawyer at Banwo & Ighodalo, and a writer.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye: The first thing to look out for is technical expertise. Knowledge of the law is the whole basis of a lawyer in a startup. As such, the first and most important thing is for the in-house counsel to be highly technical in the knowledge and application of law to issues arising out of your business. Also, a necessary plus is more industry-streamlined knowledge and awareness of current market solutions that are needed for that startup.\n\nPerhaps more useful for the startup than the lawyer\u2019s technical expertise is the lawyer\u2019s creativity, business savvy, and solutions-oriented outlook. The lawyer mustn\u2019t be restricted to the legal side of the startup only, as this may negatively impact some of the creative solutions that the product and engineering team may want to bring on board. It is therefore important for the founders to look out for the creative flair in the lawyer candidates they are speaking to.\n\nLastly, cultural fit is very important. While lawyers are inclined to be more regimented in their approach, working in a startup will require the flexibility of whatever candidate you are looking to scoop up into your team.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "In 2013, Patricia Pedhom Nono learnt one of the lessons of her life. Actually, she has learnt life-altering lessons more than once. And Patricia considers them absolutely necessary; after all, what would she be today without them?\n\nShe introduces herself to start our conversation and ends with \u201cfor now.\u201d This is probably because humans are dynamic by nature, but Patricia is very clear about her values and why they would never change.\n\nFaith, consistency, and hard work are a few of the virtues to note in Patricia\u2019s story. Patricia is the Transformation Director and Technology Leader at the international audit and consulting firm, PwC in sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. She feels strongly about empowering African youth and helping organisation heads understand what it takes to lead successfully.\n\nIt would be premature to put Patricia\u2019s exploits down to a privileged background without hearing of her journey.\n\nTapping into the genius inside a stubborn Patricia\n\nPatricia Pedhom Nono. Transformation Director and Technology Leader, PwC, sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nPatricia\u2019s background is both funny and impressive. I took her heads-up of \u201cI\u2019ll tell you exactly the way it is\u201d lightly until we were deep into the conversation. A few minutes in, and we are both cracking up as she shares her story. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these are critical details to note about her childhood.\n\nAn excellent place to begin is a vital trait she\u2019s had since she was a child that has fuelled her consistent professional climb.\n\n\u201cWhile growing up, I was a very stubborn kid and tried to question everything. At that stage, my mind was just bubbling to understand the environment,\u201d she recalls.\n\nAlthough her stubbornness \u2014 okay, let\u2019s call it doggedness \u2014 often got her into trouble, it had advantages like making her independent early in life. She explains how this curiosity leaves her dissatisfied with the status quo and nudges her to do things differently.\n\n\u201cThat developed a solution and challenging type of mindset that is very important if you want to grow in technology and become a leader because things are changing so fast.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, a child with such qualities could be considered difficult; however, she regards one of her privileges growing up as having understanding parents who found how to manage and help her direct her curiosity in the right direction.\n\nPatricia is from Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital, and is the only girl of four children in a middle-class home.\n\nPatricia\u2019s love for books from childhood was one of her outstanding qualities as a student. She describes herself as a brilliant, top-of-class, A-student.\n\nDuring her final year in high school, she got a scholarship to attend a two-year preparatory programme at Telecom SudParis, a top engineering school in France. Expectedly, she aced her entrance examination and was set to resume school before her life took an unexpected turn, one from which she learnt one of many lessons in her life to date.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that as an A student, an honours student, my first mark in class was 3.5 out of 20. Then I called my dad and said, \u2018Dad, you know what? I\u2019m coming back home! This is insane; I\u2019ve never had this type of mark in my life. How come I\u2019m not even reaching the average?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe probably knew she would not have it that easy because of how seriously her dad takes success.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me something that was very crucial. He said, \u2018You know what? You got the scholarship to represent Cameroon over there, you\u2019re not there for you, but you\u2019re also there for all the people that are looking at you and expecting that scholarship to happen. Stop being childish; I know that you can do it. Running away is not a solution, Patricia, especially when you\u2019re not only doing it for yourself.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt only 18, Patricia found her father\u2019s advice difficult to accept.\n\nHowever, in a stroke of genius, he gave her an out that she could only take if she stayed in school for a while. It doesn\u2019t matter if you call it the counsel of wisdom or words of experience, but she decided to remain in school because her dad said he would only allow her to return home if she genuinely didn\u2019t like it there and not because of her poor scores. And she reasoned that the only way to confirm how she felt about the school was to first get good grades.\n\nIt would be an exciting twist in this story to say that she bounced back instantly, but her grades did not get better immediately. And while there are debates over who first said, \u201cForm is temporary, class is permanent,\u201d a statement often heard in sporting circles when one makes a resurgence following a dip in form, Patricia\u2019s class shone through, eventually, but not without encouragement from her mathematics teacher; he\u2019d noticed how tense she looked during tests and examinations and said,\n\n\u201cYou have to compete against yourself. The moment that you have given the maximum that you can give, then you should be proud of yourself. Don\u2019t try to look around and try to compete with other John and Smith.\u201d\n\nShe took what turned out to be excellent advice and was top of her class at the end of the programme; she was finally back where she felt most comfortable. After that, she got another scholarship for a three-year course equivalent to a Master\u2019s in Management and Information Systems and Finance at the same engineering school.\n\nBy the way, Patricia chose engineering for a reason.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always wanted to be a surgeon, that was my dream, but I ended up being an engineer because I wanted to be independent. When I got the scholarship, it was only for engineering school. I asked if there was one for medicine, but they said no. They told me there\u2019re so many medical doctors now, so we want to drive the engineering field in Francophone Africa. So I went with it; I didn\u2019t want to be dependent on my parents anymore.\u201d\n\nJourney to fulfilment\n\nPatricia Pedhom Nono. Transformation Director and Technology Leader, PwC, sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nAnd it got even more interesting in her final year as an engineering student. Patricia had always had her eyes on going to the United States for a funny reason.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, when I looked at the music, I\u2019d say \u2018American guys are so handsome. So, I need to go to America,\u2019\u201d she recalls, laughing.\n\nObviously, this mattered little when she was to visit the US.\n\nThe opportunity came in the form of an internship at KPMG (whose consulting arm was called Bearing Point at the time) in New York. But this wasn\u2019t an easy feat either because the internship was not for students at her school.\n\nActing on a tip from a friend at another school that an American company would interview for some internship roles, Patricia promptly visited the school and was probably not turned away because of her confidence. She prepared intensely and was exceptional at all interview stages, winning the recruiter\u2019s heart and getting offered a job despite not being a student of the school the recruiter attended.\n\nAmazed, I ask why she went that far.\n\n\u201cI knew what I wanted, and I was bold enough to go after it, and it turned out well,\u201d she replies, \u201cI\u2019m a very demanding person, not only of my team, [but] demanding of myself as well. For me, [it\u2019s] excellence first.\u201d\n\nAnd this is also reflected in her career journey.\n\n\u201cToday, I describe myself as a servant-leader, a mom, and a big dreamer. And in the technology field, I\u2019m a technology and business executive. I\u2019m working for PwC, which is an audit and consulting firm, driving technology transformation for the entire team and also driving transformation for our clients.\u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t all that the Cameroonian technology leadership expert with 18 years of experience does.\n\nAs a consultant, she helps tech businesses discover the potential areas they should focus on that can give them massive outcomes. She is also passionate about mentoring young African leaders to build a generation that rightly expresses the continent\u2019s potential globally.\n\nThe atypical girl-child, at 23, Patricia didn\u2019t think twice about beginning her career in a country thousands of miles from home.\n\nAnd she climbed the ladder so fast that in her nine years in New York, she accomplished a lot by taking up consulting and project management roles at PwC and KPMG \u2014 two of the US\u2019 Big Four consulting firms.\n\nSoon, she began having a yearning that needed to be urgently addressed.\n\n\u201cI started looking at things from a different perspective. \u201cWhat am I doing for the continent? Which value do I bring back?\u201d I kept asking those questions, and then I wanted to try going back,\u201d she recounts.\n\nPatricia requested a 12-month family leave to go back to Cameroon. During her visit, she decided to get a feel of work by freelancing at an organisation as a mentor and coach for teenagers and youth.\n\nShe considers that period very inspiring, and after spending a little over a year back in the US, she began planning her relocation to Cameroon.\n\n\u201cI had that call; it was like the motherland was calling me. It wasn\u2019t necessarily the most rational decision to go back, and the return was very tough,\u201d she sighs, \u201cbut when I came back, I had that clash of culture because growing up outside and living in New York actually strengthened that independent mind. And from a woman\u2019s perspective, they don\u2019t expect you to be like that. It was a challenge at work and in society.\u201d\n\nTrue to herself, she did not change and try to fit the status quo. But after a while, she decided to do things differently without sacrificing her individuality. Since she\u2019d spent those years in an English-speaking environment, Patricia needed to learn the ropes in a Francophone work situation.\n\n\u201cIt took me two years to understand the environment. Shifting that mindset from Anglophone to the Francophone environment was quite the challenge. Thank God I managed to find my way and balance things.\u201d\n\nLearning leadership the African way\n\nPatricia Pedhom Nono. Transformation Director and Technology Leader, PwC, sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nPatricia calls herself a stubborn servant leader who got that way through.\n\nAfter her relocation, she got into MTN Cameroon in 2011, and the first team she led was the turning point in her servant leadership career. Considering where she was coming from, she was more concerned about getting work done than having to care about what was going on with the people she was leading.\n\nAfter the first assessment survey for rating leaders, she realised the workers perceived her as mean and unkind. Consequently, she reconsidered her leadership style.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, it was challenging. Now I understand that the culture bit is quite important, and if I want to succeed, I need to leave that independent American heart somewhere and try to understand the environment.\n\n\u201cBecause success is also how you make sure you achieve within the personal, cultural, or team constraints that you have. That was another pivotal moment when I had to learn to be a bit more people-oriented,\u201d she explains.\n\nBut she had other key lessons to learn.\n\nStarting as the Chief Information Officer(CIO) at MTN Cameroon, before leading the customer operations department, she says, \u201cWe were serving about 10 million customers at that time. And I went from a team of 20 people to a team of 400. But I failed in my objectives in the first year. Because making 400 people dance in the tango is not easy!\u201d\n\nAfter analysing the situation, she realised where she might have gotten it wrong.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been an A-profile, you tend to feel like you can control everything. That you can do it yourself. With 20 persons, if they don\u2019t do it, you do it yourself and move on. But when there\u2019s an organisation, delegation becomes quite important because you cannot do everything. If you want to achieve, you have to push people to do what they have to do and do it the right way.\u201d\n\nPatricia took the team\u2019s performance to heart.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was a personal failure; it wasn\u2019t [only] because the team was unable to deliver.\u201d\n\nShe eventually realised that an engineering background was not enough to help her excel in her new role, so she decided to develop leadership capabilities despite being in the tech space. In 2018, she started an academy where she coaches women and young people on how to achieve excellence. She regularly shares stories about her failures and the lessons they\u2019ve taught her on LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cIt was quite fulfilling,\u201d she says, \u201cnot many leaders take the blame for the underperformance of their teams. Maybe, if the team could not deliver, the problem was me. You have to take the time to nurture and coach the team to become high performers.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, she confirms that one of the skills that stand out for her is critical thinking, which she learnt as an engineer. As a consultant, she\u2019s honed the ability to present an idea, convince people to buy into it, and point out the value and impact her effort generates. She even contributed to a book titled The X Factor, where she shares how she leverages her faith to be a good servant leader while aiming for the top.\n\nAt the end of that learning phase, she had gained a lot of valuable lessons from her experience and other examples of poor leadership \u2014 she learnt patience, empathy, and consideration.\n\nAfter seven years at MTN Cameroon, she rejoined PwC, this time as the Transformation Lead for sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. In her current role, she trains core tech people to look beyond technical skills and learn leadership, management, presentation, and negotiation skills.\n\n\u201cI have gone back to the consulting field where I\u2019m helping my clients to make the technology part of their organisations perform better and also to drive business growth.\u201d\n\nPatricia says her moves across industries were circumstance-motivated, with one because a respected boss changed companies, and she was interested in moving with them. Another was due to relocation, and the last was because the company suspended her role. However, she learnt to open a new chapter at every new company instead of importing what applied at the last one.\n\nShe also insists that having performed in various roles across core tech, commercial, and customer experience, among others, her moves have made her well-rounded. Talking about the best time to move, she says,\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not growing, learning, and you do not have perspective in a company, it\u2019s time to move. Keep that in mind because you\u2019re losing valuable time, especially when you\u2019re at the start of your career. The options are still very large if you\u2019re junior or medium-level; be very open, and don\u2019t lose time. It\u2019s the growth that you will achieve in the first 10 or 15 years of your career that you will capitalise on later. Because at a certain level, people are not looking at your competencies anymore; they are looking at your reference as an expert in the field.\u201d\n\nShe explains the three levels in a person\u2019s career: the first is where you do any job that comes your way to gain experience and probably make ends meets; the second \u2014 when you dictate the kind of job you take \u2014 is when people begin to see you as an expert; and the third stage is where you\u2019re headhunted or recommended for professional roles.\n\nEverything in between\n\nAlthough Patricia is quite vocal and keen about her professional life, she has other factors that encourage her consistency. She speaks proudly of her family and partner, who, by the way, might have been a huge motivation for her relocation to Cameroon.\n\nThe proud mother of two says, \u201cThey keep me on my toes. They are the most important; I want to live my legacy through them as well.\u201d\n\nPatricia points to her experience at the preparatory school for lessons that have stuck with her for most of her life and helped her productivity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind not being at the top, but what I do mind is giving my best and being excellent at what I do to the maximum of my capacity. At the end of the day, I do the math, and I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ve given my best.\u201d\n\nIt also helps that her parents constantly reinforce the need for excellence and repeatedly tell their children to live by one goal \u2014 doing their best even though they could be the fifth on a list of five winners.\n\n\u201cIf five people win, you can be the fifth; if there are four, you should be the fourth; and if there are three, you should be the third. But if there\u2019s only one, aim to be the one.\u201d\n\nOn what she thinks about the bias she faced as a young Francophone African woman in the US, she says,\n\n\u201cBias exists. But, you should not focus too much of your energy on it; don\u2019t try to justify and prove yourself to people. Just be who you are. I\u2019m sure you will find areas where you can leapfrog your performance and move forward.\u201d\n\nOn an average weekday, she prepares her kids for school, exercises, and takes work-related meetings in the mornings before beginning work and attending to clients. Her evenings and weekends are spent with family.\n\nSurprisingly, she has quite a controversial opinion about work-life balance.\n\n\u201cWork-life balance is utopia; you can\u2019t have it all. You have to pick your top three \u2014 family, work, or personal life \u2014 and know that you have to juggle [them].\u201d\n\nTo stay productive at work, she adopts the two-minute rule and uses her calendar app consistently. She also encourages stand-up meetings and proper delegation. Patricia likes to read, travel, exercise, and have family time.",

          "text": "Angola produces more oil than Nigeria for second straight month\n\nFor the second straight month, Angola produced more crude oil than Nigeria in June despite the increase in the output of Africa\u2019s biggest economy, according to a new report by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nBusinessDay had reported last month that Nigeria lost its status as Africa\u2019s top oil producer to Angola as its output declined the most in May among its peers in OPEC.\n\nOPEC\u2019s monthly oil market report for July 2022 show that Nigeria\u2019s oil production increased by 134,000 barrels per barrel (bpd) to 1.158 million bpd in June from 1.024 million in May, based on direct communication.\n\nRead also: Angola overtakes Nigeria as Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer\n\nAngola\u2019s oil production rose to 1.175 million bpd in June, up from 1.162 million bpd in May, based on direct communication.\n\nOPEC uses secondary sources to monitor its oil output, but also publishes a table of figures submitted by its member countries.\n\nNigeria recorded the biggest increase in production among its OPEC peers in June, and the prices of the country\u2019s three major crude oil grades rose.\n\n\u201cOn a monthly average, crude differentials to the North Sea Dated benchmark of Bonny Light, Forcados and Qua Iboe rose by $2.45, $3.26, and $2.83, respectively m-o-m in June, to settle at a premium of $5.28/b, $7.61/b, and $6.53/b,\u201d\n\nOPEC said Angolan crude differentials also rose on demand from Europe, adding: \u201cThe crude differential of medium-heavy sweet crude Cabinda rose in June by $2.83 m-o-m on average to a premium of $3.76/b.\u201d\n\nAccording to secondary sources, OPEC\u2019s crude oil production averaged 28.72 million bpd in June 2022, higher by 234,000 bpd compared to the previous month.\n\n\u201cCrude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, IR Iran, Kuwait and Angola, while production in Libya and Venezuela declined,\u201d the 13-member oil cartel said.\n\nOPEC said despite the improvement in fossil fuel prices, the short-term economic outlook for Nigeria was clouded by high inflation, which had reduced private sector optimism and weakened consumer spending.\n\nIn May 2022, the composite Consumer Price Index rose to 17.7 percent year-on-year from 16.8 percent y-o-y in the prior month.\n\nThe report noted that in response to the elevated inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of Nigeria raised its policy rate by 150 basis points to 13 percent, bringing borrowing costs to the highest since April of 2020.\n\nIt said: \u201cIt was the biggest rate hike since July of 2016 amid concerns that persistent inflationary pressures could weigh on the country\u2019s fragile recovery. Meanwhile, the Stanbic IBTC Bank Nigeria PMI fell to 50.9 in June of 2022 from 53.9 in the prior month, pointing to the weakest improvement in business conditions in Nigeria\u2019s private sector since January of 2021.\n\n\u201cOverall, the above-average fossil fuel prices support a firmly positive outlook for the rest of the year, but concerns over soaring inflation would increase uncertainty next year.\u201d\n\nPreliminary data indicates that global liquids production in June increased by 1.32 million bpd to average 99.82 million bpd compared with the previous month.\n\nHowever, non-OPEC liquids production, including OPEC natural gas liquids (NGLs), was estimated to have increased in June by 1.1 million bpd month-on-month to an average 71.1 million bpd, but was higher by 2.5 million bpd year-on-year.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe share of OPEC crude oil in total global production decreased by 0.1 percentage points to 28.8 percent in June compared with the previous month.\n\n\u201cEstimates are based on preliminary data from direct communication for non-OPEC supply, OPEC NGLs and non-conventional oil, while estimates for OPEC crude production are based on secondary sources.\u201d\n\nFor 2022, world oil demand is foreseen to rise by 3.4 million bpd, unchanged from last month\u2019s estimate despite some regional revisions, according to OPEC.\n\n\u201cTotal oil demand is projected to average 100.3 million bpd. In 1Q22, demand was revised up amid strong economic growth in most consuming countries and a lower baseline,\u201d it said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s solar companies are seeing a surge in demand for mini-grids and equipment as businesses in Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer look for alternative power sources as the cost of diesel soars locally due to rising global oil prices.\n\nAccording to Reuters, supply constraints could, however, hamper their ability to capitalise on the trend, with some saying they have begun to turn away customers because they are unable to meet demand.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy with a population of more than 200 million people, has installed electricity capacity of 12,500 megawatts but the national grid only provides 4,000 MW at peak, leaving businesses and citizens heavily reliant on diesel-powered generators.\n\nThe price of diesel, not subsidised like petrol, has nearly tripled to N800 a litre ($1.93). Most of that increase came in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRead also: Solar panel recycling market to be worth $2.7 billion by 2030\n\n\u201cThere has been an increased growth in demand (for solar), I think really driven by the spike in diesel prices this year,\u201d Victor Ezenwoko, Daystar Power chief commercial officer said.\n\nEstimates in Nigeria suggest the country spends $22 billion annually to fuel generators. In the commercial capital of Lagos alone, nearly N1billion is spent daily on diesel.\n\nSolar power adoption is estimated at below 2 percent and some businesses perceive it as unsuitable for large-scale use, industry executives said.\n\nA study earlier this year by Boston Consulting Group and All-On, a Shell-funded firm, said Nigeria\u2019s installed photovoltaic solar panel per capita amounted to 1 watt compared to an average 8 watts in similar emerging markets like South Africa.\n\nThat is changing as energy costs eat into company margins, forcing businesses to actively consider solar, a clean form of energy, said Prince Ojeabulu, CEO at Rensource Energy.\n\nIn 2021, Rensource installed under a megawatt of solar panels but it is now constructing 6 MW plants.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the year, going by the trend that we see so far, we should have 12MW of solar installations operational across Nigeria, or even more,\u201d he said.\n\nA ministry of power official said there was an increase this year of approved solar mini-grids serving industrial users but did not give details.\n\nBut global supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 lockdowns in China this year and the war in Ukraine are tampering the optimism for growth. Delivery times for some equipment has risen from three months to as long as nine months.\n\n\u201cWe could install 60MW this year if we had the equipment. We have even started turning down customers\u2026we have become more choosy with whom we work (with),\u201d said Daystar CEO and co-founder Jasper Graf von Hardenberg.\n\nLocal financing has been difficult to access too, executives said, but money is flowing in from overseas development financial institutions looking to invest in businesses focusing on green energy.\n\nDemand has been so strong for Arnergy solar that it has done more connections in the first half of 2022 than the whole of last year, said Sinmi Akinsanmi, vice president for strategy and business operations.

          "title": "Exxon-Seplat deal: NNPC\u2019s push puts investors on notice",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has secured an injunction from the Federal High Court in Abuja high court restraining the sale of shares of ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian unit to any third parties, a development that puts on notice local investors planning future divestment deals that it will not back down.\n\nThe order granted on July 6 restrains Mobil Producing Nigeria Ltd and Mobil Development Nigeria Plc from selling, trading, allocating, transferring, or disposing of their shares in their interests covered by or connected to the Joint Operating Agreement between them and the NNPC.\n\nThe order restrains \u201csale of assets covered in Oil Mining Lease 68, Oil Mining Lease 69, Oil Mining Lease 70 and Oil Prospecting Licence 94, to anybody, person (s), company, consortium or entity howsoever described pending the determination of the claimant/applicant\u2019s motion filed on the 5th of July or when the judicial tribunal is duly constituted and can make interim preservation orders,\u201d the motion reads.\n\nThe motion, with suit no: FCT/HC/BW/CV/173/22 m/203/2022, was filed on July 5 at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, in the Abuja division, presided over by Justice B. Belgor. It had the upstream regulator as one of the defendants.\n\nAnalysts say NNPC\u2019s action could have a material effect on future divestment plans based on how it communicates its intention to investors. Nigeria is in dire need of investments and the oil corporation, which only recently was transformed into a company, cannot be seen as scuttling investments.\n\n\u201cThe big picture though is depending on how the narrative is shaped,\u201d said Ayodele Oni, energy lawyer and partner at Bloomfield law firm.\n\nIn February, Seplat Energy Plc, a major energy company, had agreed to buy the entire onshore and shallow-water assets of ExxonMobil in Nigeria but the NNPC had opposed the deal.\n\nMele Kyari, group managing director of NNPC, had said International Oil Companies (IOCs) that divest from Nigeria\u2019s upstream sector failed to address issues of abandonment and decommissioning of oil assets.\n\nDecommissioning, which is the general term for returning an oil production site to its pre-lease condition at the end of the useful life of the oil asset, can be a costly exercise for the companies involved. Many fields abandoned in Nigeria are not decommissioned largely because of the local companies who acquire them.\n\nThe NNPC also objected that as a joint venture (JV) partner with Exxon\u2019s Nigerian units, it had pre-emptive rights over any sales of the assets of the company. According to the terms of the JV contract, the NNPC, which holds a 60 percent share in the Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU) JV, has the right of first refusal in any asset sale agreement.\n\nThese pre-emption rights usually give the NNPC the right to match the best (financial) terms for any such acquisition and acquire the asset, said Oni.\n\nBut Mobil Oil Producing said the deal was not an asset sale but merely a sale of its shares to another entity, an argument the NNPC has refused to accept.\n\nAccording to the transaction document seen by BusinessDay, Seplat Energy had offered to buy ExxonMobil\u2019s interests in its Nigerian offshore shallow-water assets at the cost of $1.2 billion.\n\nThe company said it had entered into an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU from ExxonMobil Corporation.\n\nThe determination of the NNPC suit could close the loophole of IOCs shedding their assets through share sale rather than embarking on asset divestments with its tedious process.\n\nIt would determine if ministerial consent was required for an oil company to sell its stake and test the validity of NNPC\u2019s pre-emption rights over assets it jointly operates with its partners.\n\nAssets\n\nBased on 2020 working interest volumes for Seplat Energy and MPNU, the transaction delivers 186 percent increase in production from 51,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) to 146,000boepd, 170 percent increase in 2P liquids reserves, from 241 million barrels (MMbbl) to 650 MMbbl, 14 percent increase in 2P gas reserves from 1,501 Bscf to 1,712 Bscf, including the significant undeveloped gas potential of 2,910 Bscf (JV: 7,275 Bscf).\n\nIt will also add an 89 percent increase in total 2P reserves from 499 MMboe to 945 MMboe1 and includes offshore fields with dedicated, MPNU-operated export routes offering enhanced security and reliability.\n\nThe MPNU asset portfolio in Nigeria primarily consists of 40 percent operating ownership of four oil mining leases (OMLs 67, 68, 70, 104) and associated infrastructure (NNPC is the 60 percent partner), the Qua Iboe Terminal, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest export facilities and 51 percent interest in Bonny River Terminal and Natural Gas Liquids Recovery Plants at EAP and Oso.\n\nIt does not include ExxonMobil\u2019s deepwater assets in Nigeria.\n\nMinisterial consent\n\nThe completion of the Seplat/ExxonMobil deal was subject to ministerial consent and other required regulatory approvals. On May 19, the Federal Government turned down the application for ministerial consent.\n\nAccording to Gbenga Komolafe, CEO of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission, the government cited overriding national interest, failure to follow due process and inappropriate application as major reasons for rejecting a deal that could deliver higher taxes, increased production, and generate more oil revenue to Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country.\n\nRead also: NNPC, Sahara JV to build LPG jetties across West Africa\n\nFollowing this refusal, the battle to see the deal through moved to the courts.\n\nOil sector operators and analysts have said Nigeria continues to impose obstacles to investments while making fervent appeals for new investments and passing a law designed to attract investments.\n\n\u201cWe need to stop playing politics in the oil and gas business because more Nigerians are sinking into poverty,\u201d Ola Alokolaro, senior partner and head of energy and infrastructure group at Advocaats Law practice, told BusinessDay.\n\nAt the NOG gas conference in Abuja last week, Osagie Okunbor, managing director of Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd and the Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, said a lack of stability in fiscals, issues with the sanctity of contracts, security of investments, and the sheer impact of crude theft continued to scare away investors.\n\nShell\u2019s divestment plan has stalled over a legal tussle with a community in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe hearing date for the motion on notice in the NNPC suit has been fixed for July 15.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Russia and Ukraine standoff, vis a vis boycott of Russian gas has triggered significant disruptions and created a huge shortage in global gas supply chain.\n\nAvailable data indicate that Russia is the world\u2019s largest natural gas exporter; exporting 238 billion cubic meters in 2020 and accounting for about 45 per cent the EU\u2019s imports in 2021.\n\nIt implies that any dislodgement in Russia\u2019s gas supply would leave a deep crater which must be exploited by Nigeria, with natural gas reserve of 209.5 trillion cubic feet.\n\nPerceptive stakeholders hold that the economic trump card of sanctions on Russia for Nigeria, as a ranking gas producing and exporting nation, is immense.\n\nExpectedly, Nigeria is savouring the prospects of being a buffer and cashing in on the void.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, while on a state visit to Portugal recently, indicated that Nigeria is ready to fill the natural gas gaps in Europe predicated by the current Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nBuhari said with over 200 million mainly young people, Nigeria was ready to be the hub of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA).\n\nThe president urged Portugal to consider Nigeria as a valued and trusted partner in Africa.\n\nHe identified key areas of cooperation and collaboration capable of moving both countries forward as oil and gas, tourism and hospitality industry, air travel, security and joint commission.\n\n\u201cAt a time the world is going through turbulent times, we feel that a strong friendship and partnership between Nigeria and Portugal can act as a force for good.\n\n\u201cWith the current Russian-Ukraine war, increased cooperation in oil and gas between the two countries has become vital to avoid crisis in the demand and supply chain, even as Nigeria is already a major supplier of gas to Portugal,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president added that Nigeria and Portugal could cooperate closely on a range of agricultural and renewable energy projects.\n\nTo add some verve to Nigeria\u2019s drive to reap from gap in the global gas supply chain, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) recently presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo approved for the NNPC to enter into agreement with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who made the disclosure, said that the project was still at the point of the front end engineering design, after which the cost would be determined.\n\nThe pipeline would traverse 15 West African countries to Morocco and Spain.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Petroleum Resources presented three memos to Council.\n\n\u201cThe first memo, council approved for the NNPC Ltd to execute MoU with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline.\n\n\u201cThis gas pipeline is to take gas to 15 West African countries and to Morocco and through Morocco to Spain and Europe.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe minister said that the council also approved the construction of a switch gear room and installation of power distribution cables and equipment for the Nigeria Oil and Gas Park in Ogbia, Bayelsa. The cost of the project was put at N3.8billion.\n\nHe said that the park was to support local manufacturing of components for the oil and gas industry.\n\nNigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline was proposed in a December 2016 agreement between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Moroccan Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (National Board of Hydrocarbons and Mines) (ONHYM).\n\nThe pipeline would connect Nigerian gas to every coastal country in West Africa (Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Senegal and Mauritania), ending at Tangiers, Morocco, and C\u00e1diz, Spain.\n\nSylva also elucidated on Nigeria\u2019s readiness to offer its services as an alternative gas supplier to Europe when he received a delegation, led by Samuela Isopi, EU\u2019s Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS.\n\nHe urged EU to increase investments in gas and hydrocarbons in Nigeria to be able to meet the bloc\u2019s energy needs.\n\nThe minister implored the EU to encourage its oil and gas companies such as Shell, Eni, and Total Energies to scale up investments in the Nigerian gas sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we warned against earlier was the speed with which the EU was taking away investments in fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe warned that the speed was faster than they were developing renewable energy; you can see now that what we were warning against is what is happening now.\u201d\n\nHe told the delegation that what stunted growth in the development of gas in Nigeria was fresh investments, and called for a change of attitude on the part of the EU, if its requests to increase supplies to Europe would be realised.\n\nThe minister said that one of the biggest challenges the sector faces was lack of investments.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, over 70 billion dollars worth of investments came to Africa, but sadly less than four billion dollars came to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, we are the biggest in Africa; if we cannot attract investments to Nigeria, you know where we are heading.\n\n\u201cYou have been our long time friend; as at today, our gas reserve is one of the biggest in the world; we have a proven gas reserve of 206 tcf and if we really focus on gas exploitation we can get up to 600 tcf.\n\n\u201cWe are already building gas infrastructure such as the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipeline project, expected to take gas to Algeria, and the West Africa Gas Pipeline project designed to take gas to Morroco.\u201d\n\nThe minister said that due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the EU must have a buffer or an alternative source of gas.\n\n\u201cWe would like to be reliable partners to solve the energy problem in Europe and we can only achieve this by working together.\n\n\u201cIt is only when investment in these areas is increased that Nigeria can meet that obligation,\u201d he said.\n\nSharing similar sentiments, Sarah Anyanwu, Professor of Development, Department of Economics, University of Abuja, said it was ample opportunity for Nigeria to increase production.\n\nAnyanwu said that Nigeria had surplus gas and called on the concerned authorities to up the ante.\n\n\u201cWe have been talking on the issues of diversifying the economy; so, these are the areas apart from oil that government should cease the opportunity and key into.\n\n\u201cWe have areas to explore and make more foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cNot only Nigeria, OPEC countries should step up; that\u2019s an opportunity for us to make more money from gas; it lies in increasing production.\n\n\u201cThe glut globally is for our good. Nigeria should cease the opportunity; increase production and breakthrough from this mono-cultural economy,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nExperts are of the submission that the diversification mantra has reverberated for many years; hence the urgent need for pragmatic steps.\n\nThey say that the interregnum in global gas supply presents a gaping opportunity for Nigeria to ramp up gas export and reap bountifully from a ready market.\n\n_____________________\n\nChijioke Okoronkwo, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n(NANFeatures)\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "2023: Muslim-Muslim ticket a disastrous error, dead on arrival \u2013 Babachir Lawal",
          "text": "Mr. Babachir Lawal, former secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), has pronounced as dead on arrival, the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nLawal called on President Muhammadu Buhari to prevail on the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to drop Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate, if the APC must survive.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed on Tuesday, BD Lawal described the choice of a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket as a disastrous error.\n\n\u201cI thought I would be able to avoid commenting on the disastrous error by my very good friend, Sen Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in his choice of a running mate.\n\n\u201cI will be the very last person to stand in the way of my very good friend, Tinubu\u2019s path to the presidency.\n\n\u201cThis is because since 2011 my consuming passion has been for him to succeed Buhari as President of Nigeria. It will not be true if I say that I did not see it coming.\n\n\u201cI have often read his body language, picked up snippets from several discussions with his lapdogs (some of whom, sadly are Christians but most of whom are Moslems) and I have conveyed my reservations to them against the pitfalls of a moslem-moslem ticket towards which I sensed they were drifting.\n\n\u201cAnd why Kashim Shetima? He is an overambitious man who has a Machiavellian bent and has lots of money with which to procure a preferred-candidate status among Tinubu\u2019s lapdogs.\n\n\u201cAnd as we are beginning to see, to also procure bogus supporters especially from among the Christian community to help launder his no-so-good image.\n\n\u201cBut as a popular proverb goes: \u2018Those whom the gods want to destroy they first make mad\u2019. It appears that the gods want to destroy the APC and its presidential candidate and have chosen the instrumentality of the northern Moslem governors and their super ambitious tool and Kashim Shettima for this purpose.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Kashim Shetima is a Greek gift from the Northern governors to Tinubu. I advise Bola to make sure Kashima\u2019s two hands are always in his plain sight and empty. True, based on the advice of his new friends, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made his choice. And I am sure he thinks he is ready for the outcome of that choice.\n\n\u201cHe has chosen to bring religion to the front burner of Nigerian politics. And being a Muslim, he has chosen to take sides with his own religion. For all he cares, Christians can go to blazes with their votes.\n\n\u201cBut he must also be told that there will be consequences for this choice. Some of them are that Christians all over the country will revolt against the APC to put the chances of his election in serious jeopardy. It will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian dominated areas in jeopardy,\u201d Lawal said.\n\nAccording to the former SGF, this could result in APC being a minority party in both the National and State Assemblies.\n\n\u201cNow tell me which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau)?\n\n\u201cThe northern governors and some northern moslem elite must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them. But if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he should have a rethink.\n\n\u201cThey will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\n\n\u201cProof of a possible Islamic agenda was leaked when Governor Ganduje, the \u201cKadimul Islam\u201d, gave advance notice that Tinubu had assured them he would be nominating a moslem as his running mate. For those who might not know, Governor Ganduje has a foundation called \u201cGanduje Foundation\u201d which purpose according to its website is to \u201cprovide selfless service to humanity and Islam\u201d but whose primary purpose it appears is the conversion of Christians to Islam.\n\n\u201cSo if my very good friend Tinubu, in a desperate bid to become President, allows himself to be made into a religious bigot or even a mujahideen, he is welcome. But it is a risk that will not play out positively for his presidential bid. But, we\u2019re to win and become President of Nigeria, it will be as a sectional President; an Islamic President. And he will surely face massive discontent and opposition even before taking off.\n\n\u201cExpecting Nigerians to ignore this crass insensitivity to the country\u2019s diversity amounts to acceding to the perpetration of very grave injustice and discrimination against a huge segment of the society. No one who seeks to be president of Nigeria should ever deploy the tool of religious extremism and exclusivism as a tool to win elections. This is very very dangerous. And this is very sad.\n\n\u201cBut, barring any last minute change of mind, Bola has made his choice. He should be bluntly told that in this choice Nigerian Christians clearly see a pending Islamic Republic of Nigeria in its infancy and are right to be severely anxious. There is gloom among the Christian community all over the country since Tinubu announced Kashim Shetima as his running mate. Are the generality of the moslem ummah happy with this? The answer is a resounding No.\n\n\u201cHow then do we respond? The decision as to how to respond to this deliberately senseless act of provocation is both corporate to each religious group and also personal to each voter that love peace, and hate injustice. Christians want to continue to leave peacefully with their moslem neighbors at home, at school, at the workplace, in the markets and on the streets as we have always done or desired to do. And I am sure Moslems share this view too. No one person\u2019s ambition to rule over us should be allowed to set us apart and at war with one another.\n\n\u201cBola Ahmed Tinubu, should be compelled upon by whoever can do so to rescind this decision. President Mohammed Buhari should exercise his powers as the Commander-in-Chief and as the APC Leader to revoke this nomination of a VP by Tinubu. The APC National Chairman should refuse to sign the nomination forms if not rescinded,\u201d Lawal added.\n\nLawal said as part of his obligation to Tinubu, a close friend, he had on many occasions argued the merits and demerits of the ticket permutations to him.\n\n\u201cI have done so in both verbal and written form and I have likewise done so with some of his close respectable associates and friends. In all instances I had left him with the sole responsibility for his final decision arguing that in the end the consequences of the outcome of any bad decision will be his to bear. There might be some collateral damages though. I have also on several occasions passed on to him counsels and messages from some well meaning Nigerians intended to alert him on the possible outcomes of the Presidential ticket permutations.\n\n\u201cTinubu is a very good man. He is a great listener. He has a very humble and friendly disposition to everyone. He is very generous in both cash and kind, especially where it could advance his political interests. But I have realized that it is in the nature of power that sycophants and lapdogs have the most influence on leaders with such character traits. They will lie to him, malign and disparage others and generally do anything to curry his favor and to also put well-meaning associates in a bad light. I suspect this is what has happened to my friend. He has been cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\n\n\u201cIt never used to be like this. While in his hey-days in Lagos, he surrounded himself with smart, street-wise guys that could tell the truth to power. He had Rauf Aregbesola, Yemi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Dele Alake, Muiz Banire, etc.The Lagos days were the days of think-tank, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, principles and ideologies. But these people have since grown-up and moved up to establish their own systems leaving my friend stranded. Nature, they say, abhors vacuum,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nAhead of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State, 21 governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, have described the incumbent governor of the State and candidate of the party, Adegboyega Oyetola, as an excellent performer who has brought purpose to governance.\n\nThey said those who have fair mind devoid of prejudices and biases will testify to the developmental strides Oyetola has registered since becoming governor of the state in 2018.\n\nThe progressive governors, therefore, reaffirmed their unalloyed support for Governor Oyetola, just as they declared their readiness to do all necessary within the law to ensure his re-election.\n\nWhile addressing a mammoth crowd at the Mega rally held at the Osogbo Township Stadium on Tuesday, national leaders of the APC and its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, expressed confidence that the party will coast home to victory in overwhelming fashion come Saturday.\n\nThe Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, lauded Oyetola\u2019s prudence and efficiency in managing the state\u2019s meagre resources, calling on citizens to look beyond political sentiments in their choice of who to elect, and to vote massively for Oyetola.\n\nLawan said: \u201cI\u2019m bringing solidarity from the National Assembly. We are believers of this party and its candidate because Osun has witnessed serious and massive transformation in the last three and a half years.\n\n\u201cWe have a governor who is prudent and efficient in the face of very meagre resources. Today, Osun has witnessed so much infrastructural development, political stability and peace. We believe that we have everything we need for development with this our Governor\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Tinubu, urged the people of Osun to replicate the victory recorded last month in Ekiti.\n\nAccording to Tinubu: \u201cWe have come to ask that you vote massively on Saturday for APC, not as a mark of entitlement but because of the future of your children.\n\n\u201cBefore you make your decision, think of the future. We are a party that guarantees your future because we are known for fulfilling our promises. Let us entrust the affairs of our state into the hands of those who mean business, not mushroom parties\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the National Chairman of the Party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, said the mega rally was an indication that the APC was not taking any chances with the affairs of Osun, saying the State deserves a leader like Oyetola in its quest for development.\n\nAdamu said: \u201cThis is a mega rally to promote our candidate. We are taking no chances with the affairs of Osun because the state deserves a leader like Oyetola in its quest for development. This is why we have come in full strength to support him in a bid to ensure his re-election. Those who have a fair mind will testify that he has done so much since he became governor in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe are here not only to testify to what he has done but to appeal to you to turn out in large numbers to vote massively for him. We are anticipating a better outcome than what we had in Ekiti and by the grace of God, we are sure of victory. I want you to be the APC ambassadors, telling those who are not here what you have seen. Continue to spread the good works of this government in the nooks and crannies of the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his colleagues, Chairman of the Nigeria Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, assured that Oyetola has the backing of all APC governors in the coming election, saying he had earned it with his outstanding performance.\n\nBagudu also lauded the tremendous and landmark developments Osun had recorded across sectors since Oyetola\u2019s emergence.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to be here today, we are proud to hear about the numerous progress that this administration in Osun has recorded. We are confident that the love and admiration of the people of Osun are with you because of your great achievements.\n\n\u201cToday, we are here for this grand rally and honoured to be here to throw our support behind you. We did it about four years ago, and you were elected based on what you can do. Now, we are here again to show solidarity based on what you have done.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring the citizens of Osun that this gentleman Governor will continue to do what is healthy for our democracy. He did not disappoint in the first term, he won\u2019t disappoint in the second term,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the National Campaign Council for Osun governorship election and Lagos State Governor, Babajide SanwoOlu, described Oyetola as deserving of another term based on his personal encounters with the people of the State.\n\nIn his words; \u201cWe thank the originator of IleriOluwa political slogan, our dear Governor Oyetola, the one because of whom we are here. Indeed, it is a huge honour that we stand here today because this is a worthy assignment and we have a sellable candidate. It is a job that is gratifying and doable because Governor Oyetola has indeed performed excellently well.\n\n\u201cI have been on campaign trail with him and I have witnessed the overwhelming support and how the people have said he is deserving of another term.\n\n\u201cPeople of Osun, do not be deceived by those who are trying to say otherwise. Let us vote massively for Oyetola to continue doing his great works for every sector of the population. This is a man that that is an embodiment of good governance.\u201d\n\nWhile welcoming members of the National Campaign Council to the State, the Director-General of Oyetola\u2019s re-election Campaign Council, Senator Ajibola Basiru, described the grand rally as a celebration of excellence.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, you are being welcomed to the celebration of excellence in governance because in the last three and a half years, Governor Oyetola has brought dexterity, commitment and integrity to the affairs of this state across sectors.\n\n\u201cNow, we are on the path to consolidating the progress and development of the state by re-electing that man that is certain to deliver development over and over. With him, Osun is on the path of sustainable development\u201d.\n\nIn his short remarks, Governor Oyetola, said Osun is on the path of consolidating on the gains of the last three and a half years.\n\nHe urged the people of Osun, especially workers, to shun political traducers who are peddling falsehood that his administration will renege in its commitment to their welfare if re-elected, saying he remains strongly committed to their welfare.\n\nOyetola also declared his readiness to do beyond what he has done in his first term, saying the welfare of workers and citizens and the overall development of Osun remains his priority.",

The Christians in the North and the whole nation are highly aggravated\n\n\u201cConsidering that the Chairman of the party is a Muslim, Deputy Chairman \u2013 North, is a Muslim, the President of the Senate is a Muslim, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker are Muslims, and now both the presidential and vice-presidential candidates are Muslims and apart from this violating the constitution, section 14 subsection 3, if this was to be reversed that all these were Christians, can any Muslim in the North be able to sell the APC presidential ticket to any Muslim ummah?\u201d\n\nThey warned of serious and grave consequences if the selection of a Muslim vice-presidential candidate was not changed, maintaining that \u201cat this moment of national peril, what should be paramount in Nigeria is unity and not infrastructure or economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor without unity, we cannot build.

          "text": "The immediate-past Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Babachir David Lawal, has declared that the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is dead on arrival.\n\nAccording to BD Lawal, President Muhammadu Buhari must prevail on the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to drop Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate, if the APC must survive.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed on Tuesday, BD Lawal described the choice of a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket as a disastrous error.\n\n\u201cI thought I would be able to avoid commenting on the disastrous error by my very good friend, Sen Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in his choice of a running mate.\n\n\u201cI will be the very last person to stand in the way of my very good friend, Tinubu\u2019s path to the presidency.\n\n\u201cThis is because since 2011 my consuming passion has been for him to succeed Buhari as President of Nigeria. It will not be true if I say that I did not see it coming.\n\n\u201cI have often read his body language, picked up snippets from several discussions with his lapdogs (some of whom, sadly are Christians but most of whom are Moslems) and I have conveyed my reservations to them against the pitfalls of a moslem-moslem ticket towards which I sensed they were drifting.\n\n\u201cAnd why Kashim Shetima? He is an overambitious man who has a Machiavellian bent and has lots of money with which to procure a preferred-candidate status among Tinubu\u2019s lapdogs.\n\n\u201cAnd as we are beginning to see, to also procure bogus supporters especially from among the Christian community to help launder his no-so-good image.\n\n\u201cBut as a popular proverb goes: \u2018Those whom the gods want to destroy they first make mad\u2019. It appears that the gods want to destroy the APC and its presidential candidate and have chosen the instrumentality of the northern Moslem governors and their super ambitious tool and Kashim Shettima for this purpose.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Kashim Shetima is a Greek gift from the Northern governors to Tinubu. I advise Bola to make sure Kashima\u2019s two hands are always in his plain sight and empty. True, based on the advice of his new friends, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made his choice. And I am sure he thinks he is ready for the outcome of that choice.\n\n\u201cHe has chosen to bring religion to the front burner of Nigerian politics. And being a Muslim, he has chosen to take sides with his own religion. For all he cares, Christians can go to blazes with their votes.\n\n\u201cBut he must also be told that there will be consequences for this choice. Some of them are that Christians all over the country will revolt against the APC to put the chances of his election in serious jeopardy. It will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian dominated areas in jeopardy,\u201d Lawal said.\n\nAccording to the former SGF, this could result in APC being a minority party in both the National and State Assemblies.\n\n\u201cNow tell me which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau)?\n\n\u201cThe northern governors and some northern moslem elite must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them. But if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he should have a rethink.\n\n\u201cThey will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\n\n\u201cProof of a possible Islamic agenda was leaked when Governor Ganduje, the \u201cKadimul Islam\u201d, gave advance notice that Tinubu had assured them he would be nominating a moslem as his running mate. For those who might not know, Governor Ganduje has a foundation called \u201cGanduje Foundation\u201d which purpose according to its website is to \u201cprovide selfless service to humanity and Islam\u201d but whose primary purpose it appears is the conversion of Christians to Islam.\n\n\u201cSo if my very good friend Tinubu, in a desperate bid to become President, allows himself to be made into a religious bigot or even a mujahideen, he is welcome. But it is a risk that will not play out positively for his presidential bid. But, we\u2019re to win and become President of Nigeria, it will be as a sectional President; an Islamic President. And he will surely face massive discontent and opposition even before taking off.\n\n\u201cExpecting Nigerians to ignore this crass insensitivity to the country\u2019s diversity amounts to acceding to the perpetration of very grave injustice and discrimination against a huge segment of the society. No one who seeks to be president of Nigeria should ever deploy the tool of religious extremism and exclusivism as a tool to win elections. This is very very dangerous. And this is very sad.\n\n\u201cBut, barring any last minute change of mind, Bola has made his choice. He should be bluntly told that in this choice Nigerian Christians clearly see a pending Islamic Republic of Nigeria in its infancy and are right to be severely anxious. There is gloom among the Christian community all over the country since Tinubu announced Kashim Shetima as his running mate. Are the generality of the moslem ummah happy with this? The answer is a resounding No.\n\n\u201cHow then do we respond? The decision as to how to respond to this deliberately senseless act of provocation is both corporate to each religious group and also personal to each voter that love peace, and hate injustice. Christians want to continue to leave peacefully with their moslem neighbors at home, at school, at the workplace, in the markets and on the streets as we have always done or desired to do. And I am sure Moslems share this view too. No one person\u2019s ambition to rule over us should be allowed to set us apart and at war with one another.\n\n\u201cBola Ahmed Tinubu, should be compelled upon by whoever can do so to rescind this decision. President Mohammed Buhari should exercise his powers as the Commander-in-Chief and as the APC Leader to revoke this nomination of a VP by Tinubu. The APC National Chairman should refuse to sign the nomination forms if not rescinded,\u201d Lawal added.\n\nLawal said as part of his obligation to Tinubu, a close friend, he had on many occasions argued the merits and demerits of the ticket permutations to him.\n\n\u201cI have done so in both verbal and written form and I have likewise done so with some of his close respectable associates and friends. In all instances I had left him with the sole responsibility for his final decision arguing that in the end the consequences of the outcome of any bad decision will be his to bear. There might be some collateral damages though. I have also on several occasions passed on to him counsels and messages from some well meaning Nigerians intended to alert him on the possible outcomes of the Presidential ticket permutations.\n\n\u201cTinubu is a very good man. He is a great listener. He has a very humble and friendly disposition to everyone. He is very generous in both cash and kind, especially where it could advance his political interests. But I have realized that it is in the nature of power that sycophants and lapdogs have the most influence on leaders with such character traits. They will lie to him, malign and disparage others and generally do anything to curry his favor and to also put well-meaning associates in a bad light. I suspect this is what has happened to my friend. He has been cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\n\n\u201cIt never used to be like this. While in his hey-days in Lagos, he surrounded himself with smart, street-wise guys that could tell the truth to power. He had Rauf Aregbesola, Yemi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Dele Alake, Muiz Banire, etc.The Lagos days were the days of think-tank, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, principles and ideologies. But these people have since grown-up and moved up to establish their own systems leaving my friend stranded. Nature, they say, abhors vacuum,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and ex-Osun State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola, were noticeably absent at the All Progressives Congress mega rally for the re-election of Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, held in Osogbo on Tuesday.\n\nThe mega rally committee in a statement on Monday, signed by its spokesperson, Funke Egbemode, had listed Osinbajo as one of the guests expected at the rally. But the Interior Minister was not listed.\n\nSome of the governors in attendance included: Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna, Abdulrahaman Abudulrasak of Kwara, Hope Uzodinma of Imo, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, and Prof. Babagana Zullum of Borno States.\n\nAlso in attendance were; a former APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole; the 2023 APC presidential flagbearer and his running mate, Senator Bola Tinubu, Kashim Shettima respectively.\n\nWhen asked why his principal did not attend the rally, the media adviser to the Interior Minister, Mr Sola Fasure, said Aregbesola was not invited for the event.\n\nFasure, who also said Aregbesola was not a member of the APC campaign council for Osun poll, further noted that the Minister was attending an official event in Lagos on Tuesday.\n\nHe said, \u201cHe is not a member of the campaign committee, but officially he went to the Kirikiri Correctional Centre in Lagos. It was an official visit. He was not invited (for Osun rally). He is not in the campaign council. He was not invited by either the candidate or the party. There is also a case in court because he supported a candidate, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, and the case will come up on Thursday.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the rally, the APC National Chairman, Adamu declared that the party was not leaving anything to chance with Osun election.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a mega rally to promote our candidate. We are taking no chances with the affairs of Osun because the state deserves a leader like Oyetola in its quest for development. This is why we have come in full strength to support him in a bid to ensure his re-election. Those who have a fair mind will testify that he has done so much since he became governor in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe are here not only to testify to what he has done but to appeal to you to turn out in large numbers to vote massively for him. We are anticipating a better outcome than what we had in Ekiti and by the grace of God, we are sure of victory. I want you to be the APC ambassadors, telling those who are not here what you have seen. Continue to spread the good works of this government in the nooks and crannies of the state. We are not leaving any chances with the affairs of Osun.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, lauded Oyetola\u2019s efficiency in managing the state\u2019s meagre resources, calling on citizens to look beyond political sentiments in their choice of who to elect, and to vote massively for Oyetola.\n\nIn his remarks, the APC presidential flagbearer, Senator Bola Tinubu, urged the people of Osun State to replicate the victory recorded last month in Ekiti.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have come to ask that you vote massively on Saturday for the APC, not as a mark of entitlement, but because of the future of your children.\n\n\u201cBefore you make your decision, think of the future.

          "text": "\u2022 Says I would have voted APC but for Muslim-Muslim ticket\n\nFormer President, Goodluck Jonathan, no longer associates with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) because of the treatment meted out to him by members when he sought re-election in 2015.\n\nThis is according to Chief Edwin Clark, leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), who affirmed on Tuesday that Jonathan had learnt his lesson.\n\nSpeaking while hosting members of Delta Central APC Leaders of Thought on a solidarity visit in his Abuja residence, he said PDP leaders from the north worked against Jonathan as they claimed that it was the region\u2019s turn to produce the president.\n\nAccording to him, many of the PDP governors from the north mobilised funds for the then-candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Muhammadu Buhari, against their own presidential flag bearer.\n\nHe lamented that the same northern governors in the PDP who had rejected zoning were now talking about competence and integrity in 2022.\n\nThe former Federal Commissioner of Information accused the party of manipulation leading to the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as its presidential candidate for the 2023 election.\n\nChief Clark stated: \u201cNow coming home politically, Jonathan was the president for some time as the result of the death of President Yar\u2019Adua. Jonathan ruled for about five years, he is a Christian and the northerners said it was their turn.\n\n\u201cFrom 2011, they have been worrying Jonathan. Even in 2015, the northern PDP leaders ganged up with APC, Tinubu and removed Jonathan from office. They did not campaign, Jonathan was on his own.\n\n\u201cSo, when people say why Jonathan is not in PDP, not attending PDP meetings, I can safely say that he\u2019s learning his lesson that the people he trusted did not trust him. They squandered the party\u2019s money and left.\n\n\u201cSo, when people say why is Jonathan not in PDP, he knows how they betrayed him, how the northern PDP governors contributed money towards Buhari\u2019s success, how members of government betrayed him.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman of PDP at the time was Governor (Adamu) Mu\u2019azu. He did not go to his hometown to campaign, he was only following Jonathan about, he knew what he was doing. Every one of them wanted Buhari to win. So, Buhari won. He has ruled for eight years.\n\n\u201cNow, the same northerners are now saying competence, no zoning, integrity.\n\n\u201cIt fell for the prey, they manoeuvred PDP with Alhaji Abubakar who has been wanting to be president of Nigeria over the years, championing the cause of division. So, the PDP, a party we love, PDP a party of southern Nigeria disappointed us.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, 11 million people voted for Atiku Abubakar, PDP. Five million from the north, five million from the south. Now he doesn\u2019t think that we ever did anything for him.\n\n\u201cSo, Nigeria has changed. If anyone tells you that all is well in Nigeria that person living in a fool\u2019s paradise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to note that you are members of the ruling party that is APC and I will give you a message to Mr President, who is the leader of your party. But we are in the minority but in every society, the minority and the majority must live together. We have never seen a community where you have only the majority if that\u2019s the case amongst them some will become minority.\n\n\u201cWe are the largest ethnic nationality in Delta State but within you, some people are dominating. Because we are alive, we don\u2019t need this society where people are not equal. That\u2019s what Mandela fought for everybody is equal. People should live in a country where you grow up to do anything God created you to do.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that when governors of the Southern states insisted on zoning the presidency to the South, the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), where he is leader, bought into it, regretting however that despite agreement for Southerners not to accept the running mate position to any Northern presidential candidate, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, picked that or the PDP even though he hosted one of the governors meeting in Asaba.\n\nClark noted that the APC, which he thought the people of the South-South should have no business with had become the party that listened to the yearning of the region over zoning.\n\nHe said he would have voted for the ruling party but for his age and its decision to fly a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.\n\nThe elder statesman added: \u201cSeveral times we met here and before the PDP had their primary, we met here again and repeated the same thing.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know that our own Governor, who initiated this meeting if you agreed for a meeting to be held in your house and you backed out thereafter, you have betrayed your colleagues. Isn\u2019t it?\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why one of my cousins called Okowa miscreant.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m therefore very happy that you are here to give us not me alone our organization your support and they will hear it.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that up till today we still believe in the southern presidency. So that is why some of us had said that APC that we never wanted to talk about is the one that has listened to us by zoning the presidency to the south.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m an old man now, I will be 95, I no longer belong to political party. Perhaps if I were to vote, and you put only two parties, that is APC and PDP, I will vote for APC for zoning the presidency to the south, listening to our opinion.\n\n\u201cWho is Atiku? Who thinks that it is very, very important that people like us when we speak, he will not listen. A good leader must be one that will listen to us. So, if he becomes president what will he do?\u201d\n\nClark also accused the PDP presidential candidate of having been opposing Dr Jonathan since 2010.\n\n\u201cNow, Atiku has been kicking against the presidency of Jonathan since 2010. He said it was their turn but today, the same Atiku and his people now said integrity. Where in Nigeria\u2026all of you here have integrity, competence,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, he stated: \u201cYou know this time, the governors of the states they think they are so powerful.\n\n\u201cBut the only thing that your party has done that has made me withdraw my support is this Muslim-Muslim ticket. I won\u2019t talk about it, because I have written a statement.\u201d",

          "text": "Ahead of Saturday\u2019s Osun governorship election, twenty-one governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, have described the incumbent governor of the State and candidate of the party, Adegboyega Oyetola, as an excellent performer who has brought purpose to governance.\n\nThey said those who have a fair mind devoid of prejudices and biases will testify to the developmental strides Oyetola has registered since becoming governor of the State in 2018.\n\nThe progressive governors, therefore, reaffirmed their unalloyed support for Governor Oyetola just as they declared their readiness to do all necessary within the law to ensure his re-election.\n\nWhile addressing a mammoth crowd at the Mega rally held at the Osogbo Township Stadium on Tuesday, national leaders of the APC expressed confidence that the party will coast home to victory in overwhelming fashion come Saturday.\n\nThe Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, lauded Oyetola\u2019s prudence and efficiency in managing the state\u2019s meagre resources, calling on citizens to look beyond political sentiments in their choice of who to elect, and to vote massively for Oyetola.\n\nLawan said: \u201cI\u2019m bringing solidarity from the National Assembly. We are believers of this party and its candidate because Osun has witnessed serious and massive transformation in the last three and a half years.\n\n\u201cWe have a governor who is prudent and efficient in the face of very meagre resources. Today, Osun has witnessed so much infrastructural development, political stability and peace. We believe that we have everything we need for development with this our Governor\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the presidential flag-bearer of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, urged the people of Osun to replicate the victory recorded last month in Ekiti.\n\nAccording to Tinubu: \u201cWe have come to ask that you vote massively on Saturday for APC, not as a mark of entitlement but because of the future of your children.\n\n\u201cBefore you make your decision, think of the future. We are a party that guarantees your future because we are known for fulfilling our promises. Let us entrust the affairs of our state into the hands of those who mean business, not mushroom parties\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the National Chairman of the Party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, said the mega rally was an indication that the APC was not taking any chances with the affairs of Osun, saying the State deserves a leader like Oyetola in its quest for development.\n\nAdamu said: \u201cThis is a mega rally to promote our candidate. We are taking no chances with the affairs of Osun because the state deserves a leader like Oyetola in its quest for development. This is why we have come in full strength to support him in a bid to ensure his re-election. Those who have a fair mind will testify that he has done so much since he became governor in 2018.\n\n\u201cWe are here not only to testify to what he has done but to appeal to you to turn out in large numbers to vote massively for him. We are anticipating a better outcome than what we had in Ekiti and by the grace of God, we are sure of victory. I want you to be the APC ambassadors, telling those who are not here what you have seen. Continue to spread the good works of this government in the nooks and crannies of the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of his colleagues, Chairman of the\n\nNigeria Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, assured that Oyetola has the backing of all APC governors in the coming election, saying he had earned it with his outstanding performance.\n\nBagudu also lauded the tremendous and landmark developments Osun had recorded across sectors since Oyetola\u2019s emergence.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to be here today, we are proud to hear about the numerous progress that this administration in Osun has recorded. We are confident that the love and admiration of the people of Osun are with you because of your great achievements.\n\n\u201cToday, we are here for this grand rally and honoured to be here to throw our support behind you. We did it about four years ago, and you were elected based on what you can do. Now, we are here again to show solidarity based on what you have done.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring the citizens of Osun that this gentleman Governor will continue to do what is healthy for our democracy. He did not disappoint in the first term, he won\u2019t disappoint in the second term,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the National Campaign Council for Osun governorship election and Lagos State Governor, Babajide SanwoOlu, described Oyetola as deserving of another term based on his personal encounters with the people of the State.\n\nIn his words; \u201cWe thank the originator of IleriOluwa political slogan, our dear Governor Oyetola, the one because of whom we are here. Indeed, it is a huge honour that we stand here today because this is a worthy assignment and we have a sellable candidate. It is a job that is gratifying and doable because Governor Oyetola has indeed performed excellently well.\n\n\u201cI have been on campaign trail with him and I have witnessed the overwhelming support and how the people have said he is deserving of another term.\n\n\u201cPeople of Osun, do not be deceived by those who are trying to say otherwise. Let us vote massively for Oyetola to continue doing his great works for every sector of the population. This is a man that that is an embodiment of good governance.\u201d\n\nWhile welcoming members of the National Campaign Council to the State, the Director-General of Oyetola\u2019s re-election Campaign Council, Senator Ajibola Basiru, described the grand rally as a celebration of excellence.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, you are being welcomed to the celebration of excellence in governance because in the last three and a half years, Governor Oyetola has brought dexterity, commitment and integrity to the affairs of this state across sectors.\n\n\u201cNow, we are on the path to consolidating the progress and development of the state by re-electing that man that is certain to deliver development over and over. With him, Osun is on the path of sustainable development\u201d.\n\nIn his short remarks, Governor Oyetola, said Osun is on the path of consolidating on the gains of the last three and a half years.\n\nHe urged the people of Osun, especially workers, to shun political traducers who are peddling falsehood that his administration will renege in its commitment to their welfare if re-elected, saying he remains strongly committed to their welfare.\n\nOyetola also declared his readiness to do beyond what he has done in his first term, saying the welfare of workers and citizens and the overall development of Osun remains his priority.",

          "title": "Osun July 16 governorship poll: INEC warns on vote-buying, insists on Electoral Offences Commission, Tribunal",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has cautioned against vote-buying and called for the establishment of the Electoral Offences Commission and Tribunal as recommended by the Uwais Committee in 2009, reinforced by the Lemu Committee in 2011 and the Nnamani Committee in 2017.\n\nThe commission expressed delight that the Electoral Offences Commission and Tribunal Bill is under consideration by the National Assembly, saying \u201cINEC supports this initiative and appeals to the National Assembly for a speedy conclusion and passage of the Bill into law.\u201d\n\nINEC Chairman Professor Yakubu Mahmood stated this at the stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Osogbo Tuesday preparatory to the governorship election.\n\nHe assured the state that the commission was taking seriously the issues of inclusivity, transparency, credibility and security in the conduct of the July 16 governorship elections.\n\nYakubu said the choice of who becomes the next governor in the state is entirely in the hands of Osun state voters.\n\nTo this end, the commission said political parties and their candidates would sign the Peace Accord today (Wednesday) to be chaired by the former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd).\n\n\u201cI would like to seize this opportunity to invite you all to the signing of the Peace Accord by parties and candidates under the auspices of the National Peace Committee chaired by our respected former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar GCFR. The occasion is holding in this hall at 10am tomorrow Wednesday 13th July 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nOn inclusive election, the INEC boss said: \u201cTo underscore our commitment to an inclusive, credible and transparent electoral process, the commission is deploying assistive devices for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) to have a more pleasant voting experience on election day.\n\n\u201cMagnifying glasses, Braille Ballot Guide and Posters for voters with hard of hearing conditions will be deployed at polling unit level in areas of need based on data collected in collaboration with the PwD community.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, our revised regulations and guidelines provide for priority to be accorded at polling units to PwDs without waiting in long queues during voting as is the case with elderly people, pregnant women and nursing mothers.\n\n\u201cBeyond these measures, we also want to make PwDs to get more involved in election administration like everyone else. In this regard, the 2022 Osun state governorship election will also make history, being the first election in which INEC is deploying PwDs as ad hoc staff.\n\n\u201cThirty-five (35) serving NYSC members with one form of disability or another have been identified, trained and engaged as ad hoc staff at polling unit level. I appeal to all stakeholders to cooperate with, and protect them, as well as all other ad hoc staff, in our effort to make our electoral process more inclusive and participatory.\n\n\u201cFor us in INEC, let me reassure political parties, candidates and the electorate that the choice of who becomes the next Governor of Osun State is entirely in the hands of voters. As I have repeatedly said in previous engagements with stakeholders, INEC will not take any action to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on the processes and procedures as provided by law. So far, we have successfully implemented 12 out of 14 activities contained in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the election. The only two outstanding activities are the last day of campaign by political parties which ends at midnight on Thursday 14th July 2022 and Election Day activities on Saturday 16th July 2022.\u201d\n\nOn the preparations made for the July 16 election, Yakubu said: \u201cThe commission has taken every step and made every arrangement for the successful conduct of the Governorship election this weekend.\n\n\u201cWe held consultative meetings with political parties and their candidates. We had several engagements with the security agencies at national, state and Local Government levels. We consulted with stakeholders. We sought for, and received, the blessings of Royal Fathers and religious leaders.\n\n\u201cWe have recruited, trained and carefully screened all categories of ad-hoc staff to be deployed to the field. All non-sensitive materials for the election have been delivered to all our 30 Local Government Area offices across the state.\u201d\n\nThe chairman also stated that \u201cvoter education and sensitisation is ongoing. We have made arrangements for the transportation of personnel and materials to ensure that polling units open on schedule on election day.\n\n\u201cFor a more effective supervision of the process, we are deploying five National Commissioners, twelve Resident Electoral Commissioners and many senior officials to support our State office here in Osun to deliver credible elections.\n\nOn voter registration, the chairman said, \u201cVoter registration was carried out all over the state, including the devolution of the exercise to the 332 Wards across the State.\n\n\u201cWe have printed and delivered the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) for collection by all valid registrants in the State. When we visited Osun last week to assess our readiness for the election, concerns were expressed about the availability of the PVCs especially for those who applied for transfer of their registration to Osun State or to new locations within the State.\n\n\u201cI am glad to report that we have delivered the PVCs for fresh registrants, transfers and requests for replacement of cards as a result of loss, damage or incorrect personal details such as names, dates of birth etc. as provided by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn our effort to ensure that more voters collect their PVCs before the election the commission \u201cdevolved the collection of PVCs from our 30 Local Government offices to each of the 332 Wards across the State, thereby increasing the number of collection centres and bringing the process closer to voters,\u201d the INEC boss further said.\n\nOther steps taken by the commission, he said, included \u201cworking all days of the week, including the weekend and public holidays to serve voters; and \u201cextending the last date for the collection of PVCs to Thursday14th July 2022 i.e. 24 hours to the election.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to all registered voters that are yet to collect their PVCs to seize the opportunity of the additional measures to do so.\n\n\u201cMany of the PVCs have already been collected by citizens. Of the 1,955,657 registered voters in Osun State, 1,479,595 (or 76%) have collected their cards as at Sunday 10th July 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are also updating our records to provide detailed breakdown of PVCs collected by polling units. This will be concluded and made available on Friday 15th July 2022.\n\n\u201cThis is important because the total number of PVCs collected will be used to determine the margin of lead principle, as against the total number of registered voters in line with our Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Elections 2022 derived from the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022,\u201d he further added.\n\nOn the deployment of technology, the INEC boss said, \u201cthe Commission continues to deploy technology in the electoral process both as a matter of practice and a requirement of the law. The Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) will be deployed for voter accreditation and uploading of election results on the INEC Result Viewing (IReV) portal on Election Day.\n\n\u201cSteps have been taken to ensure that the BVAS machines function optimally during voter accreditation based on lessons learnt from the conduct of recent elections. A few weeks ago, mock accreditation exercise was conducted in polling units across the State.\n\n\u201cI personally observed the exercise in Osogbo and Boripe LGAs in Osun Central as well as Ede South and Egbedore LGAs in Osun West Senatorial Districts. I also visited our Ife Central, Ife East and Ife North LGA offices in Osun East Senatorial District.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the successful outcome of the mock exercise and the level of preparations by our offices. We have also trained enough Registration Area Technical Support Staff (RATECHs) and made adequate transportation arrangements for their rapid response in the event of reported glitches on election day.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has accredited Polling Agents nominated by political parties for the 3,763 polling units, 332 Ward collation centres, 30 Local Government Area collation centres and the State Collation Centre where the final declaration of result will be made.\n\n\u201cAs an indication of the intense national and international interest in the 2022 Osun state governorship election, 87 Observer groups (79 domestic and 8 international) deploying a total of 7,790 field observers have been accredited for the election.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 94 media organisations (92 national and 2 international) deploying 624 journalists have been accredited to cover the election.\n\n\u201cOn election day, the national headquarters of INEC in Abuja will monitor the election throughout the State. Our Zoom Situation Room will be activated. We are working to ensure that accredited observers and the media are invited to join us at intervals to provide live reports from the field.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, citizens can contact us on our various platforms such as the toll-free INEC Citizens Contact Centre (ICCC) telephone line in addition to our Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts.\u201d\n\nVote-buying\n\nHe also spoke on vote-buying. \u201cI cannot conclude my remarks without addressing a matter of serious concern to our elections. Here, I am referring to sundry violations of our electoral law, including the diabolical practice of vote buying in which voters are financially induced to vote one way or another.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the more the commission and other stakeholders work hard to progressively improve the quality of national elections in Nigeria, the more some retrogressive elements try to undermine the process.\n\n\u201cWhile we will continue to work with the security and anti-corruption agencies to confront this challenge, our effort will be given a boost by the establishment of the Electoral Offences Commission and Tribunal as recommended by the Uwais Committee in 2009, reinforced by the Lemu Committee in 2011 and the Nnamani Committee in 2017.\n\n\u201cHappily, the Electoral Offences Commission and Tribunal Bill is under consideration of the National Assembly. INEC supports this initiative and appeals to the National Assembly for a speedy conclusion and passage of the Bill into law.\u201d\n\nUtomi, Falana, others caution\n\nin a related development, several Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) under the aegis of Civil Society Committee for Anti-Fraud Election Security(CISCAES), have set up an anti-rigging war room to monitor, track and counter any fraudulent practices at the forthcoming governorship election in Osun state on Saturday, July 16, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Lagos Monday, one of the leaders of the group, Prof Pat Utomi said the initiative was part of an effort at ensuring a free and fair election into Osun and by extension Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\n\nUtomi who is the chairman of the National Consultative Front(NCF), said if the Osun governorship poll is not free and fair, it would ultimately impose a huge threat on the anticipated credibility of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe direct immediate consequence would become \u201cvoter apathy\u201d in 2023 for lack of confidence in the ability of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct transparent, fair and credible 2023 polls,\u201d they said.\n\n\n\nAlso speaking, human rights lawyer, Barrister Femi Falana (SAN), explained that the anti-rigging electoral \u201cWar Room\u201d, would help track, identify and dismantle the already existing vote-rigging mechanism.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the measure which becomes fully operational Wednesday July 13, would help monitor, track and counter the ongoing fraudulent practices, both before and during the election.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere cases of fraud or vote-rigging are identified, such shall be rightly reported to our own CSO-driven anti-rigging War Room (Situation Room) for immediate and needful interventions.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe arraignment of the Electoral offenders will serve as a deterrent to all electoral offenders and prevent any form of impunity in the Osun State gubernatorial election fixed for July 16, 2022,\u201d he said\n\n\n\nAlso speaking, Comrade Kennedy Iyere, who is the founder of CISCAES and Youth Off The Street Initiative, explained that the group would also organise and lead a pre-election \u201cBallot Security Solidarity March\u201d to INEC Office in Osogbo to draw the attention of the general public to the critical need for a credible \u201cOsun 2022 Guber-Poll.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also added that CISCAES and its allies will sensitize, train, recruit, mobilize and deploy youths as volunteers for \u201cward-2-ward\u201d and \u201cPolling Unit-2-Polling Unit\u201d anti-rigging ballot monitoring exercise.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is designed to enforce ballot policing by youth voters and other electorates at their various wards and Polling units.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis intervention shall compel ballot security and surveillance which will make it too difficult or impossible for INEC to either manipulate the BVAS or effect other technical vote-rigging measures,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther members of the group include: Emmanuel Ijewere, President of Agribusiness group; Ambassador Sylvester Okoduwa, Regional Coordinator of Transition Monitoring Group; Dr. Tanko Yunusa, spokesperson of the National Consultative Front (NCF); Funke Awolowo, Steering Committee Member of the National Consultative Front (NCF); Comrade Abdulazeez Ismail Abiodun, Chairman of Osun State Chapter of the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN).\n\n\n\nOthers are: Barrister Christian Wogu, President, Schechinal Law House; Olawale Okunniyi, DG, National Consultative Front (NCFront); Comrade Oloye Adegboyega Adeniji, Lagos State Chairman and National Coordinator of Peace Action Transformation (PACT); Alhaji Waheed Lawan, Chairman of Osun State Network of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and Comrade Michael Ebofin, President of Network of NGOs in Osun State (NETNOS).\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "Mining: Research, devt pivotal to achieving economic diversification- Asuquo",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General/ CEO, National Metallurgical Development Center, NMDC, Jos, Engr. Prof. Linus Asuquo has said that research and development should be given priority if the nation was bent on achieving its goals on economic diversification.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in an interview granted in Abuja, Asuquo noted that capacity building interms of training and retraining of human capacity was important for the growth and development of the economy.\n\nHe said that at the NMDC, there was need to renovate some of the structures to give it a conducive emblem for research and development and such efforts been put in place has ensured its effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nHe explained \u201cOn capacity building in terms of human capacity building, we have done enough to train our people for research and development, we need to train and retrain, we have done that locally and internationally, we have sent some of our staff to Australia, Japan and to South Africa for training, the essence of that is that our research and development must be productive. If you lack in training you can not go forward, and the people have stayed there for many years without adequate training, so they have now been trained.\n\n\u201cIf we are to go forward in this country for research and development, that is where our priority should be, if we really want to develop in this country. If we want to diversify our economy, we can not diversify without meaningful research and Development as a lot of research has to be done for us to go forward.\u201d\n\nThe NMDC boss who was appointed in July 2018 disclosed that the inability to analyze the materials used for building projects was one of the factors contributing to building collapse in the country.\n\nHe said that individuals and construction companies used scrap metal to produce metals without allowing NMDC to effectively carry out their job.\n\nIn his words:\u201dWe have to analyze even though we have SON, but we are the ones to analyze the type of materials , whether they are fit for building or not. So that has also been a challenge for NMDC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development of the Centre, he continued \u201cbecause I found out that the security of that place was very poor and incident of thefts was almost on a weekly basis; so I had to beef up security of the place by contacting security personnel, the Police, the SSS, and the Civil Defence and they were ready to cooperate and since then, the theft incident reduced to the nearest minimum.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there was need to restructure the management for effective and efficient running of the Centre, hence the restructuring of departments from nine to seven and placing the right people in the right places and this he confirmed has yielded dividends.\n\nAsuquo also said \u201cwith the very poor power supply in the country and for any meaningful research, power was necessary and there was no power. We were going with a small generator and we could not do any effective research, so I had to find an alternative power source by solar system so we had to install the solar system in all the laboratories for effective analysis and now people can analyse using our equipment.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the core mandate of the Metallurgical Center, the Director General, further explained \u201cstarting with exploration, let me say that in this country we have identified 44 strategic minerals in the country, in 500 locations and therefore, for us to be effective we have to analyze, NMDC has to work on mineral processing and then in the metal sector, we have to know the type of minerals we have in the country, the compositions, and so forth. So that was a challenge for us to have a laboratory ready.\n\n\u201cBut this place was established as far back as 1973, as a research laboratory for the then steel plant , so you believe that from 1973 till the time I came, the equipment were very obsolete, some of them were not useful again, therefore there was need to find the state of the art equipment to do meaningful research and we were able to procure state of the art equipment for research and Development.\n\n\u201cAnd am pleased to inform you that right now, NMDC, even though not sufficient because the recent development is capital intensive, we now have the state of the art equipment to analyze these minerals that we have: apart from that, we also have the methodology department for some analysis.\n\n\u201cNigeria has iron ore in Itakpe, which is of very high iron concentration but this was meant for Delta State Company because it has about 250 millions turns of iron but we have another iron ore in Akpaja about three billion turns that will take so many years, no research has been done on it to find whether is suitable or not , that is our own work in NMDC, to find out whether the Akpaja iron ore will be suitable, of course is suitable, I worked on that in 1990/ 1991, to find out ways that Akpaja iron ore could be used for our Steel plant by selective calculation which we have to use cassava starch to make flux sarage, even though it has some phosphorus, it\u2019s not a problem because that can be dephosphorised during the processing.\u201d\n\nOn coal, Asuquo revealed that, \u201cone of the materials that we use for iron making is Coal and a lot of work has been done in NMDC about coal and unfortunately most of our coal, even though we have in abundance like Enugu coal, they are not prime coating coal, that is you cannot have real coal, hundred percent coke from that coal, so what we have done in our research is to use the lavia Obi coal and blend with the imported coal to form our coke, that will reduce the cost of production, importation and thus, foreign exchange will be reserved. We have also worked sufficiently on our coal.\n\n\u201cJust last week, we have acquired scanning electron microscope which is the state of the art equipment for metal and mineral processing and two people had to come from UK to train our staff, which was a human capacity training. We trained about ten people which will be enough to train others in the place on how to use this.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development for its intervention in the development of the Centre which includes renovation of seven of its buildings, procurement of equipment such as the scanning electron microscope and a lapping polishing machine adding that \u201csome teams are coming from South Africa to train our staff on this lapping polishing machine. With such capacity building, we are set to do meaningful research and Development compared to what we saw before.\u201d\n\nOn the challenges confronted so far, the DG said \u201cthere are lots of changes, research and Development is capital intensive in any country, by the grace of God I have been able to in my span of sixty eight years to travel to more than fifty six countries of the world and I have seen that research and Development is capital intensive, the whole world is putting attention in research and Development, people are budgeting between three to four percent GDP for research and Development and I want to thank Mr. President because recently, he increase form zero point one to zero point five but that is still very inadequate.\u201d\n\nProjecting into the coming years, in the steel sector, Engr. Asuquo said: \u201cLike I said, if we have adequate funding and we pay attention to what we are doing, given priority we should be expecting development in the country. Let me say this, as I have repeated many times, we should not play with the Ajaokuta Steel company. A lot of politics has been toiling with it over the years, if you know the quntoms of metals imported into this country, then you know where we are. We are spending some billions of naira to important metals, now considering the railways we are constructing, if we have Ajaokuta Steel company working, I don\u2019t think we should have been importing these metals , we would have reserved our economy, we would have created more employment for our youths, there would be skill acquisition and so on, the benefits are numerous.\n\n\u201cSo, if we start doing research and development and the Ajaokuta Steel Company is working, there will be development, without Ajaokuta working, then we are just playing lip service. Also there must be a political will in this country for us to say this is our priority.\u201d\n\nReacting to the claim that the Ajaokuta Steel Company was outdated, he said, \u201cpeople who say that are not informed, if you do a lot of research, you will know that Russia cannot do without blast furnace, even Indian cannot do without blast furnace. I was in India in the year 2000 and they were producing hundred million tonnes of steel in that year and that was the method were they using there. We just seat down at home here and criticize that our Ajaokuta Steel Company is outdated.\n\n\u201cWhat are the new methods that can be used in the production of Iron and Steel except the blast furnace, a lot of people are saying nobody is using coal, Russia is using coal, China is using coal, so what are we talking about? Everyone wants to be an engineer now, Nigerians like to talk but when it comes to practical terms to proffer solutions they go silent.\n\n\u201cAny person that have seen the amount of money spent in Ajaokuta, to scrap that place will be a colossal waste, and suicidal. Even if it\u2019s outdated, we can modernize it into sections; that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Ajaokuta Steel Company. Starting from the blast furnace, where they will produce iron , after that you produce steel, from Steel, you have a continuous casting, where you produce rods.\u201d\n\nHe further added \u201cDid you know you can generate power from the Ajaokuta Steel Company to so many States , we should not just start at once, we can think big and start small.\u201d\n\nOn NMDC\u2019s collaboration with other MDA\u2019s for wealth creation, Asuquo further stated that in December 2020, it had collaborated with Defence Industry Corporation of Nigeria, DICON and has also signed an MOU with NASENI.\n\n\u201cDICON was importing armaments from China and I wrote to them that we have that capacity to produce their raw materials, instead of importing brass from China, we could produce for them, the DG visited us twice with his team and was excited with what he saw and what we were doing, and then sent a technician team to us to evaluate and the MOU was signed on December 3rd, 2020, to produce the raw materials for them, if such a thing is implemented, I can tell you that I may not need money from government because the billions they were using in importing, if they give that to us it will be sufficient for our research and development. We can generate enough revenue when we collaborate with these organisations, recently, we have signed an MOU with NASENI to collaborate to generate revenue, the Executive Vice Chairman came with his team and we are working with them on some meaningful research. Before you talk about generating revenue, something has to be done before generating revenue which is to equip the place.\u201d",
          "summary": "Prof. Linus Asuquo has said that research and development should be given priority if the nation was bent on achieving its goals on economic diversification.\nLet me say this, as I have repeated many times, we should not play with the Ajaokuta Steel company.\n\u201cSo, if we start doing research and development and the Ajaokuta Steel Company is working, there will be development, without Ajaokuta working, then we are just playing lip service.\nWe just seat down at home here and criticize that our Ajaokuta Steel Company is outdated.\nEven if it\u2019s outdated, we can modernize it into sections; that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Ajaokuta Steel Company.",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T.

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

          "title": "2023: Tinubu\u2019s Muslim-Muslim Ticket Is \u2018A Disastrous Error, Dead On Arrival\u2019 \u2013 Babachir Lawal",
          "text": "Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has faulted the announcement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket by the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nLawal, in a note he personally signed on Tuesday, described the decision as a \u201cdisastrous error.\u201d\n\nMr Tinubu on Sunday had announced former Borno State Governor, Kassim Shettima, as his running mate in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nBoth men are Muslims.\n\nREAD ALSO: Tinubu, Lawan, APC Governors Campaign For Oyetola In Osogbo\n\nMr Lawal, who backed Tinubu during the APC presidential primaries, said the choice of Mr Shettima was a sign that the APC presidential candidate has \u201cbeen cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe northern governors and some northern moslem elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them,\u201d Mr Lawal said.\n\n\u201cBut if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he should have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\u201d\n\nRead Mr Babachir\u2019s full note below:\n\nI thought I will be able to avoid commenting on the disastrous error by my very good friend, Sen Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his choice of a running mate.\n\nI will be the very last person to stand in the way of my very good friend Tinubu\u2019s path to the presidency. This is because since 2011 my consuming passion has been for him to succeed Buhari as President of Nigeria.\n\nIt will not be true if I say that I did not see it coming. I have often read his body language, picked up snippets from several discussions with his lapdogs (some of whom, sadly are Christians but most of whom are moslems) and I have conveyed my reservations to them against the pitfalls of a moslem-moslem ticket towards which I sensed they were drifting.\n\nAs part of my obligation to him, a close friend, I had on many occasions argued the merits and demerits of both ticket permutations to him. I have done so in both verbal and written form and I have likewise, done so with some of his close respectable associates and friends. In all instances I had left him with the sole responsibility for his final decision arguing that in the end the consequences of the outcome of any bad decision will be his to\n\nbear. There might be some collateral damages though. I have also on several occasions passed on to him counsels and messages from some well meaning Nigerians intended to alert him on the possible outcomes of the Presidential ticket permutations.\n\nTinubu is a very good man. He is a great listener. He has a very humble and friendly disposition to every one. He is very generous in both cash and kind, especially where it could advance his political interests. But I have realized that it is in the nature of power that sycophants and lapdogs have the most influence on leaders with such character traits. They will lie to him, malign and disparage others and generally do any thing to curry his favor and to also put well-meaning associates in bad light. I suspect this is what has\n\nhappened to my friend. He has been cornered by self-serving, hero-worshiping, lapdogs.\n\nIt never used to be like this. While in his hay-days in Lagos, he surrounded himself with smart, street-wise guys that could tell truth to power. He had Rauph Aregbesola, Yomi Osinbajo, Babatunde Fashola, Dele Alake, Muiz Banire, etc.The Lagos days were the days of think-tanks, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, principles and ideologies. But\n\nthese people have since grown-up and moved up to establish their own systems living my friend stranded. Nature they say abhors vacuum.\n\nWelcome the Abuja equivalent. But the Abuja equivalent are people inflicted with the modern Nigerian diseases \u2013 religious bigotry, sycophancy and morbid tribalism. They are mostly political jobbers who are most times not averse to the application of diabolical means. Gone are the days of think-tanks, and strategic planning. Gone are the days of principles and ideologies. Try and call a meeting; they will not attend. Try and make a plan; they will sabotage it. Everything is ad-hoc, everything is chaotic because they excel in such environments. The result is that they have played on his longterm ambition to be President and have built it into a sort of desperation and a crescendo that easily justifies this satanic resort to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. This is the calamity that has befallen my\n\nfriend.\n\nAnd why Kashim Shetima? He is an overambitious man who has a Machiavellian bent and has lots of money with which to procure a preferred-candidate status among Tinubu\u2019s lapdogs. And as we are beginning to see, to also procure bogus supporters especially from among the Christian community to help launder his no-so-good image.\n\nBut as a popular proverb goes: \u201cThose whom the gods want to destroy they first make mad\u201d. It appears that the gods want to destroy the APC and its Presidential Candidate and have chosen the instrumentality of the northern Moslem governors and their super ambitious tool and Kashim Ibrahim for this purpose. Alhaji Kashim Shetima is a Greek gift from the Northern governors to Tinubu. I advise Bola to make sure Kashima\u2019s two hands are always in his plain sight and empty.\n\nTrue, based on the advise of his new friends, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has made his choice. And I am sure he thinks he is ready for the out come of that choice. He has chosen to bring religion to the front burner of Nigerian politics. And being a Muslim he has chosen to take sides with his own religion. For all he cares, Christians can go to blazes with their\n\nvotes. But he must also be told that there will consequences for this choice. Some of them are that Christians all over the country will revolt against the APC to put the chances of his election in serious jeopardy. It will also put the election of all Christians standing for elections in Christian dominated areas in jeopardy. This could result in APC being a minority party in both the National and State Houses of Assembly.\n\nNow tell me which Christian will vote for APC with the following contraption: Moslem Presidential Candidate (Lagos), Moslem Vice Presidential Candidate (Borno), Moslem National Chairman (Nasarawa), Moslem Deputy National Chairman (Borno), Moslem President (Katsina); Moslem Senate President (Yobe); Moslem Speaker (Lagos); Moslem Deputy Speaker (Plateau) e.t.c. APC the great! Wu na de try woh!\n\nThe northern governors and some northern moslem elites must have persuaded him that they will never vote for a ticket that has a northern Christian on it. And he has agreed with them. But if he thinks a Moslem-Moslem ticket will win him the northern Muslim votes, he\n\nshould have a rethink. They will massively vote for one of their sons because it is in their nature to do so. Buhari, their first son will not be on the ballot in 2023. Atiku their second son will be.\n\nProof of a possible Islamic agenda was leaked when Governor Ganduje, the \u201cKadmul Islam\u201d, gave advance notice that Tinubu had assured them he would be nominating a moslem as his running mate. For those who might not know, Governor Ganduje has a foundation called \u201cGanduje Foundation\u201d which purpose according to its website is to \u201cprovide selfless service to humanity and Islam\u201d but whose primary purpose it appears is the conversion of Christians to Islam.\n\nSo if my very good friend Tinubu in a desperate bid to become President allows himself to made into a religious bigot or even a mujahideen, he is welcome. But it is a risk that will not play out positively for his presidential bid. But, were he to win and become President of Nigeria, it will be as a sectional President; an Islamic President. And he will surely face\n\nmassive discontent and opposition even before taking off.\n\nExpecting Nigerians to ignore this crass insensitivity to the country\u2019s diversity amounts to acceding to the perpetration of very grave injustice and discrimination against a huge segment of the society. No one who seeks to be president of Nigeria should ever deploy the tool of religious extremism and exclusivism as a tool to win elections. This is very very\n\ndangerous. And this is very sad.\n\nBut, baring any last minute change of mind, Bola has made his choice. He should be bluntly told that in this choice Nigerian Christians clearly see a pending Islamic Republic\n\nof Nigeria in its infancy and are right to be severely anxious. There is gloom among the Christian community all over the country since Tinubu announced Kashim Shetima as his running mate. Are the generality of the moslem ummah happy with this? The answer is a resounding NO.\n\nHow then do we respond? The decision as to how to respond to this deliberately senseless act of provocation is both corporate to each religious group and also personal to each voter that love peace, and hate injustice. Christians want to continue to leave peacefully with their moslem neighbors at home, at school, at the work place, in the markets and on the streets as we have always done or desired to do. And I am sure Moslems share this view too. No one person\u2019s ambition to rule over us should be allowed\n\nto set us apart and at war with one another.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu, should be compelled upon by whoever can do so to rescind this decision. President Mohammed Buhari should exercise his powers as the Commander-inChief and as the APC Leader to revoke this nomination of a VP by Tinubu. The APC National Chairman should refuse to sign the nomination forms if not rescinded.\n\nThere is a story in the bible on how some people responded to similar provocation: \u201cAnd when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king,\n\n\u201cWhat portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David.\u201d So Israel went to their tents\u201d (1 Kings 12:16).\n\nI will love for Bola to be our next President. But I am afraid a Moslem-Moslem ticket will be \u201cDead on Arrival\u201d. And the arrival date according to INEC\u2019s election time table is 25th February, 2023. This ticket will drag down the whole APC members to the pit. We all should reject it.\n\nEngr. Babachir Lawal",

          "text": "No fewer than 13 million Nigerians are in possession of digital assets, as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has rated the West African country third among countries with the highest number of cryptocurrency holders in Africa.\n\nLatest data from the UN agency\u2019s policy brief indicated that the country was trailing Kenya and South Africa, with about 6.3 per cent of the Nigerian population owning or holding cryptocurrencies.\n\nFrom the country\u2019s estimated population of 211 million inhabitants, this meant that a little over 13 million were owners of digital currencies in 2021.\n\nThe UNCTAD policy brief put Kenya ahead of Nigeria and South Africa with the highest proportion of crypto-owning inhabitants than any other African country.\n\nKenya\u2019s digital currency ownership of 8.5 per cent as a share of the population was the highest in Africa and the fifth-highest globally.\n\nOnly Ukraine with 12.7 per cent), Russia (11.9 per cent), Venezuela (10.3 per cent), and Singapore (9.4 per cent) have a higher proportion of crypto-owning residents than Kenya globally.\n\nSouth Africa was the second-ranked country in Africa and eighth globally, with 7.1 per cent of the population that owned or held cryptocurrencies in 2021.\n\nAlthough the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) restriction on banks to allow trading in crypto currency subsist, Nigeria is currently one of the biggest cryptocurrency markets globally.\n\nSix Nigerian banks were in April reportedly fined N1.315 billion by the CBN in the 2021 financial year for failing to comply with the apex bank\u2019s directive prohibiting their customers from trading in cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently released guidelines on the liberalisation of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOut of the 20 countries that were surveyed by UNCTAD in the latest policy brief, Australia was found to have the least percentage of its population (3.4 per cent) that owned cryptocurrency in the said period.\n\nUNCTAD acknowledged that cryptocurrencies have grown in their popularity because they are, \u201can attractive channel through which to send remittances.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations agency also revealed that it found that middle-income individuals from inflation-hit developing countries own or hold cryptocurrencies because they are seen, \u201cas a way to protect household savings.\u201d\n\nHowever, based on its findings, the UNCTAD stated that it determined that, \u201cthe use of cryptocurrencies may lead to financial instability risks,\u201d adding that their use potentially opens \u201ca new channel for illicit financial flows.\u201d\n\nThe UNCTAD policy brief added: \u201cFinally, if left unchecked, cryptocurrencies may become a widespread means of payment and even replace domestic currencies unofficially (a process called cryptoisation), which could jeopardise the monetary sovereignty of countries.\n\n\u201cThe use of stablecoins poses the greatest risks in developing countries with unmet demand for reserve currencies.\u201d\n\nTo minimise some of these risks, UNCTAD recommended the imposition of taxes that discourages crypto trading, including \u201cthe mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets.\u201d\n\nThe agency also recommended imposing, \u201centry fees for crypto-exchanges\u201d or levying taxes on cryptocurrency trading.\n\nDoing this, it stated, would make the use of cryptocurrencies less attractive, even as he prescribed the restriction of cryptocurrency advertisements and the issuing of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nMeanwhile, the value of global trade rose to a record $7.7 trillion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, an increase of about $1 trillion in the corresponding period of 2021, a report by the UNCTAD has stated.\n\nThe just-released UNCTAD Global Trade Update revealed that the growth, which represents a rise of about $250 million relative to Q4 2021, was fuelled by rising commodity prices, as trade volumes have increased to a much lower extent.\n\nAccording to the report, although expected to remain positive, trade growth has continued to slow during Q2 2022.\n\n\u201cThe war in Ukraine is starting to influence international trade, largely through increases in prices,\u201d the report noted.\n\nIt affirmed that rising interest rates and the winding down of economic stimulus packages would likely have a negative impact on trade volumes for the rest of 2022, even as volatility in commodity prices and geopolitical factors would also continue to make trade developments uncertain.\n\nThe report stressed that trade growth rates in Q1 2022 remained strong across all geographic regions, although somewhat lower in the East Asia and Pacific regions.\n\nExport growth has been generally stronger in commodity-exporting regions, as commodity prices have increased.\n\nTrade in merchandise goods reached about $6.1 trillion, an increase of about 25 per cent relative to Q1 2021, and a jump of about 3.6 per cent when compared to to Q4 2021.\n\nThe value of merchandise exports from developing countries was about 25 per cent higher in Q1 2022 than in Q1 2021.\n\nIn comparison, the figure is about 14 per cent for developed countries.\n\nMerchandise trade between developing countries also strongly grew during Q1 2022\n\nTrade in services grew to about $1.6 trillion, an increase of about 22 per cent relative to Q1 2021, and a rise of about 1.7 per cent relative to Q4 2021.\n\nThe report showed that most economic sectors recorded substantial year-over-year increases in the value of their trade in Q1 2022.\n\nHigh fuel prices were behind the strong increase in the value of trade in the energy sector, it noted.\n\nTrade growth was also above average for metals and chemicals.\n\nBy contrast, trade in the transportation sector and in communication equipment has remained below the levels of 2021 and 2019.\n\nThe report stated that the evolution of world trade for the remainder of 2022 was likely to be affected by slower-than-expected economic growth due to rising interest rates, inflationary pressures and concerns over debt sustainability in many economies.\n\nThe report pointed out that the war in Ukraine was affecting international trade by putting further upward pressure on the international prices of energy and primary commodities.\n\nIn the short term, because of the inelastic global demand for food and energy products, rising food and energy prices would likely result in higher trade values, and marginally lower trade volumes.\n\nOther factors expected to influence global trade this year are

          "text": "Europe\u2019s growing pressure on Nigeria and a handful of other African countries to produce more gas for export, while declining to fund such projects citing carbon emission reasons has hypocrisy written all over it.\n\nThis is according to a Bloomberg treatise which sampled various opinions on the matter.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nNigeria has three per cent of the world\u2019s proven gas reserves, yet has tapped almost none of it, the report said, noting that like most African countries, what has been extracted is mostly sent to Europe, which now wants to import even more to make up for supplies lost to Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nItaly, for instance, has struck fresh deals to buy gas from Angola and the Republic of Congo, while Germany has been looking to secure supplies from Senegal.\n\nBut that\u2019s despite discouraging the use of gas and other fossil fuels around the world in pursuit of global climate goals, a case some European leaders made at the United Nations\u2019 COP26 conference in Glasgow last November.\n\nWhile African leaders are eager for the millions in revenue that the gas deals are likely to bring in, they\u2019re also calling out the sudden interest in their resources as a double standard that perpetuates the West\u2019s exploitation of the region, the report hinted.\n\nThey question why Africa must move away from dirty fuels \u2014 thereby delaying access for hundreds of millions of people to electricity \u2014 even as its gas is used to keep the lights on in Europe.\n\n\u201cRich countries have been reluctant to fund pipelines and power plants that would facilitate the use of gas in Africa because of its emissions, yet haven\u2019t delivered on promises to help finance green projects that could be an alternative source of energy.\n\n\u201cEurope\u2019s awkward position was on display at the Group of Seven leaders summit last month. The world\u2019s most advanced economies walked back a climate commitment to halt financing for overseas fossil fuel projects, but indicated that exceptions would likely apply to projects that would allow for more shipments of LNG to their countries.\n\n\u201cIn another climb-down, European Union lawmakers recently voted to classify gas and nuclear energy projects within the bloc as \u2018green investments\u2019, potentially opening up billions of euros in fresh funding,\u201d it added.\n\nIt noted that that approach has irked African leaders who need fuel to lift millions out of poverty.\n\n\u201cWe need long-term partnership, not inconsistency and contradiction on green energy policy from the UK and European Union,\u201d it quoted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, as saying in written comments.\n\n\u201cIt does not help their energy security, it does not help Nigeria\u2019s economy, and it does not help the environment. It is a hypocrisy that must end,\u201d Buhari added.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, sub-Saharan African governments share the blame for their underutilised gas reserves. Few countries have seriously invested in or reformed their power or oil and gas sectors, particularly Nigeria, where the Bonny Island plant has run at least 20 per cent below capacity since 2021 because of pipeline theft and vandalism.\n\n\u201cMany African leaders support boosting gas exports to help their cash-strapped governments, but they also want access to financing that would allow them to harness the fuel\u2019s potential to create domestic natural gas market,\u201d it stressed.\n\n\u201cThey cannot just come and say, \u2018We need your gas, I\u2019ll buy your gas and we\u2019ll take it to Europe,\u2019\u201d Gabriel Obiang Lima, Energy Minister of Equatorial Guinea,was quoted to have said at a press conference in May. \u201cThey need to give something back to us,\u201d he added.\n\nGas has long been controversial from a climate perspective: it burns cleaner than other fossil fuels but still generates carbon pollution and tends to leak the super-warming greenhouse gas methane.\n\nEurope\u2019s own stance on the fuel has shifted since the war began. Its top priority now is to buy up as much LNG as it can get its hands on, while countries including Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have turned to coal as a backup.\n\n\u201cThe whole of the West developed on the back of fossil fuels \u2014 even as we speak some Western nations are deciding to bring coal back into their energy mix because of the war.\n\n\u201cSo when the world wants to transition to zero carbon emissions, who has to do more?\u201d said Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Energy Minister for Ghana, which has in the past few years made significant oil and gas discoveries. \u201cIs the West saying Africa should remain undeveloped?\u201d he added.\n\nThe African continent\u2019s share of historical global emissions would only rise to 3.5 per cent from 3 per cent even if it tapped every molecule of its known gas reserves. Universal energy access on the continent could be achieved by 2030 with $25 billion a year in investment \u2014 the equivalent of just 1 per cent of the money pouring into the energy sector globally.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a dearth of new funding for power plants to burn gas within Africa. Governments and businesses have $100 billion in planned projects, including 35 gigawatts of gas-powered electricity, but can\u2019t find the money to build most of them.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "text": "With about 10 months to the end of his second term tenure, President Muhammadu Buhari om Monday said he was eager to leave office and retire to his home town, Daura in Katsina State.\n\nThis was just as the president called on the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to reconsider their position on the prolonged strike, expressing worry that the hiatus would have generational consequences on families, the educational system and future development of the country.\n\nThe president, who received some governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC), legislators and political leaders at his residence in Daura, said the strike by the university lecturers had already taken a toll on the psychology of parents, students and other stakeholders, throwing up many moral issues that already beg for attention.\n\nBuhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said: \u201cI am eager to go. I can tell you it has been tough. I am grateful to God that people appreciate the personal sacrifices we have been making.\n\n\u201cBy this time next year, I would have made the most out of the two terms, and the remaining months I will do my best,\u201d the president noted.\n\nBuhari urged those in political positions and places of privilege to be mindful in helping the many Nigerians that were looking for opportunities.\n\n\u201cIf you are greedy, you won\u2019t look around to see what is happening with those who are less endowed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president told the governors and political leaders that he had not been to his house in Daura for close to a year due to the demands of office.\n\n\u201cThe observation that I abandoned my base was made by the Emir of Daura, Dr. Faruk Umar Faruk, at the eid prayer ground. He held the microphone and told everyone that the last time I was in Daura was during the Eid-el-Kabir of 2021,\u201d he added.\n\nBuhari said he would retire to Daura, not Kaduna, where he has a better house.\n\n\u201cIn ten to eleven months time, I will come here. I have a better house in Kaduna, but it is too close to Abuja,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSpeaking further on the ASUU strike, he said the future of the country rests on the quality of educational institutions and education, while assuring that the government understands their position, and that negotiations should continue, with students in the lecture halls.\n\n\u201cWe hope that ASUU will sympathise with the people on the prolonged strike. Truly, enough is enough for keeping students at home. Don\u2019t hurt the next generation for goodness sake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president called on all well-meaning Nigerians, particularly those close to the leaders and members of the association, to intervene in persuading the lecturers to reconsider their position, and the ripple effect on an entire generation and the nation.\n\nBuhari said students from Nigerian universities would be faced with the challenge of competing with others in a highly connected and technology-driven work space, and keeping them at home only deprives them of time, skill and opportunities to be relevant on the global stage.\n\n\u201cColonial type education was geared towards producing workers in government. Those jobs are no longer there. Our young people should get education to prepare them for self-employment. Now education is for the sake of education.\n\n\u201cThrough technology we are much more efficient. We should encourage our children to get education, not only to look for government jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nFurthermore, Buhari said resources should be channeled more into building infrastructure and operations of the health and educational sector, not to expand the bureaucracy to create job opportunities.\n\nThe president explained that the schedule of work was much, saying he recently had to sympathise with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, who had to be away most of the time from his family.\n\nBuhari urged the APC stalwarts to keep working for the good of the people and the country, noting that, \u201cwe are a lucky people, and we need to reflect more on where we are coming from.\u201d\n\nThe president said relative to the resources available and compared to the last administration, the government had done well in many areas, particularly in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI wish the person who is coming after me the very best,\u201d he said.\n\nOn security, the president said the north-west had posed more challenges, and some success had been recorded in other regions such as the north-east and the south-south.\n\nBuhari advised some of those from the south-south to stop hurting national assets, which also affect their livelihood.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, the Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, thanked the president for his leadership roles in improving the economy of the nation and the many successes recorded at the APC, which include two conventions to produce the party leadership and the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe will work hard to ensure the success of our party. We have reasons to work very hard,\u201d he added.\n\nBagudu, who is the Governor of Kebbi State, said the favorable seasons supported the vision of ensuring food production and making agriculture a priority, with clear results in rice pyramids in various states.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the attacks by the renegades, our country remains self-sufficient in food production. We have seen investments that were not there before you came into power.\n\n\u201cNot less than 20 states now have agriculture process zones. We have rice pyramid in Ekiti, Gombe and Niger, while maize pyramids were revived in Katsina and Kano states,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said more than 54 rice meals were commissioned in various states, and 57 fertiliser plants were revived, or built afresh.\n\n\u201cAll these were achieved because of your commitment and patriotism,\u201d the governor told the President.\n\nBagudu also appreciated the president for providing ease of access to governors and political leaders, noting that the opening of the National Economic Council for more fluid exchange of ideas greatly helped in improving the economy.\n\nAPC Governors at the lunch with the president included: Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari; Kaduna State, Malam Nasir el-Rufai; Imo State, Hope Uzodinma; Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule; Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello; Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje; Ekiti State, Dr. Fayemi Kayode; Plateau State, Simon Lalong, and Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",
