          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nAn optometrist, Dr. Oluchi Ubani has warned that the loss of peripheral vision could be a sign of the onset of glaucoma, noting that such a development should be promptly checked.\n\nPeripheral vision loss occurs when people can\u2019t see objects unless they\u2019re right in front of them.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, the eye expert noted that people do not pay attention to their peripheral sight, noting that this is wrong.\n\nAccording to the optometrist, the state of peripheral vision can gives hints on the general condition of the sight.\n\nDr. Ubani said, \u201cFor us to say that vision your is okay, it entails that when you are looking straight ahead and someone moves a hand by your side, you should at least perceive that something is going on.\n\n\u201cYou might not totally see but you can guess that something is there or that someone moved a finger. That is our peripheral vision.\n\n\u201cHowever, when glaucoma starts taking away your peripheral vision, you will discover that you may not be able to see what is happening by the side except you fully turn your head. You can\u2019t sense it anymore.\n\nUbani, who is also a public health expert, noted that it is wrong to visit optometrists only when people are unable to see what is in front of them. \u201cIt is wrong for people not to be bothered about what is happening by their side,\u201d she said.\n\nShe, however, noted that while the damage caused by glaucoma can\u2019t be reversed, the eye condition can be managed when detected early.\n\nShe also added that glaucoma can also occur in children, hence the importance of screening for it in children.\n\nUbani also warned that diabetes, hypertension and sickle cell disease are some of the health issues that could cause irreversible blindness, noting that people with the conditions should also seek eye care from experts.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Peter Duru \u2013 Makurdi\n\n243 aggrieved Benue aspirants in the last Ward Congresses of the All Progressives Congress, APC, have dragged the party to court for allegedly being shutout and denied participation in the process.\n\nThis was made known on Friday by the Makurdi/Guma House of Representatives candidate of the APC in the last election, Mr. Conrad Utaan when he led the Chairman and Ward Executives of the party in Guma Local Government Area of the state and some of his supporters on a courtesy call on Governor Samuel Ortom in Makurdi.\n\nMr. Utaan explained that \u201cthe 243 persons bought their nomination forms and were supposed to have been screened to participate in the Ward Congresses here in Benue state but that did not hold.\n\n\u201cThey were locked out, we understand that a list was put together and sent to Abuja which obviously shut them out.\n\n\u201cWe happen to belong to a party that calls itself the APC that is supposed to be a progressive party. However our party has demonstrated the height of impunity that you can find in any political space.\n\n\u201cA situation where a political party sells nomination forms to its registered members and takes them into a process that summits them to an activity that will not even hold is more or less 419.\n\n\u201cIt is quite unfortunate, but whoever was sent from Abuja to come and hold Congresses in Benue, they have just succeeded in plunging the last nails on the coffin of the APC in Benue.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to take it lying down. I am happy that the 243 people who bought the forms have already approached the courts for proper interpretation of what their rights really are in the APC.\n\nALSO READ: APC Congress: All grievances have been resolved \u2013 Ondo Committee Chairman\n\n\u201cWe are challenging it, the people who bought forms are challenging it in court. It is rather unfortunate that the leadership of the APC in Benue has decided to kill the party with their own hands with this kind of impunity.\u201d\n\nThe former Focal Person of Social Investments Programme explained that he was in government house with his supporters to seek shelter under the Governor saying that as a man of peace, equity and justice Governor Ortom should accommodate them under the umbrella.\n\nResponding, the Governor thanked God for bringing his political son, Mr. Utaan back to him, saying in politics, there was no permanent friend or enemy but interest.\n\nThe Governor stated that the event was not strange as he had done a similar thing when he left the PDP to actualise his gubernatorial ambition in the APC in 2015 and back to the PDP in 2019 for his reelection.\n\nWhile assuring the would-be entrants of equal opportunities in the PDP, the Governor said the umbrella was big enough to accommodate all.\n\nResponding to the allegation against his party, the Caretaker Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mr. James Ornguga said Mr. Utaan wanted his preferred candidates on the list during the Ward Congresses which was done on consensus basis and when it was rejected he decided to seek shelter elsewhere.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Boniface Enekwechi\n\nANAMBRA State, the self- acclaimed \u201cLight of the Nation\u201d, is on the verge of another round of elections to choose the leader who will steer her ship for another four years. It is gratifying that with each cycle of election, the state throws up more and better prepared men and women for the topmost job.\n\nAs it stands today, the political firmament is being bestrode by personages who perhaps aspire to replicate the vision of past Igbo and Nigerian leaders such as Dr. Alex Ekwueme, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Dr. Michael Okpara, Dim Emeka Ojukwu and a host of others who through dint of hard work, knowledge, and altruism crystallised the people\u2019s aspirations in infrastructural development, educational excellence, and business enterprise.\n\nIn the face of many daunting challenges Anambra needs a leader who will motivate the citizens to repose faith in their government and institutions, and not people who seek power for personal aggrandisement and ego. Therefore, the 2021 governorship election will afford the people of the state an opportunity to raise the bar by choosing from among them a youthful, vibrant and visionary leader who can transform the state and bring prosperity to the remotest parts.\n\nAs endowed as Anambra State is in terms of human capital, it is astonishing that many years after its creation by the General Ibrahim Babangida regime, there is no befitting state capital and other key infrastructural development that can place it as a state of reckoning in Africa.\n\nNow that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has fixed a date for the governorship election in the state, it is expected that aspirants will think of new ways of doing things and ensure that the quality of life of the citizens is changed for the better. Though this may appear impossible to negative thinkers but I know for sure that with the right leadership the state can actually be the \u201cenvy of other states\u201d. It only requires the determination, political will and requisite knowledge which he possesses in abundance to bring this about.\n\nPerhaps, what is of utmost importance in the quest for the governor of the prime state is the ability to identify and escalate the vision of those aspiring to lead. Anambra needs a man whose vision resonates and that can truly elevate and set the state apart in all sectors of human capital and infrastructural development.\n\nALSO READ: Mob set two motorbike thieves ablaze in Makurdi\n\nA cursory look at the aspirants and their vision for the state instantly throws up Mr. Valentine Ozigbo, who by stroke of fate hails from Anambra South Senatorial zone where the pendulum will swing in the choice of the next governor.\n\nBorn in 1970 to a father who was a headmaster and a mother who thrived in petty trading, Ozigbo started early to gain attention as a brilliant student since he usually excelled among his peers throughout his academic pursuits. His vision is encapsulated in advocacy for peace and cohesion among the people of the state.\n\nThis advocacy is apt in the sense that it is at the core of all other factors necessary to spur and motivate the full participation of all the citizens, mostly those with investment prowess to explore the available opportunities in the state and commit their resources for the common good.\n\nHis advocacy for unity among the people will act as a boost for investors both from within and outside the state to consider Anambra State favorably in their investment decisions.\n\nWhat I also find most laudable in his vision and plans for the state is the will to create synergy between Anambra and its neighbouring states like Delta, Imo and Enugu, whereby joint development agencies will be set up for their mutual benefits. This is not only laudable and long-overdue but it speaks to the innovative acumen of a man who sees beyond his immediate environment.\n\nHe has, through his accomplishments and pedigree in the private sector, demonstrated that he has the capacity, willingness, and ability to lead Anambra State to the Promised Land after Governor Willie Obiano.\n\nTime has come for all Anambrarians to leave their comfort zones and work for the greater good of the people of Anambra State and this will require that the people see beyond the ephemeral postures of opportunists who may use guile to find their way to the topmost position.\n\nIf opportunists are allowed, Anambrarians shall all be losers for their indiscretion.\n\nThey cannot continue to play to the gallery in terms of choosing the right leaders and hope that manna will fall from heaven. These expectations can only materialise and come into fruition when the people choose a good leader and refuse to accede to the ambition of politicians who want to use the office to massage their bruised egos or siphon the public treasury.\n\nEnekwechi, a social commentator, wrote from Lagos\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Who is afraid of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu?",
          "text": "By Tunde Rahman\n\nWhy do many political opponents dread the All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, so much so that in their wishful thinking they hope he gives way or simply quit the stage? Why should political contestation get to the point where our so-called political leaders would be wishing their competitors dead if they are actually in politics for the public good? These are some of the questions that have agitated my mind following the repeated unfounded rumours about Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s health status. In the last few months, the former Lagos governor has died many times over in the reckoning of these nefarious persons.\n\nEach time Asiwaju travels, the next thing these detractors, who abound in PDP as in APC, do is to shamelessly claim he is seriously ill undergoing surgery or that he has died. Yet, each time they have made such blatant claims, the lie has always blown up on their very faces, as they have always been proven wrong.\n\nSurprisingly, some of these evil persons would also claim the APC national leader is no longer relevant in the scheme of things in the party he helped form. And you wonder: if he is no longer important within the APC, why dissipating energies about him? Why hoping he dies each time he steps out of the country?\n\nThese people have been in this despicable game for quite a while. They have perpetrated so much hatred and told too many lies such that to track them can be a herculean task. Let me attempt a recall of a few of these. In April this year, when we went for Umrah (lesser Hajj) in Saudi Arabia, they brought out a photo-shopped photograph that portrayed Asiwaju in very bad light. The picture was so bad that you would wonder whether it had any feature of him. All that these malicious people wanted to demonstrate is Asiwaju is so badly ill or incapacitated that he cannot even aspire to lead this country, talk less mount the exalted office. Ironically, at the same lesser Hajj, Asiwaju, who the malevolent imagined dead, effortlessly performed tawaf (going round the holy Kabbah) several times and underwent all the rites of Umrah. I was in that entourage to Umrah along with some of his friends and associates including Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, former EFCC Chairman Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, and former National Welfare Officer of APC, Alhaji Ibrahim Masari, among others.\n\nElucidating on how we arrived in Medina around 4 am, how tired, weary and needing sleep we all proceeded to Mecca, a distance of 4-and-a-half hours, that same morning we landed in the kingdom, and how on eventual arrival in Mecca we immediately headed for the Kabbah, would help put a lie to the claim about Asiwaju\u2019s ill-health.\n\nThe journey from Medina to Mecca by road was very strenuous. Virtually all of us slept. Not Asiwaju. He was awake throughout, conversing with the driver, Mustapha, and ensuring he was awake and alert for the duration of the drive. We arrived in Mecca without any hassle, quickly checked into a hotel, and then headed for the Kabbah for tawaf and other rites of Umrah. Leading the charge, Asiwaju Tinubu painlessly performed the seven-round tawaf and shortly after, being a Friday, it was time for Jummah. We left Medina immediately we arrived because way back in that holy city, Asiwaju had insisted he would like to observe Jummah in Mecca.\n\nFor the duration of the trip, Asiwaju\u2019s hotel suite in Mecca was turned into a Mecca of sort with governors, ministers, other top dignitaries and Islamic clerics coming to visit him. Overlooking the Kabbah, it was in his living room that we were observing some of the prayers and making supplications to Allah.\n\nMany took selfies with him with their cameras and phones unencumbered. He allowed as many as wanted to take photographs with him to do so, an opportunity some abused. An example was someone who either unknowingly deployed a phone with a bad camera or deliberately doctored the photograph, which was now used to achieve nefarious ends, as depicted by that damaging picture of Asiwaju in Saudi.\n\nAgain, not long after we returned from Umrah and the former Lagos governor undertook a trip abroad, I think to France and UK, there were also unfounded reports that he had been hospitalised in Paris for alleged coronavirus attack and had even purportedly undergone an operation. Some proceeded from there to claim he had died. Now, Asiwaju has never tested positive for COVID-19. Not at that alleged time, not at present. For the life of me, how could someone who had never been positive for coronavirus be hospitalised for it or undergone a surgery for complications arising from the virus he never contracted? I volunteered this much not to disparage many who had contracted the virus or those presently battling the dreaded menace.\n\nEach time we felt we had over-exposed ourselves or someone had contracted the virus in the team, we would call for coronavirus tests and no one is exempted. Asiwaju and some of us must have undergone close to 15 COVID-19 tests each. Some of us, including this writer, had even tested positive for the virus at one point or another. Asiwaju has never experienced it once.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe fake news about Asiwaju\u2019s alleged ill health or death is something we have become accustomed to each time he travels out of the country such that it has become a joke of sorts. Indeed, we had a hilarious encounter when he embarked on the extant travel some two weeks ago. As I made to leave him at the Lagos airport, I said: \u201cSir, now that you are traveling again, when these mischievous guys begin to say you are either dying or dead, what do I say to them?\u201d We had a good laugh. He then said: \u201cJust say I have travelled and don\u2019t mind whatever they say.\u201d\n\nSo the speculation trailing the extant trip is what it is: fake, unfounded news. It bears repeating, however, to state that Asiwaju is hale and hearty. He is not in any hospital. He does not have any medical situation that would require hospitalisation either in Nigeria or abroad.\n\nIt is sad that perpetrators of this mischief are not deterred by the fact that each time this fake news has been propagated they have been proven wrong.\n\nHowever, there are a few points to make at this juncture. Firstly, some speak magisterially on the state of health of Asiwaju Tinubu. They say he doesn\u2019t enjoy good health. Are they his doctors? Are they saying they are privy to his medical records? Pray, how could an unhealthy man muster the strength and energy to go through the rigors of tawaf and all rites associated with Umrah immediately after a six-hour flight and over four-hour road trip?\n\nThose perpetrating this evil think they are unknown. They hide their identities behind the anonymity of the social media. But we have a fair idea who they are. Their luck will run out soon as they would be exposed sooner than later!\n\nAgain, these people who try to rubbish Asiwaju\u2019s health, peddling rumours that he is dead forget that the matter of life and death is within the realm of God. Not of any individual. They should not attempt to play God. They conveniently forgot what many dubbed the Zik\u2019s curse. Recall that Nigeria\u2019s first president and one of our foremost leaders, late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, was rumoured dead I think around November 1989. Some prominent print media organisations and television stations published the story without conducting due diligence and checks. With banner headlines cast in impressive adjectives befitting the Great Zik, they proudly proclaimed the nationalist dead. Some of Zik\u2019s associates, some of whom had not seen him in years, particularly the late Chief RBK Okafor, also fell for it, ranting about their close relationship with the late nationalist and how they were with him in his last moments.\n\nReminiscing on this episode in an article titled \u201cThe Day Zik Didn\u2019t Die\u201d published by THE NATION newspaper on November 8, 2016, celebrated columnist, Professor Olatunji Dare, had this to say: \u201cOut-of-work politicians\n\nsaw an opening and moved in swiftly. A First Republic legislator and former stalwart of the Zikist Movement, Chief RBK Okafor, panting as if he had sprinted all the way from Nsukka to Rutam House in Lagos, narrated breathlessly how he had cradled his \u201cbeloved Zik\u201d in his arms and how, even as his life ebbed, the great nationalist had said to him: \u201cChief RBK Okafor, my political son, remember that I am a Pan-Africanist and should be given a Pan-African burial.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, Zik\u2019s rumoured death was false. It was fake news. Zik did not die. At least he did not die at that time. He read that obituary in the newspapers. He also reportedly cursed those people grandstanding over his purported death. And one by one, they died before him. Zik went on to live for another seven years. The long and short of all of this is those wishing Asiwaju dead, hoping to profit from it should be very careful. They should be wary of the wrath of God.\n\nHaving stated all of that, my final point is media stakeholders must meet minds together and devise a way to halt the excesses of the social media. We must help to stem this menace of fake news, hate speech and abusive language. There must be a form of regulation for this nonsense going on, on social media. I\u2019m totally in support of peer regulation, regulation within the media industry itself, but we must scale up enforcement of this regulation. Why don\u2019t we draft the regulations ourselves and approach the National Assembly for legislation to back them up to make these regulations institutional as some professionals have also suggested?",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor\n\nProminent pro-democracy crusaders and rights activists were enraged on Friday by justification of the June 12, 1993 presidential election annulment by former military President Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nAfenifere and NADECO chieftains chided the former military leader for a shortfall in memory and historical perception, saying that he tried to murder the truth.\n\nBabangida, who is warming up for his 80th birthday, justified the cancellation of the poll believed to have been won by the defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP) candidate, the late Chief Moshood Abiola, on a live Arise Television Programme.\n\nBut, Afenifere leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said the former military leader never wanted to vacate office, adding that he had a predetermined agenda.\n\nHe lamented that posturing was typical of ambitious military rulers from the North who loathed democratic transition and succession.\n\nAdebanjo said the annulment contributed to disunity and suspicion that an ethnic group was bent on dominating other groups.\n\nHe maintained that the military drivers of the transition programme have gone into history as enemies of the people.\n\nAdebanjo said:\u201dBabangida never wanted to go. He was changing the goal post during the game. These people from the North only believe in a Nigeria where they will continue to dominate other ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cThey only want unity according to their terms. They want to dictate the conditions for unity. We should sit down and agree. Otherwise, the deceit will continue.\u201d\n\nAn Afenifere chieftain, Senator Olabiyi Durojaye, lamented that the historic poll results were cancelled after Nigeria held a free and fair exercise.\n\nHe said the annulment was annoying because Nigerians were full of expectation about a new dawn in the post-military era.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDurojaye, who was detained by the military over the pro-democracy struggle, said if Babangida had any information about an imminent coup, there was no evidence that he shared it with his colleagues in the Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) and other critical stakeholders.\n\nNoting that many have not overcome the shock of the annulment, he said: \u201cHistory will take care of the actors.\n\nNADECO chieftain and Third Republic House of Representatives Chief Whip Olawale Oshun berated Babangida for what he described as deliberate falsehood, adding that nobody will believe in unfounded rationalisation and deceit\n\nOshun, who is the leader of Afenifere Renewal Group(ARG), said Babangida has God to contend with because his action led to the death of many young people along Ikorodu Road, Lagos when Abacha\u2019s men opened fire during protest.\n\nHe said IBB\u2019s account contradicted those of his colleagues in the AFRC, who were also taken aback by the annulment of the popular will.\n\nOshun said Babangida never wanted to vacate office, adding that in that plot to perpetuate the military, Gen. Sani Abacha was smarter.\n\nHe also lamented that the former military President polarised the polity in a bid to remain in power.\n\nOshun said: \u201cHe did not want to go. I was in the House of Representatives at that time. I knew the efforts he made to compromise the House to remain in office. The House was polarised.\n\n\u201cOf course, there were some ambitious men around him; people like Mark, who were not pleased with an Abiola presidency. But, officers like Col. Umar stood their ground on the election.\u201d\n\nWhile maintaining that IBB lied on Arise Television programme, he added: \u201cHe should tell that to the marines. Nigerians voted. He should have allowed it to stand. Abiola won in the barracks. He said soldiers wanted to stage a coup. Are the soldiers more than millions of Nigerians who voted? IBB ruined our country. \u201d\n\nA journalist, Rotimi Durojaye, said:\u201dBecause of his age and health, Nigerians should forgive Babangida. He brought us to where we are. He should ask for forgiveness from Nigerians. I don\u2019t know whether he is now senile. Was Nigeria the first country to conduct election by the military?\u201d",

          "text": "By Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has ruled out any further discussion with the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) over the ongoing doctors\u2019 strike.\n\nThe government said it has invoked the \u201cNo work no pay\u201d rule as contained in Section 43 of the Labour Act.\n\nIt added the doctors will not receive payment as long as the strike persists.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, who disclosed these when he appeared on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels Television, said the position of government has been communicated to the leadership of NARD.\n\nHe said the government has given the striking doctors seven \u2013 day ultimatum to return to their post or risk being replaced by Monday next week.\n\nNgige said the government is ready to replace the striking doctors with local ones, saying it has so many alternatives at its disposal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Minister also said the government may drag the doctors to the National Industrial Court or Industrial Arbitration Panel if the strike persists by Monday when the seven \u2013 day ultimatum would have elapsed.\n\nHe said: \u201cI won\u2019t meet them anymore because I have other things to do. I did two conciliations yesterday. Am I going to be wasting my time with them?\n\n\u201cI have other tools within the labour laws and I will do it. I invoked Section 43 of the labour laws this afternoon (yesterday). I have communicated it to NARD.\n\n\u201cThey will not receive money for the period they are on strike and it will never count as a period of pensionable position in their career.\n\n\u201cEven the International Labour Organisation supports it because they render essential services. They are not supposed to go on strike without notifying me 15 days before the day of strike.\n\n\u201cAs we speak I have not received any notification that is why I am invoking Section 43 of the Labour Act on withdrawal of services, right to strike and the right to protect the employer and their patients.\n\n\u201cThings will happen next week. Let them wait because they are taking government for a ride and it is wrong. They are playing with lives.\u201d\n\nAsked if he will invoke the labour laws next week, the Minister said: \u201cI will and by next week I will escalate it because reconcilation has failed and the law says if conciliation has failed on my own side I can move it up \u2013 Industrial Arbitration Panel or National Industrial Court of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ones (demands) that are Federal Government have been treated. If I did 95 per cent for you that is distinction.\n\n\u201cI have given them seven days (the day the strike started); it started on Monday. My seven days terminates on Monday. I will invoke other things that are allowed by law. The employer has a right to replace them in the period they were away.\n\n\u201cYou can use local doctors to replace them. There are many people on the standby.\u201d\n\nAsked if the Federal Government could cope without the doctors, who are rendering critical services at a time when there are rising cases of COVID-19 and diarrhea, Ngige said things are under control.\n\nThe Minister said he has warned his children who are medical doctors to stay of the ongoing strike which he described \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nNgige said he has a son and daughter who are practising doctors.\n\nHe also blamed state governments for the situation, saying people are not talking about that but focusing on the Federal Government alone.\n\nThe Minister accused state governments of not doing enough in terms of healthcare in the country.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nIn the past one month, the agitation for self-determination for Yoruba nation, from all indications, seemed to have lost its steam, as little or nothing has been heard about the struggle.\n\nA lot has happened within the past one month, during which the prominent Yoruba nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, was arrested in Cotonou, Benin Republic, when he attempted to travel to Germany, having escaped from Nigeria. Igboho\u2019s residence was raided in the early hours of July 1, this year by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) in collaboration with other security agencies. Two persons were killed in Igboho\u2019s house during the operation, while 12 persons were arrested in his house on that day and were taken to Abuja. Since then, DSS took them to court for the first time this week and they have been granted bail with conditions.\n\nIt is also on record that the last Yoruba nation rally that was held at Ojota in Lagos on July 3, this year, was another case that probably weakened the agitation for self-determination for the Yoruba Nation. Dozens among the participants in the rally were arrested, taken to court and granted bail. Some of them were sprayed with hot water by the police and a young girl, Jumoke, was also hit by a stray bullet in front of a shop in Ojota. She died immediately.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the Lagos rally by the agitators was a total departure from what they experienced, even with security agencies when similar rallies were earlier held in Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti States, with active or passive participation of Igboho. There was an insinuation that a number of Yoruba nation agitators might have slowed down on the struggle as a result of an alleged clampdown on them by the Federal Government. The force with which the government went after Igboho, as gathered, sent shivers down the spines of many agitators and they have gone back to the drawing board on how to outwit the government.\n\nIt was further argued that the Federal Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari is achieving its aim of weakening the agitators.\n\nOpinion polls conducted revealed that the fact that more than 100 groups under the umbrella of Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), agitating for self-determination Yoruba nation, have not been holding activities like they used to do it before the total clampdown.\n\nBefore the clampdown, there was a fierce and consistent social media agitation for the Yoruba Nation. Apart from that, the agitators, under the leadership of an Emeritus Professor of History, Banji Akintoye, held many rallies and created a lot for awareness for the agitation.\n\nCommunications Manager to Prof Akintoye, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, was confronted with the arguments. On that allegation that their activities had gone down, he stated: \u201cNo, the agitation has not gone down. In fact, it is becoming more popular. Maybe what you meant by saying going down is because of some special rallies that we held in the past. But agitation is not all about rallies.\n\n\u201cBut you have to watch the body language of the state actors and strategize and re-strategize. You would remember the rally we held at Ojota in Lagos on Saturday July 3 and how the police clamped down on us. This has made us to review our strategies. So, we have changed strategies and nothing has gone down. We are working underground. We have not been holding rallies, but we have been doing house-to-house mobilisation.\u201d\n\nAdeleye stated further that the struggle would not die because Igboho was arrested and because some of the agitators had been purportedly harassed, intimidated and molested by security agencies.\n\nHis words: \u201cHave you seen a struggle that died because of the arrest or death of its leader? If you consider Boko Haram insurgency, when the government killed Yusuf Mohammed, what happened? When the leader of Ogoni people, Ken Saro-Wiwa was killed during the era of the late Gen Sani Abacha, what happened in Niger Delta thereafter? So, the arrest of Igboho has emboldened many Yoruba to continue with the agitation. Then, the harassment of agitators has rather continued to popularise the agitation.\n\n\u201cWe thank the Federal Government for doing the popularisation for us. We want to thank the Federal Government of Nigeria for publicising the Yoruba Nation rallies for us. They thought they are harassing us, but the government is helping us to create more awareness for the Yoruba nation agitation.\u201d\n\nAdeleye further stated that plans were on-going for Igboho\u2019s associates that were arrested and taken to court by DSS in Abuja to perfect their bail conditions before the end of this month. He added, however, that Igboho is in safe hands in Cotonou, even as he refused to comment on the strategies being put in place to rescue him. He said: \u201cWe will not discuss our plans and strategies in the media. But we will be glad to discuss our success stories.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

So, let us come together as a party and salvage this country,\u201d Saraki said.\n\nThe BoT Chairman, Sen. Walid Jibrin, in his remark said now was the right time for PDP to put its house in order, to enable it prepare for its upcoming elective convention for the election of its national leaders, as well as prepare for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve complete success, we must do away with any personal interest and unnecessary in-house fighting, capable of killing the objectives set by the party.\u201d\n\nHe said the board must look critically at the party approved organs, advising all to wake up by functioning very well, in order to fulfil the dreams of PDP\u2019s forefathers.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing, it is very important therefore, that the BoT being the conscience of the party, must today come up with necessary strategy for election of our national leadership, based on free and fair election that will produce credible and competent officers of our party,\u201d he said.\n\nJibrin noted that the BoT was always ready to listen to any group, committee, or individual with good intentions for the party, aimed at promoting peace and unity in PDP and Nigeria.\n\nHe urged members to put their collective interest ahead any personal interests in making sure that PDP new leaders emerged only through free and fair election at the national convention.\n\n\u201cThere is also need to take a firm stand to drastically reduce suits by aggrieved members, by following procedures enshrined in the PDP constitution, before referring any matter to court.\n\n\u201cAnyone that takes the party to court should be seriously disciplined,\u201d he said.\n\nJibrin stressed the need to look at why many past PDP national chairmen, Chief Audu Ogbeh, Chief Okwesilieze Nwodo, Alhaji Bamanga Tukur, Alhaji Ahmed Mua\u2019zu and Alhaji Alimodu Sheriff, did not complete their tenures successfully.\n\n\u201cWe must sit with the national chairman and the NWC to come out with decisions that will make our party strongest. While truth is bitter, we must cope with the bitterness by taking serious actions to handle this situation.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that he had completed all arrangements with the PDP Governor\u2019s Forum, the National Assembly Caucus and Forum of State Chairmen, for effective consultation on the way forward for the party.\n\nPDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, said the meeting was critical not only for members of the NWC but the entire PDP. He added that it was time for the party to brace up and come out strong and even stronger.\n\n\u201cI believe that in every human endeavour where there are issues, the issues must be tabled, discussed and come out with solutions. That solution will make our party very strong,\u201d Secondus said.\n\nBriefing on the state of the party, including the pending congress in nine states, Secondus said the reconciliation committee had done great work in Plateau and Niger. He said for the remaining states, forms were being sold to those who wanted to contest.\n\nSecondus said that after the state congresses, PDP was looking forward to a smooth and peaceful convention coming up in December, adding that the office of the national organising secretary was already preparing.\n\n\u201cSoon, the schedule of events, timetable and others shall be presented before the caucus, BoT, NEC and all organs of our party for action, leading to the convention,\u201d Secondus said.\n\nOn the seven deputy members of principal working committee of the party that resigned, he said the NWC met them on the day they tendered their letters.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP deputy national publicity secretary, Diran Odeyemi, has withdrawn his resignation letter.\n\nOdeyemi, who was one of the seven deputy national officers, who tendered their resignation letters, on Tuesday, said his decision was because of the activation of internal conflict resolution mechanism by the PDP leader.\n\nIn a letter dated August 4, 2021 and addressed to the PDP National Secretary,Odeyemi said:\n\n\u201cI write to withdraw my letter of Resignation as the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of our great party.\n\n\u201cThis decision is taken in view of the activation of the internal method of resolving issues by our leaders across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI also wish to state expressly that whatever embarrassment the resignation has caused the party, its leaders, members and supporters is highly regretted.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, in view of the fact that the tenure of myself and other members of the present National Working Committee (NWC) will expire in another three months, it is my view that the boat should not be rocked under any guise.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I pledge my loyalty and commitment to the party and the Prince Uche Secondus led NWC, and will continue to play my roles to ensure a successful National Convention, which will usher in new national officers.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Africa has gradually become home to exciting innovations. Startups, raising capital in billions, are birthing disruptive models across sectors, and global tech giants are extending their tentacles to the untapped markets in the continent.\n\nSeamless connectivity is essential to help businesses and individuals reap the rewards of the disruptions happening across the continent. Still, the lack of the required infrastructure to effect this has caused slower growth in Africa.\n\nAs of March 2021, Africa had a 37.42% average Internet penetration with wide gaps between juggernauts like Kenya at 85% and smaller countries like Eritrea at 6.9%.\n\nA map showing Internet penetration rates in Africa. Hover your mouse on each country map to see the numbers\n\nIn the early 2000s, Africa\u2019s policymakers made significant strides to tackle this issue, but the game changed in 2009 with the launch of the MainOne cable on the West African coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPropelled by CEO Funke Opeke\u2019s passion for connecting Africa to the Internet, MainOne\u2019s feat initiated a boost to Internet speeds that seemingly aided the proliferation of startups and tech-enabled businesses in Nigeria, one of Africa\u2019s most developed tech ecosystems.\n\nRecognising another apparent gap, the company subsequently launched a series of data centre facilities, through its subsidiary, MDXi, in Lagos, Nigeria, to support the myriad of businesses popping up in the nation\u2019s commercial capital.\n\nMainOne is not resting on its laurels, as MDXi announced its data centre facility expansion to Appolonia City in Greater Accra, Ghana.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, data centres are facilities that house computer systems and other components like telecommunications and storage systems.\n\nLike fibre optic cables, and base transceiver stations (telecom masts), data centres are a critical part of the global Internet infrastructure.\n\nThese centres process large amounts of data and host websites, manage emails, and even help instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram run effectively. Data centres are grouped in tiers, with tier 1 being the simplest and Tier 4 being the most advanced.\n\nA 2020 researchandmarkets.com report titled Data Center Market in Africa \u2013 Industry Outlook and Forecast 2021-2026 reveals that Africa has invested up to $2 billion in data centres and will reach $5 billion by 2026.\n\nThe report argues that the rise in data traffic caused by COVID-19 will further increase African businesses and governments\u2019 demand for data centres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, few African countries are cloud-ready, considering constraints from a lack of inland and submarine fibre and power availability.\n\nResearchandmarkets.com states that economic heavyweights like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, and Ethiopia will witness significant growth in data centre activities. Still, several countries with those constraints could miss out on this growth.\n\nSo what\u2019s the attraction in Ghana?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainOne\u2019s data centre launch in Ghana\n\nMainOne\u2019s past initiatives suggest launching its data centre in Ghana as a natural progression that aligns with its connectivity ambitions.\n\nIn 2019, the company launched its second data centre \u2014 the first outside Nigeria \u2014 in Ivory Coast, one of West Africa\u2019s major economic hubs. Through this move, MainOne solidified its intention to oil the engine of Ivory Coast\u2019s digital economy.\n\nIn an exhaustive chat with Techpoint Africa in July 2020, Funke Opeke hinted that MainOne would be expanding its data centre footprint to Shagamu, Ogun State \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s second most industrialised state \u2014 and other West African countries.\n\nTrue to her words, MainOne has seemingly set its sights on Ghana.\n\nBacked by a large population, a vast economy, and increasing digitisation, Nigeria has grabbed the major headlines for West Africa\u2019s tech-related activities.\n\nHowever, past events also suggest that African tech companies planning to expand nearly always have Ghana in their sights. Recent examples include Nigeria\u2019s GIG Logistics and Cars45, and Kenya\u2019s Quickbus.\n\nWhy?\n\nGhana is West Africa\u2019s second-largest economy, and about 57% (17.6 million) of its 31 million population are below the age of 25, while over 14 million out of 18 million adults are literate. The country is home to startups like mPharma, Jetstream, Bace Group, OZ\u00c9 , and Nvoicia.\n\nIn 2019, Google launched its 5th Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab in Accra, Ghana and in 2021, Twitter surprisingly chose Ghana to launch its first African office.\n\nBesides, the Ghanaian government recently started introducing forward-thinking digital projects.\n\nFollowing the pandemic\u2019s onset, in July 2020, it began building a digital template for elections using the African Union\u2019s proprietary technology \u2014 the PanaBIOS online platform.Seven months later, in February 2021, it piloted a regulatory innovation sandbox for financial services companies.\n\nAs recently as June 2021, it commenced West Africa\u2019s first digital census.\n\nSuch digital activity requires fast and reliable Internet access, which is only possible with the presence of basic and advanced telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Ghana\u2019s Internet space look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Speedtest\u2019s global Internet index, Ghana currently has the fastest fixed broadband speeds in Africa at 51.93 Mbps, ahead of South Africa (47 Mbps) and Egypt (42 Mbps).\n\nThe Speedtest Global Index is a service owned by Ookla, a US-based Internet analytics company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana has the fastest broadband speeds in West Africa. It, alongside Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal, lead the region by a wide margin.\n\nHowever, just 0.3% of Ghana\u2019s population has access to fixed broadband services, hinting at low adoption.\n\nFor mobile Internet, the numbers are slightly different. Internet World Stats reveals that, in December 2020, Ghana had a 46.5% mobile Internet penetration rate. While this is higher than the continental average of 37.42%, it falls behind 27 other African countries.\n\nAs of January 2021, Ghana reportedly has 15.7 million registered mobile Internet users. It, however, only has a mobile Internet speed of 13.8 Mbps.\n\nWhile Internet penetration has been increasing, Ghana\u2019s 79th and 132nd positions globally for fixed broadband and mobile Internet show there\u2019s significant room for improvement. Like other African countries, infrastructure remains a major challenge.\n\nHow Africa has improved its Internet speeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA glut of Internet cables in Africa. Source:\n\nDespite immense growth in recent years, several Africans still don\u2019t have access to the Internet. The continent has the slowest Internet speeds and the highest costs relative to income. This gap has presented opportunities and challenges.\n\nSince MainOne\u2019s cable launch, other submarine cables have landed in Africa to give it a combined capacity of 100 terabits, and upcoming initiatives from Google and Facebook could add 280 terabits. Still, cables are only one layer as several other challenges plague African countries.\n\nCountries like Nigeria and Kenya have taken it a step further by improving the usage of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).\n\nPer the Internet Exchange Society, websites load slowly in Africa since several of them have servers outside the continent. Encouragingly, local IXPs resolve this problem by lowering the cost and latency of accessing content from foreign websites.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2020, Nigeria and Kenya have localised 70% of Internet traffic through local IXPs, which has helped them save a combined $46 million. Other African countries have seemingly not witnessed as much success.\n\nCould MainOne push Ghana even further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nSince Ghana decentralised its telecom sector in the late 90s, MTN, Vodafone, and Airtel have provided healthy competition to drive Internet adoption.\n\nHowever, MainOne plans to take this a step further. The newly launched data centre will offer open access connectivity options to Ghana\u2019s leading telecom operators and direct access to the MainOne cable and other submarine cable systems.\n\nIt also offers access to Internet exchanges like the GIX (Ghana), IXPN (Nigeria), LINX (London), DE-CIX (Frankfurt/Lisbon), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Internet Exchange (CIVIX), and the West Africa Internet Exchange (WAF-IX).\n\n\u201cThis creates shorter routes for internet traffic with direct access to content providers, which enables better internet resilience, reduced latency, and improved customer experience for internet users in Ghana,\u201d MainOne says.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ghana could well be on its way to localising Internet traffic, boosting its speeds, and saving millions of dollars in the process.\n\nEven more business benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosting Internet speeds affects individuals and businesses in Ghana, but the MDXi\u2019s other features shoot its business value up a notch.\n\nIt reportedly features private data centre suites, precision cooling, and enterprise-grade 24\u00d77 multi-level security and video surveillance. It also has safety and fire suppression systems with multiple redundancies built into the power, cooling, and security infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to eliminate the challenges businesses face with setting up IT infrastructure in-house, by presenting a shared Data Center model, which optimises cost, and improves performance and efficiency.\u201d\n\nMainOne reveals that enterprises, government agencies, multinationals, and startups can now subscribe to colocation or cloud services, which allow them to focus on their core businesses.\n\nAfricanus Mensah, Chairman, MainOne Ghana, believes that the data centre will impact Ghana\u2019s business growth and human capital development. He believes the facility will \u201cexpand the frontiers of the digital revolution and transformation in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MDXi Appolonia Data Center will contribute to the growth of the local economy by providing jobs, enhancing capacity development, and serving more businesses in Ghana as the region continues to grow its digital economy.\u201d\n\nThe company reveals that as Ghana\u2019s digital economy keeps growing, the data centre facility will contribute to its growth by creating jobs and enhancing capacity development.\n\nWhile MainOne\u2019s data centre could offer several benefits for businesses and individuals in Ghana, this is only one part of the puzzle. Factors like ease of doing business, terrestrial Internet infrastructure, and a skilled workforce will prove a solid foundation for Ghana\u2019s digital economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Website Writer, Narrator, tech, business and policy analyst.

Source TechCrunch\n\nNigerian digital freight company, MVX, has raised a $1.3 million seed round to scale its operations, hire staff, and improve its technology.\n\nWho participated in the round? Kepple Africa Ventures, The Continent Venture Partners, Founders Factory, Launch Africa Ventures, and Oak Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy MVX? Per Techcrunch, Tonye Membere-Otaji, CEO and Founder of MVX, was fascinated by the lack of an online marketplace for vessels while working in the maritime industry in 2016.\n\nHowever, he couldn\u2019t launch because it was challenging to find the right partner and team. But, in 2019, he established MVX with Tobi Amusan (CTO) after raising a $100,000 pre-seed round.\n\nBecause its business model centred around offering a support vessel booking platform that linked vessel chartering requests, MVX was previously referred to as MVXchange.\n\nHowever, this changed in 2020 because of the uncertainty of oil prices and the economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nThe freight company launched MVXtransit, a digital freight booking platform that helped cargo owners find deals on moving containers. And in April 2021, it launched MVXpay, a finance and payment solution to provide trade finance for freight operators.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? The two products are now rolled into MVX. Also, the startup plans to make freight shipping and trade finance easier for African businesses by bringing booking and deployment processes online.\n\nThe startup claims it has expanded beyond Nigeria and that merchants from the West African country and Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, and Rwanda can use its platform to move freight in and out of their countries.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Ghana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Dignited\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has launched Tingg in Ghana. Tingg is a digital payments network that allows businesses and their customers to accept and make payments easily.\n\nThis announcement is coming after Cellulant was granted a Payment Services Provider (PSP) licence by the Central Bank of Ghana (CBG).\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that Cellulant is now one of the PSPs supported by the Bank of Ghana to provide digital payment solutions throughout the country.\n\nAlso, the PSP licence allows Cellulant to aggregate merchant services and payments for banks, institutions, and the general public, process financial services, acquire merchants, and build PoS systems.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more. The licence permits establishing a third-party payment gateway, and a marketplace for fully regulated financial service providers. It also allows merchant acquisition and aggregation, the printing and display of EMV cards, and the limited usage of closed-loop virtual cards.\n\nWhy the licence? The licence is required under the Payment Services Act 2019, which requires any fintech or digital payments company to be licenced by the Bank of Ghana before operating in the nation.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the requirements.\n\nAccording to Cellulant, Tingg helps businesses to digitise their payments using different options.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will enable consumers\u2019 merchants to pay for products and services using regionally appropriate payment options.\n\nRevio raises over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African billing startup, Revio, has raised more than $1 million in a seed round. International venture development firm, The Delta, led the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Brent Maropis (CEO) and Louis Buys (Co-founder), Revio is dedicated to assisting startups, particularly those in the Software as a Service (SaaS) space, get the most out of their billing subscriptions.\n\nAccording to Buys, the company improves client loyalty and makes it easy to avoid unsuccessful payments and customer loss. Essentially, it enables organisations to communicate with customers in real-time through the intelligent use of machine learning and analytics.\n\nRevio claims it supports all currencies and integrates with the African payments startup, Flutterwave, to allow its SaaS clients to sell their products to all African customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Though it\u2019s currently focused on the South African market, Revio plans to expand to East Africa in 2022.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nFlutterwave to drive US expansion as it appoints Silicon Valley veteran as head of US growth.

          "text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) raced to the top of the world as the region with the largest volume of peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin transactions, thanks to a major contribution by Nigerians in July.\n\nNigeria is the second-largest P2P market for bitcoin behind the United States \u2013 in July 2021, according to a report by Luno and Arcane Research. This is despite a directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that prohibits financial services to support cryptocurrency businesses and also freeze accounts maintained by exchanges and individuals in the market.\n\nThis is not the first time Nigeria is being put behind the US in the P2P market. Paxful earlier in the year noted that Nigeria was the second-largest market for P2P transactions on its platform.\n\nThe researchers at Luno and Arcane Research explain that Nigerian authorities are unable to censor cryptocurrencies due to the nature of coins like bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult for the government to intervene in these transactions, so they tried making bitcoin less appealing by making the markets less accessible. This caused centralised exchanges to lose ground. Meanwhile, the P2P markets thrived as the remaining option,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThroughout the month of July, the global weekly P2P volumes trailed at around $60 million from $93 million recorded on the week of February 15.\n\nHowever, while the global P2P volumes trend downwards, the SSA P2P volumes have remained stable. Last week saw the P2P trading volumes of SSA become the largest region measured by trading volumes in the P2P markets for the first time, as SSA\u2019s trading volumes surpassed those of Northern America.\n\nRead also: How to buy bitcoin in Nigerian naira safely\n\nNorthern America had seen 181 consecutive weeks as the largest region in terms of P2P trading volumes up until last week when the trading volumes in the region were surpassed by SSA. The last time Northern America was not the dominating region in the market was back in early 2018 when the speculative interest in bitcoin was thriving. Then, Western Europe, Asia, and Eastern Europe saw periods with trading volumes surpassing those of Northern America.\n\n\u201cBack then, speculative mania was leading the volumes to explode. This time around, one could argue that the sustained purchasing demand from the SSA\u2019s is caused by the utility caused by bitcoin\u2019s censorship-resistant nature,\u201d the report notes.\n\nNigeria may be behind the US in terms of volume of P2P bitcoin transactions, but the country is farther down behind the Northern American economic power in putting controls that guarantee protection for investors in the country. While the US has some levels of controls in place and which have encouraged financial service operators to play in the market, the Nigerian central bank chooses to build its own Central Bank Digital Currency and to keep the crypto market far away from financial services.\n\nComments by Gary Gensler, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission in which he asked the US Congress to give it more powers to tame the market, rattled the market.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m neutral on the technology, even intrigued\u2014I spent three years teaching it, leaning into it\u2014I\u2019m not neutral about investor protection,\u201d said Gensler, who on Tuesday gave a speech about crypto at the Aspen Security Forum. \u201cIf somebody wants to speculate, that\u2019s their choice, but we have a role as a nation to protect those investors against fraud.\u201d\n\nGensler is hoping that Congress would grant the SEC power to oversee crypto exchanges in the US. The goals, he said, are to protect the investor, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring fair markets.",

The competition aims to foster innovative approaches to end hunger, championed by Nigeria\u2019s entrepreneurs.\n\nThe six young men and women received cheques totaling N120 million to support their start- ups. In addition to the cash awards, the start-ups will also receive mentorship from the investor companies and participate in a six-months\u2019 Sprint Programme designed by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).\n\nThe winning innovative entrepreneurs and the amounts they received are:\n\nJerry Oche: ZOWASEL (an online marketplace and crop testing service that connects smallholder farmers with premium buyers): N42 million;\n\nAdepeju Jaiyeoba: COLOURFUL GIGGLES (a natural baby food company working to fight hidden hunger by making baby food affordable and readily available): N21 million;\n\nTosin Ayodele: AGRORITE (a company which helps smallholder farmers to access credit, data driven advisory services and premium markets): N21 million;\n\nAyoola Dominic: KOOLBOKS (a company producing eco-friendly and easily accessible refrigeration solutions, powered by solar energy and equipped with Pay-As-You-Go technology): N21 million;\n\nLuther Lawoyin: PRICEPALLY (a digital food cooperative enabling families or small businesses to share bulk food items among a group or buy food in bulk directly from farmers or wholesalers, making it cheaper and fresher than retail): N10 million, and\n\nMichael Ogundare: CROP2CASH (a company which creates reliable, verifiable credit scores and risk profiles for farmers to unlock much-needed finance to improve their productivity and income): N5 million.\n\nThe initiative and the backing it receives will help to support and contribute to Nigeria\u2019s own efforts at achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 \u2013 which aims to bring an end to hunger.\n\nThe funding for the first Zero Hunger Sprint in Nigeria was provided by five large corporations who are passionate in supporting innovative ideas in the food security and nutrition sector, under the Zero Hunger Roundtable: Promasidor; Guinness Nigeria; TGI; Nigerian Breweries and Tolaram Group.\n\nThe Zero Hunger Roundtable is a multi-sector forum aimed at collectively addressing food challenges as a part of the UN\u2019s global mandate to achieve Zero Hunger by the year 2030.\n\nCommenting on the initiative, Paul Howe, Country Director, WFP Nigeria, said: \u201cWhat we saw at the Zero Hunger Innovation Sprint was amazing. The pitch showcased the incredible talent, energy and dynamism of young Nigerian entrepreneurs \u2013 and the Zero Hunger Roundtable is trying to harness this energy in a way that is socially beneficial and sustainable in addressing hunger challenges\u201d.\n\nIfeyinwa Ugochukwu, CEO, Tony Elumelu Foundation, said: \u201cIt is only through innovation that we can truly rise up to the challenges of food insecurity in Nigeria. Through innovation, therefore, these private sector investors and entrepreneurs can blaze the trail to achieve Zero Hunger in Nigeria by 2030 through innovations that will boost food production and accelerate the transformation and consumption of nutritious food\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, Sade Morgan, Corporate Affairs Director, Nigerian Breweries Plc, noted that, \u201cThe Zero Hunger Sprint Pitch confirmed that we have in Nigeria abundant innovators and young entrepreneurs in the agriculture and food processing sector. Nigerian Breweries Plc is committed to supporting the selected start-ups to provide exciting and sustainable solutions that will boost the agricultural value chain in line with our sustainability agenda.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting, MD Ramesh, CEO, TGI Group, noted that, \u201cAttracting youth into the industry of food production and agriculture is an imperative to get new energy and ideas in the sector. Such an initiative hosted by WFP is a huge attraction for youth participation across genders. We are very impressed by the quality of talent we saw\u201d.\n\nRotimi Odusola, Corporate Relations Director of Guinness Nigeria Plc, said, \u201cThe most inclusive and diverse culture makes for better business and a better world; this continues to drive our passion to support initiatives such as the Zero Hunger Sprint which have the potential to give leverage to smallholder farmers, especially women and differently-abled people in under- served communities across Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBruno Gruwez, CEO, Promasidor, \u201cWe are proud to partner with WFP in the Zero Hunger Sprint in Nigeria. As a leading food company, this forms part of our efforts to bolster backward integration initiatives and accelerate local food production in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nPawan Sharma, CEO, Tolaram Group West Africa, said \u201cThe incredible pitches from the entrepreneurs were truly impressive and we look forward to partnering with them in a socially and commercially beneficial manner while addressing hunger- related challenges in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army has said that the Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) have resorted to releasing video propaganda falsely portraying lavish lifestyle in their enclaves to recruit new fighters.\n\nThe director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, in a statement said the move was because of the obvious reality of defeat and inability to carry out attacks that have hitherto been the strategy to assert relevance in the eyes of the public.\n\nHe said this was as a result of the sustained and well coordinated military bombardments from both Land and Air Components of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) which has exerted so much pressure on the terrorists and their sympathisers, whose only available weapon now, is cheap and uncoordinated propaganda.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe noted that a good number of the terrorists have surrendered to troops in different locations across the theatre, a trend that indicates that they are loosing the capacity to remain in the fight.\n\n\u201cApparently, there are indications that their fighting capability has been severely encumbered by devastating depletion, with their remnants deserting various enclaves, leaving behind a few diehards that will undoubtedly be eliminated by the highly spirited troops of OPHK in no distant future,\u201d the Army spokesman said.\n\nHe said in a bid to replenish their fast depleting fighting force and clandestinely conscript unsuspecting individuals to join their fold, terrorists embarked on a subtle recruitment drive using the said propaganda video to portray a lavish lifestyle in their so-called fortress; a psychological strategy desperately deployed to attract impressionable youths and unsuspecting individuals.\n\nHe added that a cursory look at the video, however, revealed an amateur work of doctored old clips and images from different backgrounds, skewed with blurred imageries that are incoherent and illogical.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe incontrovertible reality is that the group is facing imminent destruction and extinction.\n\n\u201cContrary to the false impression they attempt to project, of a blissful live in their enclaves, the true situation in their evil enclave is one of hunger, disease, brutality, high level of immorality and the constant fear of military offensives.\u201d\n\nHe said such condition was largely responsible for the terrorists\u2019 turning in their arms in droves as the gallant troops of OPHK are rendering their enclaves uninhabitable with fierce offensives.\n\n\u201cWhat the terrorists did not tell their target audience is that their fighters and family members are currently surrendering to the troops in multitudes, laying down their arms and renouncing their membership of the evil organisation and that they were misled in joining in the first place.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, most of the terrorists who surrendered to the troops lamented that the condition in their enclaves have become too harsh and completely unbearable that they had no option than to give themselves up to troops. This is the reality of the situation that confronts every BHT member, contrary to the make-belief and propaganda they conjured up in the video,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Army (NA) being a professional force, adheres to extant laws and international best practices, particularly the provisions that relate to a situation when an adversary surrenders.\n\n\u201cThis informed the acceptance of some BHT members who laid down their arms and willfully denounced violent campaigns. The NA will however not hesitate to subdue unrepentant BHTs who are still fanning the embers of violence in the North East.\u201d he said\n\nHe restated that the Nigeria Army will continue to safeguard the territorial integrity of Nigeria in furtherance of peace and stability in the West African Sub-region.\n\nHe, therefore, called on individuals or groups who have fallen to the antics of BHTs\u2019 clandestine recruitment drive, projected through the propaganda video to surrender themselves and their weapons to the nearest military or security forces outfit or risk testing the might of the ongoing counter insurgency operations.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Army has said that the Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) have resorted to releasing video propaganda falsely portraying lavish lifestyle in their enclaves to recruit new fighters.\n\nThe director, Army Public Relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, in a statement said the move was because of the obvious reality of defeat and inability to carry out attacks that have hitherto been the strategy to assert relevance in the eyes of the public.\n\nHe said this was as a result of the sustained and well coordinated military bombardments from both Land and Air Components of Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) which has exerted so much pressure on the terrorists and their sympathisers, whose only available weapon now, is cheap and uncoordinated propaganda.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe noted that a good number of the terrorists have surrendered to troops in different locations across the theatre, a trend that indicates that they are loosing the capacity to remain in the fight.\n\n\u201cApparently, there are indications that their fighting capability has been severely encumbered by devastating depletion, with their remnants deserting various enclaves, leaving behind a few diehards that will undoubtedly be eliminated by the highly spirited troops of OPHK in no distant future,\u201d the Army spokesman said.\n\nHe said in a bid to replenish their fast depleting fighting force and clandestinely conscript unsuspecting individuals to join their fold, terrorists embarked on a subtle recruitment drive using the said propaganda video to portray a lavish lifestyle in their so-called fortress; a psychological strategy desperately deployed to attract impressionable youths and unsuspecting individuals.\n\nHe added that a cursory look at the video, however, revealed an amateur work of doctored old clips and images from different backgrounds, skewed with blurred imageries that are incoherent and illogical.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe incontrovertible reality is that the group is facing imminent destruction and extinction.\n\n\u201cContrary to the false impression they attempt to project, of a blissful live in their enclaves, the true situation in their evil enclave is one of hunger, disease, brutality, high level of immorality and the constant fear of military offensives.\u201d\n\nHe said such condition was largely responsible for the terrorists\u2019 turning in their arms in droves as the gallant troops of OPHK are rendering their enclaves uninhabitable with fierce offensives.\n\n\u201cWhat the terrorists did not tell their target audience is that their fighters and family members are currently surrendering to the troops in multitudes, laying down their arms and renouncing their membership of the evil organisation and that they were misled in joining in the first place.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, most of the terrorists who surrendered to the troops lamented that the condition in their enclaves have become too harsh and completely unbearable that they had no option than to give themselves up to troops. This is the reality of the situation that confronts every BHT member, contrary to the make-belief and propaganda they conjured up in the video,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Army (NA) being a professional force, adheres to extant laws and international best practices, particularly the provisions that relate to a situation when an adversary surrenders.\n\n\u201cThis informed the acceptance of some BHT members who laid down their arms and willfully denounced violent campaigns. The NA will however not hesitate to subdue unrepentant BHTs who are still fanning the embers of violence in the North East.\u201d he said\n\nHe restated that the Nigeria Army will continue to safeguard the territorial integrity of Nigeria in furtherance of peace and stability in the West African Sub-region.\n\nHe, therefore, called on individuals or groups who have fallen to the antics of BHTs\u2019 clandestine recruitment drive, projected through the propaganda video to surrender themselves and their weapons to the nearest military or security forces outfit or risk testing the might of the ongoing counter insurgency operations.",

          "text": "The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has revealed that the Ministry of Finance was frustrating the disbursement of the $200million Cabotage Vessels Finance Fund (CVFF).\n\nRecall that the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) had in March said it received the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari to disburse the Fund to qualified indigenous maritime operators in line with the Treasury Single Account (TSA) policy and the CVFF Guidelines of 2006.\n\nHowever, the agency is yet to apply the over $200 million accumulated in the Fund into the acquisition of vessels for local shipowners, who have been struggling to survive due to lack access to funds to run their business.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking at the federal ministry of transportation\u2019s 2020 ministerial retreat in Lagos on Friday, Amaechi said President Buhari and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), have approved the disbursement of the fund but the minister of finance, Zainab Ahmed, protested against the disbursement of the fund, saying public fund shouldn\u2019t be disbursed to private operators.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cthe president made approval saying go ahead and disburse, and the attorney-general said go ahead, the law says its a private fund but the minister of finance, Zainab Ahmed protested that it is a public fund and cannot be spent, so what will I do?\u201d Amaechi asked rhetorically.\n\nHe, therefore, advised shipowners to write a protest letter to the president, seeking the disbursement of the fund and explaining why the fund is a private fund.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cthe owners of the fund should write to the president and copy me, then I will go back to the president. The law says it\u2019s not a public fund, now that they are aware they should write to say we are aware of the approval, and we are aware of the protest by the minister of finance and if I have all these, I will go back to the President,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister also disclosed that with the commissioning of the Deep Blue Project, vessels unable to visit the eastern ports can now do that without fear of any attack or hijack.\n\n\u201cI said we will address the issue of security in the maritime sector because the reasons why vessels are not able to go to Port Harcourt, Warri and other places is because of the high cost of insurance.\n\n\u201cHigh cost of insurance is as a result of insecurity, so if we address the issue of insecurity which is the root cause, then, the high cost of insurance will reduce and more business will go to the South-South where we have other seaports.\n\n\u201cSince we launched the equipment for the security architecture, we are now monitoring to see how much improvement and this is going to reduce because there is presence of equipment and human being managing them,\u201d Amaechi added.\n\nAlso speaking, the director-general of NIMASA, Dr Bashir Jamoh, said the agency was doing everything possible to put the floating dockyard into use.\n\nAccording to him, the quay to berth the floating dock at Continental shipyard is weak, rusty and old, hence the need for rehabilitation.\n\nJamoh said, \u201cconcerning the floating dock, where we are right now is finding space to berth the facility in Continental Shipyard because we have an agreement with NPA and we have advertised with the managing partner and the NPA.\n\n\u201cWe are going to use the NPA\u2019s continental shipyard, but the problem has to do with continental shipyard because you know when you are bringing in ship, you must find a place where you can berth that particular ship.\u201d",

We will still discuss the outcome of the meeting with the press but that is not now,\u201d the monarch, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said.\n\nAsked the identities of the top government officials, he said, \u201cMinisters and special advisers to the president are among them. The feedback has been positive so far. We will be meeting with the president soon. We will continue to press that the right thing is done.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson for Ilana Egbe Omo Oduduwa confirmed the development, saying, \u201cYes, the monarchs have been very helpful. We are hopeful that Igboho will be granted asylum this week.\u201d\n\nDr Malik Falola, a Benin-based counsel for Igboho, had hinted that Benin Republic is avoiding a diplomatic row that may arise between Nigeria and the francophone country if Igboho\u2019s matter is \u201cnot well-managed\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cDoes the law say Sunday should be returned? No, the law does not permit that. ECOWAS law does not permit that. He is not a Benin citizen. But if he is arrested by Benin another country must justify why he should be released to them.\n\n\u201cIs it the case that Nigeria wants Benin to release him so that he can be killed? If it is the case that he committed an offence here and he ran to Nigeria, Benin Republic can call for his extradition because the charges against him here are not political. But since he committed the offences here, he has to be tried here.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria insists that Igboho is their citizen, they must know that the law must be followed. Both parties won\u2019t want a diplomatic row over this matter. The law is clear.\u201d\n\nIgboho and his wife were arrested on Monday, July 19, 2021, by the International Criminal Police Organisation at the Cadj\u00e8houn Airport in Cotonou, Republic of Benin on their way to Germany. Ropo was later released.\n\nThis was after DSS raided his house in Ibadan and declared him wanted for stockpiling arms.\n\nWhen he was re-arraigned last Monday, fresh charges were levelled against the 48-year-old activist, who was also returned to a new detention facility.",

          "text": "\u2018\u2026Wearing face masks uncomfortable\u2019 \u2026Third wave\u2018ll be more severe \u2013 Don \u2018\u2026Govt should raise awareness, enforce rules\u2019 \u2026More variants may come in future if \u2026 \u2013 Virologist \u2026Nigeria expecting 41,282,770 vaccines \u2013 FG\n\nNigeria is currently experiencing a spike in the Covd-19 pandemic with the discovery of the new deadlier Delta variant of the disease in some parts of the country. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the dangers of abandoning safety protocols amidst rising cases.\n\nThe federal government had last year placed the country on a lockdown among other stringent measures as part of efforts to contain the pandemic. The policy caused changes in personal hygiene among Nigerians as they tried to protect themselves from being infected by the virus.\n\nDeadlier variant\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had in July detected a confirmed case with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as Lineage B.1.617.2.\n\nThe Centre, in a statement, disclosed that the variant was detected in a traveller to Nigeria, following the routine travel tests required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja.\n\nThe deadlier Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility. The variant has been detected in over 90 countries and is expected to spread to more countries, according to the NCDC.\n\nThe NCDC Head of Communications, Dr. Yahya Disu, in the statement, said the variant had also been linked to a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation.\n\nHe said, \u201cTaking into consideration the continued Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria, especially the current finding of the very infective Delta variant of the virus in Nigeria, it is noted that the Delta variant is currently wreaking havoc in many African, Asian and Western countries. The variant has overwhelmed the health systems in countries such as South Africa.\n\n\u201cThe Delta variant has been reported to be responsible for the current emerging third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThreats\n\nPublic health experts have warned that the Delta variant of Covid-19 first detected in India remains a big threat to Nigeria, noting that it could spark a surge of the viral infection that will be difficult to contain.\n\nA pharmaceutical research scientist, Dr. Uche Enemalu, said the government should immediately begin to put in place measures to contain the variant confirmed to be responsible for a massive resurgence of Covid-19 infections, as well as deaths, in many countries of the world in the last few weeks.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is 60 per cent more transmissible than other variants and the faster the transmissibility, the more difficult it is to contain.\n\n\u201cAsk people in Europe, see the situation in the USA, follow the figures from South Africa, Uganda and other African countries, and you will see we are dealing with an invasive, evasive and elusive variant that is transmitted rapidly and causes serious illness.\n\n\u201cTo be forewarned is to be forewarned. A warning is not enough anymore; arming ourselves with masks, safe distance and a vaccine is the way to go. Enough of reactive red alert warnings; we must move to combat readiness,\u201d he said.\n\nPerception, abandoning protocols\n\nDespite the detection of the Delta variant and a surge in the number of cases, checks by Blueprint Weekend revealed that many Nigerians have thrown caution to the wind.\n\nThis reporter who visited markets, motor parks, shopping malls and other public areas observed that while the use of hand sanitisers was no longer a common practice, only a few Nigerians wear face masks in public. Many of those with face masks hung them on their chins.\n\nSpecifically in Nyanya, a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), various worship centres, event centres and drinking joints have also been going about their businesses without adhering to safety measures.\n\nA trader at Nyanya market, John Ugwu, said he was struggling to adhere to non-pharmaceutical preventive measures because of the public perception that a third wave of the pandemic was not real.\n\n\u201cWhen Covid-19 entered Nigeria last year, everybody was conscious about wearing their face masks, but now, we think it is not real. I am not used to covering my face or wearing a face mask. It makes me uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cI have five face masks in my house, but I usually forget to wear one each time I leave my house for a business trip. I am still trying to make it a habit.\u201d\n\nLikewise, a resident of Mararaba in Nasarawa state, Hassan Abubakar, told Blueprint Weekend that it was not important to use face masks, adding that the Delta variant would go as the previous strains went down in the country.\n\nExplaining the behavioural change and why many Nigerians may have returned to their old ways regarding personal protection, a psychologist, Dr. Martin Agwogie, said, \u201cRecall that at the initial stage of the Covid-19, there was tension everywhere, people were afraid and people took the lockdown measure, to a large extent, seriously. After a time, people thought Covid-19 might not be as deadly, especially in Nigeria and Africa, as it is in other parts of the globe, due to the mortality rate.\n\n\u201cPeople thought some persons that contracted Covid-19 went into isolation and recovered from it. They thought it was not as serious as they initially thought. There is also the misconception that it is more of a disease of the rich; that only the rich were dying from Covid-19. That affected the level of risk people attached to Covid-19. What that simply means is that their perception of harm from the disease is possibly low.\n\n\u201cPeople survived the first and second waves; people have actually got to a stage where they said there was no Covid-19, so going back to taking precautionary measures was like going back to what they thought was over. Some had dropped their face masks and other preventive measures. For them, going back to it would be a challenge, especially because they don\u2019t see it as a risk.\u201d\n\nThird wave\n\nGiven the disregard for non-pharmaceutical protocols by Nigerians, a professor of virology at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Luke Ukonu, told Blueprint Weekend a third wave is imminent.\n\nHe said, \u201cA third wave is a high possibility. We see the number of lab positive cases climbing and the positivity rate rising. With the reported detection of the Delta variant in Nigeria, and the near abandonment of non-pharmaceutical interventions by most Nigerians, I believe we are getting set for a third wave.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes, it is likely to be more severe than the second wave, just as the second was higher than the first wave. It is, however, hard to make any detailed projection because the elusive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus keeps surprising us.\u201d\n\nPoor vaccination\n\nHowever, a virologist, Musa Yusufu, said the federal and state governments should double their efforts in expanding vaccination campaigns to provide protection for Nigerians and prevent mutations.\n\nHe also encouraged Nigerians to make themselves available for vaccination to prevent further mutations and the spread of the virus. According to him, more variants of Covid-19 could emerge in future if the gap of infections was not closed with vaccination.\n\n\u201cPolio, for example, has a variant called vaccine-derived poliovirus that can also cause infection. The same polio vaccine that was manufactured a long time ago is still in use; another vaccine was not manufactured to take care of that mutant. It is the same way that the Delta variant is a mutant and a common characteristic of the RNA virus is to mutate as they move from one individual to the other.\n\n\u201cMore variants may come in future if we don\u2019t close the gap with vaccination. Don\u2019t let anyone deceive you; before any vaccine is released for emergency use, it serves the primary purpose of protecting. The more the people are vaccinated, the more the virus would be handicapped to mutate and the fewer the opportunities for variants to emerge,\u201d he said.\n\nWay out\n\nThe executive director of Unity Advocacy Forum, Mrs. Jumoke Ayoola, speaking with this reporter on the ways of checking the development, urged Nigerians to adhere to all the safety protocols prescribed by the NCDC.\n\nShe said, \u201cI will encourage people to observe all the preventive measures because by doing so, they are not only protecting themselves against coronavirus, they are protecting themselves against other respiratory and virus infections as well as those that can cause gastroenteritis.\n\n\u201cThe face mask will prevent the spread of other respiratory infections. Wearing the mask on the chin is a waste of time and energy because it will not serve any purpose; the real places that the mask needs to cover are the nose and the mouth.\u201d\n\nAlso, the chairman, Expert Review Committee on Covid-19, himself a virologist, Prof. Oyewale Tomori, said disregarding the preventive measure against contracting and spreading the virus would put many in danger.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is unfortunate and a danger not only to those refusing to wear face masks but also to their families, friends, and loved ones. Covid-19 is still around and being transmitted on a daily basis. The fact that we are not testing efficiently and effectively does not mean it is not around. The person locked up in a room with windows shut says the sun is not shining on a sunny day but those outside in the sun know better.\n\n\u201cHalf a loaf is better than no loaf. The partial protection of the vaccine may be the difference between getting exposed, infected, and surviving or dying. Getting vaccinated and immunised may be the difference between being alive or dying or dead. So, please get vaccinated.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe expert stated further that the third wave might double the number of cases recorded during the second wave.\n\n\u201cFirst, the second wave lasted as long as the first wave, about eight months. However, the first wave produced 62,830 cases and the second wave made 104, 730 people sick. For every sick person in the first wave, we had 1.6 times the number in the second wave. From what we have seen the Delta variant doing in other countries, and should the third wave come in Nigeria, it will be a miracle if we do not see a doubling of the number of cases as we saw in the second wave. See the number of cases we are now reporting in the last two to three weeks; from zero to three-digit numbers.\n\n\u201cKeep persuading, while diligently and actively implementing the non-pharmaceutical interventions. We must all work with each other to encourage people to wear their masks. Establishments, public and private institutions, offices must enforce the guidelines in their spaces. We, as individuals, must persuade, encourage and insist on others complying with guidelines on NPIs.\u2019\u2019\n\nSimilarly, a consultant public health physician, Dr. Hannatu Mohammed, said the face mask had become a necessity now more than ever to keep the Delta variant of the virus at bay.\n\nMohammed said, \u201cThe Delta variant stays more in the atmosphere compared to the previous variants we have had. The implication is that the number of people that could get infected could be more. A person infected with the previous variant could infect two or 2.5 persons at a time. But this new variant can get four to five people infected at once because it stays more in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWe need more face masks now than ever before. The important thing now is how to protect oneself with a face mask. The implication of that is we should not be tired of using face masks now. We need it more because of the peculiarity of the new variant we have now.\u201d\n\nAgwogie, however, urged the government authorities to lead the awareness campaign against Covid-19 by showing example, through public adherence to preventive measures so that the citizens would understand the seriousness and follow suit.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the government also needs to increase the level of awareness and enforce the rule; it is not a case of \u2018do what I say and not what I do,\u2019 because you see people, even those in government still behaving as if there is nothing serious about the pandemic. If those who are respected in society do not adhere to the Covid-19 protocols, it throws caution to the wind.\n\n\u201cWhat I would suggest is persuasion. Let Nigerians know why they need to adhere to the protocols. There is a difference between adhering to protocols and the use of force. When you preach to their conscience, through different channels, it becomes more effective. But that is not to say some measures cannot be used to curtail excesses when there is a breach. But I believe in persuasion and communication as against the use of force.\u201d\n\nAdditional doses\n\nMeanwhile, the executive-director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, disclosed that Nigeria would be expecting 41,282,770 Covid-19 vaccine doses this year. He advised Nigerians to embrace non-pharmaceutical means of curbing the Delta variant of Coronavirus.\n\nFaisal, who disclosed this during a press briefing in Abuja, noted that the Ministry of Health and its agencies were working towards supporting the local production of vaccines in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country has officially ended the first phase of its strategic Covid-19 vaccination plan and is now preparing to commence the second phase in the next few weeks. We have also received communication for the delivery of the following vaccine shipments in the coming months.\n\n\u201c3,924,000 doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca by end of July or early August 2021 from the COVAX facility, 3,930,910 doses of Pfizer-Bio-N Tech Covid-19 vaccine in August from the COVAX facility donated by the United States Government, 3,577,860 doses of Pfizer-Bio-N Tech Covid-19 vaccine in Q3 from the COVAX facility, 29,850,000 doses of Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine by the end of September, that will arrive in batches from the African Union Commission.\n\nFaisal added that the federal government had procured equipment for the preservation of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe are making every effort and are confident that, with your continued support, Nigeria will be able to make more significant utilisation of the vaccines that would be supplied to the country.\n\n\u201cThe National Primary Health Care Development Agency is putting in place all necessary logistics for storage, distribution, security, and accountability for the range of vaccines we are expecting.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the federal government of Nigeria has procured 60 units of U701 ultra-cold chain equipment, and as we speak, no fewer than 37 of them have been deployed to all the 36 states and FCT in preparation to receive all Covid-19 vaccines that would require ultra-cold.\u201d",

          "title": "Keren\u2019s death: Premiere Academy denies rape allegation -NigPilot",
          "text": "\u2026says the school has zero tolerance for sexual harassment\n\nThe Secondary school at the center of controversy over the death of Keren Akpagher, Premiere Academy Lugbe, Abuja , has pushed back on allegations of sexual harassment leading to the death of the 14-year-old SS1 student.\n\nActing Principal of the school, Mr. Chris Akinsowon, in a statement on Thursday, said the school has zero-tolerance for sexual harassment of any kind, whether verbal or physical, as well as in-campus misconduct.\n\nAkinsowon vowed that \u201cin the unlikely event that any form of sexual assault happened to Miss Keren Akpagher in the school, leading to her death, the School Board and Management will join hands with all relevant security agencies to prosecute such a person in line with the laws of the land.\u201d\n\nThe acting principal, who provided further clarifications on the alleged assault of the deceased student, however, maintained that Keren\u2019s autopsy result was not yet out, stressing that it is part of the investigation the school insists must be allowed to take its course and earnestly awaits the result.\n\n\u201cThe autopsy result is not out yet. It is a part of the investigation process the school insists must be allowed to take its course. We earnestly await the result and plead that nothing should be said to pre-empt whatever the outcome might be,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the alleged staff of the school that was sent on indefinite suspension and dismissal, he noted that the dismissal of the staff was \u201c based on a careless talk with a student; that\u2019s part of our commitment in making the school safe for our students and earn the confidence of our parents.\u201d\n\nHe described reports that their students have sworn to an \u2018oath of secrecy\u2019 as very disturbing, stating that \u201chow can secondary students take an \u2018oath of secrecy; this is nothing but blackmail and an attempt to divert the minds of the public from the truth.\u201d\n\nHe assured the general public that \u201cas a school established to train future leaders, we will never give in to spineless, chinless and directionless individuals who are all out to cause people to have a negative opinion of the school.\n\nSpeaking further on Keren\u2019s demise, he said upon her \u201cadmission to the Queen\u2019s Hospital, Wuse Zone 11, Abuja on early Monday, 21st June 2021, the school\u2019s representatives went there to visit her and her mother.\n\n\u201cWe reached out to the family on the very Tuesday, 22nd of June, when we were informed of her demise at the hospital, all activities for that day in the school were shut down. The Management staff and some members of staff went to commiserate with her.\n\n\u201cThe following day, 23rd June, the visit was repeated with a Board member and some staff to deliver a condolence letter, even though she was not in, we delivered it. On the 24th June, 4 members of staff went again, but they were denied entry right from the gate of the Estate. The PTA Executives of the school went on the same day and were equally prevented from entering from the gate of the Estate.\n\n\u201cKeren\u2019s mother denied granting any interviews, yet media houses, publications, social media, and bloggers have been quoting her. A valedictory Service was conducted in memory of Keren Akpagher in the Academy on Monday, 12th July, 2021.\n\nAkinsowon was responding to an earlier press conference held on Wednesday, in which the leader of the Coalition of Gender-Based Violence Responders, Lemmy Ughegbe, alleged that Premiere Academy was one of the schools engaging in the ignoble act of sexual harassment.\n\nUghegbe accused the FCT police of acting like image-makers of Premiere Academy by defending the action and role of the school and failed to release, Katen\u2019s medical report to the mother.\n\nHe said \u201cThe FCT Deputy Commissioner of Police, Fom Pam Joseph, has held on to the medical report of the deceased and refused to give it to the biological mother of the girl.

          "text": "French giants Paris Saint-Germain have made contact with Lionel Messi over a potential move, Mauricio Pochettino has confirmed.\n\nESPN claims to have been informed by sources that the player\u2019s arrival could have an impact on the futures of Kylian Mbappe and Paul Pogba.\n\nThe site claims PSG reached out to Messi on Thursday following the unexpected announcement from Barca that he would not be signing a new deal with them. PSG sporting director Leonardo and chairman Nasser al Khelaifi are heavily involved in the discussions with Messi, having been in contact with his father, Jorge, for some time.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference ahead of PSG\u2019s opening game of the Ligue 1 season, Pochettino confirmed that information. \u201cOf course [signing Messi] is a possibility,\u201d he said. \u201cThe club is working on it and if there is any information we will communicate it as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMessi joining PSG would increase the likelihood of Mbappe, who is out of contract next summer, signing a new long-term deal with the club. This would damage Real Madrid\u2019s hopes of signing the 22-year-old on a free transfer next summer.\n\nMessi\u2019s arrival in Ligue 1 would also mean PSG end their interest in signing Manchester United midfielder Pogba, meaning he would run down his contract at Old Trafford before becoming a free agent next summer.\n\nPSG have long been vocal about their wishes to sign Messi since he announced in August 2020 that he wanted to leave Camp Nou.\n\nPSG\u2019s owner Tamim bin Hamad is eager to bring Messi to the club and is kept informed of all the conversations around the Messi situation. Bin Hamad has been keen to sign either Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo since he bought the club in 2011.\n\nHowever, there will be heavy financial implications for PSG should they manage to entice Messi to the club. While he is a free agent after running down his contract with Barca, the 34-year-old would still command a large contract in terms of wages, commissions, a signing-on fee and bonuses.",

Canada\u2019s contribution is a reflection of our commitment to stand in solidarity and work together with national counterparts and development partners in responding to this unprecedented global crisis.\u201d\n\nGlobally, WFP has extensive experience in supporting governments to implement social protection programmes, including public works and resilience building interventions such as irrigation canals, fish ponds, charcoal dams, tree planting and improving roads for market access. These aim at enabling communities to better adapt to shocks and economic stresses.\n\nIn Tanzania, WFP is currently working with the Government to support the Productive Social Safety Net system managed by the Tanzania Social Action Fund (TASAF) to reach the most vulnerable households. With this contribution from Canada, WFP will be able to strengthen this support for the benefit of those living in the poorest urban areas of the country. Emphasis will be put on addressing gender related vulnerabilities, including those faced by female headed households.\n\nAlso, WFP Country Director and Representative, Sarah Gordon-Gibson, said, \u201cWe are grateful for Canada\u2019s contribution to the World Food Programme in support of the national social protection programme. Social safety nets are essential in ensuring food security and nutrition and changing the lives of the most vulnerable populations, especially women who have the main responsibility for household food security and nutrition. This will enable women to access adequate and diversified food and other basic needs for their family. This contribution reflects Canada\u2019s commitment to building the resilience of vulnerable Tanzanians\u201d.",

          "text": "Barcelona president Joan Laporta has said keeping Lionel Messi was too risky to the club\u2019s finances as \u201cthe club is above players, coaches and presidents.\u201d\n\nMr Laporta said the negotiations to keep Messi at the club are over and that he does not want to generate \u201cfalse hope\u201d that the situation could be fixed.\n\nBarca announced on Thursday that Messi, a free agent since his contract expired in June, will not rejoin the club because of financial problems.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference on Friday, Laporta explained that the \u201cdisastrous\u201d situation inherited from the previous board and LaLiga\u2019s rigid spending limits have made keeping Messi impossible.\n\nThe 34-year-old Messi had reached an agreement to sign a new five-year contract at Camp Nou, extending his 21-year link with the club, and Laporta said the forward is devastated that it will not be possible.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to generate false hope,\u201d Laporta said when asked whether the situation was retrievable. \u201cDuring the course of negotiations, we\u2019ve known of other offers for Messi. There was a time limit, for us and for [Messi\u2019s camp], because they need time. The leagues are starting.\n\n\u201cThe negotiations with Messi have ended and it\u2019s brought us here without an agreement because of the salary limit. Leo wanted to stay, so he\u2019s not happy. We all wanted him to stay, but now, like us, he is facing the reality of what\u2019s happened. A reality that can\u2019t be changed.\u201d\n\nLaporta said the only way to keep Messi would have been to accept the deal proposed by LaLiga this week, which would have seen 10% of the league\u2019s business sold to the investment fund CVC Capital Partners.\n\nWeighing up the pros and cons of LaLiga\u2019s agreement with CVC, Laporta said no one is bigger than the club and that accepting the terms of the sale could have put the club at risk in the long term.\n\n\u201cIt would not be in Barca\u2019s best interests,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe were going to receive some money, but we think that accepting it \u2014 and affecting our [revenue from] television rights for the next 50 years \u2014 is not something we can do [to keep Messi]. It\u2019s too risky. The club is above players, coaches and presidents.\u201d\n\nLaLiga president Javier Tebas, who has been feuding with Laporta and Real Madrid president Florentino Perez over the creation of a European Super League, responded on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNot long ago, you were saying we [LaLiga] were broke,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow we\u2019re valued at \u20ac24.25 billion and there\u2019s access for [clubs] TO GROW, you\u2019re worried about the future income of a league you\u2019d written off as dead.\n\n\u201cYou know that the operation with CVC doesn\u2019t mortgage Barca\u2019s television rights for 50 years, what it does is give them more value for all clubs and that way you can MORTGAGE your BANKS and solve the debt problem. That\u2019s how you understood it a few hours ago.\u201d\n\nYears of mismanagement have led Barca to this point where they are unable to register Messi, their record appearance holder and top goal scorer of all time. Laporta described the situation he has inherited from previous president Josep Maria Bartomeu as a \u201cshipwreck.\u201d",
