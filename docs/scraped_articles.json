          "text": "THE Lagos State Government has warned heads of schools and child-centred institutions in the state against covering up abuses as this is an offence punishable under the law.\n\nThe Executive Secretary, Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency, Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, stated this on Friday during a sensitisation programme for principals and teachers on safeguarding and child protection policy, in Alausa, Ikeja.\n\nShe said, \u201cIt is said that enlightenment is superior to enforcement and that is why we are having this engagement with teachers and principals of both public and private schools to ensure that children in your care are adequately protected and your response to abuses would be aimed towards justice being served.\n\n\u201cLast year, Mr Governor signed the law establishing the Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency and there is a new criminal section that has been created in that law which says that each child-centred institution that tries to cover up a case of child abuse, the institution and personnel will be guilty of an offence punishable by three years imprisonment. Just this week, DSVA has had the cause to investigate allegations of abuse in two schools and we also charged some cases to court.\u201d\n\nThe Director, Monitoring and Investigation, Office of Education Quality Assurance, Mrs Bimpe Savage, urged principals to report abuses in their schools to the education district offices.\n\n\u201cThere are different types of abuse \u2013 physical, emotional, psychological and neglect \u2013 which are rife in schools and the onus is on us to safeguard our children in the schools.\n\n\u201cIf you have reports of abuse, they can be properly investigated by the coordinating directors and evaluators at the zonal and district levels in the state,\u201d she said.\n\nA Child Protection Officer, Mrs Modupe Saheed-Adebambo, explained that the child safeguarding policy adopted by the state involves every step that must be put in place to ensure that children maximise their potential.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has lambasted Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State for his hypocrisy and promotion of religious intolerance in the state which allegedly contributed to the 24-year jail term handed down to atheist, Mubarak Bala.\n\nIn a telephone interview with The PUNCH, Soyinka said the sentence handed down to Bala must be appealed at once even as he argued that it was hypocritical of the Ganduje government and the Sharia authorities to be chasing blasphemers while the governor himself saw nothing wrong in stuffing his babariga outfit with dollars.\n\nGanduje was in 2018 caught on video stuffing his outfit with wads of dollars presumed to be kickbacks, a development which attracted criticisms from several pro-transparency groups.\n\nThe governor however denied receiving kickbacks.\n\nSoyinka said he was shocked by Ganduje\u2019s statement wherein he promised to sign the death warrant of musician, Yahaya Shariff, who was convicted for blasphemy in 2020.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine a governor saying he would sign the death warrant of a musician for blasphemy! For me, it is nothing short of a crime against humanity. It reeks of hypocrisy. This was the same governor that was stuffing his outfit with dollars.\n\n\u201cI have deliberately not called for his arrest because he enjoys immunity. But these are the people who arrest blasphemers,\u201d said the Nobel Laureate.\n\nWhen asked if he would be seeking Ganduje\u2019s prosecution after he leaves office, Soyinka responded, \u201cOf course, the authorities know what to do once he leaves office.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was hypocritical of the northern leaders to hound blasphemers while turning a blind eye to corruption.\n\nThe Nobel Laureate called on civil society groups to launch a campaign against the 24-year imprisonment of Bala even as he insisted that the moves should be made to immediately appeal the sentence.\n\n\u201cI am glad that the conviction will be appealed but I think it is imperative for rights groups to launch a campaign against these atrocities. Nigeria is a secular nation and has no state religion. The conviction is one of the fallouts of the so-called Sharia that was adopted by some of these states years ago.\n\n\u201cWe are not in the dark ages or cavemen. No one should be imprisoned for their religious views. The concept of blasphemy should not even exist in a secular state,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso in an interview with The PUNCH, Bala\u2019s lawyer, James Ibor, said the matter would be appealed soon.\n\nThe lawyer said the 24-year sentence handed to his client was outrageous, adding that the court even lacked the jurisdiction to hear the matter in the first place.\n\nIbor lamented that despite a Federal High Court in Abuja ordering the release of his client, the authorities refused to obey the order.\n\n\u201cWe will appeal the matter very soon. This is a travesty of justice. My client only pleaded guilty because he and his family had been receiving threats and just decided to end it all. And even after pleading guilty, the sentence should not have exceeded five years based on Kano sentencing guidelines and he has already been in detention for two years which means he shouldn\u2019t have been given more than three years,\u201d Ibor said.\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), also condemned the sentence, adding that he was sure the matter would be overturned once it is challenged at the Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cThe conviction will not stand the test of an appeal. He should also apply for bail. No doubt, the Court of Appeal will uphold his fundamental rights of freedom of conscience and freedom of expression,\u201d Falana said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nThe National Chairman of the Maintain Peace Movement and the immediate past National Legal Adviser of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, Barr. Emmanuel Enoidem has said that the endorsement of governorship aspirants by the leader of the party has remained a standard practice and tradition in Akwa Ibom State since the inception of the civilian rule in 1999.\n\nEnoidem, who is also an aspirant for the Senate seat of Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District, said this yesterday when he led Pastor Umo Eno, the leading PDP governorship aspirant for consultations with former PDP state and chapter officers at the PDP State Secretariat in Uyo.\n\nAccording to Enoidem, he, as a foundation member of the PDP in the State, was present in the Ewet Housing residence of Atuekong Don Etiebet, the leader of the PDP at that time, where a stakeholders\u2019 meeting was convened to decide who should be the governorship candidate of the PDP.\n\nHe recalled that Etiebet simply walked into the gathering and announced that Obong Victor Attah from Uyo Senatorial District would be the governorship candidate and that was it.\n\n\u201cI, myself, I was a supporter of Benjamin Okoko, and the secretary of his campaign team, but I had to obey my leader,\u201d Enoidem said.\n\nHe also brought back to memory how Governor Attah initially endorsed Godswill Akpabio and later changed his mind to Bob Ekarika.\n\n\u201cMany PDP stakeholders who had already started working for Akpabio were unhappy but I remained with Governor Attah.\n\nAnd I had told Akpabio before that he should not say that it was not Attah who made him because it was Attah who made him.\n\nThe lawyer, who is championing the nomination and election of Pastor Umo Eno, reminded stakeholders that Akpabio himself, as the leader of PDP in the State endorsed Udom Emmanuel and it came to pass against all odds because the leader had spoken.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow, it is the turn of Governor Udom Emmanuel. More than any other leader in the past, this governor took time and carried along a cross-section of stakeholders and every section of the State, before he endorsed Umo Eno. I am here to consult with you and ensure that you join other stakeholders in this winning team\u201d.\n\nEnoidem said that loyalty to his leaders is what has seen him to his political pinnacles today and that it was that same trait that Akpabio saw and invited him into his team after he emerged as the flag bearer of the party in 2007.\n\n\u201cGovernor Udom is the leader of my party in this State. I cannot embarrass my leader. God forbid. Luckily for us, the man that our leader has endorsed is one of the very best of Akwa Ibom men in competence and character and I call on all of us delegates to demonstrate your loyalty to our leader and support Umo Eno\u201d.\n\nPaul Ekpo, the former two-term state chairman of PDP and a former National ex-officio member spoke passionately also in the same vein.\n\nHe narrated how he had bought his senatorial nomination forms recently with N5.5 million but the leadership of the party discouraged his bid \u201cin the interest of the party\u201d and he had to simply obey in spite of his hierarchy in this party.\n\nHe described Eno as a tested and highly successful entrepreneur who will not only spread the spirit of entrepreneurship for the benefit of the youths but a peaceful man who will ensure that Akwa Ibom remains a land of peace\u201d.\n\nThe consultations, which took place late in the evening, took an emotional dimension when the former PDP officers said that in the history of the party they had never been so honoured and consulted as a group by a governorship aspirant.\n\nFormer State Legal Adviser, Barr. Godwill Umoh; former House of Assembly Member, Obong Aniedi Andem, and former state deputy chairman of PDP, Sir Michael Essang, spoke respectively for Uyo, Eket and Ikot Ekpene Senatorial Districts, while former Ibeno PDP Chairman, Ekokwaha Etteh, spoke for former local government chapter chairmen.\n\n\u201cGovernor Udom Emmanuel has taken a wise and informed decision in preferring Pastor Umo Eno.\n\nWe the former officers of the party in Eket Senatorial District have already made up our minds to support the aspiration of Pastor Umo Eno,\u201d Essang said. Barr Umoh, Obong Andem and Mr Etteh, spoke likewise.\n\nPastor Umo Eno, while speaking at the event said: \u201cFor years now, politicians looking for votes during elections have normally shown up to throw chicken feed at our youths and disappear soon after they got the votes.\n\n\u201cBut with humility, I am here as someone who has lived here in this state with you since 1995 and grown my businesses very successfully from the scratch, to tell you that I will help you, help our youths and women to start their businesses and grow them successfully as I did myself.\n\n\u201cWith all humility, I am a job creator as you all know. If I could create thousands of jobs in this state as a private businessman, you can imagine how many jobs I will create when God makes me the governor.\n\n\u201cSo when any other governorship aspirant comes around to promise that he will create jobs, tell them to show you where he created one job before.\n\nEno was accompanied to the consultations by officials of the MPM, led by the National Chairman, Barr. Enoidem, Deputy Chairman of his Campaign Team, Dr. Godwin Ntukude, and several members of his support groups lead by Friends Of Umo Eno League and Team Umo Eno.",
          "summary": "Emmanuel Enoidem has said that the endorsement of governorship aspirants by the leader of the party has remained a standard practice and tradition in Akwa Ibom State since the inception of the civilian rule in 1999.\n\u201cMany PDP stakeholders who had already started working for Akpabio were unhappy but I remained with Governor Attah.\nPaul Ekpo, the former two-term state chairman of PDP and a former National ex-officio member spoke passionately also in the same vein.\n\u201cGovernor Udom Emmanuel has taken a wise and informed decision in preferring Pastor Umo Eno.\nEnoidem, Deputy Chairman of his Campaign Team, Dr. Godwin Ntukude, and several members of his support groups lead by Friends Of Umo Eno League and Team Umo Eno.",

          "title": "#EndSARS: Police welfare still in a shambles",
          "text": "More than one year after the country witnessed widespread protests over rampant police bestiality, it is still business as usual in the Nigerian Police Force. OMOBOLA TOLU-KUSIMO reports that the situation is so bad that some police personnel confessed that they often go to work with a mentality to make money and not how to burst or curb crime.\n\nIt was, no doubt, a daring move that sought to cure the ailing soul of their maligned profession, but it ended in tears for the organisers. That was last month, when news broke that there would be a nationwide industrial action by police personnel. As a prelude to the unusual event, organisers of the supposed industrial action announced a two-week warning strike. Their grouses: poor working conditions, poor salaries, lack of genuine welfare and outdated weapons, among other complaints.\n\nAs expected, the police management swiftly moved against the ringleaders. At last, the careers of two inspectors, five sergeants and two constables bit the dust. The nine men were dismissed from service following their orderly room trial for planning and coordinating a strike within the ranks and file of the police. They were said to have been traced and subsequently arrested after their phone calls were tracked.\n\nThe dismissed nine policemen are: AP/No. 245800 \u2013 Insp Nanoll Lamak; AP/ NP 287568 \u2013 Insp Amos Nagurah; F/No. 271367 \u2013 Sgt Onoja Onuche; F/No. 442680 \u2013 Sgt Franklin Agughalau; F/No. 495378 \u2013 Sgt Emmanuel Isah F/No. 508168 \u2013 Sgt Adesina Ismail; F/No. 508282 \u2013 Sgt Osoteku Ademola; F/No. 525839 \u2013 Police Constable Ehighamhen Favour Ebele and F/No. 528222 \u2013 Police Constable Ubong Inem.\n\nThey have since been de-kitted, ejected from their police accommodation, and their names deleted from IPPIS payroll. However, the issues that brought them doom were part of what sparked an unprecedented crisis for weeks in 2020, with widespread demonstrations embarked upon by young Nigerians almost birthing far-reaching reforms concerning civil-police relations. That was October 2020 when #EndSARS protests against rampant police brutality rocked the country, forcing the youth to demand an end to the notoriously ruthless police unit then known as Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\nMore than one year after, many Nigerians believe the police remain largely the same, despite purported reforms that followed the protests. The federal government, obviously moved by the widespread demonstrations, also reached some concessions with the protesters, including setting up of judicial panels of inquiry by state governments to look into cases of alleged violations of human rights by the disbanded SARS and other units of the police.\n\nBut alas, the police checkpoints have returned. So are unprofessional misdemeanours and outright excesses on the part of bad eggs among the nation\u2019s law enforcement agents. A recent case in point that showed that it is business as usual happened in Ketu, Lagos. The encounter between a businesswoman and a policeman goes thus: \u201cHey madam, stop the car\u2026Wind down your glass,\u201d said a policeman on duty on Ketu overhead bridge at a checkpoint in February 2021. After the woman parked and wound down her window, the officer beggarly said, \u201ce fun mi l\u2019owo ki nfi j\u2019eun,\u201d meaning give me money to eat.\n\nInfuriated by the action of the policeman, the woman, Mrs. Esther Obi, chided him. \u201cOfficer, what you have just done is wrong. You mean you stopped me just to ask me to give you money to eat,\u201d she queried. \u201cYou just sounded like a beggar, desecrating our Nigerian police uniform. You don\u2019t even care whether I am a foreigner. Is this how you portray the country to foreigners? This is bad,\u201d she added.\n\nMrs. Obi was not alone in this ugly experience from Nigeria\u2019s law enforcement agents. In January 2021, Mr. David Adeyemi, an accountant, approached a roadblock mounted by some policemen. As he slowed down, he watched to know if they would ask him to park or not. Rather than stop him politely, one of them used his gun to hit the body of his car, shouting \u201cHey you\u2026stop there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you not stop,\u201d he asked as he moved towards Mr. Adeyemi. \u201cI was waiting to know if you will ask me to stop or not,\u201d said Adeyemi. Officer started smiling and said\u2026\u201d Okay, give us money. Your boys are here,\u201d he said. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to check my vehicle particulars,\u201d Adeyemi asked?\n\n\u201cLeave particulars, oga. All we want is money. Give your boys money,\u201d he exclaimed. Adeyemi expressed his displeasure and said\u2026 \u201cOfficer, you just hit my car with your gun. And then you ask me for money. This is part of why Nigerians protested against police that led to the mishap from #EndSARS. Nobody will expect that you will still behave in the manner you just did when #EndSARS destruction to the country is still stirring us all in the face. I do not want to encourage your behaviour nor compensate it; hence I will not give you any money. I insist you check my vehicle particulars and let me go,\u201d he said.\n\nThe officer eventually let Adeyemi go, having realised he was one of the citizens who know their rights. This is the story of many Nigerians who come across the police at various checkpoints on a daily basis, including the youth. It was many of these kinds of unprofessional behaviours on the part of policemen that got young Nigerians angry in 2020 leading to protests that almost brought the country to its knees. While this is a far cry from what their counterparts in other developing countries do, it appears that the police officers in Nigeria have refused to learn from the mistakes that led to #EndSARS crisis in October 2020.\n\nPolice officer recounts ordeals of colleagues\n\nThe Nation spoke exclusively with some policemen under the condition of anonymity. Luckily, some of them bared their minds. Sanni Bello, an inspector, said he is distressed daily by the situation he finds himself. He said he is not happy that he would wake up in the morning, get to work with a mentality of how he will make money and not how he will burst or curb crime. He revealed that this is how he and many of his colleagues reason every day.\n\n\u201cI am an inspector and I earn N90,000. I buy my uniform and some other working tools. As it is, the system does not support you if you want to be a good cop. I am pained that we have to suffer. There are so many things that are wrong. This is why I cannot live in the barracks because I do not want my children to grow in such environment. More so, the buildings are distressed and they can collapse at any time.\n\n\u201cWhen you see policemen looking dirty and haggard, it is because they cannot sew a new uniform for themselves as they usually do. If you know you want to look good and clean, you have to sew your uniform by yourself. The last time I was issued a uniform was in 2002 and I was issued because I was working at the headquarters.\n\n\u201cThose on the field, divisions and others do not get uniforms. We buy them by ourselves. But if you want to wait for the government to issue you one, you will wait forever while you look dirty. I have spent 22 years in service and I have only been issued uniform twice, the first one when I was in the college and the second when I was working at the headquarters.\u201d\n\nWhen asked where they sew their uniform, he said: \u201cWe buy and sew our uniforms from the barracks or police store around Mobolaji Bank Anthony, Lagos. It belongs to the police and it is where they are supposed to be issuing us the uniform at no cost. But unfortunately, we are made to pay from our pockets. Tell me how we will not look for money from the public by all means?\n\n\u201cPresently, the camouflage is available for us to buy in the barracks. I have about six uniforms which cost me over N60,000. Yet I earn a meagre salary of N90,000. The police authority has taught us to seek money from the public and that is what is causing the tension between us and the people. Also, my housing allowance is just about N5000 per month. The salary increase that was announced during and after #EndSARS by President Muhammadu Buhari is yet to be paid to us. It is pathetic.\n\n\u201cImagine, a constable earns between N45,000 and N48,000; an inspector earns between N90,000 and N140,000 while a DPO depending on his rank as Chief Superintendent of Police or Superintendent of Police does not earn up to N250,000 naira monthly.\u201d\n\nThe officer, who said nothing has changed with their welfare since #EndSARS, maintained that they are still doing everything that led to the crisis in October 2020. \u201cWhat broke the camel\u2019s back that led to #EndSARS were majorly the extrajudicial killings, which is still happening. There is unprofessionalism among the police. Some of us drink at work and some to stupor. These are mistakes that we do while on duty that have led to deaths of citizens.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the change he would like to see happen in the police force, he said: \u201cFirst of all, we need to dress well and look good because when we look attractive, the people will receive us better. Secondly, we need to be trained and retrained. Many of us need to go for counselling. After the #EndSARS, we were subjected to go for psychiatric evaluation, which we did. Although we are not shown our results, we went for the test. Many of us are very hostile to the members of the public, which makes them to be hostile to us in return.\n\n\u201cI believe that what you give is what you get. When you are not doing your job, people will complain and get angry. Sometimes, the hostility we get from people hinders our job. For instance, we receive information that somebody wants to transport arms in an area and we move to condone off the area and make arrest. The residents in the area will engage us and block us from effecting the arrest out of ignorance of the crime. They do this because they don\u2019t trust us. Honestly, our job has become much endangered and our lives are more endangered than before and we are finding difficult it to do our job well.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of checking people\u2019s phones, he said: \u201cThis brings me to the aspect of phone checking. We believe that you are your phone and your phone is you. I don\u2019t need to tell you that I\u2019m a police officer if you check my phone. You will know that I am one but we have abused this phone strategy. When we stop to search anybody or suspect crime, the first thing some of us check is the account balance of the suspect. If they find any offence a suspect commits, they will negotiate with him or her, which is very wrong and it is giving us a bad name. But the truth is that we have unravelled and discovered many criminal activities by checking phones.\n\n\u201cI think there is need for public sensitisation and awareness for the people to really understand how we work so that when they see us, we do not become endangered species. We are not all bad and Nigerians cannot do without us. We have our good sides as well. The members of the public need to trust us to be able to protect them better,\u201d he noted.\n\nA DPO laments lack of funding of police stations\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, a DPO in one of the police stations in Lagos lamented the lack of funding of stations across the country. He listed the woes afflicting policing work in the country. \u201cImagine our patrol vehicles are fuelled by the citizens using it because we do not get money to fuel from the Force. There is a budget for it, but it doesn\u2019t get to the stations. Most police stations repair the vehicles by themselves. As I am now, I don\u2019t have body armour bulletproof or crush elements. Yet, I am to face criminals every day.\n\n\u201cThat is why you see police look away from a robbery incident. They feel it is not their family that is being robbed because even the people don\u2019t appreciate what we do. Many times, people want to beat police or mob us. Things need to change. The authorities are not fair to us. They know that we cannot talk because it will lead to mutiny. But the rot in the system will lead to protest, which may happen very soon.\u201d\n\nHe added that they need to have proper insurance cover such that they are sure of recovery physically, emotionally and financially and in the cause of death, their families are paid benefits. \u201cPresently, what we do when any of us become incapacitated is that we contribute money among ourselves to donate to the family, noting that it was only recently that we were enrolled under health insurance.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, our pension is nothing to write home about. In fact, when we think of pension, we get more frustrated because we see our senior colleagues who have retired lamenting that they cannot sustain their selves with what they are paid. For instance, a Chief Superintendent of Police that got N2 million or N3 million in his Retirement Savings Account (RSA) is being paid monthly pension of about N30,000. What we have seen is that many of them go back to working as security in banks and other places.\n\n\u201cThis experience has made many of us to find ways of making money while in service from offenders. We want to meet up with the standard of an average person. How can the police authorities expect us to survive on the present salary structure? The salary has been reviewed by President Muhammadu Buhari twice; yet we are not paid. As it is now, most policemen have the mentality of going out in the morning just to make money and not to actually burst crimes.\u201d\n\nTo change the face of policing, he advocated for state policing, citing how Lagos State has been taking care of the operatives of the Rapid Response Squad. \u201cThose of us that are strictly under federal police are overwhelmed. Our work strength is not up to 500,000 to 200 million people, far below the United Nations recommendation. So, I believe that state policing is the way to go. We envy our colleagues in the RRS under Lagos State because they are paid a different salary apart from what they are getting at the federal level. They also look well kitted. At the federal level, we are forced to buy uniforms and basic items of kit from uniforms to handcuffs out of our salaries.\u201d\n\nAnother police officer said: \u201cNothing has changed after #EndSARS. It is business as usual for many officers as seen on the road. We live by what motorists, offenders and other people give us. We don\u2019t know what the authorities use monies budgeted for us to do, but we cannot fight. There is no CSP that is collecting 200,000. Even DPO and Area Commander collect like N200,000. We are urging President Muhammadu Buhari to make sure that the salary increase is implemented while they improve our welfare generally. We buy our kits with our own money and they are aware. We also maintain our vehicle,\u201d he added.\n\nEven police retirees don\u2019t fare better. A police retiree, Izuata Momodu, who retired in 2011, said he had written an article 23 days after he retired corruption in the police in Nigeria. The said article was about his plight and the rot pervading the police service in the country. \u201cAfter my retirement, I suffered a terrible stroke that affected vital parts of my body. I needed N1.2 million at the time to treat myself, but I couldn\u2019t get help after serving my country for 35 years. I nearly died. I had to borrow money to pay for hospital bills and I became indebted after retirement.\n\n\u201cI wrote that if the Federal Government wants to eradicate corruption in the police, they should pay good salary and pension. This has not happened till date. In no distant time, nobody is going to join police again. I could not build a house because I wanted to be honest and not rob the people. I refused to shed blood. I shunned corruption, but what is my gain today. I am earning N49,000 monthly as pension. This is not sufficient for me to buy my drugs; needless say feed me and my family. I had to retire back to my father\u2019s house because I couldn\u2019t build a house.\u201d\n\nHow policemen fare abroad in terms of welfare package\n\nEvery policeman in Nigeria will be green with envy, if not ashamed of his enlistment, when showed the remuneration packages available to his counterparts, especially in poorer African countries. In Nigeria, often touted as Africa\u2019s giant, police employees are forced to make do with the worst salary structure when compared to what their counterparts collect in other African countries. In Nigeria, the least officers in police force are the police recruits, who are generally regarded as candidates undergoing training to become members of the police force. Police constable (grade level 3) earns N43,293.80; while the Inspector General (IG) of police goes home with N711,498.00 every month.\n\nPolice Constable Grade Level 03 (N43, 293.80 per month or N519,525.6 per annum); Constable Grade Level 10 (N51,113.59 per month or N613,363.08 per annum); Corporal Grade 04 (per month \u2013 N44,715.53 or N536,586.36 per year); Sergeant Grade 05 (per month \u2013 N48,540.88 or annual salary \u2013 N582,490.56); Sergeant Major Grade 06 (per month \u2013 N55,144.81 or annual salary \u2013 N661,737.72); Cadet Inspector Grade Level 07 (salary per month \u2013 N73,231.51 or annual salary \u2013 N878,778.12); Assistant Superintendent of Police Grade 08 (per month \u2013 N127,604.68 or annual salary \u2013 N1,531,256.16); Deputy Superintendent of Police Grade 10 (per month \u2013 N148,733.29 or annual salary \u2013 N1,784,799.48); Superintendent of Police on Grade 11 (per month \u2013 N161,478.29 or annual salary \u2013 N1,937,739.48); Chief Of Superintendent of Police on Grade 12 (per month \u2013 N172,089.06 or annual salary \u2013 N2,065,068.72); Assistant Commissioner of Police Grade 13 ( per month \u2013 N183,185.73 or annual salary \u2013 N2,198,228.76); Deputy Commissioner of Police Grade 14 (per month \u2013 N242,715.65 or annual salary \u2013 N2,912,587.8); Commissioner of Police on Grade 15 (per month \u2013 N266,777.79 or annual salary \u2013 N3,201,333.48); Assistant Inspector General of Police (per month \u2013 N499,751.87 or annual salary \u2013 N5,997,022.44); or Deputy Inspector General of Police (per month \u2013 N546,572.73 or annual salary \u2013 N6,558,872.76); Inspector General of Police (per month \u2013 N711,498 or annual salary \u2013 N8,537,976).\n\nAccording to the annual report by the South African Police Service (SAPS), published in November 2021, the country has 182,126 police employees \u2013 a decrease of over 5,200 employees compared to the 2020 report. The reporting period covered April 2020 to March 2021. This figure includes both active police officers and administrative staff: 21,396 commissioned officers; 122,075 non-commissioned officers; 37,840 Public Service Act employees. These reduced employment figures effectively give South Africa a police to population ratio of 1:413.\n\nWith this, South Africa falls within the generally accepted benchmark of one police officer to 450 people. The SAPS employees work across a range of sectors including administration, visible policing and crime intelligence, with salaries averaging at R206,000 for the lowest skills level (1-2). This rises to an average salary of R1,435,000 for senior management and executive employees (levels 13-16), while the average salary across all levels is R416,000.\n\nIn Ghana, the minimum police salary ranges from 1320GHS per month to 4550GHS per month (or N86,226.59 to N297,220.45). In Chad, person working as a police officer earns salaries ranging from 137,000XAF to 473,000XAF (or N93,965.12 to N324,419.71). A person working as a police officer in Cameroon receives from 127,000XAF to 440,000XAF (or N87,106.35 to N301,785.77). In Togo, salaries of police officers range from 152,000XOF to 524,000XOF (or N103,474.16 to N356,713.55).\n\nIn more advanced democracies, police officers are treated almost like kings; not as dregs of society as it happens in Nigeria. In Canada, the average salary for a police officer is over $100,000 (or N41.56 million) a year. An entry level constable will make about $50,000 (or N20.78 million) at the start and, after 3 years of service, the pay jumps to about $82,000 (or N34.09 million) a year. Specifically, a corporal makes between $86,000 \u2013 $90,000 (or N35.75 million to N37.40 million), sergeant $95,000 \u2013 $98,000 (or ?39.48 million to N40.73 million), inspector $126,000 and superintendent $140,000 (or N52.37 million to N58.19 million).\n\nWhile the median average salary for police and sheriff patrol officers in the United States is around $60,000 or N24.93 million. This amount varies, depending on the state and level of experience. Some of the highest paying states are New York (average \u2013 $103,000 or N42.81 million and entry level $62,000 or N25.77 million), California (average \u2013 $102,000 or N42.39 million and entry level: $80,000 or N32.25 million), New Jersey (average \u2013 $100,000 or N41.56 million and entry level $53,000 or N52.03 million)\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the national average salary for police officers is \u00a331,000 a year and their full time working hours is around 40 hours per week in 8 hour shifts. In fact, overtime hours are paid at a higher rate, making the average London officers going home with around \u00a34,000 a year in overtime salary. Generally, the starting salary for the police constables in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is between \u00a319,400 and \u00a323,000 per year. In around 7 years, it rises to around \u00a338,300; while typical salaries with several years of experience is \u00a336,900 \u2013 \u00a342,000 for a sergeant; \u00a347,730 to \u00a351,771 for inspector; and \u00a352,830 to \u00a355,005 for chief inspector. Those who work in London get an extra amount of \u00a32,373 as London weighting.\n\nWhat should be done, by experts\n\nThe Executive Director, Rule of Law and Accountability Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), Okechukwu Nwanguma, in an interview with The Nation, said President Buhari must demonstrate genuine commitment to genuine police reform by ensuring full implementation of the Police Act and by leading by example by respecting and acting in accordance with the provisions of the Police Act and other laws. He stated that police external accountability mechanisms must be strengthened while police leadership must prioritise discipline by supporting and empowering internal control and disciplinary mechanisms, such as the Complaints Response Unit (CRU), to investigate and address public complaints and act as tools for checking professional misconduct and changing the culture of incivility and impunity. There must also be a radical improvement in the welfare and working conditions of police personnel because this is one of the means to fight corruption and humanise the police, Nwanguma added.\n\nHe urged the government to implement the new Police Act 2020, which was passed and assented to by President Buhari one month before the outbreak of the October 2020 #EndSARS uprising. Nwanguma posited that the purpose of the new Police Act is to democratise the police force by transforming it from a brutal, corrupt and ineffective colonial police of occupation to a people-friendly, service-oriented and accountable police that operates in accordance with democratic policing standards and capable of public trust and support.\n\n\u201cThe promises made by government specifically to redress countless cases of police abuse and ensure an end to impunity are yet to be fulfilled. Instead, police brutality remains widespread while the authorities continue in their failure to address documented cases with a view to bringing perpetrators to justice and ensuring justice for victims.\u201d\n\nSenior Legal Adviser, Human Rights Law Service (HURLAWS), Collins Okeke, acknowledged that a lot has happened in more than one year after #EndSARS, adding that judicial panels were constituted by some states; while most of the panels have submitted reports. What, however, remains to be done is the implementation which tragically has not started, he stated. \u201cThe poor welfare from poor salary, pension, housing, inadequate equipment to work, among others, has over time reduced their self-esteem and means of livelihood, thereby causing them to engage in unethical practices. There is also lack of discipline,\u201d Okeke pointed out.",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru,Owerri\n\nAfter razing the country home of Imo State Attorney General and Commissioner for justice, Cyprian Akaolisa at Obibi Awo \u2013 Idemili in Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State, gunmen again on Saturday night returned to set fire on one of his houses again and that of his aged father.\n\nThis time around, according to the commissioner, the hoodlums showed no mercy as they reduced the houses to rubble.\n\nConfirming the incident, Akaolisa accused his Igbo brothers for being responsible for the arson on his house and that of his father\u2019s.\n\nAkaolisa who wrote on his Facebook wall said \u201cThe Igbo are hardworking people who through their years of toils put up structures and leave developmental strides in their communities of Origin maka.\n\n\u201cThrough my many years of struggle, I have managed to put a block on another to build a befitting house for my family. My aged father also has a house he built through his sweats.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cToday, the both buildings are in rubbles and ashes \u2013 our fellow Igbos burnt them.\n\n\u201cFirstly, last year, these arsonists burnt my country home in Obibi, Awo-Idemili, Orsu LGA of Imo State for no just cause.\n\n\u201cThis year again, they returned and this time, they perfected the complete burning of even the blocks/bricks.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cAnd last night, to my utter consternation, they leveled my father\u2019s house. This is a house my father built by himself \u2013 the life-toil of an aged man.\n\n\u201cIn other words, I wish to put on record that my family house is completely destroyed. This was after they used a truck to cart all the properties: fridges TVs, bed/foams, generator sets and other household materials.\n\n\u201cWhat are my crimes, who did I offend? And what were my father\u2019s offences?\n\n\u201cAnd I dare ask, where is the Igbo spirit? This is a direct affront on the ak\u1ee5 ruo \u1ee5l\u1ecd spirit. Who will invest in Ala Igbo nay Orsu LGA today under this type of atmosphere?\n\n\u201cThe above are acts of arson ongoing in my LGA of Orsu. The complete burning of our LGA Secretariat, the house of my colleague \u2013 Chief Prince Ford Ozumba, the Hon Commissioner, Imo State Ministry of Labour, Employment and Productivity, the house of Hon. Ekene Nnodumele, the member representing Orsu State Constituency in the Imo State House of Assembly. There are also houses of other political leaders which have been razed in my area so far.\n\n\u201cOther ungodly acts are the sacking and carting away of all the Police presence & armouries in Orsu LGA, the kidnapping and killing of well-to-do individuals and security operatives. This attendant scare has become a daily phenomenon in my Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cToday, these gunmen (Codenamed \u1ee4m\u1ee5 \u1eccma, under the guise of freedom fighters) have continued to demand huge sums of money from mourning families who wish to bury their loved ones and the likes. It is now strictly business! These gunmen have almost made a god of themselves, killing and carniballising at will, in my area but believe me, they will not succeed with our voices up and collaborative efforts.\n\n\u201cWhere is the Igbo spirit, \u1ee5m\u1ee5nne m?It is unfortunate that majority of those who forment these troubles are not indeginous to Orsu but have garnered collaborators and enablers among the locals either through fear, persuasion, financial inducements and made to swear to devilish oats of secrecy.\n\n\u201cIt is time to synergize and put an end to the seige in Orsu LGA and liberate our people who are worse hit by the economic downturn occasioned by the ravaging insecurity. For the enablers and cheerers, It is time for the needed restropect, soul-searching to interrogate the process so far by weighing the gains and loses.\u201d\n\nThe police spokesperson for the command, Micheal Abattam, is yet to confirm the incident to newsmen.",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nLeader of the Indigenous People of Biafra\u2019s(IPOB) freedom was the focus of discussion by the Ohanaeze Ndigbo when they converged in Owerri, the Imo State capital at the weekend during the reception ceremony of the President General of the Igbo apex body, professor George Obiozor at the government house.\n\nAlmost all the leaders in the zone spoke against the continual detention of Kanu, as a matter of fact, elder statesman ,Mbazuluike Amaechi in his contribution at the meeting believed a greater part of the insecurity challenge occurring in the zone would be drastically reduced if he regains his freedom.\n\nRecalling his earlier meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on the condition of Kanu\u2019s release, the elder statesman expressed worry that more groups may come up for agitation if he is not released now when the ovation is high.\n\nHe resounded that he will hand over Kanu to Ndigbo on his release as part of his promise when he met with the president but kicked against the destruction of properties in the south east by hoodlums ,insisting that it will never impact positively on the economy of the zone.\n\nHe said \u201d I begged Buhari last year ,i was with with bishop Onuoha and others, that he should release Nnamdi Kanu,If you don\u2019t release him, what is happening will continue, more groups are coming up and we must stop that in Igbo land ,if they release him 70 percent of these crisis will stop\u201d.\n\nObiozor in his speech appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to exercise his prerogative of mercy and release Kanu, he is also of the view that both the State and federal government should engaged the restive youths in a dialogue towards the peaceful resolution of the crisis in the zone.\n\nHe also added, \u201cWe wish to appeal to the leaders of IPOB, our sons and daughters ,not to unwittingly add to the burdens of our people.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nObiozor equally appealed to the group to completely lift the sit-at-home in Igbo land saying its effect has created hardship in the people. \u201d Sit-at-home is not a favour to Ndigbo but condemnation of these countless millions of daily income earners to untold hardship\u201d. He said.\n\nSpeaking on the Igbo presidency, governor Hope Uzodimma reiterated his stand for a united Ndigbo to realise \u201cour objective ,my position had been that we Igbos need a united Nigeria to vent our God \u2013 given talents. This is because Nigeria provides us with the space and opportunities we need to actualize our political and socioeconomic destiny.\u201d Uzodimma said.\n\nHe added \u201cThis is why I think that the time has come for every patriot to rise and address the Igbo question. What cannot be taken away is that for too long Igbos have cried out profusely over their plight. This plight is comparable to the plight of the Southwest over the annulment of the June 12 elections.\n\n\u201cFollowing that annulment, the Southwest felt short changed. They cried out for justice. While some groups did so responsibly, others resorted to violence. The instructive thing here is that at a point the patriotic zeal in the political class in Nigeria was touched and they rose in unison to acknowledge that the Yorubas had cried enough and that it was time to wipe their tears.\n\n\u201d It is now obvious from every indication that Ndigbo have also cried enough about their marginalization. It should also be clear to the political class that the time has come to wipe these historical tears of Ndigbo. What is more, most of the patriots who engineered the plan that made the Southwest produce the presidential candidates for the two major political parties in 1999 are still alive and active in politics.\n\n\u201cThat same undying love for the country that inspired them to do what they did for the Southwest in 1999, should inspire them to do the same for the South east in 2023. The West, the North, the East and the South are all important in our quest for national unity. This a clarion call on the political class to do the needful.\u201d The governor stated.\n\nThe ceremony was well attended by prominent Igbo sons and daughters which included, chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu,Aldolphus Wabara, Ike Nwachukwu,Pius Anyim,Nnia Nwodo, Chief Gray Enwo Igariwey, Igwe Alfred Achebe,Victoria Akanwa,chief Ikedi Ohakim, Uche Ogah,ABC Nwosu among others.",
          "summary": "Obiozor equally appealed to the group to completely lift the sit-at-home in Igbo land saying its effect has created hardship in the people.\n\u201d Sit-at-home is not a favour to Ndigbo but condemnation of these countless millions of daily income earners to untold hardship\u201d.\nHe added \u201cThis is why I think that the time has come for every patriot to rise and address the Igbo question.\nThis plight is comparable to the plight of the Southwest over the annulment of the June 12 elections.\nThe West, the North, the East and the South are all important in our quest for national unity.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governors from the South have rejected proposal by the party to throw open the 2023 presidential contest to all qualified aspirants.\n\nThe governors after a meeting in Abuja on Friday night insisted that the PDP 2023 presidential ticket must be zoned to the South in the spirit of equity and fair play.\n\nThis followed the recommendation of the PDP committee on zoning headed by Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, that the presidential ticket should be thrown open to all the qualified aspirants.\n\nThe Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, who spoke after the meeting on behalf of the governors, at a press briefing, said that their stance was based on the resolutions of the Southern Governors Forum at the meetings in Delta and Lagos states that the presidency must be zoned to the South in 2023.\n\nThe meeting was also attended by Governors Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom) and Diri Douye (Bayelsa).\n\nThe Abia governor, who is also the vice chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, stated that it was not the fault of the South that the opposition party did not win the presidential poll in 2019, when the ticket was ceded to the North.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have watched with keen interest the developments in our party especially concerning zoning. Our position is that first, we are committed to the unity of our party and we have worked hard to make sure that this party remains strong and viable vehicle to rescue Nigeria come 2023.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, we want to draw your attention to the fact that we have agreed as Southern Governors in Lagos and also in Delta that this party has to respect the zoning principle as enshrined in our Constitution, and to that effect, we feel that the best thing to do is zone the presidency to the South, and we stand on that position.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cWe have not seen any reason to change our position because the party was founded on the basis of equity and justice. And we also think that equity and justice is an important pillar that will ultimately stabilize our politics towards our journey in rescuing Nigeria. This is our position and that is why we have met today.\u201d\n\nIkpeazu, while fielding question on the reasons on which the zoning committee reportedly resolved to throw the ticket open, said: \u201cIf you want to take a position of policy, you don\u2019t look at problems in their face and take decision. You take a decision and remain firm on that decision. We think what this country is lacking today is our ability to dispense equity and justice. It may be difficult, it may be a bitter pill, but we need to stand with the truth.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim; former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; former President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Sam Ohuabunwa and American-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, yesterday, resolved to work together to ensure that the Southeast produces the 2023 PDP presidential ticket.\n\nAnyim, who spoke on behalf of the other aspirants, after a meeting, in Abuja said that their resolve to have a South Easterner as the PDP 2023 presidential candidate is based on equity, fair play and national unity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cfour of us are presidential aspirants on the platform of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party. We met this morning and resolved as follows: we have agreed to work together as a team. We will work together to ensure that a South Easterner emerges as PDP flag bearer for 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe intend to consult with other zones on this issue and it is based on fairness and equity. In doing so, it is important to note that we have always supported other zones, and we now expect them to reciprocate.\u201d\n\nOn whether the four aspirants, will come up with a consensus candidate from the Southeast, Anyim said: \u201cWhen we get to the bridge, we\u2019ll cross it. But we will work together in the interest of the party, in the interest of the nation, and in the interest of Southeast.\u201d\n\nThe former SGF, while responding to a question whether they have the support of Governors Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu of Enugu and Abia states respectively, said that the question should rather be directed to the governors.",

          "title": "Search for Consensus Presidential Candidate in PDP Falters, Atiku Insists on Primary Election",
          "text": "\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe quest by some presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for a consensus flagbearer for the party ahead of their Presidential primaries is looking more like a fruitless mission, with former vice president Atiku Abubakar and two others (Dele Momodu and Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa) insisting that all aspirants must face the party\u2019s delegates in \u201cdemocratic primary election.\n\n\u201dThe four aspirants in the forefront of the campaign for consensus \u2013 former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State; Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and the former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, Mohammed Hayatudeen \u2013 have been crisscrossing the country in the last few weeks, promoting the consensus flagbearer idea. Only last Wednesday, the pro-consensus aspirants led by Saraki met with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, where the issue of consensus flagbearer topped the agenda and strategies for actualising the mission mapped out.\n\nWike, while speaking after the meeting, said their interest was to ensure the consolidation of unity in the party.He said they were developing a formidable strategy that would enable the PDP coast to victory in the 2023 presidential election. Atiku was, however, absent from the meeting. The pro-consensus presidential aspirants had earlier met with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State on the issue.\n\nA source close to the former vice president told THISDAY last night that Atiku would never be part of any consensus arrangement for the presidential ticket of the PDP. The source said some of the pro-consensus presidential aspirants, led by Saraki, met with Atiku in his house in Abuja last week and that the former vice president told them bluntly that what they were pushing for was undemocratic, can\u2019t work and that he would never be part of it.\n\nAtiku was said to have advised that all aspirants should go and face the party\u2019s delegates at the National Convention. Another source close to the former vice president told THISDAY: \u201cThe push for consensus is by people aiming to shut out a particular aspirant. Are they saying the 13 aspirants that took forms would sit down and pick one of them as the consensus flagbearer? Does this make sense? Who will step down for who? The aspirants should be meeting and selling their ideas to delegates; not meeting over consensus candidate. That is the position of Atiku.\n\n\u201dNewspaper publisher and another presidential aspirant, Dele Momodu told THISDAY last night that the move for consensus PDP flagbearer was dead on arrival.Momodu stated: \u201cI see a very dangerous kind of desperation in our career politicians in Nigeria as our country prepares for the 2023 Presidential election. It is unfortunate that some of our leaders are toying with the hard-fought democracy most of them were never part of.\n\n\u201cAt a time our country is at its worst state in decades, career politicians are only interested in hijacking power for themselves and are totally disinterested in engaging the electorates on how they plan to rescue our country and its long-suffering people from the brink of total collapse.\n\n\u201cThe concept of consensus as practised in Nigeria is anathema to democracy because it is based on everything that democracy is not. It denies merit, enshrines illegality and enthrones mediocrity. Moreover, it embraces corruption, bullying and other unseen ills and threats.\n\nHow are the proponents of consensus different from President Muhammadu Buhari who has virtually taken over the control of APC as the Alpha & Omega? \u201cHow will they enforce their consensus on someone like me when I have bought my nomination form and I\u2019m ready to contest all the way? They should please conserve and preserve their energies and let the people make their choices in a free and fair contest. That is the essence of democracy.\n\nWe need to save hapless Nigerians from this unnecessary distraction.\u201dAnother PDP Presidential aspirant, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa questioned the principles that would govern the choice of a consensus presidential candidate being promoted.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I see Bukola Saraki moving round the country canvassing for a PDP consensus Presidential candidate, he reminds me of his father many years ago, moving round the country saying it was the turn of the North to present a Presidential candidate.\u201cHowever, what are the principles governing the choice of a consensus Presidential candidate? It is worth consideration when consensus is anchored on the principle of equity, justice and fair play, not the brow beaten saga, which APC was compelled to submit to by Mr. President recently.\n\nConsensus should not approximate to an arm twisting scenario or drama.\u201cWhy is the talk of consensus at this time when the clamour for a Nigerian President of Southeast extraction has gained critical mass at the national level? Someone brought the idea of this consensus to my attention, to buy into it. When 10 people are contesting or vying for a position, you don\u2019t exclude nine to the advantage of one person. Consensus must be a collective decision of all those involved in this game. Period.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeeting with Makinde, Okowa\n\nAt the PDP pro-consensus presidential aspirants meeting with Makinde, the governor said the party would work to ensure the success of a consensus presidential candidate arrangement for the PDP. \u201dWe have discussed behind closed doors the issue of the consensus arrangements we are trying to put together. We did it at the last convention of our party, and that was the first time the PDP was able to achieve bringing in a national chairman for the party through a consensus arrangement,\u201d Makinde said.\n\nAt the meeting with Makinde, Saraki declared: \u201cOf course, we all have our individual interests to become the president, but we have decided in our meetings that we are ready to subject ourselves to a consensus arrangement. It is not just for one part of the country, but for the PDP as a party.\u201dAt another meeting with Okowa, Saraki also made a case for consensus candidate: \u201cThis is important because we believe that the country needs unity.\n\nWe are all eminently qualified to lead this country but we believe that only one person will lead and that person needs everybody to make Nigeria better and to fix this country.\u201dThe former governor of Kwara stated that the interest of the aspirants was second to that of the country, adding, \u201cThis also goes to show that this consensus arrangement is not just about the issue of the North but about Nigeria.\n\n\u201dSaraki said any of them is qualified to lead the country and that they had agreed to a consensus arrangement to elect the party\u2019s presidential flagbearer.Also, Saraki, during a consultative visit to Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State last month, said some of the PDP presidential aspirants from the north were ready for a consensus candidate.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the end of the day, it is only one person that will lead this country in 2023; and we also resolved that we are going to work closely to ensure that we come out with a way that consensus arrangement would come among the three of us on how to go forward into leading this country.\u201dThe aspirants that have purchased the PDP presidential forms are Atiku, Saraki, Wike, Anyim Pius Anyim, Governor Mohammed, Governor Tambuwal, Hayatudeen and Dele Momodu.\n\nOthers are a United States based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze; former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel; a pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa and an unknown politician from Imo State, Mrs. Oliver Tareila Diana.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Refuses to acquit, discharge him, strikes out 8 other counts, to rule on bail application May 18\n\n\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court, Abuja yesterday ordered the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu to stand trial on only seven of the 15-count alleged terrorism charges against him.\n\nJustice Nyako made the order while ruling on Kanu\u2019s application to quash the charge preferred against him by the federal government.The application, premised on 34 grounds and supported by a 36-paragraph affidavit, also sought an order to acquit and discharge Kanu.Delivering ruling in the application, Justice Nyako struck out eight of the 15-count charges because the prosecution failed to disclose any form of offence alleged to have been committed by the defendant.\n\nThe judge ruled: \u201cIn this instant preliminary objection application, I have read the counts and come to the conclusion that counts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 have not disclosed any offence against the defendant. \u201cCounts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15 show some allegations, which the defendant has to answer.\u201cThe court shall proceed to try the defendant on those counts.\u201dBy the ruling, Kanu would now stand trial on counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15, which the court believes he needs to respond to. Meanwhile, the court has fixed May 18 to deliver ruling in Kanu\u2019s application for bail.The court fixed the date after listening to arguments for and against granting the application.\n\nKanu\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, in moving the bail application said: \u201cUntil a person is tried and convicted, he should be allowed to walk free.\u201dHe reminded the court that a defendant ought to enjoy the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.\n\n\u201cI humbly urge my lord to use your discretion to grant him bail subject to my lord\u2019s condition,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can limit him to stay in my house and I will not allow him to move around,\u201d the lawyer added jokingly.Responding, prosecution counsel, Mr. Shuaibu Labaran, prayed the court to refuse the application, adding that Kanu had allegedly violated the earlier bail granted him.\n\n\u201cMy lord granted him bail in 2017 on health grounds, but since then until date, no medical record was submitted to the court until he jumped bail,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat we should be saying is contempt of court because he has flagrantly violated the orders of the court.\u201dHe urged the judge to be guided by her discretion vis-a-vis the circumstances of the case \u201cand in the alternative, order accelerated hearing on this matter so that the defendant can know his fate one way or the other.\n\n\u201dIn a short ruling, the judge announced May 18 to deliver the ruling on the bail application.The IPOB leader was arraigned last year on an amended criminal charge, shortly after he was arrested and repatriated to Nigeria.He had fled the country in 2017 after soldiers invaded his family house in Abia State and was reported to have committed most of the alleged offences from his hideout somewhere in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter he was repatriated and arraigned, he pleaded not guilty to the 15-count amended charges bordering on alleged treasonable felony and asked the court to quash the charges for being defective and baseless, adding that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try him based on those charges.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Signs terms sheet with four asset managers\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele yesterday announced that the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (InfraCo) would unlock N8 trillion of pension funds\u2019 assets to be deployed into bankable infrastructure projects across Nigeria. Emefiele also announced the appointment of Mr. Lazarus Angbazo as Chief Executive Officer of InfraCo and signed terms agreement with four Infrastructure Asset Managers \u2013 the AAA Consortium, Chapel Hill Denham, Africa Infrastructure Investment Managers and Sanlam Infra works.\n\nInfracorp is being promoted by the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, with KPMG as transaction advisers. Also, with their Legal Advisers \u2013 Kenna Partners, Olaniwun Ajayi, and Ukiri and Lijadu \u2013 they are to deliver InfraCo as a catalyst to accelerate public-private solutions for infrastructure in Nigeria, with initial capital raising of N15 trillion. At a press briefing in Lagos yesterday, Emefiele said:\n\n\u201cWe have done our scoping, we believe that a substantial portion of the N15 trillion is available locally. There is a lot of liquidity today not just in the banking industry; there is a lot of liquidity that is currently held by our pension funds managers. I understand from the last count that the size of Nigeria pension fund is over N13 trillion. I am told that in another three to five years, Nigerian pension assets would rise to almost N20 trillion to N25 trillion.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of local capital and liquidity in Nigeria and what we would like to say is that we would begin by talking to people, the institutions that have this liquidity to come in and take up this kind of debt and that is why I am trying to say that out of the N14 trillion that will be debt, we imagine that on looking at it on a straight line, we should be looking at N8- N9 trillion available say within the Nigerian banking industry and the pension fund administrators.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, naturally the rest will be raised through foreign debt like Eurobond and the rest of them. So, yes, there will be Eurobond, but because we are moving very quickly, very fast, we will be looking at more in Nigeria.\u201cSo, let\u2019s not forget these are projects from viability stand points and that they will be generating Naira revenue. Most of the roads will be carrying the traffic cam, they will be tolled but we will try as much as possible to ensure that the tolls are not too high and become so burdensome on the road users.\n\n\u201cThe important thing I think is we must begin to come to a realisation that for us to have good infrastructure, for us to have good roads, we will need to make them commercially viable and that means we have to really pay for them.\u201dFurther speaking on how InfraCo would be financed, Emefiele said the first phase of this financing is to raise N14 trillion debt plus N1 trillion equity which is being contributed by the CBN, AFC and NSIA. He added: \u201cUpon signing the terms sheet today, we will go straight into execution mode because Nigeria very badly needs to develop its infrastructure.\n\nThere is infrastructure deficit in the public sector, there is infrastructure deficit in the private sector and we would like to see that we played our part at this time to support the efforts of not just the government but also the private sector in doing whatever can be done to develop infrastructure in Nigeria. \u201cWe are determined to do this because we all travel to different parts of the world and we see state of the development of their infrastructure and indeed most of the developing countries that we like to compare ourselves with also have some sort of our type of InfraCo and that is why they have moved very aggressively in developing infrastructure in those countries.\n\nWe are determined to see to it that from today InfraCo is open for business.\u201cFrom today we are unveiling InfraCo to Nigeria and because we are sure, we are confident that the funding of N15 trillion is available.\u201cIn other countries where infrastructure corporations have worked, pension funds have been used to develop the infrastructure of those countries.\n\n\u201cEmerging market economies have used private sector funds coming from either pension fund managers or the banking industry to set an example that we here in Nigeria stand ready to support infrastructure development, to support the government in the development of Nigeria infrastructure, and that is our solemn pledge today that we will.\n\nI am so sure that with the gap in the Nigerian infrastructure, this is the first tranche and I believe it will soon very quickly be used up and we can now go to a phase two and phase three.\u201cNigeria as the biggest economy in Africa and a country with the largest population in Africa truly deserves that at this time. Its infrastructure must be top notch so as to continue to encourage investors both locally and foreign to have confidence to come and do business in Nigeria.\u201dOn his part, Angbazo said:\n\n\u201cThe specific mission of InfraCo is to harness opportunities for infrastructure development in Nigeria by originating, structuring, executing and managing end-to-end bankable projects. These projects would be managed privately by asset managers that are private entities and they would do this in partnership with public and private sector participants to provide long and attractive investment returns required not just in terms of financial returns but also in terms of social impact.\u201d\u201cInfraCo is a dedicated vehicle to unlock and enable development of infrastructure.\n\nIt is a catalyst to unlock private capital by leveraging local and international pools of capital and finally it is an enabler for economic growth and development by driving local capacity building, inclusive growth and development with impact.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Mohammed Koko is the current MD of the NPA.\n\n\u201cFrom 2005 to 2015, he worked at the Zenith Bank PLC in Port Harcourt, where he rose to the position of Assistant General Manager before being appointed as the NPA\u2019s Executive Director, Finance and Administration.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring the term of former Governor, Rotimi Amaechi, he was also the designated Zenith Bank account officer for the Rivers State Government. According to reports, Mohammed Koko was brought before a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt by the EFCC in 2009 together with three other top officials of Zenith Bank on charges of fraud totalling N3.6 billion,\u201d the probe report further revealed.\n\n\n\nThe report noted that his financial profile showed that he had several accounts in five banks.\n\n\n\nThe EFCC went on to analyse Koko\u2019s bank accounts and the amounts of money in inflow and outflow which all confirmed the alleged fraudulent acts of the NPA boss.\n\n\n\nIn the summary of findings in the report, the EFCC investigation team said, \u201cOne, Mohammed Bello Koko received payments in cash and transfers totalling N829 million into his Zenith Bank personal account between 2015 and May 2021.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo, he is a director at M.B.K Business consults and Cethes company which Ali Amin Abubakar is also a director in both companies.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe EFCC in the report recommended the prosecution of Koko for the various fraud and money laundering discoveries alongside his alleged accomplice, Ali Abubakar.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is recommended that the Operations department should investigate the capital expenditure accounts and tenders board minutes of the NPA during Mohammed Koko\u2019s tenure as executive director, finance and administration preparatory to his possible prosecution alongside his suspected accomplice, Ali AMIN Abubakar,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had on February 15, 2021, reported that President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Mohammed Bello Koko as the substantive Managing Director of the NPA.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Pandora Papers in 2021 revealed that Bello Koko was behind two shell companies incorporated in a tax haven to anonymously invest in the United Kingdom property market.\n\n\n\nThis potentially violates Nigeria\u2019s public service code of conduct laws.\n\n\n\nPandora Papers also disclosed that he and his wife, Agatha Anne Koko, enlisted the services of financial secrecy seller, Cook Worldwide and Alem\u00e1n, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), an offshore law firm, to register Coulwood Limited (reg. number: 1487897) and Marney Limited (reg. number: 1487944) in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), one of the world\u2019s most commonly used tax havens, in 2008.\n\n\n\nBoth companies were registered on the same day, June 19, 2008.\n\n\n\nThough a public servant, Bello Koko is also a director of the two companies, in violation of Nigeria\u2019s Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act (Sections 5 and 6).\n\n\n\nPandora Papers project is led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).",
          "summary": "An investigative report by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has found Mohammed Bello Koko, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), guilty of N829 million fraud in kickbacks and money laundering activities.\nAt the time the report was done, Koko was the acting Managing Director of the NPA.\nFollowing the suspension of Hadiza Bala Usman as the Managing Director of NPA by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Presidency announced Koko as her replacement in an acting capacity.\nBuhari in February 2022 confirmed Koko as substantive managing director of the NPA.\nSaharaReporters had on February 15, 2021, reported that President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Mohammed Bello Koko as the substantive Managing Director of the NPA.",

          "text": "An alleged kingpin, notorious for mobilising hoodlums to attack perceived opponents of the President Muhammadu Buhari regime, has been identified as Sunday Bright Attah.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Attah was also allegedly used by a former lawmaker, Ned Nwoko, to bribe court officials who manipulated justice during the arrest and illegal detention of human rights lawyer, Abubakar Marshal.\n\nAlso, Attah allegedly led a gang of hoodlums to attack human rights activist and presidential aspirant, Omoyele Sowore, during his court trials, leading to the infliction of injuries on several supporters of the activist.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Attah and his hoodlums had also been used by the secret police, the Department of State Services (DSS) to attack supporters of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, during several court sessions of the IPOB leader.\n\nNot done, Attah, it was learnt, was also allegedly instrumental in attacking popular Kayanmata (aphrodisiac) seller, Hauwa Muhammed, aka Jaruma and her supporters during her trial and case with Ned Nwoko.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters on Sunday that Attah, who hides under OneNigeria group, now has a squad of hoodlums to undertake pro-government public assaults.\n\n\u201cHe was the person Ned Nwoko sent to bribe court officials against Marshal Abubakar. He also made arrangements for people to attack Sowore during his arraignment by the police on Ned\u2019s matter but that day, he did not show up.\n\n\u201cHe led the team the DSS arranged to attack Sowore and Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s supporters during the court sittings,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cHe was the person that mobilised hoodlums to attack Jaruma and her supporters during her trial by Ned Nwoko. In fact, he has a killer squad in Abuja assembled to carry out hits with DSS and police backing,\u201d another source confirmed.\n\n\u201cOn February 28, 2022, he sent some university boys to the Area Court in Zuba. His usual style is to send these boys under the guise of protest and after his fake protesters had dispersed, he plants thugs to attack the personality targeted,\u201d another source revealed.\n\n\u201cHe reportedly has a killer squad in Abuja assembled to carry out hits with DSS and police backing,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nIn a video obtained by SaharaReporters, Attah is seen leading a group of persons said to have been sponsored, in a protest staged against Sowore and Sahara Reporters.\n\nAttah and his band of protesters were chanting and singing in the video, with a cacophony of drums and trumpet sounds filling the air. Displaying banners and placards strictly condemning Sowore and SaharaReporters, the protesters chanted \u2018Solidarity forever, we shall always fight for our rights\u2019.\n\nHowever, the chant \u2013 solidarity forever \u2013 which has become synonymous with protests demanding human rights and good governance was not in consonance with the condemnation of Sowore, which was the only message on the banners and placards.\n\nBut speaking with SaharaReporters, Attah denied the allegations, adding that he was not against Kanu, Sowore, the publisher of SaharaReporters or any other Nigerian but against agitations for secession and uprising, which he and others in the OneNigeria group fight against.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy father is not a DSS person and none of my relatives is DSS. I am a journalist like you and a media consultant. I don\u2019t know what they are talking about. Those are lies. We as a group don\u2019t witch-hunt anybody. Our interest is to promote peace and unity and harmony among Nigerians. We have no country other than Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe cannot give in to separatism. We are over 200 million Nigerians \u2013 no country would accept us. It is not about any individual; it is not about Nnamdi Kanu, Sowore or Sunday Igboho. If you talking to me today say that you want Nigeria divided, we will speak against it.\n\n\u201cAm I Nnamdi Kanu or Sowore or Igboho\u2019s enemy? No. But my duty as a Nigerian who has nowhere to run to if Nigeria is in a crisis is to speak positively. I have never been to a programme where I fought. I am not a violent person. All I know how to do is to write and speak. So those that say I am a tool in the hands of whoever, it is in their imagination.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had on March 6 reported that sources said the judge who ruled that Abubakar Marshal should be remanded was ferried from Kuje in a vehicle with a covered licence plate, arranged by Nwoko through Attah, also said to be one of his personal assistants.\n\nIt was also gathered that Nwoko had sent Attah to ensure his wish was carried out regarding how the proceedings should go, which was to ensure the judge did not grant bail to the lawyer.\n\nThe source had said, \u201cA team led by Pelumi Olajegbensi visited Marshal Abubakar today and he\u2019s in high spirit. He also said that while he was being transferred to Keffi prison, they told him Ned Nwoko had paid the police hierarchy to detain him (the lawyer) and Sowore because he (Nwoko) already paid for it.\u201d\n\nAccording to another source, \u201cthe Grade 1 area court judge that detained him was ferried by Ned Nwoko from Kuje.\n\n\u201cAnd to be sure this will be carried out, Ned sent one of his personal assistants, Attah Bright Sunday to keep tabs on the judge to ensure he didn\u2019t grant Marshal bail.\n\n\u201cAttah was seen in court bribing court officials before arranging for the judge to leave in a black Mercedes Benz with the police prosecutor.\n\n\u201cThe licence plate of the SUV was covered to avoid detection.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, SaharaReporters also learnt from sources that the businessman, Nwoko, with the help of some of his allies, established a fake group called Niger Delta Peace Agitators when he could not achieve his goal of jailing Sowore.\n\nThe group had threatened to stage a protest in Abuja if Sowore was not arrested.\n\nIt accused Sowore of planning to eliminate Nwoko, saying it would resist any attempt to kill the businessman.\n\nThe group, through its spokesperson, Mr. Kenule Nwiya Jr, had also given the Nigeria police 48 hours to arrest Sowore or it would mobilise its members for the protest.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can Hytch succeed where GoMyWay failed?",
          "text": "At the end of October 2018, the Nigerian ride-sharing platform GoMyWay ceased to exist after operating for about 4 years. According to a statement by the company\u2019s CEO Damilola Teidi, this was due to a lack of follow-on funding, as its investors had decided not to continue backing the company.\n\nIt was a surprising event, owing to the promise of the business at launch. Within its first month of launch, it announced that it would quickly expand into Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. A pan-African expansion within launch month is unusual, but the calibre of investors\u2014Konga founder and CEO Sim Shagaya, and Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) and former Amazon and Naspers executive Bill Paladino\u2014on the startup\u2019s capital table somewhat made the possibility considerable. Though the expansion didn\u2019t eventually happen, the prospect of it happening, however, was an indication that the business was meeting its projection.\n\nIt\u2019s now 4 years since anybody last used GoMyWay, and another startup is ready to take up the challenge of scaling digital vehicle-pooling in Nigeria. Founded by Laolu Onifade, Hytch Africa was launched to the public last month\u2014after months of public building and teasing its internet community with product videos and pictures\u2014to help people share rides and move faster and cheaper.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLike GoMyWay, Hytch has also begun to ramp up users. The company announced, on its social media platforms, that it had acquired 600 users in just 3 days, with zero spend on marketing. Its CEO also tweeted that they are looking to get 2,000 users by the end of the second quarter.\n\nGoMyWay, before it went into oblivion, had said it had over 12,000 users and had completed 106,630 rides across 16 states in Nigeria. But how the 2 startups acquired users is different. While the defunct company ran free services, accompanied by giveaways, like offering car owners one month\u2019s supply of fuel, Onifade told TechCabal that Hytch hasn\u2019t spent a kobo on user acquisition.\n\nBusiness model is king\n\nGoMyWay had traction but wasn\u2019t making money. According to Teidi\u2019s statement, the plan by its shareholders and investors was to run a free service for a year or 2, then focus on growing the user base. So, there was traction with zero revenue and no way to monetise the business.\n\nFor Hytch, the opposite is the case as they want to make money as they go, and are already doing so. \u201cWe are already making money. We charge 15% on every ride and, since launch, we\u2019ve recorded an average of 25 rides daily,\u201d Onifade told TechCabal.\n\nLaolu Onifade, founder and CEO at Hytch\n\nHytch operates a cashless payment method and it provides an inbuilt wallet for both drivers and riders, and riders are automatically debited at the end of every trip they take.\n\nGoMyWay and others like Ridebliss, another local carpooling service that\u2019ve since failed, are great learning references for Hytch. Hytch, in a bid to capture the vehicle-pooling market, allows not just carpooling, but bus-pooling; buses can pick up people going their way. This means that public bus owners can also use the platform to get riders daily.\n\n\u201cHytch is not just for private car owners; there is a bus-pooling option as well,\u201d Onifade said.\n\nRide-sharing is essential\n\nVehicle-pooling is not new to people: globally, it\u2019s one common way for people to move from one place to another, hitching rides with an unknown driver at random locations or bus stops. What if this same experience can be digitised?\n\nThis is the question companies like Hytch are answering.\n\nDifferent ride-hailing companies are currently trying to incorporate ride-sharing into their product. Last year, Uber in Kenya was reported to be testing Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders heading in the same direction share the cost of the journey. They have plans to roll out the service to Ghana and Nigeria. The company first introduced the service to its San Francisco market, and it was reported to be a success until the pandemic forced its pause.\n\nAnother disturbing factor is that the ride-hailing sector\u2014even though it\u2019s not the most-funded tech sector\u2014requires a lot of capital to scale. At least that\u2019s what the top companies have done and made the world believe is best practice: burn heavy cash to acquire users. Bolt recently raised $607 million in a Series F round; Uber raised a total of $25.2 billion over 33 rounds before it IPOed in 2019; and even French BlaBlaCar, which is primarily doing the same thing as Hytch, has raised more than $443 million in venture capital since its founding in 2006 (its recent funding of $115 million came in April last year).\n\nFor now, it looks like the company has learnt a great deal from the defunct startups in the sector and may be well on its way to success. But it\u2019s too early to say.\n\nOnifade believes that his company has the skill and drive to build the product and a business model that works but do they have the money needed to fully build? Per investment, the CEO said they have raised a family-and-friends\u2019 round and are currently raising pre-seed.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Global payments company Visa has opened a new Innovation Studio in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThe studio was officially opened by the Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, Dr Patrick Njoroge on April 6, at an event attended by leading banks, financial technology companies and innovation specialists from across Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThis facility will serve the sub-Saharan Africa region and joins a network of innovation centers operated by Visa since 2016, in cities including London, Dubai and Singapore. The Nairobi studio is the first in Africa and sixth globally.\n\nThe new facility supports Visa\u2019s commitment to promoting innovation and creating opportunities for clients and fintech partners to co-create market-relevant payment and commerce solutions throughout the region.\n\nAida Diarra, Senior vice president and head of Visa in Sub-Saharan Africa, said the studio will assist in increasing the Visa market in the region by issuing digital and physical Visa to its clients.\n\n\u201cSub-Saharan Africa is a fast-growing region with a tech-savvy population and as we continue to grow digital payments adoption in the region, our aspiration is to deepen our collaboration with clients and partners in developing solutions that are designed around the unique needs of Africa,\u201d said Diarra.\n\nA photo of the corner fabrics section at the Visa Innovation studio in Nairobi\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a brand built on technology, Visa has driven the major technology advancements that make electronic payments what they are today.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Nigerian households\u2019ll face \u2018exceptional\u2019 income squeeze \u2013 World Bank",
          "text": "The World Bank has said household real disposable incomes in Nigeria are expected to face \u201cexceptional squeeze\u201d this year.\n\nIn just two years, Nigerian households have been slammed by three huge economic shocks \u2013 the economic recession, COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukraine war, with a consistent rise in inflationary pressures.\n\nOhiozei Obaseki, an Abuja-based entrepreneur, told BusinessDay that the pressures that accompanied those years caused a serious dent on his family\u2019s standard of living.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt seemed like a battle from all fronts, from government sanctions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to the persistent rise in food prices, to movement restrictions, which affected businesses and so on.\n\n\u201cI just welcomed my last born at the peak of the pandemic and it seemed as though we were not going to make it through that storm because my income was not able to acquire what it could before the pandemic. Not to talk of when a new child has joined my family.\n\n\u201cIf no one says this, I will: inflationary pressures since the pandemic have eaten deep into my pockets, and I\u2019m not sure I can boast of recovery in the next 3-5 years. I\u2019m barely hanging on my wits end.\u201d\n\nShubham Chaudhuri, the World Bank country director for Nigeria, in an interview with BusinessDay, indicated that the COVID-19 crisis in the country, exacerbated pre-existing structural distortions (including trade distortions, such as 2019\u2019s border closure), which were already driving up prices and eroding purchasing power before the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis in turn explains the near stagnation in household real disposable incomes that has preceded the exceptional squeeze expected this year,\u201d Chaudhuri said.\n\n\u201cHowever, the extent to which the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war would drive the economy further into poverty as well as permanently making it less productive is still unknown,\u201d he added.\n\nThe World Bank, in its latest report titled \u2018Nigeria Poverty Assessment 2022\u2019, said many primary effects of the pandemic had been more economic-related rather than health-related, partly due to Nigeria\u2019s pre-crisis conditions.\n\n\u201cIn the more recent stages of the Covid-19 crisis, even though economic activity began to recover, inflation started to accelerate especially for food items that are crucial for consumption among the poor and vulnerable,\u201d it said.\n\nAliko Dangote, CEO of Dangote Group, warned in March that the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine was going to cause intense food scarcity as a result of fertiliser scarcity.\n\nThe current diesel price hike in the country is threatening the survival of many businesses.\n\nChukwuma Okoye, CEO of Hugo\u2019s Shawarma Karu, told BusinessDay that since the surge in diesel price started, his business had been running on losses and payment of workers had become a nightmare.\n\nAccording to him, the business is still surviving because of the outrageous loan he took out during this period to see how long the crisis lasts.\n\n\u201cIf this crisis lingers any longer than it currently is or the price of diesel mistakenly hits the N900 mark, it\u2019s going to be a wrap for me and this business. To make matters worse, I\u2019ll be owing a whole lot of people and I\u2019ll also be a major contributor to the unemployment drivers,\u201d he said.\n\nTara Vishwanath, lead economist in the Middle East and North Africa Region\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Group of the World Bank, told BusinessDay that in 2018/2019, many Nigerians were living just above the poverty line, thus leaving them vulnerable to falling into poverty when shocks like these occurred.\n\nShe said, \u201cFrom our data, the distribution of consumption in Nigeria was relatively flat around the poverty line. This means that in the event that a slightly higher standard of living is set, it drastically increases the percentage of the Nigerian populace that would be living below the poverty standard.\n\n\u201cA useful yardstick to consider alongside the poverty concept is the \u2018vulnerability\u2019 concept, which includes those who are non-poor but stand a significant chance of falling into poverty in the near term.\u201d\n\nRead also: What Nigeria can do as non-poor risk poverty\n\nAnita was already struggling with the economic fallout from the pandemic when the new year delivered a fresh shock.\n\nThe Nigerian tailor, who owns a small shop in Abuja\u2019s socially mixed neighbourhood in Wuse, saw her monthly electricity bill more than double from about N13,250 to about N27,400 after recent price rises.\n\nA long-time supporter of the current regime, she found herself doubting whether she would ever vote for the current ruling party again as crushing inflation that reached almost 16 per cent last month and a decade high of 18 percent last year has hit her business and her family life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m undecided; like a lot of people,\u201d said Anita, 43, who asked to be identified by a pseudonym because her husband has a government job. \u201cThe main reason is this government. In the early days (the ruling party), things were amazing. But in recent times, the problems have just been piling up.\u201d\n\nElectricity prices rose between 25 and 75 per cent in January as the plunge in the value of the currency from last year, combined with removal of electricity subsidy and soaring global energy prices, produced increases in the cost of power.\n\nAngry social media users posted their bills online while shopkeepers displayed theirs on their windows.\n\nOn the streets of Abuja, however, spiralling living costs are a source of mounting anxiety and hardship.\n\nFatima, a 70-year-old retiree, said she had resorted to collecting plastic bags and selling them to the city\u2019s roaming waste collectors to top up her partial state pension. She cannot afford to buy basic necessities with her \u2018almost insignificant\u2019 pension.\n\n\u201cAt home we eat pasta, pasta, pasta,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are fed up with pasta. To make matters worse, pasta is even becoming unaffordable as the days go by.\u201d\n\nAbbey, a motorcycle courier for a restaurant along Apo central district, complained that close to half of his daily earnings of about N4,270 was eaten up by the cost of petrol.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who lives with his parents, said his family had started watching less television to try to reduce their electricity bill.\n\n\u201cMaybe it will take 20 years before Nigeria might return to the early 2000 era,\u201d said Amuche Okorie, 45, as she helped her husband run their small shop selling lightbulbs, vacuum parts and remote controls.\n\nAll Amuche is focused on right now is seeking to shelter her three children from the worst of the impact of the ongoing economic turmoil.\n\n\u201cWhen my daughter sees that the price of chocolate has increased three times, she tells me not to buy it. Which 10-year-old thinks like that?\u201d Amuche said.",

          "title": "Court ruling on 35% affirmative action for women:",
          "text": "Since the judgment Wednesday, by the Federal High Court in Abuja ordering the government to comply with the 35percent affirmative action for women, which allows women occupy 35 percent of all appointments, there have been reactions from women leaders across the country.\n\nThey have called on the Federal Government to, without delay, obey the court ruling by implementing the affirmative action.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Donatus Okorowo, said the Federal Government had the obligation to implement the 35 percent affirmative action, accusing past governments of acting in breach of international treaties on women\u2019s participation in government.\n\nJustice Okorowo added that the National Gender Policy is not merely a policy statement, but one that must be backed with requisite action on the part of the government.\n\nHe said the 35percent affirmative action which entails appointive positions for women to ensure inclusivity must not be merely on paper as Nigeria is a signatory to international treaties, particularly on those entrenching the rights of women.\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television morning programme Thursday, in reaction to the court ruling, Ene Obi, country director, ActionAid Nigeria, said it was a positive development. When asked if she was optimistic about government heeding the judgment, Obi said she was not in a position to speak for the government.\n\nShe explained that the government had been shying away from implementing even though Nigeria is a signatory to the Beijing Charter.\n\nShe recalled that 25 years after Nigeria signed the Beijing Declaration on 35 percent Affirmative Action on women inclusion in policymaking, election, and appointment, nothing positive has been done in that regard.\n\nObi particularly expressed disappointment that despite the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari, during his campaign, promised to give 40 percent appointments in his government to women, up till now the percentage of appointments remains abysmal and frustrating.\n\nThe Country Director has been vocal in her condemnation of the poor implementation of 35 percent Affirmative Action in Nigeria, decried the under-representation of the women folk in governance in the country.\n\nAt a recent workshop on \u2018Strengthening State Level Institutional Capacities to Enhance Women\u2019s Meaningful Participation in Peace and Security in Nigeria\u2019 held in Karu, Nasarawa State, Obi had expressed displeasure over the poor treatment meted out to Nigerian women in terms of elective positions and appointments in public offices including being worst hit by current insecurity challenges in the country.\n\nShe observed that women\u2019s voice in terms of national issues remains at the stifled, including issues, directly and indirectly, affecting them.\n\nMufuliat Fijabi, chief executive officer of the Nigerian Women Trust Fund, who also reacted to the judgment on the Channels Television programme, said: \u201cFor us, this is a victory and we know that the government will acknowledge this and do the needful in terms of ensuring that we have a balanced system of governance that will bring about fast development for the country.\u201d\n\nThis marks a step closer to victory for women who had been pushing against the rejection of gender-related bills by lawmakers in the ongoing constitution review process.\n\nOne of the bills titled \u2018Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide for Special Seat for Women in the National and State Houses of Assembly; and for Related Matters\u2019 failed after 208 members out of 290 present, voted against it in March\n\nSince then, various women groups occupied the gate of the National Assembly in protest against the rejection.\n\nBetta Edu, National Woman Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has hailed the Federal High Court, Abuja judgment that ordered the Federal Government to enforce the National Gender Policy by allotting 35 percent of appointments in the public sector to women.\n\nAPC Woman Leader said her party has already gone beyond the court judgment on the 35% affirmative action by making nomination forms free for women contesting for the various elective offices in country.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing to have a judgment; it is another thing to have that party poised to implement. Before we read about the court ruling our party had already mainstreamed women.\n\nRead also: How women can ignite their power for effective transformation\n\n\u201cWe had already given out forms for free to women to ensure that the affirmative action comes to be. Because you can give women the affirmative action of 35percent and yet they do not even have the funds to contest in the first place. If they are not coming out to contest then the position must be filled by someone else,\u201d Edu said.\n\n\u201cThat is why the party has gone beyond 35percent affirmative action. We are no longer at that level, we have passed that level. We are offering the Nigerian woman something that is greater than the 35percent affirmative action.\n\n\u201cWe are giving them a seat at the table; mainstreaming, a platform that you can be certain that you will emerge as the winner of that election. The ball is in our court to go all out and sensitise all women to run, get elected and perform exceptionally well while in office because that will be the ticket for the next woman who is waiting in the line to get into an elective position and appointive position,\u201d she further said.\n\nAkande-Sadipe who chairs the House of Representatives Committee on Diaspora told BusinessDay that she shares in the feelings of all Nigerians who champion the cause of women emancipation.\n\nShe said: \u201cMy reaction is the reaction of every well meaning Nigerian. Females are 50percent of our population; we should be allowed to contribute to the socio economic growth of our nation in all spheres.\u201d\n\nAkande-Sadipe, a female lawmaker, who represents Oluyole Federal Constituency of Ogun State, added the judgment would give women the chance to occupy positions that would enable them contribute their quota to the development of the country.\n\nA non-governmental organisation, Women in Politics Forum (WIPF) had filed the suit against the Nigerian government, seeking the implementation of the 35 per cent Affirmative Action in appointments of women into public office.\n\nDelivering judgment on the suit on Wednesday, the Presiding Judge, Donatus Okorowo ruled that Nigerian women had been subjected to various forms of discrimination concerning appointments into key positions of government.\n\nReferencing Section 42 of the Nigerian constitution as it relates to the suit, the judge upheld the plaintiff\u2019s contention to the effect \u201cthat of all the 44 ministries, there are only about six female gender, and that the situation is worse in other MDAs and agencies.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives had during the consideration of the Constitution amendment, approved a Bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide a Minimum Percentage for Women in Ministerial or Commissioner Nominees; and for Related Matters.\n\nThe Green Chamber has also slated for reconsideration, Bills for Acts to alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide for Affirmative Action for Women in Political Party Administration; expand the Scope of Citizenship by Registration and provide Criteria for Qualification to become an Indigene of a State in Nigeria.\n\nThe House had initially voted against those Bill, the action which forced women hundreds of of women to besiege the National Assembly, blocking the main entrance to the nation\u2019s Parliament edifice for weeks.",
          "summary": "Since the judgment Wednesday, by the Federal High Court in Abuja ordering the government to comply with the 35percent affirmative action for women, which allows women occupy 35 percent of all appointments, there have been reactions from women leaders across the country.\nThey have called on the Federal Government to, without delay, obey the court ruling by implementing the affirmative action.\nAPC Woman Leader said her party has already gone beyond the court judgment on the 35% affirmative action by making nomination forms free for women contesting for the various elective offices in country.\nRead also: How women can ignite their power for effective transformation\u201cWe had already given out forms for free to women to ensure that the affirmative action comes to be.\nBecause you can give women the affirmative action of 35percent and yet they do not even have the funds to contest in the first place.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe commitment of the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration to the implementation of the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda has brought about a series of notable reforms in the State Civil and Public service.\n\nSpecifically, the State has adopted top-to-bottom, bottom-down and unilateral approaches to reinvigorate the Service by building and developing human capacity, creating a digitally-driven culture of performance management, enshrining a new culture to make workers accountable in the Service to enhance productivity, efficiency and promote better service delivery.\n\nThe latest in these efforts is the State government\u2019s collaboration with MacTay Consulting, on an 8-day Performance Management System (PMS) training exercise that was designed to equip Commissioners, Permanent Secretaries and Directors in the various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), with the requisite knowledge and skills to fully adopt the new PMS which makes use of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) introduced into the State Civil/Public in the Second Quarter performance review of 2021.\n\nPMS is a new evaluation system introduced by the Federal Government of Nigeria in November 2020 in place of the Annual Performance Evaluation Report (APER) to assess Civil/Public servants\u2019 performances and ultimately transform the State\u2019s workforce into a competent, efficient and competitive one.\n\nEdo State, which has been rated as a leading State in institutional reforms and accountability to citizens, is in a hurry to rid its institutions of dysfunctional processes and systems, and is one of the few States that have adopted this system.\n\nIn her opening address, the Managing Director of the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun Public Service Academy, Mrs. Precious Imuwahen Ajoonu, welcomed participants on behalf of Governor Obaseki and advised participants to take the training seriously as the State expects much from them.\n\nShe reiterated the State government\u2019s position on value creation and usage and how each person would be held accountable in the new era.\n\nShe said: \u201cGovernor Obaseki takes this training very seriously, if you can recall, we should have been doing the Quarter 1 performance review by this time, however, we have suspended that until we complete this exercise because we do not want a situation where we carry out reviews and we get the kind of feedback we used to get in the past. We want leaders in the Edo State Government to take ownership of their scorecards.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe are going to do the performance review training a bit differently this time around, instead of brining participants per sector, we selected participants to fit into the six (6) thematic pillars of the MEGA Vision and it is our thinking that at the end of this training exercise, MacTay would have taken us through the scorecard to understand it and spend less time during the review.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate destination is to be able to move this to the E-GOV platform to make it electronically-driven.\u201d\n\nIn attendance were the Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa Esq, Commissioners for Agriculture, Water Resources, Local Government Affairs, Physical, Urban and Regional Planning and Mrs. Elizabeth Rotimi of MacTay Consulting among others.\n\nIn the course of the training, participants were advised to take performance review seriously as targets must be met, and taxpayers\u2019 money must be accounted for.\n\nThe training which adopted a very practical approach had Public servants trained on how to appropriately fill in the BSC, carry out proper job alignment and placement in their respective MDAs, bring out the best in their subordinates and strategically meet citizens\u2019 expectations which the MEGA Agenda of the State Government is set to deliver.\n\nBSC which is a framework that helps organizations translate strategies into operational objectives that drive both performance and behavioral cultures would ensure Civil/Public servants are accountable for their respective responsibility, as it\u2019s no longer business as usual.\n\nPrior now, the Annual Performance Evaluation Report (APER) system used for appraising Public servants was faulted because of its catalogue of drawbacks which include; bias/sentimental appraisal of staff, poor prioritization of tasks/goals, poor role definition, favoritism and subjectivity, no uniform parameters of assessment, unrealistic and unclear tasks/goals, political interference, no strict adherence to who evaluates and most importantly inadequate information training across board by those using it for evaluation.\n\nThe inability to properly, fairly and justly explicate and value each employee\u2019s contribution has been one of the greatest challenges emanating from the use of the APER system as what cannot be measured cannot be done.\n\nMost of the civil servants delivering on their responsibilities despite their counterparts\u2019 behaviors towards work assumed that since commitment was not valued appropriately they may as well be reluctant on their jobs concurring with the wrong sayings \u201cIf you cannot beat them, you join them.\u201d\n\nThe loopholes in the system are currently addressed by the PMS and the role of Public servants as the custodians of Citizens hard earned taxes and not the owners, has been reiterated from all the policies and programs of this present administration thus enshrining accountability and transparency in the system. The administration believes that performance is key if they must deliver on the promises made to Edo people.\n\nThe PMS which appraises the State civil/public servants ascertains each employee\u2019s contribution, measures the value each brings to their MDAs, builds performance culture and excellent service, brings about career development in service and ultimately achieves the MEGA Vision.\n\n\u201cThe BSC has the ability to change the behavior of employees. The end of performance is a consequence. Positive behavior recognized and valued will get repeated and even replicated, while negative behavior reprimanded would be discouraged. Performance determines rating not looks or familiarity. PMS is a shift in mindset\u201d said Mr. Ajayi Adeyemi, a Consultant and Facilitator from MacTay Consulting.\n\nThe Edo State Government has done a lot to change the culture of its workforce and training of these top officials is one of the steps in this direction because culture is the shadow of a leader.\n\nThe adoption of a merit-based system of recruitment and appraisal which was clearly seen in the just-concluded recruitment exercise that absorbed over 300 young graduates and the Promotion examination exercise for civil servants on grade levels 8 and 9, are true reflections that the Governor is setting a new pace that we all must follow to achieve our vision 2030.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The husband, Mr Peter Nwachukwu hit her with his leg on the chest. All this while, he has been beating her but my sister hides all that she was passing through from us\u201d, Favour said.\n\n\u201cBefore now, we have told her to come out of the marriage, we told her that they are not divorcing and that it\u2019s just a separation. But she felt that God is against divorce.\n\n\u201cWe told her that separation is not a sin but just for her to stay alive and take care of her children. She will always tell us to relax and that the man will change.\n\n\u201cSo when the man kicked her in the chest, she fell down and he took her to the hospital but he did not even tell us.\n\n\u201cIt was her friend who lives in Ebonyi state that called her twin sister because Osinachi has a twin sister, to ask, \u2018did your Sister tell you that Peter hit her on the chest? the sister then told her no.\n\n\u201cIt was the hitting on the chest that killed her.\n\n\u201cMy brother had to ask the doctor what killed her and the doctor said that there were clusters of blood clot on her chest.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, they did not tell the doctor that she was kicked in the chest because the doctor could have known what to do if he had an idea of what happened.\n\n\u201cEach time we talked to her, she will be pleading for peace and if we move to act, she will tell us no, that we should calm down.\u201d\n\nOsinachi and her husband were living in Abuja, where she died. The marriage produced three boys and one girl.\n\nAccording to Favour, Osinachi and Peter met during one of her ministrations.\n\n\u201cNwachukwu saw how my sister was ministering, he then fell in love with her,\u201d she said.\n\nFavour also revealed that Peter has not been arrested.\n\n\u201cMy younger brother who had gone to see the children said Nwachukwu is not arrested, he is in his house in Abuja. When my brother got there, the children were so happy to see him and they told him that they want to come and see their grandmother who is my mother.",

          "text": "Scottie Scheffler emphatically underlined his status as world number one by claiming his first major title in the 86th Masters at Augusta National.\n\nScheffler survived early pressure from Cameron Smith and then kept a charging Rory McIlroy at bay to win for a remarkable fourth time in his last six events.\n\nThe 25-year-old American suffered the embarrassment of four-putting the 18th, but a closing 71 saw him finish 10 under par.\n\nHe was three shots clear of McIlroy, whose stunning 64 equalled the lowest final round in tournament history.\n\nSmith rallied from a devastating triple-bogey on the 12th to finish in a tie for third on five under.\n\nHe was alongside Ireland\u2019s Shane Lowry, the former Open champion recovering from his own triple bogey on the fourth to return a 69.\n\nScheffler took a three-shot lead into the final round.\n\nHe saw his advantage cut to a single stroke as Smith birdied the first two holes, and chipped in for an unlikely birdie on the third.\n\nThis helped to restore his overnight cushion as Smith bogeyed the same hole.\n\nSmith also dropped a shot on the difficult par-three fourth hole.\n\nThe gap remained four shots at the turn before the Australian made a superb birdie on the 11th, the most difficult hole on the course.\n\nBidding to join Tiger Woods as the only players to win the Masters and Players Championship in the same year, Smith\u2019s chances promptly ended.\n\nThis was when he hit a terrible tee shot on the 12th into Rae\u2019s Creek.\n\nThat left an inspired McIlroy alone in second, four shots behind Scheffler, until the Northern Irishman produced a stunning birdie from a greenside bunker on the 18th.\n\nThat completed a brilliant 64, just one shot outside the course record and eclipsing McIlroy\u2019s previous lowest score of 65 in the opening round in 2011.\n\nThat was when he went on to lead by four shots after 54 holes before slumping to a closing 80.\n\n\u201cThis tournament never ceases to amaze and that\u2019s as happy as I\u2019ve ever been on a golf course right there,\u201d an ecstatic McIlroy said.\n\n\u201cTo play as well as I did and then to finish like this, I mean, it\u2019s just absolutely incredible.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy felt his heroics would not be enough with Scheffler sizing up a birdie putt on the 14th as he spoke.\n\nThe American duly converted there and picked up another shot on the next to effectively seal a commanding victory.\n\n\u201cI gave it a good go and could not ask any more of myself,\u201d added McIlroy, who needs to win the Masters to complete a career grand slam.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come back and keep trying.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy had birdied the first and drove the green on the third to set up another, perhaps fuelled by missing out on the par-five second.\n\nThis was after hitting a 376-yard drive but then pushing his approach into a bunker.\n\nThe four-time major winner also picked up shots on the seventh and eighth before missing another good chance on the ninth.\n\nBut he swiftly made amends by chipping in from the back of the green on the 10th and also made an eagle on the par-five 13th.\n\nFive-time Masters champion Woods was completing a second straight 78 as the final group got their rounds under way.\n\nBut he admitted just playing this week was one of the greatest achievements of his career following the injuries he suffered in an horrific car crash 14 months ago.\n\n\u201cFor not winning an event, yes. Yes, without a doubt,\u201d Woods said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think people really understand. The people who are close to me understand.\n\n\u201cSome of the players who are close to me have seen it and have seen some of the pictures and the things that I have had to endure.\u201d\n\nWoods said he was unsure whether he would play next month\u2019s US PGA Championship at Southern Hills.\n\nBut he did say that he would contest the 150th Open Championship in July at St Andrews, the scene of two of his Open victories.(dpa/NAN)",

When I say congratulations to you, I also say commiserations. You have been appointed to serve Anambra, and you must provide service.\n\n\u201cThe challenges are enormous. That is why you have also offered to serve. During my campaign, I told everyone that the work put in to get office is just five percent, 95 percent of the work comes after swearing in, and you must bear that in mind.\n\n\u201cI charge you to read the oath of office and oath of allegiance very carefully and follow them. Where people see it as celebration, you see it as work. Your eyes must be on the ball always. Always think of how your ministry will be, how will Anambra be better. If I were you, I would like to write down how I like to be remembered after serving as commissioner.\u201d\n\nSoludo also apologised ahead of time to the commissioners and other appointees, saying he would be very demanding, and would task them hugely for result.\n\nHe also told the commissioners that they were selected fit for their office, and their appointments are away from the normal procedure of sending names to the legislature for screening, after which ministries are apportioned.\n\n\u201cAs your chief servant, I have to tell you that I will be very demanding. I have to apologise ahead of time because I will be very demanding and once we fix a meeting for nine, you must all be seated before nine, and that is the culture we want to maintain.\n\n\u201cThe Soludo solution which was our slogan during the campaign is not just a promise, but you must all work to make it a reality, to create and build that livable Anambra State which we promised.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that you went to your screening knowing fully which ministry you are going to head.\n\n\u201cIn the past, you go for screening without knowing which ministry you will lead, and later they start thinking of which ministry to send you to, whether to send you to a lucrative ministry or to send you to another. But here, all of you were selected fit for your office. You were selected, knowing your competence in a particular field, and you must deliver,\u201d Soludo said.",

Therefore, the decision to block people from making calls is discriminatory, and a travesty.\n\n\u201cThe decision will cause a wide variety of harms to economic activity, personal safety, and disproportionately affect those on the margins of society. This will directly hinder the ability of the government to achieve the 2030 Agenda\u2019s Goal 8 on the promotion of sustained, inclusive, sustainable economic growth.\n\n\u201cMillions of Nigerians including persons with disabilities, elderly citizens, persons living in remote areas have been unable to capture their biometrics, and obtain their National Identity Numbers [NINs] due to logistical challenges, administrative and bureaucratic burdens, as well as the persistent collapse of the national grid.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in the discrimination of marginalized or vulnerable groups.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the decision to block people from making calls on their SIMs is reversed within 48 hours of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions in the public interest to ensure full compliance with human rights standards.\n\n\u201cThe rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and freedom of association, whether offline or online promote the democratic ideal by allowing citizens to voice their concerns, challenge governmental institutions, and hold government accountable for its actions.\n\n\u201cThe democratic ideal rationale also recognizes the necessity of having a well-informed citizenry to participate in the democratic process.\n\n\u201cWe support any lawful means to address the growing insecurity across the country. However, while the authorities have a legal responsibility to protect, ensure and secure the rights to life and property, any such responsibility ought to be discharged in conformity with human rights standards.\u201d",

They sank almost without trace, with Socialist Anne Hidalgo falling below 2%.\n\nIt was only a few months ago that Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse was still in the race for the right-wing Republicans. She performed so badly her party could barely scrape the 5% needed to claim its election costs.\n\nThe battle for votes now starts in earnest. Marine Le Pen can count on supporters of Eric Zemmour, whose more hardline nationalism gave him fourth place and 7%. Nationalist Nicolas Dupont-Aignan has also backed her.\n\nMost of the other candidates on the left have backed Mr Macron, as did Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, but one-time Socialist candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal said the president now had to \u201cearn\u201d victory.",

Due to the exigencies of this appeal and its constitutional colorisation, there is need to hear this matter expeditiously.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the appellant is hereby given up to Tuesday 12th of April, 2022 to file its notice of appeal and the parties are to file their respective briefs of arguments within three days from the date of service of the notice and record of Appeal on the respondents.\n\n\u201cThere shall be a further three days given to the appellant to file a reply. Parties should desist from taking any step to frustrate the hearing of the appeal.\n\n\u201cThe matter is adjourned to the 4th of May, 2022, for the hearing of the appeal. Fresh hearing notice to be issued on the 2nd to the 12th respondents.\u201d\n\nLower Court ruling\n\nThe Umuahia Division of the Federal High Court, had, March 18, declared as invalid and unconstitutional Section 84 (12) of the amended Electoral Act.\n\nJustice Evelyn Anyadike in a judgment ordered the AGF to delete the said section from the amended Electoral Act.\n\nSection 84(12) of the Electoral Act provides that: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nThe high court which ordered that the section be struck out held that sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that government appointees seeking to contest elections are only to resign at least 30 days before the election.\n\nThe court therefore held that any other law that mandates such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal and void to the extent of its inconsistency with the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nJustice Anyadike, thereafter, ordered Malami to delete the contentious section from the constitution.\n\nNASS appeals\n\nHowever, the National Assembly which enacted the contentious section of the Electoral Act filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal in Owerri against the Umuahia court judgment.\n\nIn its appeal, the NASS held that the high court erred in law because the clause in question was directed at political appointees and not civil servants.\n\nNASS claimed that the high court passed judgment on a matter which was not included in the Electoral Act and concluded that its decision was liable to be set aside by the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe National Assembly also challenged why it was not joined as a respondent in the suit, being the only body with constitutional power to alter any part of the legislation which it passed.\n\nBuhari\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on February 25 assented to the Electoral Act 2022, but objected to the provision of Section 84 (12).\n\nHe later asked the National Assembly to amend the section of the Act, a request rejected by the lawmakers.\n\nPDP\u2019s grouse\n\nAnd dissatisfied by the president\u2019s request, the PDP, on its own, dragged President Buhari before a Federal High Court Abuja, challenging moves to alter the amended Electoral Act.\n\nBuhari was sued along with the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), and Minister of Justice, Senate President, Speaker, House of Representatives, Clerk of the National Assembly, Senate Leader, House of Representatives Leader and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe party also joined as defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/247/2022 Deputy Senate President, Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Deputy Senate Leader and Deputy House of Representatives Leader.\n\nThe main opposition party in the suit filed on its behalf by Chief James Ogwu Onoja, SAN, had prayed the Federal High Court for an order of interim injunction restraining Buhari and other defendants from altering the duly signed Electoral Act or withholding the Electoral Act from being put to use, including the provisions of section 84 (12) of the said Act pending the resolution of the suit.\n\nThe PDP also applied for an order of the court stopping the National Assembly from giving effect to President Buhari\u2019s request to remove section 84 (12) from the Electoral Act or take any step that would make the provision inoperative pending the resolution of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\n\nThe PDP\u2019s grouse was hinged on the fact that having assented to the Bill February 25, 2022, President Buhari cannot give any directive to the National Assembly to take immediate steps to remove the section or any section of the Act on any ground whatsoever.\n\nIn a ruling on PDP\u2019s ex-parte application, Justice Inyang Ekwo, ordered defendants in the suit to suspend all actions on any attempt to alter the Electoral Act.",

          "text": "Tiger Woods completed his astonishing return from severe leg injuries with more struggles in Sunday\u2019s final round of the Masters while leader Scottie Scheffler teed off chasing his first major title.\n\nWoods fired a second-straight six-over par 78 \u2014 his highest-ever rounds at Augusta National \u2014 to finish on 13-over 301, his highest 72-hole total at the famed course by eight strokes.\n\nThe 15-time major champion was 47th, set to be his worst Masters finish other than a missed cut as an amateur, and stood 22 strokes behind Scheffler.\n\nBut the fact Woods was able to walk the course and play at all was nothing short of incredible given the 46-year-old medical marvel was in a car crash 14 months ago and feared amputation of his right leg.\n\n\u201cEven a month ago, I didn\u2019t know if I could pull this off,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a positive. I\u2019ve got some work to do. Looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nThousands of cheering supporters lined the holes to watch his amazing efforts, which stole the spotlight at Augusta National ahead of an expected back-nine battle for the green jacket.\n\nPlaying 18 holes on four consecutive days for the first time since the accident, Woods struggled Sunday.\n\nWoods birdied the par-5 second but his missed greens in regulation led to bogeys at the fourth through seventh holes and he missed an eight-foot birdie putt at the par-5 eighth.\n\nAnother missed green led to a bogey at the 11th and at the par-5 13th, Woods put his second in the azaleas before a left-handed, backwards-club pop-out shot to the green helped him save par.\n\nREAD ALSO: Imran Khan Ousted As Pakistan PM\n\nWoods made a 37-foot bogey putt at 14 after missing a 27-foot par putt, found pine straw left at 17 on the way to a double bogey then closed with a par as fans gave him a standing ovation. Woods smiled and tipped his cap in appreciation.\n\n\u201cIt was an unbelievable feeling to have the patrons\u2019 support out there,\u201d Woods said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing my best but to have their support out there, I don\u2019t think words can describe it.\u201d\n\nWoods arrived at Augusta chasing a record-tying sixth Masters crown despite not having played a top event in 17 months and departed knowing he had the fortitude to play majors again.\n\nAfter weeks hospitalized and months unable to walk, Woods rehabilitated his battered body and returned to top-flight competition on the same course where he won his first major title 25 years ago \u2014 despite his right leg being held together with metal rods, pins, plates and screws.\n\n\u2013 Scheffler in command \u2013\n\nMeanwhile, world number one Scheffler put himself in position to capture the green jacket and a $2.7 million top prize from a $15 million purse with a breakthrough major triumph.\n\nThe 25-year-old American won his first US PGA title at February\u2019s Phoenix Open, added another last month at Bay Hill and overtook Spain\u2019s Jon Rahm for the ranking summit by capturing the WGC Match Play crown two weeks ago.\n\nScheffler began on nine-under 207, three strokes ahead of Australia\u2019s Cameron Smith, last month\u2019s Players Championship winner.\n\nThe sport\u2019s hottest players teed off side by side in the final pairing on an iconic stage, Smith sinking a 13-foot birdie to pull within two of the lead while Scheffler went into pine straw and over the green but chipped to three feet and rescued par.\n\nSmith was a 2020 Masters runner-up when he became the first player to fire four rounds in the 60s at Augusta National in the same year.\n\nHe could become only the second player to win the Masters and Players in the same year after Woods in 2001.\n\nAustralian Min-Woo Lee eagled the second and reeled off four straight birdies to play the front nine in a record-tying 30, but faded nine off the lead with two bogeys to start the back nine.\n\nFour-time major winner Rory McIlroy, needing a victory to complete a career Grand Slam, birdied the first and third holes to reach 1-under and share sixth.\n\nThe greatest last-round comeback in Masters history was an eight-stroke fightback by Jack Burke in 1956.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has kicked against an interim ex parte order by the Awka Division of the Federal High Court presided over by Justice Hyeladzira Nganjiwa granting the former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, leave to travel to the United States of America to attend to his medical appointment.\n\nThe anti-graft agency argued that it was denied fair hearing.\n\nObiano is being investigated by the EFCC for alleged corruption and money laundering during his tenure as Anambra State governor from 2014 to 2022.\n\nHe was arrested on March 17, 2022, at the Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos as he attempted to leave the country, hours after handing over to his successor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo. He had earlier been watch-listed by the commission.\n\nA statement issued yesterday by the EFCC spokesman, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, accused Obiano of attempting to arm-twist the anti-graft commission with the ex parte order,\n\nIt stated: \u201cAvailable court documents indicate that Obiano had on March 11, 2022, ahead of his handover on March 17 filed a motion ex parte dated March 10, 2022, before Justice Nganjiwa praying among others, for an interim injunction stopping the EFCC from arresting or preventing him from travelling out of the country for his medical treatment.\n\n\u201cWhile the court in one breath ordered the applicant to put the commission on notice on why interim preservatory order should not be granted, it went ahead to make an order that the commission should not obstruct, impede or prevent the applicant from travelling abroad to keep his medical appointment and adjourned till March 23.\n\n\u201cOn March 31, the commission was served an originating motion on notice for the enforcement of the applicant\u2019s fundamental rights. Curiously, the motion was filed on March 11, 2022, the same date as the motion for ex parte order.\n\n\u201cThis was followed by another motion on notice on April 4, putting the commission on notice to release Obiano\u2019s passport to enable him to travel abroad for his medicals with hearing fixed for April 6, and instructions that proceedings shall be conducted virtually via Zoom.\u2019\u2019\n\nAhead of the hearing, the EFCC said it petitioned the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court asking Nganjiwa to recuse himself from the fundamental rights action on the grounds that he is a party in the commission\u2019s appeal at the Supreme Court in the corruption case, H. A. Nganjiwa vs FRN.\n\n\u201cBut when the case was called, Justice Nnamdi Dimgba held the brief of his brother judge, who is bereaved.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has revealed that the terrain where bandits operate contributes to making security operations difficult.\n\nBut human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), said Nigerian soldiers can defeat bandits and terrorists if adequate weapons are provided for them to engage the anti-state forces.\n\nThe minister who said this on Saturday during a radio programme on Bond FM, added that the current administration has invested in tackling insecurity, adding that efforts would be more impactful if citizens support government\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are also pleading with Nigerians to join in this fight because they have a lot of roles to play in tackling this insecurity. This is because these criminals called bandits are living among us; they interact with the people as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWho are the ones supplying them with food? More so, they also have landlords. People should expose these criminals and then, the various efforts of the government will be effectively complemented and we will see the results.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying our best in the fight against the bandits by equipping our security apparatus. The government has purchased aircraft so that they can fight alongside the soldiers. We have not rested on our oars.\n\n\u201cThe welfare of the police is also given adequate attention and very recently, this administration recruited 25,000 constables and deployed them to their home states. This will go a long way in community policing.\n\n\u201cIt will be easier for the newly-recruited constables to work effectively. There are lots of work in progress in the security infrastructure and personnel.\u201d\n\nThe minister also spoke on the suggestion by the Governor of Kaduna State, on the use of mercenaries to fight bandits.\n\n\u201cGovernor el-Rufai spoke out of a deep concern about the situation. He might have spoken out because of the circumstances at which the bandits are emboldened to operate,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf we employ mercenaries to fight the bandits, we should have it at the back of our minds that they are only mercenaries and not our security personnel who will return to wherever after their task is done.\n\n\u201cThe mercenaries cannot be compared with our security forces; the fight against the bandits is a difficult one because of the terrain.\n\n\u201cWe cannot just go with full force to bomb them or else the innocents living around them will be killed and we don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, human rights lawyer, Falana at the weekend said Nigerian soldiers can defeat bandits and terrorists if adequate weapons are provided for them to engage the anti-state forces.\n\nHe expressed this concern after the burial of Kwara State Chairman of Trade Union Congress (TUC), Akinwumi Akinsola, at Ijoko, Ogun State. Akinsola was killed during an attack on a Kaduna-bound train on March 28.\n\nSpeaking on the country\u2019s security challenges, Falana asked Nigerians to dismiss the proposal of Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai that foreign mercenaries should be hired to fight insurgents.\n\n\u201cI can say without any fear of contradiction that Nigeria has some of the most patriotic soldiers in the world. All that is missing is appropriate weapons to fight the terrorists who are well-equipped.\n\n\u201cI am speaking from my personal knowledge because I defend top-ranking soldiers \u2013 generals who are charged illegally for demanding weapons to fight terrorists. Troops are prepared to fight, but they are simply saying it is suicidal to face terrorists with inadequate weapons.\u201d\n\nFrankly speaking, according to the senior advocate, Nigerian soldiers are ready to wage counter insurgency operations but they are ill equipped and ill motivated.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have one of the best armed forces in the world but the huge fund earmarked for acquiring military hardware was cornered and stolen by some unpatriotic officers.\u201d\n\nHe, however, lamented that members of the ruling class \u201chave a penchant for diverting the attention of our people from addressing the problems confronting our country.\u201d\n\nHe cited the case of the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi recently acknowledged that the Abuja-Kaduna train bomb blast could have been prevented if the security gadgets had been acquired and installed.\n\nHe added that it had been revealed that the minister wanted an incompetent company to be awarded a contract of N3.7 billion to secure the train, which according to him, happened seven months ago.\n\nHe rhetorically said: \u201cWhy did the Minister not recommend another security agency to fix the problem and save precious lives? For goodness sake, why were the Chinese not asked to fix the security gadgets since they constructed the train and the railroad tracks?\n\n\u201cIn 2014, the APC leaders asked President Jonathan to resign on account of the increasing wave of insecurity. Why have the same fellows who have demonstrated worse incompetence not called it quits? Can you imagine that they want terrorists to massacre more passengers?\n\n\u201cWithout installing the much needed security gadgets, the Nigerian Railway Corporation has announced that the Abuja-Kaduna train will resume services in two weeks time. \u201c\n\nAlso after Akinsola\u2019s burial, TUC National President, Quadri Olaleye urged members of the union not to be discouraged despite the death of two members \u2014Musa-Lawal Ozigi, TUC secretary-general, and Akinsola \u2014 in the Kaduna train attack.\n\n\u201cI call on union members to keep the flag flying and continue the struggle. As a trade union, good governance is our goal; that is why we established a programme to ensure stability in the system,\u201d Olaleye said.\n\n\u201cIt was during our national tour that our members were attacked on the Abuja-Kaduna train service. Our comrades lost their lives for a purpose, which is stability and good governance.\u201d\n\nJames Sowole in Abeokuta",

          "text": "The owners of an oil production and storage ship, Trinity Spirit, had a history of financial problems, amounting to over $200 million, before the vessel blew up in Nigerian waters two months ago, a Bloomberg report has revealed.\n\nAlthough the headship of the company, Shebah Exploration and Production Company, had admitted that the business was \u201cin receivership,\u201d the new investigation has now unravelled how the firm accumulated the humongous debts that led to its eventual collapse.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIn its last update, the company had said that three persons out of a possible 10 on board survived the fire, noting that a total of five bodies had been found on or around the vessel.\n\nThe vessel caught fire on February 2, burned for more than 24 hours and left a stain of crude stretching for miles across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWhile the cause of the accident has not yet been determined, the Ministry of Environment estimated that up to 60,000 barrels of oil were on board the ship at the time of the blaze.\n\nAccording the report, which documented a trail of the ship, creditors have filed lawsuits against the company operating the vessel, in at least three countries, accusing the firm of defaulting on multiple financial agreements.\n\nThese include two bank loans for a combined $220 million and a contract for the management of the vessel itself, according to court documents and corporate statements.\n\nIt started when a prominent businessman and President of Shebah, Dr. Ambrosie Bryant Orjiako, acted as the personal guarantor of a $150 million loan taken by the company in mid-2012 from the African Export-Import (Afrexim) Bank and two Nigerian lenders to fund a drilling programme on the firm\u2019s oil licence.\n\nShebah leased the vessel from one of its shareholders named Allenne Ltd., a company registered in the British Virgin Islands of which Orjiako was a director, according to court filings.\n\nOrjiako is best-known as a founder of Seplat Energy Plc, which has grown since 2009 into Nigeria\u2019s largest independent oil producer and in February agreed to pay $1.3 billion for Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s shallow water assets in the country.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Seplat has no involvement with the Trinity Spirit or any of Shebah\u2019s legal disputes, Orjiako said by email, declining to comment on any matters that are still in court.\n\nHe referred questions regarding the vessel to Shebah Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ikemefuna Okafor, who didn\u2019t respond to emails or calls. Orjiako announced in November that he would step down as Seplat\u2019s Chairman in May.\n\nShebah stopped paying down the Afreximbank loan after meeting a single $6.1 million instalment, according to a lawsuit filed by the lenders in the UK against the company, Allenne and Orjiako.\n\nIn February 2016, a judge ruled that the banks were entitled to $143.9 million, which remains unpaid and has doubled with interest, Afreximbank said in a statement. The banks \u201ccontinue to consider their options for recovery,\u201d Afreximbank said through its law firm, Baker McKenzie.\n\nOrjiako, 61, had argued that delays by Afreximbank in releasing the funding led to drilling contractors either withdrawing or withholding their services, according to a defence he submitted to the London court in September 2015. A UK judge dismissed an appeal by Shebah and Orjiako against the decision in mid-2017.\n\nShebah in 2004 acquired a 40 per cent interest in a permit known as Oil Mining Lease (OML) 108 from ConocoPhillips as Allenne purchased the Trinity Spirit from the Houston-based producer. Shebah agreed to bear all costs in return for 80 per cent of income from the block.\n\nOutput levels wouldn\u2019t return to Conoco\u2019s 20,000 barrels a day from the licence, with no production recorded since 2017, according to data published by Nigeria\u2019s state-owned energy company.\n\nThe government announced in 2019 that it was revoking the permit, without giving reasons. A spokesman for the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), the news medium said, didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether the licence was ever withdrawn.\n\nShebah is also under pressure from other creditors. A federal high court in Lagos last year granted Zenith Bank Plc, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest lenders, an injunction preventing selected companies from dealing with Shebah\u2019s assets in a dispute around a $70 million loan provided in 2014 to Orjiako\u2019s firm. Zenith said it doesn\u2019t comment on matters that are in court.\n\nA Houston-based oil services company, Alliance Marine Services, alleged it terminated a contract to manage the Trinity Spirit after Shebah accumulated arrears of $5 million, according to a case filed in a US federal court in 2009.\n\nThe plaintiff said it had also initiated arbitration proceedings in the UK to try recover the money. AMS voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit several months after commencing it and it\u2019s not clear whether the dispute was resolved. Bloomberg was unable to reach AMS.\n\nShebah and two other companies connected to Orjiako were ordered by a UK court in 2020 to pay a Greek shipping company $4.3 million after the trio defaulted on a 2017 agreement to charter a tanker.\n\nIn 2019, a federal high court approved the appointment of a receiver by the state\u2019s debt recovery agency, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), to manage Shebah.\n\nBefore the fire, the oil firm, which is still in receivership, had offered the Trinity Spirit to AMCON to reduce some of its debt and to recover a portion of the loans provided by local lenders in 2012.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has declared that increased diversity of creditors raises coordination challenges for Nigeria and other indebted poor countries.\n\nWith a total public debt of N39.566 trillion ($95.77 billion) as at December 2021, Nigeria is exposed to a significant number of local and external creditors.\n\nIn a blogpost captioned, \u201cRestructuring Debt of Poorer Nations Requires More Efficient Coordination,\u201d the IMF stated that low-income countries face fewer debt challenges today than they did 25 years ago, attributing this in particular to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries\u2019 (HIPCs) initiative, which slashed unmanageable debt burdens across sub-Saharan Africa and other regions.\n\nIt observed that although the ratios are lower than in the mid-1990s, debt has been creeping up for the past decade, adding that the changing composition of creditors will make restructuring more complex.\n\nOf the about $39 billion external debt as at December 31, 2021, Nigeria is indebted to bilateral creditors such as China Eximbank, JICA (Japan), AFD of France, GIZ (Germany) and Eximbank of India.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nOn the multilateral side, Nigeria is indebted to the World Bank Group, including the International Development Association (IDA) and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).\n\nIt also owes the African Development Bank (AfDB); Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, European Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nThe country\u2019s external debt obligations also extend to Eurobonds and Diaspora Bond.\n\nThe IMF believes that the increasing diversity of creditors poses complex restructuring and more complex challenges for Nigeria and other heavily indebted countries.\n\nIn the blogpost, the global lender noted that an improved common framework for debt treatment could clear a path through an increasingly complex creditor landscape.\n\nAccording to the IMF, in past decades, Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) countries borrowed mainly from Paris Club official creditor nations and private banks, alongside multilateral institutions, adding that today, China and private bondholders play a much larger lending role.\n\nThe IMF stated: \u201cThe share of DSSI countries\u2019 external debt owed to Paris Club creditors fell from 28 per cent in 2006 to 11 per cent in 2020. Over the same period, the share owed to China rose from 2 per cent to 18 per cent and the share of Eurobonds sold to private creditors increased from three per cent to 11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe situation differs significantly across countries, however. Averages conceal a diversity of debt composition, from the shares of bilateral, multilateral and private creditors, to the composition of official bilateral creditors themselves.\n\n\u201cChina is now the largest official bilateral creditor in more than half of DSSI countries, including when counting all 22 Paris Club creditors as a single pool. China would therefore play a key role in most DSSI countries\u2019 debt restructurings that would involve official bilateral creditors.\n\n\u201cWhile the diversity of creditor compositions calls for greater attention to country specificities, appropriate coordination mechanisms will be key in all cases.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IMF, putting in place mechanisms that ensure coordination and confidence among creditors and debtors has become urgent, adding that improvements to the G20 Common Framework could play an important role by ensuring broad participation of creditors with fairer burden sharing.\n\n\u201cExperience so far shows that greater clarity on restructuring steps, earlier engagement of official creditors with the debtor and with private creditors, a standstill in debt service payments during negotiations, and specifying the mechanics of comparability of treatment is still needed,\u201d the multilateral institution said.\n\nAlthough Nigeria is one of the 73 eligible countries under the DSSI mooted by the IMF and the World Bank for the G20 nations to defer the debt service obligations of poor countries in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country opted out of the initiative.\n\nThe World Bank had explained that although some countries were eligible for the DSSI, they had chosen not to participate for a number of reasons.\n\nSome of the reasons included conveying wrong signals to bondholders and other private creditors, among others.\n\n\u201cSome DSSI-eligible countries have thus far elected not to participate. Currently, 27 DSSI-eligible countries, 37 per cent of eligible countries, are not participating in the initiative for a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cSome fear participation may convey the wrong signal to bondholders and other private creditors while others note the amount of eligible bilateral debt service was negligible, and savings do not justify the administrative expenses incurred by the deferral,\u201d the World Bank had stated.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",
