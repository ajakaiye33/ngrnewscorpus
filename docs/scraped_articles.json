          "text": "President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that the United States will join Germany in imposing sanctions on the Russian Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project in retaliation for Moscow\u2019s mounting military pressure against Ukraine.\n\nThe targeting of Nord Stream 2 \u2014 one of energy-rich Russia\u2019s highest-profile geostrategic initiatives \u2014 adds to Western sanctions announced by the United States and European allies this week against two Russian banks, several oligarchs and other measures.\n\nBuilt to funnel Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic sea \u2014 bypassing the current overland route which traverses Ukraine \u2014 Nord Stream 2 has long been controversial. It is completely built, but has not been put to use.\n\n\u201cI have directed my administration to impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers,\u201d Biden said in a statement after Germany announced it was halting the project on Tuesday.\n\nAlthough the pipeline is seen as an efficient way to supply energy to the European Union, which depends heavily on Moscow, critics say it also would tighten Russia\u2019s strategic grip on European nations, while deliberately weakening Ukraine.\n\nThe White House had previously blocked attempts by Congress to impose sanctions against the pipeline, saying that construction was already more than 90 percent complete by the time Biden took office and that ally Germany was keen for the project to be completed.\n\nHowever, with Russia shocking the world by massing troops on Ukraine\u2019s border and Western leaders now saying an invasion is already underway, both Berlin and Washington abruptly shifted position.\n\nComing on top of Germany\u2019s earlier decision to block legal certification, the US sanctions doom the project, according to Washington.\n\n\u201cBy acting together with the Germans how we did, when we did, and the way in which we did, we have ensured that this is an $11 billion prize investment that is now a hunk of steel, sitting at the bottom of the sea,\u201d State Department spokesman Ned Price said.\n\nIn his statement, Biden praised Germany as \u201ca leader\u201d on the issue and said that \u201cas I have made clear, we will not hesitate to take further steps if Russia continues to escalate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough his actions, President Putin has provided the world with an overwhelming incentive to move away from Russian gas and to other forms of energy,\u201d Biden said.\n\nHowever, in the shorter term, there are fears that the closing of Nord Stream 2 will prompt Russia to use its resources to squeeze Europe\u2019s already hard-pressed energy markets, as well as prompting higher fuel prices in the United States, where Biden faces strong political headwinds over inflation.\n\nAFP",

More important than that, the president has promised the Nigerian people that this is one thing he\u2019s going to do for them. He had serially been a victim of a lousy, fraudulent electoral process.

So getting the president to assent to a bill is part of the law making processes in this country and if he decides not to sign it, is also part of the law making process in this country.\n\n\u201cBut I believe the president will sign the bill because he said so himself, and a lot of objections he had on the bill had been adjusted taking into cognisance the issues that he raised, he may not be 100 per cent happy with the present copy but it is something that can be amended moving forward\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Bala Ibn Na\u2019Allah (APC-Kebbi) and co-sponsored by 12 other senators during plenary on Wednesday.\n\nThe motion was entitled; \u201cUrgent need to surmount all kinds of kidnappings, banditry and related security challenges in Wasagu-Danko, Sakaba, and Yauri Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Kebbi\u201d.\n\nPresenting the motion, Na\u2019Allah said that it was no longer news that the bandits were moving in hundreds in the areas terrorizing the people.\n\n\u201cThe bandits have been reportedly laying siege around Yar-kuka, Morai, Dankade to Wadako and recently in Bena where 20 people were abducted.\u201d\n\nHe said that if urgent steps were not taken, the peace-loving communities might be forced to resort to self-defense by acquiring arms and ammunition.\n\nContributing Sen. Adamu Aliero (APC-Kebbi) said that the acquisition of 12 Super Tucano jets by the federal government was supposed to help flush out the bandits from their hideous.\n\n\u201cRecently, we purchased Tucano Aircraft, which can be used to move out the bandits.\n\n\u201cIt has the ability to trace the movement of these bandits. If they are rustling cows, I wonder how they move them without being detected.\n\n\u201cI urge security forces to intensify efforts to stop banditry in the state.\u201d\n\nAlso, Sen.

          "text": "Oil companies, Duke Oil and Oando Plc have denied involvement in the importation of adulterated fuel, which hit the country recently.\n\nAppearing before the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) investigating the circumstances of the unhealthy situation, Wednesday, the companies said their product met the required Nigerian specification.\n\nAt the public hearing, the Managing Director of Duke Oil, Lawal Sade said the product his company imported was certified okay both at the port of loading and discharge by the relevant authorities.\n\nHe, however, said they were notified by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC, a few hours after the product was discharged that it had some particles which is why the process was discontinued.\n\nHe noted that the product has since been quarantined.\n\n\u201cDuke Oil is engaged in petrol and crude oil products. It is a wholly-owned 100% NNPC subsidiary vested with the responsibility of trading petroleum products both internationally and locally.\u201d\n\nOn the supply of the PMS to NNPC onboard NPNote gariner, with IMO no 947720 with a bill of lading dated January 7, in November 2021, NNPC issued a request as part of the strategic restocking to national energy security.\n\n\u201dMr Chairman, yes, there was a delivery of cargo by Duke Oil like you have seen in the report and that cargo met up with the Nigerian spec as it is both at the loading and discharge ports. There was a confirmation by the regulator which is the new Nigerian midstream, downstream authority to discharge that cargo within the stipulated date. The cargo was discharged and the vessel sailed.\n\n\u201dIt was just after 24 hours of operation then, Duke Oil was notified by the NNPC that there was a complaint from some of their customers that the cargo has some particles\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. Chairman, with the notification from PPMC/NNPC, Immediately, the management of Duke Oil authorised the NNPC not to evacuate the cargo any further and requested for recertification. But it is important we reiterate the fact that the cargo has been certified by the midstream and then, there is a joint inspection before the discharge and the specifications provided in the contract with NNPC meet up with the Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cAnd then, some remedial actions were taken immediately, Mr Chairman, to conclude the report and give an assurance to this hon. Committee and indeed, all Nigerians that Duke Oil as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NNPC and commercially driven company, we are not just in business to make money but also to guarantee the energy security of our great nation and we never compromise the quality of the product we supply to Nigeria and any other place we do business and we will always seek to maintain this positive position.\n\n\u201cDuke Oil had no prior knowledge and was not notified by the supplier via any communication about the presence of methanol addictive in the cargo procured and all relevant quality certification at ports both load and discharge ports did not attest to the presence of methanol until when the cargo has been received by NNPC, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\u201cAnd as a responsible government entity, we share the pains Nigerians have gone through as a result of the subsequent discovery and quarantine of the methanol blended PMS and subsequent hardship it caused to all of us. And what we did, Mr. Chairman, as a shareholder in NNPC, we partnered with them to ensure that the quarantine process is taking place and then, as the supply of the last resort, we give back and ensure that there is a continuous flow of petroleum products across the country.\n\n\u201cWe understand the hardship and inconveniences that resulted from the issue as mentioned earlier, Duke Oil had already taken necessary steps by creating additional layers. That\u2019s our submission. Thanks, Mr. Chairman\u201d.\n\nIn his ruling, the Chairman of the committee, Abdullahi Gaya asked the company to submit all relevant documents regarding their presentation, saying they may be reinvited if necessary.\n\n\u201cWe will go through the documents and if there is a need to call you, we will do that\u201d, he said.\n\nEarlier, the representative of Oando Plc, Afanga Afanga who also appeared before the committee said the product met the Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cIn line with our Direct Sale Direct Purchase contract with NNPC, on the 16th of January 2022, we delivered 90MT worth of PMS onboard the Vessel MT Elka Apollon. It is important to note that this PMS cargo that was supplied met and was in line with all the Nigerian and DSDP contractual specifications.\n\n\u201cThis was confirmed by the mandatory tests that were conducted at the loading port in Europe and before discharge in Nigeria by an independent NNPC quality inspector and finally by agents of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority. It is on this basis that the cargo was certified and accepted for discharge by NNPC.\n\n\u201cAs clearly stated by NNPC last week when they were before this honourable committee, its current inspection protocol does not include testing for methanol content and thus was not detected by the NNPC quality inspectors. The most important thing at this juncture for us is to work with NNPC as we are committed to ensuring that what is brought into the country is well treated and the issues around the situation are alleviated for Nigerians. We have given assurances and we have also been able to show to be following the right protocol that we followed and there was nothing that was breached as being alleged\u201d, he said\n\nRuling on the matter, the chairman of the committee, Gaya asked the company to standby as they may be reinvited.\n\n\u201cWe have not digested the documents but based on the summary you have given, I will allow members to ask questions. Then, in due course, we are going to invite you again to come and explain if there is a need for that, based on the documents that you brought\u201d, he said.",

          "title": "Citing Emergence of Previous Chairmen, Buhari Okays Consensus for APC Convention",
          "text": "\u2022El-Rufai denies division among colleagues\n\n\u2022Confirms they initially disagreed, but now on same page\n\n\u2022Party zones offices, adopts PDP formula, swaps positions between North and South\n\n\u2022Chairmanship goes to North-central, National Secretary South-west\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, met with governors elected on the platform of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and okayed suggestions for a consensus option at the newly proposed March 26 national convention of the party.\n\nBuhari met with the APC governors at the State House, Abuja, for about 15 minutes and discussed the current state of the party and the misgivings about its national convention. He noted that all former chairmen of APC, from Chief Bisi Akande, John Odigie-Oyegun, to Adams Oshiomhole, emerged through consensus.\n\nBut Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, dismissed insinuations that the 22 governors of APC and the Anambra State Deputy Governor were sharply divided over the date of the national convention, saying they merely disagreed. El-Rufai, who spoke with newsmen after the APC governors\u2019 meeting with Buhari, however, noted that the governors had disagreed over the timing of the national convention, as some were of the belief that there were many unresolved issues. But he contended that they were all now on the same page.\n\nEl-Rufai said APC had adopted a formula, which was embraced by the leadership of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during its convention. Under the plan, APC would allow its northern and southern members swap positions from the ones held by the previous National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nJudging by the copy of the zoning formula obtained by THISDAY last night, APC had resolved to have its national chairman come from the North-central, while conceding the office of National Secretary to the South-west.\n\nDespite its recent challenges, Chairman of Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, allayed concerns that the ruling party might collapse after Buhari\u2019s tenure. Lalong believed APC would be stronger after the incumbent president.\n\nEl-Rufai, who was fielding questions from State House correspondents, said the governors had disagreed over the timing of the convention, because, \u201cThere were some governors that felt we should put off the convention until we resolve all the congress issues in some states.\n\n\u201cAs you know, in some states, these matters are even in court. So, some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved. And this is not borne out of any agenda or selfishness. It is just a realistic proposition to avoid us violating any laws or putting our party structures of elected candidates in danger.\n\n\u201cYes, there were differences in opinions about timing. Some of us are saying the constitution allows us to have convention even if three or four states have issues that are unresolved, while others are saying no, let us finish all the reconciliations and we do this convention. After all, there is no time limit for the convention as long as we do it before the time for the primaries.\n\n\u201cSo, that was the difference. This is what the media has called divided governors. In a democratic setting, there is no way you can have 22 governors plus the deputy governor of Anambra State agreeing on any issue.\n\n\u201cWe can have differences. But after our meeting of last night, to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr. President today, we are all on the same page.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna State governor also disclosed that APC had agreed on a zoning formula that would swap offices previously held between North and South.\n\nBy the arrangement, all offices that were occupied by northerners in the last NWC will go to the South, and vice versa, in the coming dispensation.\n\nEl-Rufai affirmed that agreement had been reached on zoning.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, northern zone will have the positions the south has had in the last NWC, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt is a very simple, equitable, and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also after their meeting with Buhari, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, revealed that Buhari was in favour of consensus in selecting candidates for party offices.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cOn consensus, Mr. President reminded us that we have produced a number of national chairmen by consensus: Baba Akande emerged as the pioneer chairman of the party by consensus; His Excellency, John Oyegun emerged by consensus; His Excellency, Adams Oshiomhole emerged by consensus.\n\n\u201cSo, he is a believer in consensus as one of the options for producing leadership, and he urged us to explore consensus, so that we can generate a list. While recognising that many people who have indicated interest are equally competent, but knowing that just one person will occupy the office, consensus is part of our constitution, and he urged us to work towards consensus.\n\n\u201cAnd the governors, I have said earlier, have also been working to ensure that as part of equitable arrangement, zoning and consensus are incorporated. We have done that at the lower levels, and even at the national level; it\u2019s almost certain that we will achieve it.\n\n\u201cThen, the date of the convention, the caretaker committee briefed us yesterday on their meeting and the proposed March 26, 2022. And today, the governors informed Mr. President that we have heard the briefing from the caretaker committee and we are supportive of their position.\u201d\n\nBagudu explained that even though the planned zonal congresses of APC were not provided for in its constitution, the law was also not against the process.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOn proposed zonal congresses not in the constitution, I think there has been so much debate. Yesterday (Monday), there was a statement to the effect that even the letter that has gone out was withdrawn.\n\n\u201cSo, zonal congresses are not explicitly stated in the constitution, particularly, how you do zonal congresses. And we have in the past done them with national convention, but nothing again in the constitution stops them from being done outside the national convention. But the final form will be decided, given the input we have provided.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC governors were divided, Bagudu retorted, \u201cAre governors divided? Not at all! The 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President; we are appreciative of his leadership. We commend him for his leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker, and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thank them for the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Lalong maintained that the ruling party would not collapse after Buhari\u2019s exit, saying, \u201cI think that from the progress report read by our chairman, and from several assumptions, and also several reports that we are seeing what tremendous efforts the federal government is doing. We are already going around commissioning projects here and there in all the various states.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, although, you are not specific as to which reason will make us not to come back again, but as far as we are concerned, based on assessment, and based on what the federal government is doing, there is every hope that this party, this government will move beyond our president and that is what he has been saying, that by the grace of God, this government will move beyond his tenure.\u201d\n\nNineteen of the 22 APC governors were in attendance at the meeting held at the Council Chambers, which also had in attendance Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; and Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nThe governors in attendance were those of Yobe, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Cross River, Kaduna, Lagos, Borno, Niger, Gombe, Osun, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Kwara, Kano, Imo, Kogi, Ogun, Plateau and Anambra\u2019s deputy governor.\n\nZoning Formula\n\nAccording to the zoning formula obtained yesterday by THISDAY, APC has zoned its chairmanship position to North-central, which implies that the presidential ticket of the party might go to the south, in addition to the office of the National Secretary, which has been given to the South-west in specific.\n\nOther positions zoned to the North-central are National Vice Chairman (NC), Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nAPC zoned the following positions to the South-south: National Vice Chairman (SS), National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader\n\nThe offices zoned to the South-west are National Secretary, National Vice Chairman (South-West), National Youth Leader, Deputy National Auditor, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nFor the North-west, the positions given are National Vice Chairman (NW), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Youth Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability \u2013 PWD) Leader, among others.\n\nThe party zoned the position of the Deputy National Chairman (S) to the South-east, with other offices like National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nNorth-east would produce Deputy National Chairman (N), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (NW), Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Women Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, among others.\n\nInterestingly, the zoning plan has tactically knocked out a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; former Governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and Sunny Monidafe.\n\nThe chairmanship aspirants favoured by the method are the senator representing Niger East, Mohammed Musa; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; and former governors of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura and Abdudulahi Adamu.\n\nBuni Threatens to Resign\n\nBut while APC may have succeeded in dousing the raging issues over its national convention, a new problem seems to be developing.\n\nAn insider told THISDAY last night that the chairman of the caretaker committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, had threatened to resign his position, citing accusations of inefficiency from many APC governors accused.\n\nThe source said regarding Buni, \u201cWhile some of the governors were ready to grab his resignation, others cautioned that accepting his resignation would draw the party back. And on the basis of that, the governors encouraged him to continue until the national convention is held.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the governors and the president agreed to swap offices between North and South, THISDAY gathered that the leaders of the party specifically agreed that the national chairman should go to the North-central.\n\nAccording to the source, while the party\u2019s leaders agreed on consensus option in electing the national officers, the governors agreed that the president should be given the privilege to pick the national chairman.\n\nThus, ahead of the national convention on March 26, the meeting yesterday also agreed to hold national caucus meeting to resolve all pending issues.\n\nAPC EXTRAORDINARY NATIONAL CONVENTION 2022\n\nZONING OF NATIONAL OFFICES\n\nSouth-South:\n\n(Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River,\n\nDelta, Edo and Rivers States)\n\n1.

          "text": "Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court in Abuja requested for a bribe to give judgement against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the corruption case involving a former Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts, Rear Admiral Tahir Yusuf (retd), a leaked audio of the military officer\u2019s brother, Abdulbar has revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Yusuf was being prosecuted by the Nigerian government through the EFCC for stealing N2 billion while serving as Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts.\n\nIn an audio recording exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters, Abdulbar, a banker was heard telling Yusuf that the judge was not paid any money.\n\nAccording to him, Justice Ojukwu invited the lawyer identified as Barrister Mathew and accused him of wanting \u201cto chop alone.\u201d\n\nHe added that the EFCC Head of Legal department was only given N3 million out of the N5 million he had requested.\n\n\u201cBarrister Mathew, the only money he was given was N1.5m. Then, when they met with the EFCC Head of Legal before everything, all payment made to him (Head of Legal) was N3 million while he was to be paid N5 million. Until now, they have not paid the balance of the money that was supposed to be paid to him. The Head of Legal assumed he has eaten (taken) the money,\u201d Abdulbar was heard saying.\n\n\u201cHe also said the judge has not been paid any money. The judge (Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu) even brought forth herself and asked what they wanted her to do but he could not do anything simply because he didn\u2019t know Oga (Real Admiral Yusuf) and the other people said there is no money.\n\n\u201cSo, the judge (Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu) was given nothing, because the lawyer said even the judge approached him. She called him, he even went to her house, she was like \u2018ah ah\u2019, it\u2019s like you collected this thing (money) and you want to chop alone or anything, so that is why something is not done. So, that is the thing we are also going after now because we were told she is the wife of Ojukwu (Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu) and she do (sic) collect bribe.\n\n\u201cSo, after this adjournment, if Babangida is not complying, it\u2019s the judge we have to meet again, since the lawyer knows her, we are going to approach her so she would do a judgement in our favour and let us move forward. So that is what we are going for.\n\n\u201cThe problem now is not the Head of Legal, he is ready to comply with us and he has written they should accept this amount (N3 million). All we need to do was to balance him his N2 million and maybe possibly, we would give him something more.\u201d\n\nJustice Ojukwu had in 2020 ordered the permanent forfeiture of about N500 million found to be fraudulently amassed by Yusuf to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe total amount forfeited was N392,695,857.87, including $91,955.38 and the sum of \u00a315,050 held in domiciliary accounts.\n\nYusuf, previously second-in-command to the Chief of Account and Budget, Naval Headquarters (NHQ), held the cash in seven accounts- both private and corporate in two banks.\n\nThe seven accounts were operated under the name of a company, Bitmas Enterprise, in Zenith Bank while two were held in Yusuf\u2019s name in the defunct Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nFollowing the forfeiture, SaharaReporters gathered that Yusuf fled Nigeria to Dubai, United Arab Emirate.\n\nThe EFCC and National Intelligence Agency also asked the Nigeria Immigration Service and Interpol to place him on a watch list and have him arrested at the point of entry or exit.\n\nHowever, Yusuf sneaked back to the country in October 2021 after he illegally obtained an international passport with the help of some corrupt government officials through Niger Republic, a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how Yusuf once boasted about giving money to many EFCC operatives including the commission\u2019s Director of Operations.\n\nThe retired military officer had disclosed this to his workers after illegally reopening two of his hotels sealed by the anti-graft agency.\n\n\u201cAfter EFCC marked Rtd Tahir Yusuf\u2019s hotels in Kaduna and Sokoto, guess what he did, he asked his people to wipe and clean the EFCC markings. This man is so arrogant. As we are talking, business activities are ongoing in the hotels,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nHe had said, \u201cOne of his staff (members) said he told them not to panic as those who came to seal off the property are fake EFCC operatives.\n\n\u201cHe was boasting around that he had reached out to the EFCC through his younger brother, Abdulbari Yusuf, who is a banker with Zenith Bank, Maiduguri branch.\n\n\u201cHe said he gave money to many EFCC operatives, including a Director of Operations, so nothing can be done to him again.\u201d",

          "text": "Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court in Abuja requested for a bribe to give judgement against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in the corruption case involving a former Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts, Rear Admiral Tahir Yusuf (retd), a leaked audio of the military officer\u2019s brother, Abdulbar has revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Yusuf was being prosecuted by the Nigerian government through the EFCC for stealing N2 billion while serving as Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts.\n\nIn an audio recording exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters, Abdulbar, a banker was heard telling Yusuf that the judge was not paid any money.\n\nAccording to him, Justice Ojukwu invited the lawyer identified as Barrister Mathew and accused him of wanting \u201cto chop alone.\u201d\n\nHe added that the EFCC Head of Legal department was only given N3 million out of the N5 million he had requested.\n\n\u201cBarrister Mathew, the only money he was given was N1.5m. Then, when they met with the EFCC Head of Legal before everything, all payment made to him (Head of Legal) was N3 million while he was to be paid N5 million. Until now, they have not paid the balance of the money that was supposed to be paid to him. The Head of Legal assumed he has eaten (taken) the money,\u201d Abdulbar was heard saying.\n\n\u201cHe also said the judge has not been paid any money. The judge (Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu) even brought forth herself and asked what they wanted her to do but he could not do anything simply because he didn\u2019t know Oga (Real Admiral Yusuf) and the other people said there is no money.\n\n\u201cSo, the judge (Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu) was given nothing, because the lawyer said even the judge approached him. She called him, he even went to her house, she was like \u2018ah ah\u2019, it\u2019s like you collected this thing (money) and you want to chop alone or anything, so that is why something is not done. So, that is the thing we are also going after now because we were told she is the wife of Ojukwu (Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu) and she do (sic) collect bribe.\n\n\u201cSo, after this adjournment, if Babangida is not complying, it\u2019s the judge we have to meet again, since the lawyer knows her, we are going to approach her so she would do a judgement in our favour and let us move forward. So that is what we are going for.\n\n\u201cThe problem now is not the Head of Legal, he is ready to comply with us and he has written they should accept this amount (N3 million). All we need to do was to balance him his N2 million and maybe possibly, we would give him something more.\u201d\n\nJustice Ojukwu had in 2020 ordered the permanent forfeiture of about N500 million found to be fraudulently amassed by Yusuf to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe total amount forfeited was N392,695,857.87, including $91,955.38 and the sum of \u00a315,050 held in domiciliary accounts.\n\nYusuf, previously second-in-command to the Chief of Account and Budget, Naval Headquarters (NHQ), held the cash in seven accounts- both private and corporate in two banks.\n\nThe seven accounts were operated under the name of a company, Bitmas Enterprise, in Zenith Bank while two were held in Yusuf\u2019s name in the defunct Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nFollowing the forfeiture, SaharaReporters gathered that Yusuf fled Nigeria to Dubai, United Arab Emirate.\n\nThe EFCC and National Intelligence Agency also asked the Nigeria Immigration Service and Interpol to place him on a watch list and have him arrested at the point of entry or exit.\n\nHowever, Yusuf sneaked back to the country in October 2021 after he illegally obtained an international passport with the help of some corrupt government officials through Niger Republic, a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how Yusuf once boasted about giving money to many EFCC operatives including the commission\u2019s Director of Operations.\n\nThe retired military officer had disclosed this to his workers after illegally reopening two of his hotels sealed by the anti-graft agency.\n\n\u201cAfter EFCC marked Rtd Tahir Yusuf\u2019s hotels in Kaduna and Sokoto, guess what he did, he asked his people to wipe and clean the EFCC markings. This man is so arrogant. As we are talking, business activities are ongoing in the hotels,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nHe had said, \u201cOne of his staff (members) said he told them not to panic as those who came to seal off the property are fake EFCC operatives.\n\n\u201cHe was boasting around that he had reached out to the EFCC through his younger brother, Abdulbari Yusuf, who is a banker with Zenith Bank, Maiduguri branch.\n\n\u201cHe said he gave money to many EFCC operatives, including a Director of Operations, so nothing can be done to him again.\u201d",

          "text": "A former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Michael Aondoakaa, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, has been barred from holding public office in the country for life.\n\nJustice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun of the Supreme Court in a unanimous judgment delivered on December 10, 2021, affirmed a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Calabar division, which had earlier upheld a Federal High Court decision that barred the former Minister under late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s administration from occupying public office in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nIn the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgement on June 1, 2010, Justice A.F.A. Ademola ordered, \u201c1. A declaration is hereby made that the 2nd Defendant undermined and subverted the rule of law, the due administration of justice and integrity of the judiciary in the letters of 8th January, 2008 and 16th February 2009 written by him in the capacity of the Defendant.\n\n\u201c2. A declaration is hereby made that 2nd Defendant is not a competent, fit and proper person to hold office as the 1st Defendant having regards to the oaths of Allegiance and office.\n\n\u201c3. N50,000,000,00 exemplary damages is hereby awarded against the 1st and 2nd Defendants in favour of the plaintiff.\n\n\u201c4. A perpetual injunction is hereby made restraining the 2nd Defendant from occupying/holding the office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and public offices in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut In the matter titled, SC.939/2015, Aondoakaa had asked the Supreme Court to upturn the judgment delivered by Appellate Court on September 3, 2015.\n\nThe five-man judicial panel at the Supreme Court, which also awarded N2million against the appellant in favour of the 1st respondent (Emmanuel Obot), were Justices Mary Peter-Odili, Kekere-Ekun, Mohammed Lawal Garba, Ibrahim Saulawa and Emmanuel Agim.\n\nA 58-page certified true copy of the judgment stated that, \u201cThe appellant (Aondoakaa), as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria to boot was reckless and acted in a manner most unbecoming of the occupant of such an exalted office.\u201d\n\nAligning with position held by Justice Olubunmi Oyewole in the Court of Appeal judgment, Kekere-Ekun quoted reasons advanced by the lower court in its decision.\n\nOyewole was of the view that \u201cThe fact leading to this appeal captured a most sordid low in administration of justice in this country.\n\n\u201cIt is unthinkable that the occupier of the exalted office of Attorney General would subvert the ends of justice, as was crudely done in this case by the appellant. Public office is a sacred trust and an Attorney General should epitomize all that is good and noble in the legal profession. That office should never again be occupied by individuals of such poor quality as the appellant.\n\n\u201cIt is ironic that the appellant should approach the same temple he so brazenly desecrated for succor against the consequences of his appalling conduct.\n\n\u201cTo restore the dignity of the legal profession and reinforce the confidence of the administration of justice. The Nigerian Bar Association is invited to the facts of this case and the judicial reactions thereto and subject the appellant to its appropriate disciplinary processes.\u201d\n\nThe facts prompting the litigations, which had dragged on for 15 years, is traceable to the People\u2019s Democratic Party primary election held in December 2006 for nomination of candidate for Uyo Federal Constituency of Akwa Ibom State for the general elections of April 2007.\n\nObot, who emerged winner of the primary election, was substituted with the name of Bassey Etim after he (Obot) was \u201cduly presented to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the PDP candidate.\u201d\n\nOn December 12, 2007, the Court of Appeal, Calabar division in appeal numbered CA/C/45/2007 delivered judgment in favour of Obot, ordering the President of the Court of Appeal to set up a new Tribunal to adjudicate over Obot\u2019s petition in Uyo.\n\nFollowing a petition he received from Etim, Aondoakaa, in his capacity as the AGF, wrote a letter to the President of the Court of Appeal, urging him not to comply with the decision of the Court of Appeal, Calabar division, which had ordered the constitution of new panel of judges to hear the matter.\n\nNotwithstanding Aondoakaa\u2019s letter, the President of the Court of Appeal went ahead by setting up a new panel of judges in compliance with the order of the court.\n\nThe new panel gave judgment on April 18, 2008 that Obot be sworn into the House of Representatives as the member representing Uyo Federal Constituency, and Etim\u2019s appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed with an order that INEC should issue Certificate of Return to Obot.\n\nCuriously, though by virtue of Section 246(2) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, the decisions of the Court of Appeal are final regarding appeals emanating from National and State Houses of Assembly elections, the former AGF wrote to the then chairman of INEC, Maurice Iwu, urging him not to obey the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which he described in the letter as \u201cobvious desecration of the institution of the judiciary.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt the same time, he also wrote to the Speaker of the House of Representatives advising him to disregard the judgment but \u201cto allow the status quo ante to remain until the last word is heard from the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nConsequent upon Aondoakaa\u2019s letters to the INEC chairman and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Obot was not issued Certificate of Return nor sworn into the office he was elected to serve the people of Uyo Federal Constituency, hence he slammed a law suit on May 15, 2009 against the then AGF in his personal and official capacity at the Federal High Court, Calabar division through his lawyer, Uwemedimo Nwoko (SAN).\n\n",

I know the discussions are often emotive. Restructuring should not be driven by political expediency, but by economic and financial viability \u2014 the necessary and sufficient conditions for political viability,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSurgeries are tough. They are better done well, the first time.\n\n\u201cThe resources found in each state or state groupings should belong to them. The constituent entities should pay federal taxes or royalties for those resources. The achievement of economically viable entities and the viability of the national entity requires constitutional changes to devolve more economic and fiscal powers to the states or regions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe stronger the states, or regions, the stronger the federated units. In the process, our union would be renewed. Our union would be stronger. Our union would be equitable. Our union would be fully participatory. We must be audacious!\n\n\u201cWe must change the relational mindset between the states and Abuja: the fulcrum would be the states, while the centre would provide support to them, not lord over them. With good governance, better accountability systems, and a zero tolerance for corruption, more economically stronger constituent states would emerge!\n\n\u201cWe would unleash massive wealth across the states. It would be a commonwealth. Wealth for all, not wealth for a few. A New Nigeria would arise! We will need all of us \u2014 not some of us.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke on the need to review the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme to ensure more inclusiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) was a very good idea. It allowed graduates from tertiary institutions to have one year of national service, largely (ideally) outside of their places of origin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe real test, however, of \u2018national service\u2019 is that it often revealed the lack of inclusiveness. After one year of service, the NYSC graduates are often not able to gain employment in governments where they served, simply because they are not indigenes of those states. That in itself, is an irony!\n\n\u201cThe young graduates are often strangers in their own country. A country they pledged to serve. Opportunity is denied just because they were not born in those states! Even if they were born in those states, they are told to return to the states of their origin.\n\n\u201cIn almost all of Nigeria, regardless of how long you have resided in any place, you cannot run for political offices in those states or locations, just because you were not born there. State governments, therefore, largely reflect nativism, not residency, which further sends a message to non-indigenes that they do not belong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOver time, this has created greater insularism, splintering, a lack of inclusiveness, the promotion of ethnic and religious chauvinism, instead of promoting national cohesion, trust and inclusiveness.\u201d",

          "text": "Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), says restructuring Nigeria should be focused on ensuring economic viability of states.\n\nHe said this on Wednesday while delivering a lecture titled \u2018Nigeria \u2014 A Country of Many Nations: A Quest for National Integration\u2019, at an event to celebrate the 80th birthday of Enoch Adeboye, general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG).\n\nAdeboye will clock 80 on March 2.\n\nAccording to Adesina, restructuring shouldn\u2019t be done on the basis of sentiments or political inclinations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs a way out of the economic quagmire, much has been said about the need for restructuring. I know the discussions are often emotive. Restructuring should not be driven by political expediency, but by economic and financial viability \u2014 the necessary and sufficient conditions for political viability,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSurgeries are tough. They are better done well, the first time.\n\n\u201cThe resources found in each state or state groupings should belong to them. The constituent entities should pay federal taxes or royalties for those resources. The achievement of economically viable entities and the viability of the national entity requires constitutional changes to devolve more economic and fiscal powers to the states or regions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe stronger the states, or regions, the stronger the federated units. In the process, our union would be renewed. Our union would be stronger. Our union would be equitable. Our union would be fully participatory. We must be audacious!\n\n\u201cWe must change the relational mindset between the states and Abuja: the fulcrum would be the states, while the centre would provide support to them, not lord over them. With good governance, better accountability systems, and a zero tolerance for corruption, more economically stronger constituent states would emerge!\n\n\u201cWe would unleash massive wealth across the states. It would be a commonwealth. Wealth for all, not wealth for a few. A New Nigeria would arise! We will need all of us \u2014 not some of us.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke on the need to review the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme to ensure more inclusiveness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) was a very good idea. It allowed graduates from tertiary institutions to have one year of national service, largely (ideally) outside of their places of origin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe real test, however, of \u2018national service\u2019 is that it often revealed the lack of inclusiveness. After one year of service, the NYSC graduates are often not able to gain employment in governments where they served, simply because they are not indigenes of those states. That in itself, is an irony!\n\n\u201cThe young graduates are often strangers in their own country. A country they pledged to serve. Opportunity is denied just because they were not born in those states! Even if they were born in those states, they are told to return to the states of their origin.\n\n\u201cIn almost all of Nigeria, regardless of how long you have resided in any place, you cannot run for political offices in those states or locations, just because you were not born there. State governments, therefore, largely reflect nativism, not residency, which further sends a message to non-indigenes that they do not belong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOver time, this has created greater insularism, splintering, a lack of inclusiveness, the promotion of ethnic and religious chauvinism, instead of promoting national cohesion, trust and inclusiveness.\u201d",

The Latin American country has seen its health system collapse, with food, electricity and fuel shortages progressively worsening \u2014 fuelling the rise in refugees, migration and asylum seekers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Ngige, although Nigeria is passing through hard times, it is not the fault of the current government, but a result of poor planning over the years, adding that good leadership is critical to the survival of any human society.\n\n\u201cA good leader must be an implementation man. He should be knowledgeable, because after the vision, he will dissect and crystalise them. He should be a jack of all trades and master of all,\u201d he said in a statement signed by Charles Akpan, deputy director of media in the labour ministry.\n\n\u201cHe may not score distinction in all but should be able to score distinction in many.

He should exude milk of human kindness.\n\n\u201cI know that our country is passing through a very rough time now because we have not planned well. It is not this administration. We know we were all dependent on oil. So, when oil prices came crashing and when security issues arose, disrupting production, we were caught napping. Because of that, we went into recession. Later on, COVID-19 forced us to go into a second recession. We are not yet out of the woods.\n\n\u201cWe thank God. I am part of this government. I know that if we don\u2019t have the kind of leader that we have who is strong like President Muhammadu Bihari, the experience of Nigeria would have been like that of Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThe citizens of Nigeria would have spilled into Cameroon, Niger and other places as refugees.

          "text": "Last month, Polygon raised $450 million, to expand its portfolio of ethereum scaling solutions and footprints in the developer ecosystem. Ethereum is a blockchain that has attracted developers across the world, but its slow speed and high transaction costs (gas fees) have made many developers reluctant to use it.\n\nPolygon, a side chain firm attached to ethereum, is improving the functionality of the ethereum blockchain by improving transaction speed and cost. While Polygon\u2019s ultimate goal, at least for now, is to scale ethereum, it is processing more transactions than ethereum\u2019s main chain, mostly because of its $1 gas fee cost. As of today, it has processed 3.4 billion transactions and last month claims its 3 million transactions per day volume is double that of ethereum.\n\nOver the past few years, Polygon, previously known as Matic Network, has grown to host over 7,000 decentralised applications, including metaverse projects like Decentraland and Sandbox; popular NFT marketplace OpenSea; and DeFi projects such as Aave, Curve, Pool, Uniswap, etc.\n\nSandeep Nailwal, Polygon co-founder has said that its $450 million funding is to help Polygon build larger developer ecosystems in several markets. At the forefront of this expansion strategy is Nigeria\u2019s Shodipo Ayomide, Polygon\u2019s new Global Head of Developer Advocacy.\n\nBefore Polygon, Ayomide had previously worked with Nigerian tech publication TechPoint as a software engineer, VanHack as a developer advocate, and Stack Overflow also as a developer advocate. Ayomide had rejected multiple managerial and director-level positions to accept his offer at Polygon because he believes \u201cit is the future\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t focused on money or passion, but what excites me is a place I am building something that a billion people are using or is impacting a billion people around the globe. It means I am part of something huge and something bigger than myself.\u201d\n\nAyomide will be working with various teams like the hackathon, community, content team, and an engineering and open-source team, to create written and video content, organise meetups and establish relationships in the Web3 ecosystem of cities across the world.\n\nOne of the developer ecosystem expansion strategies is to establish Polygon Guilds, a structure that will help educate \u201cWeb2 developers\u201d and onboard them to Web3. This guild model will adopt a similar approach to Google Developer Group, a small meetup across different locations where people can learn about Google technologies.\n\nPolygon Guilds are in over 19 cities, a large number of them are in Africa\u2014Lagos, Abuja, Delta, Warri, Port Harcourt, Nairobi, and Mombasa. Polygon is also expanding its presence in France, India, the Netherlands, and the United States.\n\nEarlier this month, Polygon created the Polygon Academy, which intends to be a comprehensive guide for anybody that wants to understand Web3. This academy consists of eight modules and learners will earn an NFT when they complete them.\n\nThe end game of Polygon, Naiwal also said, is to become the AWS of Web3, and if Web3 is going to be as big as investors are saying it would be, its recent efforts will no doubt be a win for African developers.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Solving Africa\u2019s tech talent problem: All hands on deck",
          "text": "When Joseph* graduated from university in 2019, he expected to secure a well paying job but didn\u2019t expect his search to take so long. Two years later, still in his early 20s, he resorted to cab-driving in Accra, Ghana, while he kept looking.\n\n\u201cI left Nigeria to study in Ghana and decided to remain here. Things are calmer here, although not necessarily easier,\u201d Joseph, who is originally Nigerian, tells me during a ride in his cab.\n\nHe goes on to speak about the difficulty around getting a better accommodation and making ends meet. The car he uses was bought on hire purchase; he\u2019s still paying for it.\n\nJoseph is one of Ghana\u2019s 15 million underemployed population. 13.4% of Ghana\u2019s population are unemployed, according to data released by the Ghana Statistical Service in December 2021.\n\nOn the other end of town, Meghan McCormick, founder of OZ\u00c9, is looking for experienced hires. OZ\u00c9 is a Ghana-based fintech company that helps SMEs record transactions and access to financing.\n\n\u201cIn the past 6 weeks, we\u2019ve been hiring for 15 roles and have only been able to fill 4. It\u2019s been difficult getting a senior UI/UX designer, data analyst, and product managers,\u201d McCormick says. \u201cIt feels like everyone is trying to pivot to product management, but they don\u2019t have enough experience.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2017, OZ\u00c9, which has over 125,000 users across Ghana and Nigeria, is at a stage where hiring the right-skilled persons is a major challenge. Although keen on hiring Africans, if that\u2019s not possible, McCormick will have to look outside the continent.\n\nOZ\u00c9 isn\u2019t alone: many African startups are in a similar situation. The prevalence of talent scarcity highlights a fascinating irony about Africa: despite having a high rate of unemployed and underemployed persons, businesses on the continent struggle to find the right talent to fill in key roles.\n\nAccording to a 2021 Bloomberg report South Africa has the highest unemployment rate (34.4%) on a global list of 82 countries. Closely behind on that list are Namibia (33.4%), and Nigeria (33.3%) coming in second and third respectively.\n\nA popular and widely accepted explanation for this discrepancy is the gap between the skills the unemployed and underemployed Africans possess and the expected skills they need to excel on the job.\n\nGranted, there aren\u2019t even enough jobs on the continent; only 3 million formal jobs are created annually in Africa, according to a 2015 report by the African Development Bank, while 10 million to 12 million youth enter the workforce in Africa each year. So, many graduates end up doing work outside of what they trained for in school.\n\nBut, while the demand for job creation is valid, there\u2019s a need to look into how to solve the current problem of ensuring that the existing vacant jobs are filled in the first place. The answer, it appears, doesn\u2019t reside in one approach.\n\n\u201cOur fight is against hunger\u201d\n\nA typical response to the issue of low/unskilled workers is to train them. A champion of this approach was Andela, which trained African developers for the first few years of its existence before evolving to become a network that hires senior developers from around the world to work for predominantly American companies.\n\nBuilding on lessons from Andela and companies like Decagon and Semicolon involved in training African tech talents, Adewale Yusuf decided to co-found TalentQL in 2020.\n\nTalentQL started out as a recruitment agency for international and national companies. But, along the way, the need to train applicants became apparent, as many African engineers were failing the tests.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that a lot of people were self-taught; school didn\u2019t prepare them for the roles they were applying for,\u201d Yusuf says.\n\nThis led to the creation of a training programme called Pipeline, a 6-month coaching programme focused on technical and soft skills. With the help of African engineers at big tech companies like Twitter, Amazon, and Spotify, the pilot cohort of 14 intermediate software engineers were trained to become world-class engineers.\n\nDespite initial scepticism, the programme turned out successful. Seeing that the Pipeline model worked, Yusuf and the TalentQL team decided to create a similar programme for those with little or no experience, scaling them up to junior level experience. This birthed AltSchool Africa, a virtual year-long training programme at the end of which participants gained a diploma in software engineering, in affiliation with a reputable and accredited university.\n\nTo ease the burden of paying for tuition, AltSchool Africa employs an income-sharing agreement where students only pay for their tuition when they get jobs upon graduation. They\u2019re expected to pay $500, which can be paid in full or in installments\u2014$50 over 10 months, or $100 over 5 months.\n\nAltSchool Africa\u2019s maiden edition has over 9,000 applicants from over 17 countries, with the top countries represented being Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda.\n\n\u201cOur courses are based on research,\u201d says Yusuf. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at what will be relevant in the next 5 years. There are some jobs that don\u2019t exist yet but will soon need developer support. These are the jobs we are training people for.\u201d\n\nAlthough TalentQL and AltSchool Africa are related, graduates of AltSchool Africa don\u2019t automatically gain access to Pipeline until they gain some working experience.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to help someone in Akoko, Akure, earn \u20a6100,000\u2013\u20a6200,000 every month and provide for their family. Our fight is against hunger.\u201d\n\nWhile AltSchool Africa started off focused on training software engineers, there are plans to add other specialisations such as product design and marketing, blockchain, and data analytics.\n\n\u201cA country like Ukraine decided to revamp their curriculum to make sure they are churning out engineers. We can\u2019t keep teaching programming languages like COBOL and Fortran in our schools,\u201d Yusuf says. TalentQL is also engaging with the Nigerian government to review its policies and the educational curriculum.\n\nA nudge in the right direction\n\nTraining programmes come and go, but wouldn\u2019t a lifetime mentor and community be better? That\u2019s part of the thinking that spurred the creation of Fuzu, a career platform launched in Kenya in 2015.\n\n\u201cOne key thing I\u2019ve learnt from our conversation with Africans is that they need someone to help them along their career journey. Fuzu is trying to fill that gap,\u201d Jussi Hinkkanen, Fuzu\u2019s CEO, says.\n\nSeven years later, now in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria, Fuzu\u2019s major appeal is that it not only connects Africans to job opportunities, it provides them with relevant resources\u2014courses, articles, and CV building\u2014based on their career path and goal. It acts as a virtual mentor and community that looks out for a person all through their career.\n\nSince inception, Fuzu has supported over 12 million Africans and seen a 57% increase in skills gained by Fuzu career builders who use its Instant Feedback tool. Kadundo Jacob is one of the millions, who secured his first and current job as a medical representative in Kenya. The company also adds that professionals who use its CV creator tool are 46% more likely to get promoted while those who complete at least 1 course within 18 months are 26% more likely to get promoted.\n\nTurning passions into livelihood\n\nIn the past few years, the internet has facilitated the rise of the passion economy\u2014a new wave of niche communities of people monetising their skills, whether it\u2019s running online classes, selling digital books, or copywriting. Africans are not left out of this movement and Mylene Flicka\u2019s Irawo, a platform that teaches Africans how to monetise their skills, is there to help.\n\nWith as low as $100, individuals can sign up for a training programme on Irawo\u2019s website and end up like Ife Kohossi, who now earns about $2,000 per month from teaching people to eat better and live healthier lives. Kohossi decided to set out on her own after several failed attempts to get a job.\n\n\u201cWhen she first came, she didn\u2019t know how to use a Facebook page to create a community. After passing through Irawo\u2019s programme Kohossi learnt how to use online tools and market her business better,\u201d says Flicka. In the case of Irawo, the training is focused on teaching Africans how to use online tools like Social media and eCommerce stores to amplify the reach of their service or product.\n\nBeyond the training, the participants are connected to mentors and they become part of a large community that continually provides useful tools and education. Irawo started in the Republic of Benin and now caters to Africans in french-speaking countries around the world\u2014proof that there\u2019s a growing interest from African creators.\n\nCompeting for a prize\n\nOver the years, companies have come to see hackathons as an opportunity to crowdsource new product ideas and also recruit talent.\n\nFor Foster Akugri, founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation focused on preparing young people for future jobs, he realised that hackathons were also helping participants upskill quickly. While the annual hackathons aren\u2019t necessarily a training ground, Akugri explained that Hacklab organises some training for the participants after the theme of the hackathon is introduced. The intending participants are exposed to resource materials about a new trend or technology, this helps the participants upskill to compete for the coveted cash prize of $10,000\u2013$20,000 with additional benefits.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s theme is edge computing, so we\u2019ve started engaging edge computing leading technology firms like in Nvidia and Intel,\u201d Akugri says. \u201cWhat we do is that beyond asking these firms for financial support, we create workshops to teach participants on the fundamentals of the technologies we are focusing on.\u201d\n\nThe partner companies also give users free access to paid tools for a short duration to practise.\n\nSince 2015, the different hackathons have covered topics such as artificial intelligence, Blockchain and eCommerce. Over the span of 8 Hackathons there\u2019s been over 300 job placements and 9 companies started, an indication of the program\u2019s impact.\n\n\u201cSome of the partner firms like Stanbic Bank and Vodafone are recruiting not less than 15 people every year from our Hackathons,\u201d Akuri added, emphasising the relevance of the Hackathon in upskilling these talents and getting them jobs.\n\nGlobally, the demand for talent outstrips supply and Africa is no exception. There are just 83,000 software developers in Nigeria. Compare that to California, which has 630,000, out of a total population of 39 million.\n\nBuilding enough tech talents for the continent will require the combined efforts of different players. African companies can also do their bit by upskilling their staff, enabling them to move departments, championing documentation processes that help new employees to settle seamlessly into their roles, and offering fine working conditions that motivate even people outside tech, who are willing and ambitious, to transition into the industry.\n\nAs the cab trip with Joseph comes to an end, he asks if moving to Lagos could offer him a better chance. He still hopes to secure a well paying job. I share a few thoughts, alight and slowly walk away, thinking about how there are others like Josephs out there.\n\n*Name changed to protect source\u2019s identity.\n\nShare this article",

Building on this work, TradeDepot will leverage its data, technology, and robust logistics operations to connect more retailers in more Ghanaian cities to suppliers and make financing more accessible and affordable, the company said in a statement.\n\nAccording to data cited by TradeDepot, Ghana\u2019s retail sector is valued at $24.4 billion and is expected to reach $33.16 billion by 2024, with SME retailers accounting for about 90% of the market.\n\n\u201cGhana represents a significant market for consumer goods in Africa and we are excited to bring the Green Lion team onboard to drive growth and prosperity for more retailers and distributors in the country,\u201d said Onyekachi Izukanne, CEO and co-founder of TradeDepot.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTradeDepot already has active operations in Ghana, as well as its operations in Nigeria and South Africa, and this acquisition is expected to expedite the delivery of its services to more cities to enable increased sales, higher margins, and other value-added services for all parties across the retail value chain.\n\nTradeDepot has built a network of leading consumer goods brands and SME retailers across Africa and created a proprietary risk scoring engine that uses retailers\u2019 purchase history, previous repayment performance, and other related data points to predict their creditworthiness.\n\nThrough its ShopTopUp platform, the company offers a broad range of consumer goods to SME retailers within its network and provides credit lines to enable retailers to access inventory and pay in instalments as they sell on to their own customers.\n\n\u201cIt is an exciting time for B2B e-commerce in Africa and we are thrilled by the opportunity to drive more value in the Ghanaian ecosystem and all over the continent,\u201d Jorge de Rojas from Green Lion added.\n\nTradeDepot will take on all existing Green Lion Africa relationships and assets in Ghana, the company said. In addition, the Green Lion team will join TradeDepot to support its mission to \u201cbuild the future of retail and make food and supplies more accessible and affordable for even the most remote consumers\u201d in Africa.\n\nThe TradeDepot-Green Lion deal is the latest in a string of acquisition deals the African tech landscape has witnessed since the year began. Late January, Egyptian-American cloud security startup Magalix was acquired by Weaveworks Limited, a GitOps company with headquarters in London and San Francisco, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nThis month, there have been at least four mergers and acquisitions (M&A) announcements involving African startups.\n\nKenyan insurance technology company Lami bought Bluewave Insurance Agency, another insurtech startup in the country, pan-African fintech Branch International acquired a majority stake in Century Microfinance Bank, which provides financial services to micro, small and medium businesses, and last week, Cape Town-based BNPL startup PayJustNow sold an 85% stake to Weaver Fintech.\n\nIn December, TradeDepot announced it had raised $110 million in an equity and debt Series B funding round to support the delivery of Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) services to 5 million SME retailers and drive further expansion of its merchant platform across the continent.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

With its promise of anonymity and speedy transactions not limited by national borders, there has been no shortage of adopters and even evangelists.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all we have to thank the blockchain for, with NFTs generating almost as much attention as the technology. Where artists had to wait for their work to be commissioned \u2014 often by individuals in the same geographical location \u2014 they can now create and sell art for astonishing prices. Admittedly, art is not the only use case for NFTs, but it is currently the most popular.\n\nWith the often mind-boggling prices NFTs sell for, it is perhaps no surprise that they have been used in fraudulent activities, with wash trading and money laundering the most common cases.\n\nIdeally, we would expect governments to curb these issues, but NFTs are not regarded as securities, and it has become difficult to establish what is a scam. Fortunately, our reporter, Bolu Abiodun has some tips on identifying NFT scams, and you can read all about it in Wash trading scams and money laundering; why NFT traders should be careful.\n\nMarketForce raises $40 million to provide BNPL to merchants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketForce co-founders. Source: TechCrunch\n\nMost African households depend on informal retailers for their supplies. As tech eased operations in other industries, a few entrepreneurs built solutions for the eCommerce space.\n\nInitially, these solutions were B2C, but in the last few years, the focus seems to have shifted to serving the small businesses that drive commerce on the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the players in this industry \u2013 MarketForce \u2013 has raised a $40 million Series A to offer buy now, pay later (BNPL) services to its customers.\n\nV8 Capital Partners led the round, with Cellulant Co-founder, Ken Njoroge, Ten13 VC, SOSV Select Fund, Vu Ventures, Vastly Valuable Ventures, Uncovered Fund, Reflect Ventures, Greenhouse Capital, Century Oak Capital, and Remapped Ventures participating.\n\nLast year, the startup raised $2 million in a pre-Series A round, including $150,000 from Y Combinator. Following that, it launched in Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. At the time, it had just launched RejaReja to enable retailers to get next-day deliveries for products.\n\nWith its latest raise, the startup plans to grow its team to 800 while growing the number of merchants on RejaReja to 250,000 in the next few months.\n\nMarketForce is not the only startup digitising the informal retail experience, with TradeDepot, SokoWatch, Omnibiz, and Alerzo doing the same.\n\nWith low spending power and a lack of proper addressing systems limiting B2C startups, the focus has shifted to B2B. Yet, there remains a vast market opportunity for startups. A 2020 report by the International Trade Center found that ten countries accounted for 94% of all online businesses in Africa. As mobile and Internet penetration increases on the continent, more countries could get a piece of the eCommerce pie.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHere\u2019s what actually happens to all your online shopping returns\n\nThe moral calculations of a billionaire\n\nOpportunities\n\nAltSchool Africa is hiring.

The two illicit activities related to NFTs include wsh trading \u2014 artificially increasing the value of an NFT \u2014 and money laundering through the purchase of NFTs.\n\nWhat is NFT wash trading?\n\nWash trading, also known as round-tripping, is a form of market manipulation done when an investor buys a financial instrument and sells it back to himself many times. This increases the instrument\u2019s trade volume, creating the illusion that the asset is worth more than it actually is. Consequently, unsuspecting investors buy such assets only to realise they are not worth as much as they thought.\n\nWhile wash trading is done by an individual, round-tripping can be done by one person buying and selling the same security within the same trading day or by two companies selling securities to themselves and agreeing to repurchase them at about the same price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chainalysis\n\nIs wash trading illegal with NFTs?\n\nIn traditional finance, wash trading is illegal. The US was the first country to declare it unlawful in the 1936 Commodity Exchange Act, and now, the practice is against the law in almost every part of the world.\n\nHowever, in the decentralised world of NFTs, the legality of wash trading is yet to be clearly spelt out. While it is deceptive, there\u2019s no legislation anywhere in the world detailing what is right and what isn\u2019t in NFT trading as its asset class hasn\u2019t been identified.\n\nDespite this marked absence of NFT regulation and class determination, some countries have taken a stand on the practice. For example, Bithumb, a South Korean crypto exchange, was accused of allowing wash trading worth over $250 million in fake volume in 2018.\n\nAlthough cryptocurrency wash trading might be illegal in some countries, it is still hard to identify the perpetrators because of the decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional financial instruments \u2014 stocks and securities \u2014 with verifiable know-your-customer (KYC) protocols, blockchain-powered assets can be exchanged without revealing identities.\n\nHow to spot NFT wash trading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherscan screenshot that shows a completed wash trade. Source: Chainalysis\n\nKnowing how blockchain works is required to spot or track NFT wash trading. However, the simplest way to avoid buying NFTs with an artificial value is to purchase them from a reputable person.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Chainalysis tracked wash trading activities with blockchain analysis, which revealed how sellers go about their wash trading activities.\n\nThe blockchain transactions on Etherscan showed NFTs successfully sold from one Ethereum address to another. While the transaction appeared normal, a closer look revealed that wash trading had occurred. The address that sold the NFT also sent the ETH to the buyer\u2019s address shortly before the sale. The seller financed the address used to purchase the NFT before the sale.\n\nNFT wash trading is sort of like a WhatsApp vendor sending you money to buy their products to make it seem like they\u2019re making sales. In the case of NFTs, however, one person can easily finance multiple wallets they own to purchase their listed NFTs.\n\nTo check the transactions an NFT has gone through on a marketplace like OpenSea, go to the item activity tab below the NFT, and you\u2019ll see the details of how the NFT has been bought and sold from several addresses. For more information on the NFT, click the diagonal arrow under the date column, and it takes you directly to the blockchain on which that NFT exists. You can go further by looking into the individual activity of each address associated with the NFT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenSea: NFT marketplace\n\nThis is like checking the account history of someone who has sent you money; you see where their money goes and where it comes from. However, going through all these transactions is a gruelling task that should be left to experts.\n\nThe best way to avoid wash trading is to buy NFTs created by a known artist.\n\nFor example, you can decide to buy the works of an artist you\u2019ve seen, read about, or follow on social media. That way, you are sure of the value of the NFT you\u2019ve purchased based on the owner and not on trading volume.\n\nWhat does wash trading mean for the NFT market?\n\nWash trading with NFTs doesn\u2019t seem to have affected the NFT market so far. If anything, the market is doing better than ever.\n\nOpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace in the world, surpassed $3.5 billion monthly trading volume in January 2022. While NFT trade volumes continue to grow despite the scams, Chainalysis\u2019 report reveals that most wash trades didn\u2019t yield as much as the work that went into them.\n\nMost NFT wash trades have been unprofitable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWash trading profits. Source: Chainalysis\n\nAccording to Chainalysis, selling an NFT to a self-financed account does not make it a wash trade; however, if it happens more than 25 times, the probability that it falls into that category is high. The research firm arrived at this conclusion after analysing the transactions of 262 sellers who sold NFTs to a self-financed account at least 25 times.\n\nInterestingly, while only 110 of the 262 sellers made more than $8 million from their wash trades, 152 incurred losses of over $400,000 from the deceptive trade. It is important to note that only NFTs bought and sold on the Ethereum network were analysed by Chainalysis; the story could very well be different on other chains such as Solana.\n\nAccording to the analysis, wash trading isn\u2019t a dominant phenomenon yet. However, if it becomes more prominent, it could encourage regulators to define NFT\u2019s asset class.\n\nWash trading isn\u2019t the only crime-related activity that can attract the attention of regulators. NFTs are gradually becoming a suitable option for money laundering. The Chainalysis Report also identified an increase in the value of NFTs purchased by illicit addresses totalling $1.4 million in Q4 2021.\n\nNFTs are not the only cryptocurrency used to carry out crimes. And according to Chainalysis, $8.6 billion worth of cryptocurrencies have so far been used in money laundering schemes in 2022.\n\nEvery form of economic value transfer can be a tool for committing crimes, and NFTs are no different. The fact that NFTs are being used for criminal activities does not impede its potential to become a tool for creators to get appreciation for their works or solve other economic problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "What we now know about Nigeria\u2019s dirty fuel saga",
          "text": "What we now know about Nigeria\u2019s dirty fuel saga\n\nThe current dirty fuel saga has raised tension across major cities in Nigeria on account of high methanol in the petrol distributed in the country. The process of recalling the tainted batch led to fuel scarcity and the consequent hike in prices and distrust from the public.\n\nBusinessDay investigations revealed that the adulterated fuel first arrived in Nigeria in the second week of January.\n\nHowever, having methanol in the fuel supply is not unexpected; it only has to be within certain limits, which for Nigeria has not been made public even though different countries also have their methanol limits.\n\nThis piece seeks to provide vital details concerning the continuing saga.\n\nWhat is Methanol?\n\nAccording to the Methanol Institute, methanol is a clean-burning, high octane blending component for gasoline that is made from alternative non-petroleum energy sources such as natural gas, coal, and biomass. Methanol with co-solvents has been commercially blended into gasoline (petrol) at various times and locations since the late 1970s.\n\nCorrespondingly, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) said, \u201cMethanol is a regular additive in petrol and is usually blended in an acceptable quantity.\n\nIt is believed that adding alcohols such as ethanol and methanol to petrol allows the fuel to combust more completely due to the presence of oxygen, which increases the combustion efficiency and reduces air pollution, as noted by a Science Direct article.\n\nHowever, when in excess, as noted by another publication the corrosive effects of methanol become a concern.\n\n\u201cTo ensure vehicular and equipment safety, the limited quantity of the impacted product has been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit,\u201d NMDPRA said.\n\nWho imported the dirty petrol into Nigeria?\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited has recognized four firms as being guilty of importing the tainted gasoline into the country.\n\nRead also: Flight delays worsen across Nigeria over aviation fuel scarcity\n\nThese firms include MRS (MT Bow Pioneer LITASCO Terminal, Antwerp-Belgium); Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium (MT Tom Hilde \u2013 LITASCO Terminal, Antwerp-Belgium); Oando (MT Elka Apollon \u2013 LITASCO Terminal, Antwerp-Belgium); and Duke Oil (MT Elka Apollon \u2013 LITASCO Terminal, Antwerp-Belgium) (MT Nord Gainer-LITASCO Terminal, Antwerp-Belgium).\n\nWhile noting this, on Thursday, February 17, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited affirmed that five Nigeria-bound petrol-laden vessels from Belgium were turned back.\n\n\u201cWe checked their origin and confirmed that five other vessels are coming from the same shipping terminal that loaded this and we rejected all of them; they did not sail into our waters,\u201d Mele Kyari, NNPC Group Managing Director, said.\n\nHowever, these companies have refuted the claims by the NNPC and have laid the blame on a subsidiary of the corporation, Duke Oil.\n\nWhat is the DSDP Agreement?\n\nThe Direct Sale Direct Purchase (DSDP) agreement is a type of swap whereby a certain amount of crude is exchanged in return for the equivalent amount of refined petroleum products. It typically lasts for a year, according to a national newspaper, (not BusinessDay).\n\nThe Nigerian government adopted the direct sale-direct purchase agreement (DSDP), to replace the controversial oil processing agreement (OPA) in 2015.\n\nThis was lauded as a value-added deal that has achieved one of its purposes \u2014 the supply of petrol in the country.\n\nWas the Dirty fuel under the DSDP contract?\n\nSources close to the business contract tell BusinessDay that the petrol cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp, Belgium were not under the contentious direct sales direct purchase (DSDP) arrangement but under a more opaque contract, seen for the first time in the history of Nigeria\u2019s petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cUnder the DSDP contract, NNPC sells its crude oil to selected middlemen for refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cBut the contract of dirty petrol saga showed NNPC sold its crude oil to middlemen who sell the product to an international buyer, making super profits thereafter proceeds to get cheap petrol from another refiner in Europe,\u201d a source who has access to the details of the contract says.\n\nHowever, this development contradicts the claim by the group managing director of NNPC, who said the four petrol cargoes with methanol-blended petrol came in under the DSDP arrangement.\n\n\u201cInvestigation revealed the presence of methanol in four petrol cargoes imported through the DSDP suppliers including the consortium MRS, Emadeb Consortium, Oando Consortium, and Duke Oil,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nLuqman Agboola, head of energy and infrastructure at Sofidam Capital, disagrees with Kyari\u2019s claim, saying, \u201cSomething shadier than the DSDP contracts we all complained about is happening in this business. The number of middlemen is increasing, which is increasing the cost of business and increasing NNPC\u2019s expenses.\u201d\n\nMiddlemen Saga\n\nThe controversy concerning dirty petrol has exposed more rot in Nigeria\u2019s opaque oil contracts as the latest findings reveal middlemen involved in crude oil swap are exploring the system to short-change the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and ensure Nigerians remain hooked on cheap fuel.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThis means the number of briefcase companies or middlemen involved in the value chain of Nigeria\u2019s petroleum sector is increasing every day.\u201d\n\nThis development contradicts the claim by the group managing director of NNPC, who said the four petrol cargoes with methanol-blended petrol came in under the DSDP arrangement.\n\nHowever, Luqman Agboola, head of energy and infrastructure at Sofidam Capital, disagrees with Kyari\u2019s claim, saying, \u201cSomething shadier than the DSDP contracts we all complained about is happening in this business.\n\n\u201cThe number of middlemen is increasing, which is increasing the cost of business and increasing NNPC\u2019s expenses.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis middleman is obsessed with making more margins than adding value.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Ademola Henry, former team leader at the Facility for Oil Sector Transformation (FOSTER), expressed worry about the secrecy of the contracts, noting, \u201cWhy can\u2019t NNPC deal directly with refiners.\u201d\n\nHow many people were affected?\n\nAccording to BusinessDay findings, Nigerian households and businesses use millions of litres of premium motor spirit (PMS) on a daily basis for powering their vehicles, and generators in a country that is currently putting everything in place to get power generation and distribution right.\n\nPremium motor spirit is the most used fuel in Nigeria, in view of the number of commercial and private cars that ply Nigerian roads and many households that are forced to use generators due to epileptic power supply.\n\nThis explains why a Twitter user warned that \u201cA lot of people have already complained that their vehicles have been damaged by the fuel. My official vehicle is inclusive. If you can, don\u2019t buy fuel for now.\u201d\n\nOn average, Nigeria consumes about 57 million litres of PMS daily. This consumption varies across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nData culled from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report, shows that the total consumption and importation of Premium Motor Spirit popularly known as petrol is N5.362 trillion.\n\nThe breakdown of data also shows that by region North Central N0.98 trillion, Northeast N0.38 trillion, North West N0.99 trillion, Southeast N0.60 trillion, South-south N 0.88 trillion, and Southwest N1.54 trillion.\n\nIn addition, the North-West geopolitical zone consumes on average about 18 percent of the whole PMS utilised across the nation daily, North-Central geopolitical zone consumes about 18 percent of the nation\u2019s PMS, North-East consumes about 7 percent of the nation\u2019s PMS, South-East uses 11 percent of PMS, and South West uses 29 percent of the nation\u2019s PMS.\n\nThis means that the southwest region, according to the data, coupled with the South-south region would have been most hit by the scarcity of petrol and also the importation of the dirty fuel.\n\nWhat has been done?\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has assured that it has made adequate arrangements for fuel supply, adding that \u201c30 vessels will deliver an additional supply of 2.3 Billion litres of PMS into the country till month-end of February 2022\n\nThe NNPC said on February 15, that it had commenced 24-hour operations at its depots and retail outlets to restore normal supply and distribution of petrol across the country.\n\nThis has made the corporation affirm that it has over a billion litres of petrol that is safe for use in vehicles and machinery as of Tuesday.\n\n\u201cNNPC Ltd wishes to reassure Nigerians that it has put adequate measures in place to accelerate the nationwide distribution of PMS earlier disrupted by the quarantine of methanol-blended petrol.\n\n\u201cAs of today, NNPC has over One (1) billion liters of certified PMS stock that is safe for use in vehicles and machinery.\n\n\u201cAs part of NNPC\u2019s strategic restocking, over 2.3 billion litres of PMS is scheduled for delivery between now and the end of February 2022, which will restore the sufficiency level above the national target of 30 days,\u201d NNPC Ltd said.\n\nHouse of Representatives probe NNPC\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Limited has been requested by the House of Representatives to suspend Oando Plc and other companies allegedly involved in the importation of tainted fuel into the country.\n\nIt also instructed its Committee on Petroleum Resources (Downstream) to investigate all PMS and other petroleum products imports from January to date.\n\nThese were some of the resolutions that resulted from the Chief Whip of the House, Mohammed Monguno (APC, Borno), moving a motion of urgent public urgency on Thursday, February 10, 2022.\n\nIsiaka Ibrahim (APC, Ogun), speaking in support of the motion, said that the tainted products may be imported because people know there are no penalties for disobeying the rules.\n\nHe warned that if the same error had occurred with aviation fuel, the results would have been disastrous.\n\n\u201cThis must come to an end,\u201d he emphasised. \u201cMr Speaker, if they had brought contaminated aviation fuel, and the way vehicles are halting on the roadways, picture planes falling out of the sky.\u201d\n\nConcurrently, Idris Wase, the deputy speaker, who presided over the session, took the motion when it was put to vote.",

Alkali, a retired Major General, Rhoda Gumus and Sam Olumekun.\n\nBusinessday gathered that the presence of the high level officials of the Legislative Arm of government had raised hopes that the Bill would receive the President\u2019s assent.\n\nThe President however proceeded to swear in the newly approved INEC Commissioner without making any statement on the Electoral amendment Bill.\n\nThe Presidency had on Monday revealed that the President has until the 1st of March, 2022 to assent to the Bill while urging Nigerians to patiently await the outcome of the current consultations.\n\nRead also: Democracy in jeopardy as Buhari sits on Electoral Bill\n\nThe bill which was passed recently was sent to the President for his assent on the 31st of January.\n\nThe delays in assenting to the Bill has attracted reactions from concerned stakeholders who urged the President to sign the Bill as it will give directions to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC in the conduct of elections, especially the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe bill which was earlier passed by the National Assembly, was rejected by the President over disputes on direct mode of primary election enshrined in the bill by the National Assembly\n\nIt was returned, reworked and returned to the President based on stakeholders \u201c agreement\u201d to amend the relevant offensive parts of the initial Bill.\n\nIssues addressed in the new Bill include the controversy over direct and indirect primary election methods.\n\nThe direct primary allows all approved registered members of a party to vote for who they want to be the candidate of their party in the main elections\n\nOn the other hand, the indirect primary election allows only delegates selected by the party to decide who will be the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nA third clause was however added to the new amendment which is the consensus, which allows the party to select those they want without necessarily subjecting it to the election process\n\nBut in a statement on Monday, Presidential Spokesman, Femi Adesina said the President still has enough time before the 30 days window provided by the Constitution for his assent.\n\nAdesina however noted that some interest groups are cashing in on what they consider a delay in the signing of the Electoral Bill into law \u201cto foment civil disorder and muddy the waters\u201d\n\nThe President however failed to name the group, but assured that \u201c the right thing will be dove at the right time\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOne can just pity their ignorance of Constitutional requirements, as the President has a window of 30 days within which to sign the Bill, or decline assent, after it had been transmitted to him by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that the amended Bill was sent to the Presidency on January 31, 2022, which means that the Executive could do due diligence on it till March 1, as prescribed by the Constitution.\n\nHe posited that \u201c a proposed legislation that has to do with the electoral fortunes of the country needs to be thoroughly scrutinized, and be made as near-perfect as possible.\n\n\u201cThose playing cheap politics with it are, therefore, encouraged to hold their peace, knowing that the right thing will be done within the lawful time\u201d",

We have ordered two fire trucks of our own, which will be delivered before the end of March 2022. With these three fire trucks, we will have enough equipment of our own to fight fire, no matter the scale.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, we are re-training our firemen and NPDC has gladly accepted to provide additional training aside from the provision of a fire truck. We have 38 men in service and will make sure that we send them on advanced fire-fighting training.\n\n\u201cOur focus is to get the Federal Fire Service to join and support the state\u2019s efforts in enlightenment and advocacy to prepare the citizens to join in response in case of any fire incident.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe would have three brand new industrial-sized fire trucks and will follow it up with re-training the human capacity to respond to accidents when it occurs. The most important issue is to rebuild the organisation, rebuild the confidence of the firemen, and create the incentives for them to come to work, as well as make them feel cherished and appreciated.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youths and Humanitarian Affairs, Mrs. Ifueko Alufokhai, said the state was delighted to receive the truck from NPDC.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe are delighted.

We have graduates in this environment that are not gainfully employed by this company.\n\n\u201cYou have gone through the four communities (Oben, Iguelaba, Ikobi and Obozogbe N\u2019 Ugu), there is no constant electricity; the health facilities that we have here is like a pmaternity.

          "text": "Kubwa General Hospital, Abuja, on Wednesday, told a Lagos State Special Offences Court sitting in Lagos that a medical report presented in court by a former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, was not issued by it.\n\nThe management of the hospital gave the evidence through the hospital\u2019s head of medical records, Bassey Amah, while testifying as a witness in the ongoing trial of the former minister over allegations of forgery.\n\nAmah, who is the first prosecution witness in the case, said that Fani-Kayode is not a patient of the hospital and has no medical record in the hospital.\n\nRecall that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had arraigned Fani-Kayode before Justice Olubunmi Abike-Fadipe on a 12-count charge of procurement of a \u201cfabricated\u201d medical report and use of the false document.\n\nThe anti-graft agency had specifically accused Fani-Kayode of procuring one Dr Ogieva Oziegbe to issue the fake medical report, which he allegedly tendered before a Federal High Court in Lagos where he is currently standing trial before Justice Daniel Osiagor for alleged money laundering.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nAt the resumed hearing of the matter on Wednesday, Amah claimed that the doctor that purportedly signed the medical report is not a medical doctor at Kubwa General Hospital.\n\nWhile being led in evidence by the EFCC counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, the witness said, \u201cMr Femi Fani-Kayode does not have a record with Kubwa General Hospital\u201d.\n\nHe further testified that the hospital on October 3, 2021, received a letter from the EFCC to investigate the authenticity of a medical report on Fani-Kayode.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmah said that the investigation by the hospital revealed that the defendant does not have a record with the facility.\n\nHe also maintained that the medical report purportedly emanating from the hospital is an act of forgery, adding that \u201cThe document is not authentic.\u201d\n\nWhen Oyedepo attempted to tender the letter of request written to the hospital by EFCC, dated October 3, 2021 and the response to the letter from Kubwa General Hospital dated October 13, 2021, the defence lawyer, Norrison Quakers (SAN) objected to the admissibility of the documents.\n\nQuakers based his objection on the premise that the witness in the box was not the maker of the document.\n\nThe senior lawyer submitted that \u201cThe witness introduced himself as Bassey Amah, he is not the maker, he can\u2019t even give evidence on the document.\u201d\n\nBut Oyedepo urged the court to dismiss the objection, \u201cthe document tendered is a public document. It emanated from Kubwa General Hospital and the witness in the box has given evidence on oath.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHe has given evidence on how they received the document, how it was investigated and how the letter was prepared.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC lawyer argued that by the role the witness played in the making of the document, \u201che is the maker, he can also be described as the maker of the document. It is relevant to the fact of the issue.\u201d\n\nJustice Abike-Fadipe ruled in favour of the EFCC, holding that,\u2019\u2019 The letter was issued by the Medical Director. The hospital itself cannot come to give evidence and can only do so via one of the human personnel.\u201d\n\nShe ruled, \u201cI am satisfied that the witness in the box is competent to testify.\n\nOyedepo, leading the witness on, asked, \u201cDo you know Abdulrazak Jimoh?\n\nHe replied \u201cHe is a staff of Kubwa General Hospital.\n\nHas your facility issued any other medical report about this defendant?\n\nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor, probing the head of the medical record department further on what the position of the hospital is, on exhibits earlier admitted and marked by the judge, the witness continued, \u201cas I said earlier, Mr Fani-Kayode is not our patient and has no medical report in our hospital.\n\n\u201cThe name is not even found there.\u201d\n\nThe witness also said,\u2019\u2019 the doctor that signed the medical report is not our doctor.\n\n\u201cThe number is not our hospital unit number.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that he does not know a certain Tochukwu Eze in the hospital where he works as a Chief of Medical Record.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d\n\nDo you know Dr Ogieva Oziegbe?\n\n\u201cYes, he was in Kubwa General Hospital.\u201d\n\nThe judge has adjourned the matter to February 25, 2022 for the continuation of the trial.",

          "text": "By Joan Nwagwu\n\nSen. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment said if not because of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s leadership style, Nigeria would have been in severe crises.\n\nNgige therefore described leadership as very critical to the survival of any human society.\n\nNgige said this after his induction as a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Leadership, Entrepreneurship and Corporate Governance (INSLEC) on Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nINSLEC is a leading global professional body of both present and aspiring leaders, entrepreneurs and people in corporate governance.\n\nNgige said Nigeria is passing through hard times not because of the current government, but as a result of poor planning over the years.\n\nAccording to him, a good leader must be visionary, see things others are not seeing and things that can be projected futuristically and bring them out for implementation.\n\n\u201cA good leader must be an implementation man; he should be knowledgeable, because after the vision, he will dissect and crystallise them; he should be a jack of all trades and master of all.\n\n\u201cHe may not score distinction in all but should be able to score distinction in many.\n\n\u201cHe must also be courageous to implement hard decisions. If you don\u2019t implement courageously, some of the visions will die or will not be implemented for the good of all.\n\n\u201cHe must also be compassionate, knowing when to tamper justice with mercy, to show the human part of him.\n\n\u201cHe should exude milk of human kindness. I know that our country is passing through a very rough time now because we have not planned well. It is not this administration.\n\n\u201dWe know we were all dependent on oil. So, when oil prices came crashing and when security issues arose, disrupting production, we were caught napping.\n\n\u201cBecause of that we went into recession. Later on COVID-19 forced us to go into a second recession. We are not yet out of the woods.\n\n\u201cWe thank God. I am part of this government. I know that if we don\u2019t have the kind of leader that we have, who is strong like President Muhammadu Bihari, the experience of Nigeria would have been like that of Venezuela,\u201d he said.\n\nNgige said that the citizens of Nigeria would have spilled into the Cameroons, Niger and other places as refugees. We were looking forward to it. But he forced us all to go into agriculture.\n\n\u201dWe made agriculture the first signature programme of the administration and provided food security so that we can eat whatever we grow here,\u201dhe said.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria had stopped the importation of rice, sorghum, millet, tomatoes and other things hitherto imported, all of which were dependent on the scarce foreign exchange.\n\nAccording to him, the country\u2019s GDP grew by 5.01 per cent in fourth quarter 2021, the highest in the last seven years, marking three consecutive quarters of growth, following the negative growths recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\n\u201cServices provided the lead, followed by agriculture, even though it had a deep and then, followed by Information and Communication Technology (ICT).\n\n\u201cSo, we have to be grateful to the government and our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, for standing firm that we will not import food anymore here.\n\n\u201dEven if he didn\u2019t stand firm, we didn\u2019t have the money anymore to start importing potatoes, tooth pick, chocolate and others,\u201d he said.\n\nNgige, however, dedicated the fellowship to the ordinary Nigerians, saying that he believed in the have-nots and would continue to fight for them wherever he found himself.\n\nHe commended the institute and chairman of the governing board for the fellowship and pledged to be a good member, not only in terms of participation, but also loyalty and obedience to the institute.\n\nEarlier, Prof. Gabriel Emecheta, President/Chairman of the council said the decision to elect Ngige as a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of the INSLEC spoke volumes about his pristine and differentiated worth as a leader, mentor and bridge builder.\n\nProf. Ayandiji Aina, the Chairman, Planning and Resource Committee extolled Ngige\u2019s creativity, confidence, decisiveness, humility and trustworthiness, describing him as a conflict manager of great distinction.\n\nThe Chairman, Business and Development Committee of INSLEC, Chief O\u2019tega Emerhor, while expressing gratitude to Ngige for accepting to be a member, praised him for imbibing wholeheartedly the spirit of the institute.\n\n\u201cWe have been following your antecedents and what you are doing in the ministry and what you did as Governor in Anambra State.\n\n\u201dWe appreciate your joining the institute and admit that with your brand name, the institute will make tremendous progress,\u201d he said.",

It should not be based on manifestation of separatist, which are the instruments and the disgruntlement feelings that are capable of dividing us further.\n\n\u201cNigeria is too large and too important to be ignored.

          "text": "Wife of the President, Hajiya Aisha Buhari, Wednesday, led a delegation of women into the National Assembly as part of the advocacy for the proposed special seats for women in both the federal and state legislatures.\n\nIn the team were Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed, her women affairs counterpart, Dame Paulin Talen and a delegation of Nigerian women.\n\nThe visit came ahead of the laying of report of the panel before the House by Deputy Speaker Idris Wase, who heads the special ad hoc committee for the review of 1999 Constitution.\n\nInside the report was \u201ca Bill for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 to Provide for Special Seats for Women in the National and State Houses of Assembly; and for Related Matters\u201d, which was the primary purpose of the first lady\u2019s visit.\n\nThe Wase-led committee had recommended a total of 68 amendments to the current constitution, key among which was proposal for financial autonomy for local government, autonomy for state legislature and judiciary, VAT to be on the exclusive list, and provision for independent candidacy in general elections, amongst others.\n\nThe Eleumelu drama\n\nBut in a dramatic twist during the session, Minority Leader Ndudi Elumelu, while citing section 42 of the Constitution, argued that the presence of the first lady in the Green Chamber in solidarity with women was discriminatory and intimidating of the men folk.\n\n\u201cAs a man, I am intimidated,\u201d he said, a joke that drew some laughter from among his colleagues.\n\nAnd throwing another banter, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila not only ruled him out of order, but also said: \u201cI can assure you that you just lost 70 percent of your votes in your constituency.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations\n\nMeanwhile, both chambers of the National Assembly have recommended 111 legislative seats for female lawmakers beginning from the 10th National Assembly in 2023.\n\nThe proposal which had been ratified by the Ad-hoc committees on Constitution review of both chambers was let out of the bag Wednesday during plenary.\n\nSpecifically in the Senate, Chairman of the Ad-Hoc Committee, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, while laying the report in the presence of the wife of the president and her entourage said, in line with the affirmative action and gender inclusivity, 37 seats have been reserved for female lawmakers\n\nin the Senate and 74 in the House of Representatives.\n\nLawan remarks\n\nAnd in a short remark after the report was laid, Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said the visit by the First Lady was to show support for a bill to have more female parliamentarians at the federal and state legislatures.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe First Lady\u2019s visit is to show support for a bill for more female parliamentarians in both chambers in the Senate and the House and the State Legislatures.\n\n\u201cThis, we believe, will help in nation building as such significant participation by our women will add value to not only legislation, but the much desired and needed national development.\n\n\u201cFor us as a nation, our motto is Unity and Faith, Peace and Progress. We believe that all hands must be on deck to ensure the participation of each and every segment of our society.\u201d\n\nSenate President Lawan assured the First Lady that the Ninth Assembly, while voting on the amendments to the constitution as contained in the ad-hoc committee\u2019s report, would ensure women participation in governance is commensurate with their population.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, you\u2019ll all agree with me that our women have not been able to get that level of participation commensurate with their population as reflected in our demography.\n\n\u201cTherefore, what we are trying to do (Amendment of the Constitution) will go through voting later to complete the process in the National Assembly,\u201d Lawan said.",

In the middle of the job in the Theatre , the armed men struck and whisked the doctor away.\n\n\u201cWe had to call in another Medical doctor to complete the operations to save life. The incident has caused us in the hospital to panic\u201d she said .\n\nMeanwhile, AKwa Ibom state chapter of Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) has urged members of the Union to remain calm and be alert at their respective duty posts as they have already communicated relevant security agencies on the incident.\n\nIn a statement signed by the Secretary of NMA Dr Ekem Emmanuel John and made available to newsmen in Uyo on Wednesday, the union threatened to suspend the services of Medical Doctors in the state if the victim is not released within 48 hours .\n\nIt therefore urged the state government to deploy security machinery and ensure prompt and unconditional release of the kidnapped doctor .\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cIt is with deep anguish that we inform you of the sad kidnap of our dear colleague and hippocratic brother, Dr. Felix Ekpo.\n\n\u201cReports from multiple sources indicate that the kidnappers stormed the Hospital premises this morning, abducted and bolted away with our colleague and his car.\n\n\u201cAs an Association we are at a loss why indeed any doctor and especially this particular young doctor would be the target for kidnappers considering that his only possession of worth is his medical knowledge and skills, his unflinching passion to avail healing to the sick and his dedication and love for Nigeria and his immediate environment of Akwa Ibom State- which has made him stay back to medically serve our country inspite of the lure of greener pastures made available by the UK, the USA, Saudi Arabia , UAE, Oman, Kuwait etc.\n\n\u201cIn view of this unfortunate circumstance, we therefore call on all members of the NMA to remain calm and alert in their various places of work as the leadership of NMA Akwa Ibom state has been in constant communication with relevant security agencies.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we call on the Government to make haste to uphold the Constitution especially Chapter 2 section 14 which states that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government.\n\n\u201cTo this end, we humbly request the Government to deploy all of its rich security machinery towards the urgent and critical task of rescuing Dr Ekpo, who is not only a citizen but also an employee of Government, kidnapped in the line of duty, right at his place of duty, as assigned to him by government.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, the Akwa Ibom Medical Community is in a state of shock and palpable fear. In the next 48hrs, it is our hope that Dr Ekpo does return to us, failing which we may be forced to suspend medical services in the entire state so as to enable us go in search of our dear colleague, Dr Felix Ekpo,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nGovernor Of Zamfara State, Hon Bello Mohammed Matawalle, has sworn in the new Deputy Governor of the state, Senator Hassan Mohammed Gusau.\n\nDelivering his speech at the Councils Chamber, Government House, Gusau on Wednesday, the Governor said following the impeachment of the immediate past Deputy Governor by the State House of Assembly, it became imperative to fill the vacancy as provided for by section 191, subsection 3 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nAccording to him, the person who should occupy the position of Deputy Governor should be an able lieutenant, loyal, credible and politically astute and relevant.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why after a wide range of consultation across the broad political spectrum, it was agreed that distinguished Senator Hassan Mohammed Gusau should be nominated for the position of Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, to which he was just sworn in following the confirmation of the State House of Assembly,\u201d Governor Matawalle said.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cWe are grateful to Allah for guiding us to arrive at this critical decision at this crucial point in our political history. Going by the pedigree of the new Deputy Governor, most especially his excellent record of political accomplishments, his excellent interpersonal relations, his accessibility, and closeness to his political constituency, I am confident that His Excellency, Senator Hassan Mohammed Gusau is not just the right person for this enviable position but also someone that will deploy his vast experiences in our relentless pursuit of building a new Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cWhile I congratulate you for attaining this feat, let me remind you that you are taking over this onerous responsibility at a time when Zamfara State, more than any time before, needs the services of competent and capable hands to join ranks to address our myriad of challenges. As you know, the most formidable challenge before us is that of more than a decade-old banditry.\n\n\u201cAlmost 26 years since the creation of Zamfara State, we are still confronted with many issues of development that require planning and proper channelling of resources to address.\n\nApart from the blueprint drawn for the development of the State during the first administration of Jibril Bala Yakubu, the State\u2019s development has virtually remained without a roadmap. This is what informed our decision to inaugurate a committee to draw a Development Plan that will guide the development of the State in the next 25 years.\n\n\u201cAs my lieutenant, your role in the implementation of the plan and other government programmes is vital.\n\n\u201cAs a Deputy Governor, your role as defined by the constitution is to assist the Governor in discharging his functions. You are to also perform other responsibilities as might be delegated to you by the Governor. You should therefore be ready for all the challenges associated with your new responsibility.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, let me commend the State House of Assembly for staying true to the course of democracy at this critical moment in our political journey. As true democrats, they acted swiftly within the boundaries of the law to salvage our democracy and save the State from the incompetence, insubordination, and carefree attitude of the immediate past occupant of the office of the Deputy Governor.\n\n\u201cI call on the good people of our dear State to extend their usual prayers, support and cooperation to the just sworn-in Deputy Governor for him to perform as expected.\n\n\u201cAs you assume office, I pray to Allah to guide you in the course of discharging all your functions with ease and a high sense of responsibility. Thank you very much. Wassalamu Alaikum\u201d.\n\nAlleged Gross Misconduct\n\nGusau was impeached after the House received the report of a committee set up by the state\u2019s Chief Judge, Justice Kulu Aliyu.\n\nThe committee was set up to probe allegations of gross misconduct, financial fraud, and abuse of office levelled against him.\n\nThe seven-man panel was led by Retired Justice Halidu Soba and had submitted its report to the State House of Assembly complex in Gusau, the state capital.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s former President and Chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Council of the Wise (CoW), Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, has said the sub-region would not accept the five-year transition period proposed by the military government in Mali because it is too long.\n\nJonathan, who is also ECOWAS Chief Mediator on the Mali crisis, said military regimes had become an aberration in the sub-region and could no longer be tolerated.\n\nHe spoke on Tuesday in Lagos during a press conference at the end of a two-day strategic retreat of the ECOWAS Council of the Wise.\n\nJonathan stressed that the proposal for a five-year transition period for the military regime by the Malian parliament was unacceptable because the time was not only too long, but also untenable.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cIf the parliament approves that, I don\u2019t believe ECOWAS will accept it. I cannot say authoritatively because I am not the chair of the Authority of ECOWAS, but because I am the mediator, we feel that five years is too long for a transitional government. In 2012, when we had a similar experience in Mali, it was one and a half years within which elections were done, when the former speaker of parliament became the interim president.\n\n\u201cAnd within one and a half years elections were done. Niger, of course, that was 2011, when I was still head of state, when the military intervention happened, it was within 12 months, elections were conducted. We had a similar case in Burkina Faso within that period; within 12 months elections were conducted.\n\n\u201cWe believe that ECOWAS does not want any coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the sub-region anyway. But assuming it happens, we believe that the period they will hold office should not be so long.\n\n\u201cIn this February, they have spent about one and a half years already. Adding another five years is six and a half years. ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State will discuss it, but I believe ECOWAS may not accept it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to negotiate it further with them and see that they reduce it because five years plus one and a half years, that is six and a half years, it is almost two tenures of an elected government. And I think for a transitional government it does not really add up.\u201d\n\nJonathan said as part of a strategy to quicken the development of the region, ECOWAS was considering re-capitalisation of its regional bank.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe also looked at some other things, like we have recommended that the ECOWAS Bank of Investment and Development should be capitalised properly and restructured so that it will play a key role in terms of assisting people in the private sector to build small and medium scale industries across the sub-region.\n\n\u201cThat will increase the opportunity of young people getting loans to develop businesses and also create jobs for others. So we looked at other things, but basically none of these will bring immediate answer to a situation in a place like Mali. Already, the military are there and they want to stay for another five years. So that should be through negotiation, which the council of the wise will work with the commission, we will work with the Authority of Heads of State and Government to get that done.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSo when you now raise the issue of Mali parliament that have approved the five-year term transition, the parliament of Mali is a part of the government of Mali that is in operation. They are not elected members of the parliament and that is why ECOWAS parliament won\u2019t even accept them to meet with the ECOWAS parliament. Because for you to be a member of the ECOWAS parliament you must be elected by your people.\u201d\n\nHe said even though the CoW was constituted by the ECOWAS Commission as an important preventive, diplomatic, and mediation organ of the ECOWAS Peace and Security Architecture, it was not set up to immediately intervene in the security challenges facing the region.\n\nJonathan said, \u201cI want the people to know that the purpose of the council of the wise is not to immediately intervene in the security challenges we have. We have three countries being run by the military, which is an aberration in the sub-region.\n\n\u201cBut the main reason for the council of the wise is to come up with different ways that we should be doing things to reduce such infraction in our democratic setting. So that is the first.\n\n\u201cWe will also make suggestions, but the council of the wise is mainly persuasive. It is like an organ of ECOWAS that will come up with advisory programmes and policies that will help the commission and, indeed, the Authority of Heads of State and Government to handle some of these issues.\u201d\n\nJonathan said his council recommended for the region free and compulsory education for all children from primary to secondary school level as part of efforts to ensure that young people were no longer easily recruited into evil agenda.\n\nJonathan said the issue of bad leaders whose actions and inactions lead to crisis in their countries was also being looked into.",
          "summary": "He spoke on Tuesday in Lagos during a press conference at the end of a two-day strategic retreat of the ECOWAS Council of the Wise.\nJonathan stressed that the proposal for a five-year transition period for the military regime by the Malian parliament was unacceptable because the time was not only too long, but also untenable.\nThe president stated, \u201cIf the parliament approves that, I don\u2019t believe ECOWAS will accept it.\nECOWAS Authority of Heads of State will discuss it, but I believe ECOWAS may not accept it.\nThey are not elected members of the parliament and that is why ECOWAS parliament won\u2019t even accept them to meet with the ECOWAS parliament.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Citing Emergence of Previous Chairmen, Buhari Okays Consensus for APC Convention",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, met with governors elected on the platform of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), and okayed suggestions for a consensus option at the newly proposed March 26 national convention of the party.\n\nBuhari met with the APC governors at the State House, Abuja, for about 15 minutes and discussed the current state of the party and the misgivings about its national convention. He noted that all former chairmen of APC, from Chief Bisi Akande, John Odigie-Oyegun, to Adams Oshiomhole, emerged through consensus.\n\nBut Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, dismissed insinuations that the 22 governors of APC and the Anambra State Deputy Governor were sharply divided over the date of the national convention, saying they merely disagreed. El-Rufai, who spoke with newsmen after the APC governors\u2019 meeting with Buhari, however, noted that the governors had disagreed over the timing of the national convention, as some were of the belief that there were many unresolved issues. But he contended that they were all now on the same page.\n\nEl-Rufai said APC had adopted a formula, which was embraced by the leadership of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during its convention. Under the plan, APC would allow its northern and southern members swap positions from the ones held by the previous National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nJudging by the copy of the zoning formula obtained by THISDAY last night, APC had resolved to have its national chairman come from the North-central, while conceding the office of National Secretary to the South-west.\n\nDespite its recent challenges, Chairman of Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum and Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, allayed concerns that the ruling party might collapse after Buhari\u2019s tenure. Lalong believed APC would be stronger after the incumbent president.\n\nEl-Rufai, who was fielding questions from State House correspondents, said the governors had disagreed over the timing of the convention, because, \u201cThere were some governors that felt we should put off the convention until we resolve all the congress issues in some states.\n\n\u201cAs you know, in some states, these matters are even in court. So, some governors held the view that we should wait until all these are resolved. And this is not borne out of any agenda or selfishness. It is just a realistic proposition to avoid us violating any laws or putting our party structures of elected candidates in danger.\n\n\u201cYes, there were differences in opinions about timing. Some of us are saying the constitution allows us to have convention even if three or four states have issues that are unresolved, while others are saying no, let us finish all the reconciliations and we do this convention. After all, there is no time limit for the convention as long as we do it before the time for the primaries.\n\n\u201cSo, that was the difference. This is what the media has called divided governors. In a democratic setting, there is no way you can have 22 governors plus the deputy governor of Anambra State agreeing on any issue.\n\n\u201cWe can have differences. But after our meeting of last night, to deliberate on the proposal by the national caretaker committee, and our briefing with Mr. President today, we are all on the same page.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna State governor also disclosed that APC had agreed on a zoning formula that would swap offices previously held between North and South.\n\nBy the arrangement, all offices that were occupied by northerners in the last NWC will go to the South, and vice versa, in the coming dispensation.\n\nEl-Rufai affirmed that agreement had been reached on zoning.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have agreed on a zoning formula for all the six geo-political zones. Essentially, northern zone will have the positions the south has had in the last NWC, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt is a very simple, equitable, and fair formula. We will now go back and consult at the zonal level and look at the positions that are available and the process of the convention preparation we started in earnest. So, by the grace of God, on the 26th of March, we would have done our national convention.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also after their meeting with Buhari, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, revealed that Buhari was in favour of consensus in selecting candidates for party offices.\n\nBagudu said, \u201cOn consensus, Mr. President reminded us that we have produced a number of national chairmen by consensus: Baba Akande emerged as the pioneer chairman of the party by consensus; His Excellency, John Oyegun emerged by consensus; His Excellency, Adams Oshiomhole emerged by consensus.\n\n\u201cSo, he is a believer in consensus as one of the options for producing leadership, and he urged us to explore consensus, so that we can generate a list. While recognising that many people who have indicated interest are equally competent, but knowing that just one person will occupy the office, consensus is part of our constitution, and he urged us to work towards consensus.\n\n\u201cAnd the governors, I have said earlier, have also been working to ensure that as part of equitable arrangement, zoning and consensus are incorporated. We have done that at the lower levels, and even at the national level; it\u2019s almost certain that we will achieve it.\n\n\u201cThen, the date of the convention, the caretaker committee briefed us yesterday on their meeting and the proposed March 26, 2022. And today, the governors informed Mr. President that we have heard the briefing from the caretaker committee and we are supportive of their position.\u201d\n\nBagudu explained that even though the planned zonal congresses of APC were not provided for in its constitution, the law was also not against the process.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOn proposed zonal congresses not in the constitution, I think there has been so much debate. Yesterday (Monday), there was a statement to the effect that even the letter that has gone out was withdrawn.\n\n\u201cSo, zonal congresses are not explicitly stated in the constitution, particularly, how you do zonal congresses. And we have in the past done them with national convention, but nothing again in the constitution stops them from being done outside the national convention. But the final form will be decided, given the input we have provided.\u201d\n\nAsked if the APC governors were divided, Bagudu retorted, \u201cAre governors divided? Not at all! The 22 governors of the APC are united. We are in total support of Mr. President; we are appreciative of his leadership. We commend him for his leadership.\n\n\u201cWe are appreciative of the sacrifice of the national caretaker, and extraordinary convention planning committee. And we thank them for the successes recorded under them. Our party, like I said, is greater and stronger, with more members by the day.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Lalong maintained that the ruling party would not collapse after Buhari\u2019s exit, saying, \u201cI think that from the progress report read by our chairman, and from several assumptions, and also several reports that we are seeing what tremendous efforts the federal government is doing. We are already going around commissioning projects here and there in all the various states.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, although, you are not specific as to which reason will make us not to come back again, but as far as we are concerned, based on assessment, and based on what the federal government is doing, there is every hope that this party, this government will move beyond our president and that is what he has been saying, that by the grace of God, this government will move beyond his tenure.\u201d\n\nNineteen of the 22 APC governors were in attendance at the meeting held at the Council Chambers, which also had in attendance Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; and Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.\n\nThe governors in attendance were those of Yobe, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Cross River, Kaduna, Lagos, Borno, Niger, Gombe, Osun, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Kwara, Kano, Imo, Kogi, Ogun, Plateau and Anambra\u2019s deputy governor.\n\nZoning Formula\n\nAccording to the zoning formula obtained yesterday by THISDAY, APC has zoned its chairmanship position to North-central, which implies that the presidential ticket of the party might go to the south, in addition to the office of the National Secretary, which has been given to the South-west in specific.\n\nOther positions zoned to the North-central are National Vice Chairman (NC), Deputy National Secretary, Deputy National Legal Adviser, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nAPC zoned the following positions to the South-south: National Vice Chairman (SS), National Publicity Secretary, National Women Leader, Deputy National Treasurer, Deputy National Welfare Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader\n\nThe offices zoned to the South-west are National Secretary, National Vice Chairman (South-West), National Youth Leader, Deputy National Auditor, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nFor the North-west, the positions given are National Vice Chairman (NW), National Legal Adviser, National Organising Secretary, National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Youth Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability \u2013 PWD) Leader, among others.\n\nThe party zoned the position of the Deputy National Chairman (S) to the South-east, with other offices like National Treasurer, National Welfare Secretary, Deputy National Organising Secretary, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, Zonal Organising Secretary, Zonal Women Leader, and Zonal Special (Persons with Disability- PWD) Leader.\n\nNorth-east would produce Deputy National Chairman (N), National Auditor, National Vice Chairman (NW), Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy National Women Leader, Zonal Secretary, Zonal Youth Leader, among others.\n\nInterestingly, the zoning plan has tactically knocked out a former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; former Governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; former Governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; and Sunny Monidafe.\n\nThe chairmanship aspirants favoured by the method are the senator representing Niger East, Mohammed Musa; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; and former governors of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura and Abdudulahi Adamu.\n\nBuni Threatens to Resign\n\nBut while APC may have succeeded in dousing the raging issues over its national convention, a new problem seems to be developing.\n\nAn insider told THISDAY last night that the chairman of the caretaker committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, had threatened to resign his position, citing accusations of inefficiency from many APC governors accused.\n\nThe source said regarding Buni, \u201cWhile some of the governors were ready to grab his resignation, others cautioned that accepting his resignation would draw the party back. And on the basis of that, the governors encouraged him to continue until the national convention is held.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the governors and the president agreed to swap offices between North and South, THISDAY gathered that the leaders of the party specifically agreed that the national chairman should go to the North-central.\n\nAccording to the source, while the party\u2019s leaders agreed on consensus option in electing the national officers, the governors agreed that the president should be given the privilege to pick the national chairman.\n\nThus, ahead of the national convention on March 26, the meeting yesterday also agreed to hold national caucus meeting to resolve all pending issues.\n\nAPC EXTRAORDINARY NATIONAL CONVENTION 2022\n\nZONING OF NATIONAL OFFICES\n\nSOUTH-SOUTH:\n\n(Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River,\n\nDelta, Edo and Rivers States)\n\n1.

          "text": "Nigeria and Iraq have said the strategy employed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, OPEC+, to gradually raise oil production is enough to balance the market.\n\nBoth countries insisted that there was no need for OPEC to be more aggressive, despite crude oil surge this year to almost $100 a barrel.\n\nThe 23-nation alliance, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, would meet on March 2 to decide the next line of action in terms of the amount of oil it expected members to pump in April.\n\nBloomberg quoted Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, as maintaining that the international cartel would not need to take any unplanned barrels to the market, stressing that the current plan perfectly serves the market as it is.\n\nSylva told reporters at an event in Doha, Qatar, according to Bloomberg, \u201cWe won\u2019t do anything extraordinary at this time because we are expecting a lot of production from outside of OPEC+.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere\u2019s no need at all to bring on more barrels than the current plan. We are expecting more production if a nuclear deal with Iran works out (since) there will be production from them.\u201d\n\nSeveral of OPEC+\u2019s biggest producers want to continue to add 400,000 barrels a day of crude to the market each month, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn addition, Iraq\u2019s Ihsan Jabbar said OPEC and its partners would make their decision for April at the March meeting, after reviewing fresh data on supply and demand.\n\nThe comments came even as Brent crude rose 2.3 per cent to $97.60 a barrel, extending this year\u2019s jump to 26 per cent.\n\nTuesday\u2019s gain occurred after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced he was recognising two self-proclaimed separatist republics in Ukraine.\n\nIraq\u2019s energy minister, Jabbar, said OPEC was factoring in growth in output from non-OPEC+ members, such as Brazil and Canada, and did not want to see any increase in commercially-stored oil around the world.\n\n\u201cThe market will have more and more oil so we think there\u2019s no need\u201d to deviate from today\u2019s strategy, Jabbar said in an interview in Qatar, where he was attending a natural gas conference, together with Sylva and others.\n\n\u201cWe will not create any growth to the commercial storage. We will secure all the demand by making the required supply,\u201d he added.\n\nRussia, a major oil and gas producer, plans to send \u201cpeacekeeping forces\u201d to the Ukrainian region in a dramatic escalation of the on-going conflict. Moscow has consistently denied having plans to invade Ukraine.\n\nSome major oil importers have called on OPEC+ to pump faster and put pressure on the likes of Saudi Arabia to use up some of their spare capacity.\n\nJabbar said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d for any OPEC+ state to raise output beyond its quota, despite many members struggling to reach theirs.\n\nNigeria has been struggling to meet its OPEC allocation for months and has as much as 300,000 barrels per day deficit, mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure and sabotage as well as technical reasons.\n\nDespite the over 1.7 million barrels\u2019 output allowed by the organisation, the country has managed to increase production to about 1.4 million, going by the latest OPEC review.\n\nAlthough there are issues surrounding the sustainability of the current upward trend of the country\u2019s supply to the global market, it is seen as a good sign for the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nLast week, the International Agency Energy Agency (IEA), which advises rich countries, said OPEC+ was pumping almost one million barrels a day below its target.\n\n\u201cWe have come from the recovery from COVID,\u201d the Iraqi minister said.\n\n\u201cIt is not fair that you will give the increase just for some countries,\u201d he added.\n\nIraq undershot its output target last month because of bad weather at ports, Jabbar said. The country should meet its quota for February of around 4.3 million barrels a day, he noted.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive of Vitol, one of the world\u2019s biggest oil traders, expects oil prices to climb to $100 and remain at that level for an extended period of time.\n\nThis bullish prediction, he said, was driven by a belief that global demand would surge in the second half of the year and could surpass 100 million barrels per day.\n\nOn the supply side, he said it was the fear of shrinking spare production capacity and restraint from US shale that was driving oil prices higher. Oil prices will go higher, and they would stay there for an extended period of time, said the chief executive of Vitol, Russell Hardy.\n\n\u201cThe 100 million-barrel number is probably going to be exceeded this year,\u201d Hardy told Bloomberg, adding, \u201cDemand is going to surge in the second half.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, demand for crude this year could surpass 100 million barrels daily.\n\nLike many others, Vitol\u2019s chief executive noted that the imbalance in global oil markets was fuelling inflation and threatening to interfere with the recovery of the global economy from the fallout of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, more oil does not seem to be coming, as the US and European super majors are focusing on shareholder returns instead of production growth, and national oil companies in the OPEC+ countries are sticking to their original plan of adding 400,000 bpd to total production every month.\n\n\u201cEventually we\u2019re going to run out of spare capacity. That\u2019s what the market is trying to work out,\u201d Hardy noted.\n\nMajor Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley, had already recently predicted that prices would hit $100 a barrel.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",
