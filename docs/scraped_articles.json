          "text": "THE lawmaker representing Ethiope East/Ethiope West Federal Constituency in Delta State at the House of Representatives, Mr Ben Igbakpa, on Tuesday, lamented his alleged maltreatment by security agents at an airport in Ghana over the comment made by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on sponsorship of secessionist agitations in Nigeria.\n\nIgbakpa, during the plenary, said the Ghanaian Government had issued a red alert ever since Buhari said sponsors of the agitations included a member of the National Assembly.\n\nBuhari had in his nationwide broadcast to Nigerians to mark the Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence anniversary on Friday, said ongoing investigations revealed a serving member of the National Assembly as one of the high-profile financiers of the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu; and the Yoruba nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday Igboho.\n\nIgbakpa said, \u201cOn that fateful day, I went to Akure to be part of the burial ceremony of our colleague, Honourable \u2018Expensive.\u2019 On Saturday, I had to honour an invitation to Ghana for a wedding. Mr Speaker, it would amaze you what I faced in the hands of Ghanaian officials. They detained me for about four hours; that they were trying to confirm something.\n\n\u201cI stayed at the airport for four hours, missed the wedding I went for and at the end of the day, one of them walked up to me saying, \u2018Sorry sir, there is an announcement in Nigeria that a member of parliament is sponsoring terrorism and we are put on red alert to ensure that no member of parliament comes here to hide or cause trouble\u2019. I had to come back home dejected.\n\n\u201cThey have been calling me all over the world. My friends have been asking me, \u2018who among you is that person sponsoring terrorism?\u2019 The right thing for a father to do is to name and shame any child that is bringing about division.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling, the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, said, \u201cHonourable Ben, your privilege is noted and we will get back to you on that.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

He was approached, no doubt but his political choice is clearly spelled out and it does not involve seeking the chairmanship position of his party.\u201d\n\nAsked if the former Kwara State governor would again contest the Presidency, he said, \u201cit is a road he has travelled before. He will do it again if a level playfield is provided for interested persons to play the game.\u201d\n\nSaraki, in the past few months, has taken ample opportunity of his nationwide tours as chairman of the PDP Reconciliation and Strategy Committee to build bridges not only for the party but also for himself ahead of 2023.\n\nA former governor of one of the North-Central states and fellow National Executive Committee, NEC member told our correspondent that all Saraki needs to test the waters again was \u201cif the Presidential race is open to all irrespective of geopolitical origins.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSaraki did well in the last Presidential convention. He is even better prepared now than a few years ago. So, if a conducive atmosphere is created to allow interested persons to participate, I can guarantee with a certain level of certainty that he will be there.\n\n\u201cDo not forget that most of the aggrieved people he is wooing to the party are also telling him not to give up. You can\u2019t betray this level of confidence people have in you if you want to go far in politics,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, serving and former governors of the PDP are pushing a consensus arrangement that would see Mark emerged unopposed. This, Vanguard gathered, is to avoid the hostile environment created in 2017 when close to a dozen aspirants vied for the chairmanship at the Eagles Square, Abuja.\n\nThe hostilities eventually led to the exit of prominent PDP members including Professors Jerry Gana, Tunde Adeniran, Taofik Adedoja, and Rasheed Ladoja from the party.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

That road is too strategic to be left in a deplorable condition. It connects South East with Akwa Ibom and Calabar. It also leads to a lot of federal institutions \u2013 MOUAU; Research Crop Institute, and others.\n\n\u201d State doesn\u2019t have the capacity to repair it. It is a very busy and important road with heavy traffic flow. It can no longer be managed. It requires total rehabilitation. The federal government should come to our rescue because it\u2019s a federal road.\u201d\n\nThe former governor decried the continued loss of lives and property on the road as a result of its bad condition which he said \u201cis taking a toll\u201d on his constituents and other road users.\n\n\u201cI am greatly pained over the ordeals of my constituents who on daily basis have bitter experiences on the road.\u201d\n\nSenator Orji expressed his deep condolences to the family of the deceased MOUAU student as well as the university community.\n\nWhile appealing for calm, the former governor promised to sustain his pressure on the federal government until the road is rehabilitated to end the ordeals of the road users.",

          "text": "By Okodili Ndidi, Abuja\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe November 6 Anambra governorship election will proceed as scheduled despite the deteriorating security situation in the State, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has vowed.\n\nAccording to the Commission, available intelligence revealed that the intention of those attacking its offices and other public institutions in the State is to ensure that the governorship election does not hold.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, stated this at the emergency meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES).\n\nHe noted that the importance of election security in a governorship election has never been this urgent.\n\nYakubu however warmed that should INEC again lose vital materials and facilities, the ongoing preparations for the election will be adversely affected.\n\nRead Also: INEC insists on deployment of technology for Anambra election\n\nAccording to him: \u201cFrom the reports we have received, the stated goal of many of the attackers is that the Governorship election scheduled for 6th November 2021 must not hold.\n\n\u201cThis is worrisome for the Commission. We are deeply concerned that specific electoral facilities and materials could once more become targets of attack. Recall that in May this year, our State Office at Awka was attacked and all the non-sensitive materials assembled for the election at the time were destroyed. In addition, our store, collation centre and the main office building were either totally or substantially damaged.

Security agencies, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Poverty Eradication Programme, among others, are expected to get hundreds of billions of Naira in the revised version.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cThe FGN Aggregate Expenditure (including GOEs and Project-tied Loans) is projected to increase by N2.47 trillion, from N13.98 trillion to N16.45 trillion.\n\nCommenting on the size of the 2022 budget, Dr Muda Yusuf, Economist and CEO\n\nCentre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), said it is a reflection of the fact that government expenditure had continued to grow over these years. The clamour for a reduction in the cost of governance has not yielded much result. The implication is that budget deficit would continue to grow, so will our debt stock.\n\nBut we, however need to be reminded that these are nominal figures. If we discount for inflation, the increase may not be as high as it looks. Nonetheless, there is need to check expenditure growth, especially with regard to recurrent spending.\n\nAlso reacting, Chairman, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Apapa branch, Frank Onyebu, noted\n\n\u201cMy candid advice is that government should assemble a more robust, more diverse economic team, a team with an in-depth knowledge of an evolving economy like ours. This team should consist of the best in the various sectors of the economy \u2013 people who have the capacity to add value, and not just people with political leanings.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Anambra 2021: INEC, NSA raise fresh alarm over deteriorating security",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the National Security Adviser (NSA) have expressed concerns over what it described as the deteriorating security situation in Anambra State ahead of the November 6 governorship election.\n\nThe Chairman of the Commission, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, who raised the alarm during an emergency meeting with the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) held on Tuesday, in Abuja, emphasised that various security reports have confirmed that the prime motive of the attackers is to scuttle the election.\n\nHe further noted that the adhoc staff on election duty, comprising members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and undergraduates, need strong assurances of their safety during and after the election.\n\n\u2018You would recall that during our last quarterly meeting held on September 9, 2021, we received briefings and reviewed preparations for the forthcoming Anambra State governorship election. You may also recall that a major concern raised by members was the security situation in the state in particular and the adjoining States in general and how this might affect preparations and possibly the conduct of the election.\n\n\u2018Unfortunately, the situation has deteriorated markedly since our last meeting. Many innocent lives have been lost and property destroyed. From the reports we have received, the stated goal of many of the attackers is that the governorship election scheduled for November 6 must not hold. This is worrisome for the Commission.\n\n\u2018We are deeply concerned that specific electoral facilities and materials could once more become targets of attack. Recall that in May this year, our state office in Awka was attacked and all the non-sensitive materials assembled for the election at the time were destroyed. In addition, our store, collation centre and the main office building were either totally or substantially damaged. The Commission also lost several vehicles to be used for the election.\n\n\u2018Happily, we have almost fully recovered from that attack. The destroyed buildings have either been completely repaired or are nearing completion and we have fully replaced the materials destroyed. This rapid recovery has only been possible because this is an off-season election.\n\n\u2018We have sourced some of these materials such as the 326 electric generators and vehicles destroyed in the attack from neighbouring States. However, should we again lose vital materials and facilities, the ongoing preparations will be adversely affected,\u2019 he said.\n\nCommenting on the safety of the adhoc staff, the election management boss, said: \u2018The Commission is particularly concerned about the safety of voters and Election Day staff, including security officials who have also become the targets of these attacks.\n\n\u2018The thousands of young Nigerians that we intend to deploy for the election, most of them corps members and university students, need to be reassured of their personal safety. At the same time, deployment for the election will involve the movement of huge consignments of sensitive and non-sensitive materials to the 21 Local Government Areas of the State, 326 Wards or Registration Areas and 5,720 Polling Units.\n\n\u2018That means over 6,000 locations to be protected. If we add that to about 26,000 officials that will be deployed for the election, we begin to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge of securing the Anambra governorship election which is only thirty-two (32) days from today,\u2019 he said.\n\nWhile expressing more concerns, Prof Mahmood noted: \u2018Perhaps, never before in our history has the importance of election security in a governorship election been this urgent. The Commission is aware that this is by no means an easy task. We appreciate the enormous challenges that the security agencies are presently facing in Anambra State, which entail not only securing the electoral process, but also enforcing law and order generally. This is particularly worrisome because the security agencies have also become prime targets of these mindless attacks.\n\n\u2018It is in the light of these recent and seemingly escalating threats to the election that the Commission has convened this emergency meeting. We will continue to work with the security agencies and in consultation with respected opinion leaders in Anambra State and the National Peace Committee to ensure that these hit-and-run attacks do not derail the electoral process.\n\n\u2018We wish to assure the people of Anambra State that the Commission is determined to proceed with the election as scheduled. To underscore this determination, the Commission is implementing two more activities on the timetable for the election in the next few days. The register of voters will be presented to political parties in Awka on Thursday. On the same day, the Commission will publish the final list of candidates for the election.\n\n\u2018We are confident that at the end of this meeting, we will firm up on specific measures necessary to further guarantee the safety of all persons involved in the election from the voters, election officials, observers, media organisations and the security of election materials,\u2019 he assured.\n\nIn his comment, the NSA, Babagana Monguno, equally reiterated the commitment of the federal government to crush the activities of the separatist groups.\n\nRepresented by Sanusi Galadima, during the emergency meeting, he said: \u2018As we are all aware the Anambra State governorship Election, is barely one month away and the security threat posed by violent activities of separatist groups in the South East region are bent on scuffling the election in the state in furtherance of their separatist agenda. Undoubtedly, this constitute a clear and present danger to the nation democratic process and consolidation.\n\n\u2018I wish to state that ONSA, is working assiduously with relevant security and intelligence agencies towards arresting the foregoing ugly trend and other associated security challenges in the South-East zone and beyond.\n\n\u2018This determination of the presidency is already been translated into action by the recent joint Military operation code-named \u201cGolden Dawn\u201d in the South-East as well as other security operations across the country.\n\n\u2018This is in addition to the increasing collaboration between the federal and South East Governors towards addressing the underlying socio economic drivers of insecurity in the region.\n\n\u2018Once again, ONSA wish to reiterate the federal government commitment for the protection of lives and property of all law abiding citizens before during and after the elections, while, finally calling on all peace-loving Nigerians of the South East extraction to join hands with constituted authority to promote peace and development across the region and beyond,\u2019 he appealed.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022Sanwo-Olu reiterates demand for special status\n\n\u2022Says prosperity of Lagos has multiplier effect on S\u2019West, Nigeria\n\nSegun James\n\nLagos State Government yesterday demanded one per cent share in the federal revenue allocation formula, maintaining that the state\u2019s unique features and its prosperity bear on development in the South-west and Nigeria, generally.\n\nThe government canvassed a special status designation for Lagos State, and proposed that the revenue sharing formula should be 34 per cent for the federal government, one per cent for the Federal Capital Territory, 42 per cent for state governments, 23 per cent for local governments, and one per cent for Lagos State (Special Status). This is against the current revenue allocation formula, which gives the federal government 52.68 per cent, the 36 state governments 26.72 per cent, and the 774 local governments 20.60 per cent.\n\nThe Lagos State government\u2019s demands were made by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the opening of a two-day South-west zonal public hearing on review of the revenue allocation formula, organised in Lagos by the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC).\n\nIn a memorandum on review of revenue allocation formula, which he submitted to the RMAFC, Sanwo-Olu declared that allocating one per cent to Lagos State (Special Status) and allowing the three tiers of government to share 99 per cent in a new revenue sharing formula was straightforward, self-justifying and in no way controversial. He said the review of the current revenue allocation formula was long overdue, stressing that the best way to guarantee national progress and development is to pay attention to sub-national development since the national is a summation of the sub-national.\n\nThe governor reiterated the call for Lagos State to be accorded special status in recognition of its huge financial commitments to infrastructure and provision of basic amenities for the increasing population of residents, as well as its preeminent contribution to the national coffers. He said the call, which had been re-echoed at different forums, could not be overemphasised, especially against the backdrop of the current economic situation of the country, the aftermath of the EndSARS protests, and the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, for which Lagos had been the national epicentre.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cOur demand is a sharing formula that is just, fair and equitable; reflecting the contribution of stakeholders to the common purse; and also one that enhances the capacity of state and local governments to deliver high-quality services and the full dividends of democracy to the greatest number of our people.\n\n\u201cLagos State is, no doubt, the nation\u2019s commercial capital, and population centre. The level of funding required to service the state\u2019s social and public infrastructure is so significant that it will be difficult for the state to bear the burden for much longer under the present arrangement.\n\n\u201cI should say that it will actually be unfair to expect the state to bear this heavy burden on its own. It is, therefore, necessary to give due consideration to all the variables that support our advocacy for a special status.\n\n\u201cThe call for a special status for Lagos is not a selfish proposition; it is in the best interest of the country and all Nigerians, for Lagos which accounts for about 20 per cent of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and about 10 per cent of the nation\u2019s population to continue to prosper.\u201d\n\nFurther defending the demand for special status, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos was more than just another state in the Nigerian federation, saying there is no tribe in the country without significant stake in the state.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cAs the former capital of the country for 77 years (compared to the 30 years that Abuja has been the Federal Capital Territory), Nigeria\u2019s largest metropolis still bears the heavy brunt of being home to all Nigerians; irrespective of age, class, gender, religious affiliation or tribe.\n\n\u201cThere are several statistics that show the number of people that come into Lagos every day, however, there are clear indications that most of these people migrate with the intention to make Lagos their new home and in pursuit of personal dreams due to the opportunities the city-state seemingly possesses, and this portends additional responsibilities on the government.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, Lagos still harbours a huge number of federal establishments, which could not be moved to Abuja. These include military cantonments and barracks, Police, Customs, Immigration, Civil Defence, Prisons, Road Safety and security/intelligence establishments.\n\n\u201cThere are several reasons to justify the call for a special status for Lagos apart from the aforementioned factors and by extension, a review of the Revenue Allocation Sharing Formula.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu also said it would be unfair for Lagos to be left alone to bear the burden of the massive destruction experienced by the state during the EndSARS protests, which were hijacked by hoodlums, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis month marks one year after the massive destruction experienced by the state in the violence that accompanied the hijacking of the EndSARS protests. Public buildings were burnt down, and historical infrastructure destroyed.\n\n\u201cAlthough, we have put that experience behind us and forged ahead, the reality of this unfortunate incident remains with us; resources that should be committed to other areas of need are now being used for the restoration of these public facilities. It will be totally unfair for Lagos State to be left alone to bear these huge expenses without assistance from the centre.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 pandemic is another issue that has once again, supported the justification for Lagos to be accorded the privilege of a special status. As much as this affects the entire country, it is a fact that the degree of havoc caused by this virus differs from state to state.\n\n\u201cLagos was the epicentre for this virus, the same way it was for the Ebola virus some years ago. The management of these unforeseen occurrences comes with huge responsibilities and financial commitments on the part of the state government.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu commended the chairman and members of RMAFC for taking the bold step of reviewing the revenue allocation method, which he believed would, \u201cresult in a fundamental alteration of the current revenue sharing formula, in favour of one that is truly fair and equitable, and that takes into full consideration the specific and more pragmatic fiscal contexts of the sub-national governments of the federation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urge FG to constitute NDDC board by law, demand forensic audit report be made public\n\n\u2022Set to commission regional security outfit\n\n\u2022S\u2019East govs, leaders to meet over rising insecurity\n\n\u2022Obi: Situation is disheartening\n\n\u2022Gunmen enforcing stay-at-home order set tricycle ablaze in Enugu\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja, David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka, Gideon Arinze in Enugu and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nSouth-south Governors Forum, yesterday, declared support for states\u2019 collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) as ordered by a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt. The forum, comprising governors of the six oil-rich Niger Delta states of Rivers, Edo, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Cross River, and Delta, made the declaration after a closed-door meeting at Government House, Port Harcourt.\n\nThe governors\u2019 decision to join the suit currently before the Supreme Court was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 presented to newsmen by Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nThe forum urged that in constituting the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), the federal government should follow the law establishing the commission. They demanded that the NDDC forensic audit report should be made public.\n\nThe governors regretted the federal government\u2019s failure to honour an understanding regarding the relocation of the headquarters of subsidiaries of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the international oil companies (IOCs) to the Niger Delta. They called for the completion of federal projects in the region.\n\nThe governors said they had established a regional security outfit that would be launched soon, adding that the National Assembly, in amending the Petroleum Industrial Act, should seriously consider the interest of the communities hosting the oil and gas activities.\n\nIn a related development, governors and leaders of the five South-east states scheduled an emergency meeting today to address rising insecurity in the zone. That was as former governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, decried the level of insecurity in the zone, describing the situation as disheartening.\n\nBut former National Publicity Secretary of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party\n\n(PDP), Chief Olisa Metuh, said the South-east leaders should demand at their meeting the release of detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, saying this is a sure step towards tackling the security challenges in the zone.\n\nThe situation in the zone remained tense yesterday, as gunmen enforcing a weekly stay-at-home order set ablaze a tricycle in Enugu State for disobeying the order.\n\nSouth-south Governors\u2019 Forum met at the conference room of Rivers State Government House, Port Harcourt, and the meeting was chaired by Okowa, with the governors of Rivers, Bayelsa, Edo, Bayelsa, and Akwa Ibom in attendance. The governor of Cross River State, Professor Ben Ayade, who recently defected from PDP to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), was absent at the gathering.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the meeting, and read by Okowa stated, \u201cAfter an extensive deliberation, Council, bearing in mind that most of the BRACED states have established their state security organs, approved the regional security architecture, which would be launched soon.\n\n\u201cUnequivocally supports the decision for states to collect Value Added Tax (VAT) and resolved to join the suit before the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cUrge the president and the National Assembly to take necessary measures to review some unfair aspects of the recently signed Petroleum Industry Bill to ensure fairness and equity. It urged that the amendment should include a clear definition of host communities and that the trustees should be appointed by state governments.\n\n\u201cCalled upon the president and the federal government to uphold the law establishing the Niger Delta Development Commission by appropriately constituting its Board. In addition, it expressed the hope that the federal government would make the forensic audit report public and deal justly and fairly with the report with a view to strengthening the capacity of the NDDC to meet its obligations to the people of the region.\n\n\u201cRegretted that the president and the federal government had generally failed to give reasoned consideration to requests made by the region during the dialogue with a special federal delegation led by Professor Ibrahim Gambari, Chief of Staff to the President. Notable among the requests were the relocation of NNPC subsidiaries and IOCs headquarters to the Niger Delta and the completion of a number of federal projects in the region, notably, roads.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the South-east governors and leaders meeting holding today at Enugu State Government House would be expected to discuss measures to address the lingering security challenges in the zone. Recent escalations in the security crisis had led to several deaths, including the killing of renowned medical doctor and widower of the late Professor Dora Akunyili, former director-general of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dr. Chike Akunyili, in Anambra State. The governors were also expected to discuss the prolonged incarceration of Kanu.\n\nA memo sent to newsmen by the Ebonyi State Governor and Chairman, South-east Governors\u2019 Forum, David Umahi, showed that the leaders would reach some decisions to salvage the region currently battling high insecurity.\n\nUmahi appealed to the governors and other leaders from the zone to endeavour to be present and not in a representative capacity.\n\nHe wrote in the memo, \u201cYour Excellences and our highly esteemed leaders, in consultation with our governors and President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, where a decision for an urgent meeting to be called was reached, may I therefore invite you for an emergency meeting of South-east governors, some leaders of Ohaneze, some of our political leaders, some of our religious leaders, and some of our traditional leaders.\u201d\n\nObi, worried about the situation in the zone, said there was need for an urgent stakeholders meeting to discuss salient issues pertaining to the wave of violence in the region. In a news release by his media aide, Mr Valentine Obienyem, the governor called on the different political, religious, traditional leaders, and other stakeholders of South-east to come together and tackle the monster of insecurity currently contending with the peace of the region and the unity of the Igbo.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe can no longer sit and wish away the unacceptable killings and violence raging through our region. We, Igbos, are not known for violence and disrespect for human lives and must not allow the urge for bloodbath to creep in among us. The sit-at-home order that has persisted in the South-east heavily bears down on the regional economy.\n\n\u201cThe urgent need for stakeholders meeting is, therefore, inevitable. This is the time for every leader in the region to unite and, in unity, address the challenges of insecurity facing us, before we are all consumed.\u201d\n\nObi reminded south easterners that crime fighting required collective efforts, urging them to remain committed to the peace and development of the region. He encouraged them to eschew crime and pursue productive ventures that will better their lives and bring development to society.\n\nOn his part, Metuh submitted that the release of Kanu would not only douse tension in the region but also put an end to allegations and counter-allegations regarding those behind the escalated insecurity in the zone and give the security agencies a clearer cue to track down the perpetrators.\n\nA statement by Metuh said, \u201cThis call is coming on the backdrop of denials by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) of involvement in the recent killings, arson and other acts of violence in the South-east; and particularly in the face of allegations that the attacks were being sponsored by external, political and criminal interests.\n\n\u201cThe authorities should, therefore, use the release of Nnamdi Kanu to eliminate the current puzzlement and complications as well as a political solution for situations that constitute unrest in the South-east.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, imperative for our governors and leaders to use this meeting to impress it on the federal government to adopt a political approach by releasing Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d\n\nMetuh reiterated that Kanu, \u201can Igbo man and our son, has not stolen nor has he killed anyone and, hence, we must stand for him as our son.\u201d\n\nHowever, Metuh urged the youth in the zone not to allow themselves to be used by criminal and political elements to destroy the region for their selfish interests.\n\n\u201cWe must all be vigilant, circumspect in our utterances and place our hands on the deck for solutions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stay-at-home order continued in the South-east, though, IPOB had repeatedly said the exercise had been suspended.\n\nStreets and major roads in Enugu were deserted in compliance with the order, which many residents have condemned and told IPOB to seek other ways of protesting the detention of Kanu. The threat driving the order was intensified yesterday, when some gunmen set ablaze a tricycle, alleging that the owner flouted the order.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Operation to target militants, bandits, armed robbers, others\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi\n\nThe 81 Division of the Nigerian Army on Monday launched Operation Still Waters, a joint operation aimed at combating kidnapping, armed robbery, banditry and other crimes within Lagos and Ogun States which are its Areas of Responsibility (AOR).\n\nAt the launch in Lagos, troops deployed for the exercise were charged to be ruthless with criminals disturbing the peace and security of both states.\n\nHowever, they were mandated to respect the rights of law abiding citizens and adhere to the rules of engagement guiding the field exercise.\n\nAccording to the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division, Major General Lawrence Fejokwu, residents of both states should expect increased military presence both during the day and at night till December 23 when the exercise would be concluded.\n\nHe said during Operation Still Waters, formerly codenamed Exercise Crocodile Smile, troops were expected to practice what they had learnt in the classrooms to better prepare them on how to tackle criminal elements.\n\nFejokwu said: \u201cWe have rules of engagement therefore, lawful citizens have nothing to fear but if we find criminals in the course of conducting the exercise, we will deal with them accordingly.\n\n\u201cThere would be increased military movement by day and night and I urge law abiding citizens to go about their business without any fear.\n\n\u201cAll we are trying to do is to work in synergy, carryout rehearsals and be sure of what we want to do so that when we have to conduct raids in the future such as cordon and search operations, all services will be on the same page and we will do it together the way it should be done because we have rehearsed it and because we know what each service ought to do in any given situation.\n\n\u201cIf we also have the security agencies on the street conducting exercises it would go a long way at deterring criminal activities in our society.\n\n\u201cWe expect hightened security awareness and that citizens in the course of this exercise can report any case to the nearest field location which are evenly distributed in the state. We are using our gun boats to patrol the waterways and deploying our own soldiers on the banks of so many jetties.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Commander 9 Brigade, Brigadier General Lander Saraso said the participating troops have been briefed to be friendly, civil with law abiding civilians but deal ruthlessly with criminals terrorising the society, within the ambit of the law.\n\nHe said the exercise would practice the troops in certain aspects of counter terrorism/counter insurgency operations in the states, adding that its headquarters was sited at the Digital Bridge Institute, Oshodi, because it was close to some identified flash points such as Oshodi Isale.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is designed to curtail the activities of militants, bandits armed robbers, cultists, hoodlums, illegal oil bunkers and the likes within Lagos and environs.\n\n\u201cRecent intelligence report available revealed unprecedented wave of criminalities going on within our environs with criminal elements who have taken over some communities to perpetuate their criminal acts.\n\n\u201cIn spite of efforts of security agencies, these criminal elements have continued to engage in criminal activities such as kidnapping, armed banditry, militancy, cultism and other violent criminalities within the city of Lagos.\n\n\u201cIn view of these criminal activities and as it is customary in the Nigerian Army, the brigade was tasked to conduct this exercise to curtail these criminal activities in conjunction with other sister services and security agencies as we approach the yuletide season.\n\n\u201cThe concept of the exercise involves the physical deployment of troops in the field from where this troops are going to be dispatched from time to time to conduct real time patrols against criminal elements within the environment.\n\n\u201cThe exercise is intended to achieve the following objectives: To practice units and sub-units under command on the concept of forward operation bases and brigade headquarters in the field; test the unit and sub-unit commanders in battle procedure and decision making processes regarding deployment of weapons and assets in internal security operations.\n\n\u201cTest commanders and staff at the brigade level including combat support and combat service support elements in the act and conduct of logistical operations and combat support service procedures in internal security operations; test ability of troops on communication skills and communication security in an operational environment.\n\n\u201cTest unit and sub unit commanders aspect of counter terrorism and counter insurgency operation, and test unit and sub unit commanders on inter service core operation and cooperation with other sister agencies in military operations other than war\u2026\u201d he said.\n\nSaraso said the ability of unit and sub unit commanders to handle the press during internal operations would also be tested, adding that they would be exposed to the levels of service support available to them at the tactical level.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We are deeply concerned that specific electoral facilities and materials could once more become targets of attack.\n\n\u201cWe wish to assure the people of Anambra state that the commission is determined to proceed with the election as scheduled.\n\n\u201cTo underscore this determination, the commission is implementing two more activities on the timetable for the election in the next few days. The register of voters will be presented to political parties in Awka on Thursday, 7th October 2021. On the same day, the commission will publish the final list of candidates for the election.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that at the end of this meeting, we will firm up on specific measures necessary to further guarantee the safety of all persons involved in the election from the voters, election officials, observers, media organisations and the security of election materials.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYakubu said the commission is already recovering from the attack it suffered in Akwa when one of its offices was attacked by gunmen in May.\n\n\u201cHappily, we have almost fully recovered from that attack. The destroyed buildings have either been completely repaired or are nearing completion and we have fully replaced the materials destroyed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis rapid recovery has only been possible because this is an off-season election. We have sourced some of these materials such as the 326 electric generators and vehicles destroyed in the attack from neighbouring states.\n\n\u201cHowever, should we again lose vital materials and facilities, the ongoing preparations will be adversely affected. This is particularly worrisome because the security agencies have also become prime targets of these mindless attacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the same time, deployment for the election will involve the movement of huge consignments of sensitive and non-sensitive materials to the 21 local government areas (LGAs) of the state, 326 wards or registration areas and 5,720 polling units. That means over 6,000 locations to be protected.\n\n\u201cIf we add that to about 26,000 officials that will be deployed for the election, we begin to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge of securing the Anambra governorship election which is only 32 days from today.\u201d",

          "text": "The family of Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has for many years secretly owned a web of offshore companies in Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and other tax havens, according to a new leak of documents known as the \u201cPandora Papers\u201d.\n\nThe Kenyattas have dominated Kenyan politics since the country\u2019s independence in 1963. In addition to the vast political power amassed over the decades, they are believed to be one of the richest families in the country \u2013 with significant interests in the financial services, hospitality, agriculture, and media sectors.\n\nIn 2018, President Kenyatta told the BBC \u2013 while stating his intention to fight corruption and promote transparency \u2013 that his family\u2019s wealth was known to the public, and that he had declared his assets as required by law.\n\nHowever, secret offshore assets belonging to the Kenyattas have been uncovered by an investigation published on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Finance Uncovered, Africa Uncensored, and other news organisations.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe secrets were discovered from almost 12 million documents from the archives of 14 law firms and agencies that specialise in offshore company formations. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and processed by more than 600 journalists, as part of a global investigation that\u2019s taken around two years.\n\nSeven members of the Kenyatta family, including the president, are revealed, through the Pandora Papers, as being variously connected to more than 10 offshore companies and foundations. The Kenyattas\u2019 offshore investments include a company with stocks and bonds worth $30 million.\n\nLargest-ever leak\n\nThe Pandora Papers represent the latest and largest, by data volume, in a series of major leaks of financial data about the offshore world over the last five years.\n\nIn 2016, the Panama Papers, which consisted of 2.6 terabytes of data, leaked from the law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The following year saw the release of the Paradise Papers, worth 1.4 terabytes of data.\n\nContaining 2.94 terabytes, the Pandora Papers is the largest of the three leaks. The files come from a much wider array of offshore providers than previous leaks, with locations ranging from Vietnam, Belize, and Singapore, to the Bahamas and Seychelles.\n\nThe papers expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state. Other world leaders named in the Pandora Papers include Gabon\u2019s President Ali Bongo Ondimba; President of Congo-Brazzaville, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nLinks were found between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including ministers, judges, mayors, and military generals from 117 countries.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars, and business leaders.\n\nThe global offshore economy enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and, in some cases, pay little or no tax. Also, many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts, as well as hidden bank accounts and art. For politicians, these help them loot state resources.\n\nOther African countries featured\n\nUp to 10 Nigerian politicians are implicated in the Pandora Papers, including former Anambra State governor Peter Obi, according to findings from the leaked documents. Fellow major African oil producer, Angola, has nine politicians.\n\nFive Ivorian politicians and three Ghanaian public officials were helped by foreign agents to stash money suspected to be looted away.\n\nChad, Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Congo Brazzaville have two politicians apiece, Gabon has three politicians while Mozambique has one.\n\n\u201cThese reports will go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe,\u201d President Kenyatta\u2019s spokesperson, Kanze Dena Mararo, said in response to the ICIJ Pandora Papers leaks, without contesting the allegations.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling.

          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "What do current edtech innovations mean for teachers in Africa?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNelson Mandela believed education is the most potent weapon with which one can change the world.\n\nConsequently, lack of education causes an ordinary, stagnant world, crippled and lacking in the production of human capital and innovations.\n\nWhile discussing education in Africa, one cannot help but notice the challenges that plague the sector, especially at the primary and secondary levels.\n\nIssues like overcrowded classrooms, low number of teachers, obsolete curriculums, poor compensation, and support for teachers stand out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDue to the poor conditions of most of the schools, teachers are frustrated and stressed out. A 2020 report on the drivers of teacher absenteeism in sub-Saharan Africa released by the United Nations (UN) revealed that, on average, 15.5% to 17.8% of the 3,498 teachers surveyed reported inability to work due to delayed salaries. This directly contributed to them being absent from work.\n\nThe size of a classroom, the quality of teaching materials, and the number of students matter in helping a teacher carry out their duties effectively.\n\nA United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) report predicted that sub-Saharan Africa will need about 17 million additional teachers to achieve universal primary and secondary school education by 2030 because of a severe shortage of teachers.\n\nData from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) shows that Central Africa has the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Africa at 80:1, with the lowest being 29:1 in Seychelles, compared to South Korea\u2019s 14:1 and Finland\u2019s 11:1.\n\nAway from the problems and given the right conditions, how important is a teacher\u2019s role in education?\n\nRole of teachers in the traditional education process\n\nIn the context of the conventional education process, a teacher\u2019s role goes beyond delivering a set of instructions aimed at impacting knowledge or rules to a group of learners. Teachers can be seen as mentors.\n\nTo get a comprehensive picture of the role of teachers in education, I reached out to Mrs Tina Matthew, an elementary school owner and early childhood educator who was a teacher for over a decade, to get her opinion on the subject. She believes that a teacher\u2019s role goes beyond the board and marker.\n\n\u201cTeachers are the bedrock of every profession. Their influence can determine how excited pupils are about a subject. I would say they can go as far as influencing their students/pupils view of the world. Children/learners/students can go on to find mentors, role models, friends and, in some cases, parent figures in their teachers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is why it is important that they are well paid and compensated, as this acknowledges their immense value and plays a part in inciting excitement about their jobs.\u201d\n\nProviding incentives go a long way in producing well-motivated teachers, students happy and curious about learning.\n\nIn commemoration of World Teachers Day, we look at how technology aids teachers\u2019 jobs and its role in the educational space. We also examine the responses of teachers to the use of tech in their work.\n\nEdtech in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs technology innovations have increased in Africa, the education industry has not been left out. With almost 60% of Africa\u2019s population under the age of 25 and an average literacy rate of 70%, the continent lags behind other parts of the world and is ripe for disruptions in education.\n\nHowever, edtech innovations in Africa are not so straightforward. While there is undoubtedly a huge addressable market, systemic issues make it difficult to progress in the edtech space.\n\nOne such problem is the lack of infrastructure. For edtech solutions to have any meaningful impact, the necessary infrastructure such as broadband connection must be present. This is not the case, however.\n\nBroadband penetration rates differ across different countries. In Nigeria, for example, the federal government has made attempts to aid broadband penetration in the country by waiving payment of right of way (RoW) charges on federal highways. In addition, it has encouraged states to slash these charges as high fees are a significant challenge in extending broadband coverage.\n\nHowever, only a few states have complied, meaning that broadband penetration differs across the country\u2019s 36 states.\n\nAnother critical factor is the purchasing power of consumers. In 2018, Nigeria overtook India to become the \u2018poverty capital of the world.\u2019\n\nThe situation is not different in other parts of Africa. In fact, according to a World Bank publication, except things change, at the rate Africa\u2019s population keeps growing, global poverty will become \u2018increasingly African.\u2019\n\nThe result of this is that while the total addressable market for edtech startups remains vast, the majority of this market cannot afford to buy mobile phones, laptops, or mobile data needed to access these products.\n\nInnovative entrepreneurs have risen to the challenge, providing solutions that are tailor-made to Africa\u2019s unique environment. South African edtech startup, Foondamate, for example, uses WhatsApp APIs to deliver lessons to students.\n\nTo understand why this is necessary, WhatsApp can run on most smartphones, and with most Africans accessing the Internet through mobile devices, the decision to go that route is genius.\n\nAnother startup trying its hand at tackling these challenges is uLesson. The company provides educational content for secondary school students in line with the curriculum in the countries \u2013 like Nigeria, Ghana, Gambia, United States, and United Kingdom \u2013 where they operate. The content is put in a USB dongle which can be played on any device.\n\nRecently, they introduced learning centres \u2014 places students can walk in and use provided devices to access the study materials. While it is still early days, this option could see more students use the startup\u2019s product.\n\nThe focus on building solutions primarily for students without taking into account the role of teachers is another problem that the sector is faced with. In a previous article, we argued that involving teachers in the edtech innovation process would help solve the learning problem in Nigeria.\n\nWhile the article\u2019s focus was on Nigeria, the same can be said for other countries in Africa. Fortunately, some entrepreneurs in the sector agree with that.\n\nBoye Oshinaga, CEO and Co-founder of Gradely, believes that involving teachers in the ideation process is necessary since they have lots of field experience educating children and can give valuable insights.\n\nWhile edtech startups are doing a great job, some of the challenges they face are not issues they can solve themselves.\n\nResponse of teachers to edtech\n\nThe issues raised earlier regarding poverty and infrastructural deficits mean it isn\u2019t easy to gauge how well teachers have responded to edtech innovations.\n\nHowever, our discussions with a few teachers and entrepreneurs in the edtech sector revealed that some teachers have been receptive to the idea of using edtech innovations in their work.\n\nKabir Ogunbanwo, a maths teacher in a private secondary school in Lagos, Nigeria, says technology has helped him do his job better.\n\n\u201cBefore now, only a few teachers have been involved in online teaching in one way or the other. Now, I have been exposed to different online teaching experiences.\u201d\n\nMrs Onabegun Mojisola, a teacher in a secondary school in Lagos, Nigeria, has had a different experience. She agrees that although technology serves as a means of resource and research for her job as a teacher, it has provided nothing else so far.\n\n\u201cAs much as technology aids my job in making research for my notes, right now, in the school where I work, the only thing we have that you can say is technology is the Internet, which helps me in research. As for edtech software, I\u2019m yet to make use of any for my job.\u201d\n\nFor Bunmi Eyiaro, Learning and Development Manager at Tuteria, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of technology by teachers in different categories: those who were willing to use technology to make their jobs easier and teachers who started using technology reluctantly, perhaps because they had to use it.\n\nHowever, she also conceded that there was some pushback from teachers due to not knowing how using technology in their processes would work.\n\nGoing by this, we could make the argument that while teachers might initially resist any attempt to move away from the traditional methods they are used to, with adequate instruction, they could be amenable to incorporating technology in their processes.\n\nWhile there are undoubtedly enormous challenges that could prevent edtech startups from gaining ground in Africa, the truth remains that there is a massive opportunity for entrepreneurs willing to build solutions in the sector while providing teachers with the tools to improve their work.\n\nAs we pointed out earlier, the work teachers do go beyond instruction. Therefore, the chances of teachers being replaced by technology are slim. Instead, used correctly, technology could help them to increase productivity.\n\nHappy World Teachers Day!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "title": "From \u2018urgent\u2019 \u20a630k to $50m: How Hanu Fejiro Abodje built Patricia from scratch",
          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s Founder\u2019s Table monthly series, where we catch up with founders in the startup ecosystem, learn about their failures, successes and a few tricks of the trade.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore he founded Patricia, CEO Hanu Fejiro Agbodje says he tried and failed at 13 businesses, all of which, in his words, \u201cended in tears\u201d.\n\nThe businesses ranged from a commercial bike business \u2014 in which his employee carted away with the bike \u2014 to a thriving fast-food joint with 3 in-campus locations that got him arrested and almost expelled from the University of Port Harcourt.\n\nToday, his barely 4-year-old alternative payment solutions platform, Patricia employs over 300 people around the world. But Agbodje is never quick to dismiss his humble entrepreneurial beginnings.\n\n\u201cMy failed businesses gave me so much first-hand experience that in the first two years of running Patricia, there was barely any challenge that was new to me,\u201d he told me during a recent chat at the Patricia Universe office in Lekki, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe talked about everything from his entrepreneurial journey, to how the Bible inspires him to make bold moves, to why Patricia recently moved its headquarters to Estonia, and plans for the future.\n\nWatch full interview or continue below for summarised text version\n\nNB: Below is a paraphrased (for clarity) and summarised version of the interview. For the best experience, we recommend watching the video above.\n\nM\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2 of Techpoint Africa (MM): What was the inspiration for building Patricia?\n\nHanu Fejiro Agbodje of Patricia (HFA): I have a journal where I write all my ideas in, no matter how stupid or dumb they seem. Patricia happened to be number 37 on that idea book. To be honest, I just wanted to make extra \u20a630,000 (~$84 in 2017) a month. That was the plan; I wasn\u2019t looking to build anything elaborate. I was just trying to survive\n\nMM: But what gave you the conviction that Patricia was the right idea to build on?\n\nHFA: I didn\u2019t give it that much thought. I was only trying to avoid running out of money while staying with my brother in Lagos. I had about \u20a61m (~$2800 in 2017) in my bank account and everyday, the money kept reducing. By the time it got to about \u20a6800,000 ( ~$2240 in 2017), I knew I had to act fast or we\u2019d be flat broke in another 1 to 2 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I picked up my idea book and of all the ideas, Patricia seemed like the only viable thing that would be low cost but guarantee me returns of at least \u20a630,000 (~$84 in 2017) monthly.\n\nMM: Why the name \u201cPatricia\u201d though?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHFA: When I had the idea for Patricia is 2015, I was in my grandad\u2019s house. My grandad and my mum had something of a love hate relationship. My mum\u2019s name was Patience but for some reason, my grandad always insisted on calling her Patricia, which would often lead to an argument.\n\nIt was on one of such days that I had my random business ideas and I was like, \u201cOkay. Number 37 \u2014 Patricia\u201d. I didn\u2019t think much about it.\n\nMM: What lessons did you learn from your 13 failed businesses before Patricia?\n\nHFA: I think one of my most remarkable business lessons I learnt is what I call \u201cJungle Rules\u201d. It\u2019s about knowing who to trust in business. I also learnt, from other businesses, not to let shame be the reason why I don\u2019t achieve my goals, or even try.\n\nOne time in 200 Level, I had to quit school to man my popcorn stand because the lady I employed swindled me and opened a competing shop opposite mine. My course mates would take photos and post it on our WhatsApp group to make fun of me. But I didn\u2019t mind because I was already familiar with the concept of no shame in business. I knew they were not going to feed me anyway and I saw it as free advertisement.\n\nSo by the time I started Patricia, I had so much first-hand experience. There was barely any challenge in the first two years that was new to me. It was like Slumdog Millionaire; I had literally gone through the motions. In fact, it\u2019s just now that things are becoming new, because it\u2019s a different ball game managing 300 people around the world.\n\nAnother blessing that is a stumbling block for young entrepreneurs today is the fact that there\u2019s a tech community. So they want to operate within the laws of the tech community. They want to go and raise funds, they want to go and seek somebody\u2019s advice.\n\nI did not do any of that. I didn\u2019t even know there was a tech community for the first two years of running Patricia. That was a blessing for me because it was just idea to execution. I did not know that I could actually get money from somebody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll I knew was this business needed a certain amount of money to execute this, and that was our next goal. And somehow we always got it with just sheer tenacity.\n\nMM: Can you give a few practical tips on how you grew the company without raising institutional funding?\n\nHFA: So, like I said earlier, I started the company with \u20a6800,000 (~$2240 in 2017) in personal savings. I rented a boy\u2019s quarters for \u20a6500,000 (~$1400 in 2017), furnished it with about \u20a6100,000 ($280), bought a couple of second-hand laptops and \u20a630,000 ($84) each. I had about \u20a6120,000 ($336) left which I planned to use to pay initial salaries. I called for interviews and hired two people whom I was to pay 30k each.\n\nBut one month into starting the company, we had made zero naira. I was quite frustrated but did not relent. Like I said, raising funds was not even an option I knew existed. So I had to think creatively.\n\nGrowing up, I saw the power of influencers. I remember back in school (University of Port Harcourt) when Olamide dyed his hair brown. In less than one week, half of my school had dyed their hair brown. Now, imagine if Olamide said \u201cuse Patricia\u201d? I was pretty sure some people would because Olamide said so.\n\nI couldn\u2019t afford Olamide of course. But I could afford Mr. Jollof. We had a mutual friend through whom I negotiated with him to make an ad for \u20a680,000 (~$224 in 2017). He made the ad, sent it to me, I hated it. He was just on his seat, relaxed and very casual.\n\nBut then he put out the ad early in the morning of the next day, without informing us. Before you know it, enquiries and transactions started trickling in. By the end of the day, we had completed about 40 to 50 transactions, excluding enquiries. I checked and saw that we had made \u20a6180,000 (~$504 in 2017) in one day. I took all of that money, paid him again and paid somebody else. And that was how things kicked off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI should also add that the kind of business we are in is a fast moving business. And we were the only ones doing what we were doing in 2017, in the whole of Africa. At most, there was a Luno but that was only for a very select few. There was really nobody doing what we were doing for the masses. Patricia was many people\u2019s first break into crypto and gift cards. So we always made money. As a matter of fact, we were making way more money that I knew what to do with.\n\nI had also built up a savings culture from reading The Richest Man in Babylon. I put all the money we made over 14/15 months in crypto (bitcoin). One bitcoin was worth $3000 at the time, I still have bitcoin from that time. Today, bitcoin is worth over $40,000. So just imagine how much return we made from an investment we made in 2017/2018.\n\nSo we really did not need to raise funds because we never lacked funds.\n\nMM: If offered VC money now, will you take it?\n\nHFA: To whoever is reading this, we need $50m. I\u2019ve crunched the numbers; for us to become a proper global company, $50m will be a very good start for a Series A.\n\nMM: How did you discover crypto though, at that early stage? You said no one else was really doing it in Africa\n\nHFA: It was our customers that turned us on to crypto. We started out as a gift card exchange platform.\n\nMM: Gift cards? What\u2019s the story here?\n\nHFA: I asked one of my uncles, in London, for money. Instead, he sent me a gift card. I didn\u2019t know what to do with it. I checked everywhere and found nowhere to convert the gift card to cash. Actually, I found one obscure platform but I got scammed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt hurt me that I lost the money but it also informed me that if I got scammed, somebody somewhere too had the same problem.\n\nMM: So you had this bright idea, what was the next step? Did you have to code up an app or something?\n\nHFA: Nope, I have zero technical background.\n\nI have many principles I live by and one of them is Occam\u2019s Razor. Occam\u2019s Razor basically states that sometimes, and most times (90% of the time in my experience), the best solution is usually the simplest solution. I don\u2019t like to overthink things; the first idea that comes to my head is what I implement first. That way, I\u2019ve saved almost 2 weeks of planning and already have a foundation to build on.\n\nSo, I had the idea in 2015. I wrote it down. In 2017, I executed. Going with my principles, we built Patricia off WhatsApp.\n\nMM: That must have made things very difficult\n\nHFA: Yes, it was so difficult. But it was so much fun. We didn\u2019t even see it as stress.\n\nMM: How did you go about employing your earliest employees?\n\nHFA: After I rented the boy\u2019s quarters, I reached out to my musician brother\u2019s manager who helped me put the word out on Twitter. I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting people to show up but they did. Five people showed up and I hired two, Chris and Beauty. Chris, who is technically employee number two and has been with the company since then, is now the COO of Patricia.\n\nMM: What have you learnt about hiring people?\n\nHFA: I have learnt to trust my gut. I think I have a very good gut, far more than anything.\n\nI can tell you many stories about how I met my key executives. I met my current Chief of People, Chika Uluocha, when I went to open an account for Patricia at the bank she worked at. I entered the bank, saw this lady at the front desk and just knew she was the one I needed to speak to. So I waited for her to be free.\n\nWe spoke from 10am till about 6pm, about everything. I was so inspired and impressed that I told her I would employ her someday. She didn\u2019t take me seriously but we kept in touch.\n\nA few months later, we had moved from the boy\u2019s quarters to a duplex. That\u2019s another interesting side story.\n\nWe started in August, 2017. By December, Beauty had already left so it was just me and Chris. But Chris had to travel home for the holidays, leaving me with so much work to handle. This was the defining moment for Patricia. You know how obsessive entrepreneurs are portrayed in movies? That was my obsession phase. I had no Christmas or New Year holiday. I lost track of time, as I worked almost non-stop from the 5th of December until the middle of February, when Chris returned, a month later than he was meant to.\n\nChris discovered that Patricia had made \u20a63.5m (~$9800 in 2017) in profit over that two-month period. I had no idea!\n\nYou know what I did? I took all of that money and rented a 5-bedroom duplex as our new office. Everyone thought I was crazy. But that\u2019s the thing about vision. Nobody can really see things the way you do. Besides, I was certain that we\u2019d make that money back in another one or two months.\n\nWe filled the space up with a couple more people, some of whom are still with us today. That was when Chika came in from the bank. I invited her to come see what we\u2019d done. She was so blown away that she quit her job at the bank and joined us. She actually accepted a pay cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatricia office in 2018 (the 5-bedroom duplex)\n\nMM: A lot has changed since then. Patricia is now officially headquartered in Estonia. Tell us about that decision\n\nHFA: The crypto ban happened but business has to go on; there are mouths to feed and I won\u2019t just lay off my staff because the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) says that we can\u2019t do business anymore.\n\nSo we decided we needed a crypto license to enable expansion outside the shores of Africa. At the grand scale of things, Nigeria is still a very small pie. Coinbase, the biggest crypto player in the world, worth over $80bn, does not have a footprint in Africa. This means there is more out there than there is in here.\n\nThat was why we moved to Estonia, got a license, and we now have operations in 27 EU countries, with just one move. So the CBN ban was a setback for something greater. We were going to expand at some point but just not this year. The CBN accelerated our expansion.\n\nMM: Advice for budding entrepreneurs? Especially those still in school\n\nHFA: Have a journal where you write your ideas down. If I never wrote Patricia down, I\u2019d never have had something to look back to.\n\nRead a lot of books, not just your school books. Read far and wide, whatever your interests are.\n\nThen try a lot of things. You have all the time to fail. You know, most people don\u2019t even try because they are afraid of failing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried and failed at 13 businesses. But trust me, if I had to try 100 businesses, I would. Because I read that Thomas Edison tried the light bulb a thousand times. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s true but if anyone can try something a thousand times, they must succeed. And if you don\u2019t succeed, you will discover penicillin.\n\nMM: What are the future plans for Patricia over the next 3 to 10 years?\n\nHFA: Our plan is to make crypto easier for the entire world.\n\nThere\u2019s a fifth revolution coming. One common trend about previous revolutions is that they don\u2019t announce themselves. They are usually almost over before we realise, \u201coh that was the nth revolution.\u201d\n\nNow, everything has evolved in this world, except money. But money is evolving now and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much push back.\n\nIf you look at it, every pioneer of the 4th revolution is a billionaire today.

          "title": "Nigerian telemedicine startup, iWello, is making healthcare available to people living on less than $1 per day",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, Ismail Adejonwo\u2019s mother experienced a troubling stomach ache. The family had no money and was hesitant to take her to the hospital.\n\nBut as the clock kept ticking, the pain became unbearable. At this point, he had no choice but to take his mother to the hospital.\n\nWhen they arrived at the hospital, the doctor informed them that they had brought her late. She was diagnosed with appendicitis, which was treated successfully with a simple surgery.\n\nEntirely unrelated, Dr Fatima Ajayi, Adejonwo\u2019s pregnant family friend, fainted during a ward round in 2019 after working a 12-hour shift. Sadly, her boss dismissed her for the day without further concern about her well-being. Adejonwo decided not to overlook these events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn 2019, these issues sparked a lot of thought in me. For my mother, we might have known what the problem was sooner if we had consulted a doctor, which could have saved her the weeks of agony she endured. Another reason we were hesitant to take her to the hospital was a lack of funds. This, too, could have been taken care of if there had been surgery funding available instead of the embarrassment of begging,\u201d Adejonwo explains.\n\nThe incident involving his family friend, Ajayi, bothered him too. Because he wanted to address incidents like these two, he began brainstorming solutions to the problems.\n\nLater in 2019, he had an idea that he pitched to a doctor friend, Bolu Balogun, on Twitter.\n\nIn 2020, Adejonwo (CEO), Ajayi (Head, Family Medicine), and Balogun (Head, General Medicine) collaborated on an idea. The idea became iWello, a telemedicine startup, and was launched in July 2021 as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) where users can easily consult with doctors.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsmail Adejonwo, Founder and CEO\n\nBefore founding iWello, despite his zero medical background, Adejonwo had over six years of startup experience.\n\nFor three years, he was the Head of Content and Digital Marketing at a student marketplace, Vasiti.com. He also had a stint as Head of Business Development at Guided Beginning, an educational and parenting startup, for four years\n\nBalogun, on the other hand, is a skilled urologist with a Masters in Clinical Urology, and she has worked in the telemedicine field for reputable companies such as Tremendoc.\n\nAjayi is a family medicine specialist with over five years of experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthcare for those who live below $1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to healthcare, iWello claims it provides a sense of belonging to low-income people \u2014 those who live paycheck to paycheck, have difficulty living above $1 per day and live in slums and rural areas.\n\nAnd one of iWello\u2019s priorities is for them to know that there is an available healthcare solution where their health needs can be met.\n\niWello is a telemedicine platform that allows anyone, regardless of income level, to gain access to healthcare for as little as $1 and surgery funding while also ensuring the well-being of doctors and healthcare workers.\n\nThere are two types of surgery funding: paid and free. For the former, the company pays for it before the surgery, and the client repays later. Essentially, iWello pays for the surgery in full, and patients pay in instalments after the surgery is complete.\n\nThe team hopes to cover all types of surgeries, but for the time being, they are focusing on minor surgeries \u2014 like appendix removal, caesarean section for pregnant women, and kidney failure issues \u2014 and major surgeries that are less than \u20a610 million ($24,306.62).\n\niWello exercises measures to ensure that its users have at most three guarantors who agree to be debited automatically if a user defaults. Depending on the schedule chosen, payment could be monthly, weekly, or daily.\n\nThe free option functions similarly to a social trust fund with profits and donations from the general public who pay for people who cannot afford the paid opportunity.\n\n\u201cAll the user has to do is register, and their surgery will be funded. But it will be on a first-come, first-served basis, which means there will be a waiting list, and we will work from that list until the social trust fund is depleted,\u201d Adejonwo says.\n\nAlso, they provide consultations, medication, and treatment for three of the world\u2019s most lethal diseases: malaria, diabetes, and hypertension.\n\n\u201cAs a company, we want to make a difference in the high mortality rates for common diseases like malaria, hypertension, and diabetes.\n\n\u201cWe currently serve through our website and are in the process of developing a mobile app.\u201d\n\nFor users and doctors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niWello\u2019s homepage\n\nAlthough iWello is just three months old and competes against startups like Tremendoc and WellaHealth, and indirect competitors like Helium Health, Adejonwo says, \u201cour services outperform most of them in terms of affordability, sharing formulas with doctors, and a pay-as-you-go integrated healthcare system that cares for people from the point of consultation to treatment.\u201d\n\nAnother advantage is that it covers the patient\u2019s entire customer journey, from consultation to treatment, which only a few telemedicine startups do.\n\nSimilarly, iWello considers its doctors\u2019 well-being by paying them a higher percentage \u2014 70% \u2014 of every consultation and treatment they provide. And offers surgery funding, a service Reliance Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO), a telemedicine insurance company, also provides.\n\nA viable model\n\niWello is currently self-funded. It also recently placed second in the Ivery Arie pitch competition and expects to complete an Angel round led by a group of lawyers in October \u2014 this month.\n\n\u201cWe are currently at the pre-revenue stage. We are not yet making profit and are currently offering a freemium service to users,\u201d Adejonwo says.\n\nHowever, the company makes money primarily through commissions and subscriptions. While a doctor receives 70% of the revenue from each consultation and treatment performed on the platform, iWello gets 30%.\n\n\u201cWe charge no interest for surgeries but a fixed service charge depending on the surgery type. However, we charge \u20a6300 ($0.73) per consultation,\u201d he says.\n\niWello is currently testing its pharmaceutical marketplace with a phoney drug checker where you can buy drugs instantly, speak with a pharmacist, and verify the drugs\u2019 authenticity.\n\n\u201cPharmacists will receive a 5-10% commission on every drug sold on our pharmaceutical marketplace,\u201d Adejonwo says.\n\nThe pharmaceutical marketplace is still in beta mode and has not yet been launched. The company anticipates that it will be available before the end of this year.\n\nAlthough the company has a user base of 140 clients and 14 doctors, it hopes to reach at least 36,000 people in each local government in Lagos State.\n\niWello plans to cover all 20 local governments in Lagos State before expanding into other Southwestern states, then the East and North, by the end of 2022. It also plans to expand into another African country, Ghana, by 2023.\n\nEnduring challenges through teamwork\n\nOne of the most difficult challenges iWello has faced is raising awareness and staying afloat in the absence of funding.\n\n\u201cOffline, we used tracking cards so that people could scan them and easily contact us, and we also reached out personally based on health issues they shared on platforms like Twitter,\u201d he says.\n\nIn terms of funding, the team has tried applying for grants, entered pitch competitions, and pitched to some angel investors. Now, they seem to be making some headway.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, the team is solely committed to this project and is working on it full time. Most of us have been working pro-bono, and even recent members on the team joined based on the impact they believe iWello can have on the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adejonwo, the government is not doing enough to improve the country\u2019s healthcare situation, which is why people continue to die from common diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, and doctors are leaving the country in droves.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I believe that with iWello, we can make a difference in the healthcare industry,\u201d he concludes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has written to lawmakers seeking a 17.67 percent increase of the Federal Government\u2019s projected expenditure in 2022 to N16.45 trillion from N13.98 trillion.\n\nThe projected increase in expenditure equates to N2.47 trillion additional spending, which Buhari said was partly due to the N100 billion extra provision to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cater for 2023 General Elections.\n\nPresident Buhari made the demand in a submission of the Revised 2022-2024 Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), accompanied by a letter read by Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila at plenary on Tuesday.\n\nThe increase in expenditure was accompanied by a 21 percent rise in projected revenues to N10.13 trillion. Analysts had said the initial revenue projection of N8.36 trillion was over ambitious based on previous revenue trend where Nigeria has only managed about 50 percent of budgeted revenues.\n\nThe increase in projected revenues leaves the door open to an even higher than planned fiscal deficit despite Buhari\u2019s projection that the deficit will increase by N692.0 billion, representing 3.42% of GDP from 3.05% of GDP in the initial fiscal deficit estimate of N5.62 trillion.\n\nAccording to the President, the increase in expenditure is also due to the provision of N54 billion to the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, which represents 1% Federal Government Share of Federation Account.\n\nRead also: Lack of central vaccine database puts Nigeria on UK\u2019s blacklist\n\nThe letter identified other reasons for the increase as: \u201cadditional provision of N510 billion in the Service Wide Votes to cater for National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (N300 billion), Police Operations Fund (N50 billion), Hazard Allowance for Health Workers (N50 billion), Public Service Wage Adjustments (additional N80 billion), and MDAs\u2019 Electricity Bills Debt (additional N37 billion)\u201d.\n\nThe rise is also due to additional capital provision of N1.70 trillion, attributed to projected increases in: \u201cCapital Supplementation by N179.1 billion; GOES Capital by N222.1 billion; TETFUND Expenditure by N290.7 billion; Multilateral / Bilateral Project-tied Loans by N517.5 billion; and, MDAs Capital Expenditure by N390.5 billion (including N178.1 billion provision for population and housing census to be carried out in 2022)\u201d.\n\nBuhari stated that it was necessary to revise the MTEF to reflect the new fiscal terms in the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, as well as other critical expenditures in the 2022 Budget.\n\nHe however indicated that the underlying drivers of the 2022 fiscal projections, such as oil price benchmark, oil production volume, exchange rate, GDP growth, and inflation rate reflect emergent realities and the macroeconomic outlook, and remain unchanged as in the previously approved 2022-24 MTEF & FSP.\n\nThe changes to the 2022 projections in the Fiscal Framework demanded by the President include; gross revenue projection decreased by N341.57 billion, from N8.870 trillion to N8.528 trillion; deductions for Federally-funded upstream project costs and 13% derivation, decreased by N335.3 billion and N810.25 million respectively and net Oil and Gas revenue projection declined by N5.42 billion from N6.540 trillion to N6.535 trillion.\n\nOther proposed amendments include; a projected decline in Net Oil and Gas Revenue by N5.42 billion; an increase in projected FGN\u2019s Retained Revenue from N8.36 trillion to N10.13 trillion (inclusive of GOES).\n\nThis is largely based on:\u201dprojected increase in the revenues of Government Owned Enterprises (GOES) by N837. 76 billion; MDAs internally Generated Revenue by N697.6 billion.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of Education Tax of N306 billion and Dividend of N8.3 billion from the Bank of Industry as revenue lines; and FGN share of oil price royalty of N969 billion which is expected to be transferred to the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority based on the provisions of the PIA\u201d.",

          "text": "The Federal Government\u2019s failure to provide a single recognised vaccine database is the major reason the United Kingdom, (UK) has refused to approve Nigeria\u2019s vaccine certificate, BusinessDay\u2019s findings show.\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK) relaxed its COVID-19 vaccine policy for more than 50 countries but Nigeria is missing on the list.\n\nWhile the UK did not give reasons for not including Nigeria on the list of the 50 countries recognised, BusinessDay\u2019s findings show that Nigeria has since been slow to provide a database that could help authenticate the vaccine cards of those vaccinated.\n\nChecks show that countries that have had their vaccine certificates recognised by the UK have had to provide a single database with features that would help verify the authenticity of the vaccines, a step Nigeria has been slow to take.\n\nTayo Ojuri, managing partner, Aglow Aviation Support Services Limited told BusinessDay that Nigeria needs to have a single source of authenticated database and this has been the country\u2019s major challenge.\n\n\u201cIn Europe, they have their database synchronised to IATA travel pass. With an IATA travel pass, you have a database where you can verify the source of the vaccines and know if the vaccine cards are genuine. A data authenticated database will solve the issue. This is also the main challenge Nigeria has with Emirates,\u201d Ojuri explained.\n\nThe UK government had said Nigeria is on the \u2018amber\u2019 list, which has restrictions for travellers to the UK, irrespective of whether they have been vaccinated against COVID.\n\nFrom October 4, the UK said the new travel system comes into effect with countries and territories categorised as either \u201cred\u201d or \u201crest of the world.\u201d\n\nRead also: Snag for travellers as UK blacklists Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine certificate\n\nOjuri said with the temporary hitch, Nigerians would have to pay more to do another COVID-19 test and self-isolate in the UK.\n\nOjuri said asking Nigerians to self-isolate for 10 days, would mean restricting their movements and this may discourage business travels.\n\nHe, however, disclosed that Nigerians are still travelling to the UK despite the restrictions, adding that the demographics of Nigerians travelling to the UK are not travelling for business but to visit family and friends.\n\n\u201cThere are many Nigerians in the diaspora. So many Nigerians are just visiting family and friends and returning back home. If they are going for business and isolating for 10 days, it\u2019s an extra cost. So, while business travel may slow down, travel for studies, visits and holidays are still increasing,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from having a synchronised database, travel experts also suggest that IATA travel passes are also accepted as an authentic means of vaccine certificate verification.\n\nIATA Travel Pass is a mobile app that helps travellers to store and manage their verified certifications for COVID-19 tests or vaccines. It is more secure and efficient than current paper processes used to manage health requirements (the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, for example).\n\nThis is important given the potentially enormous scale of testing or vaccine verifications that will need to be securely managed.\n\nSusan Akporiaye, the national president of the National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies, (NANTA), said Nigeria was not listed among countries with approved vaccine certificates for now because they have not found a way to verify the authenticity of its vaccines but they are working on this.\n\nAkporiaye noted that the British High Commission has found a way of verifying the genuineness of vaccine certificates for countries recognised.\n\n\u201cNigeria had something similar when there was news making the rounds that President Trump refused to give Nigerians visas but the US ambassador said Nigeria didn\u2019t have synchronised data.\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria in collaboration with the UK can provide a platform where the barcodes on the vaccine cards can be inserted and information showing that the cardholder actually took the vaccine, then there won\u2019t be issues anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also disclosed that people are still travelling to the UK despite the travel restrictions as British Airways flights for next week are almost fully booked.\n\n\u201cNigerians quarantine in the UK because the UK comes at random and calls the houses and if the person is not there, they ban them from visiting the UK for 10 years and they will be deported back to Nigeria. Nigerians are law-abiding once there are penalties,\u201d she said.\n\nOnyema Justice, a frequent business traveller to the UK said he was troubled about the situation as he had to get fully vaccinated in Nigeria, to enable him to carry out his business in the UK seamlessly, only to find out that he has to undergo 10 days quarantine despite being fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cHow do I self-isolate for 10 days in the UK when I have business targets to meet? This only shows down business for me. I just hope the government of Nigeria can work closely with the UK to resolve the issue,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement on its website, the UK government released a list of over 50 countries with approved COVID-19 vaccination programmes and proof of vaccination for travel to England.\n\n\u201cFully vaccinated residents in other countries not yet part of the inbound policy, as well as those partially vaccinated, will still have to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests for day 2 and day 8 after arrival, and self-isolate for 10 days, with the option to test to release after 5 days,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThe UK government is continuing to work with international partners as we seek to more regularly expand the policy to further countries and territories.\u201d\n\nThe government said that the new simplified travel system meant that eligible fully vaccinated passengers and eligible under-18s returning from over 50 countries and territories, not on the red list, can do so without needing to complete a pre-departure test (PDT), a day 8 test or enter a 10-day self-isolation period, making it easier for those travelling \u2014 whether that\u2019s to see friends and family, or on business trips.\n\nThe statement further explained that eligible fully vaccinated passengers with an approved vaccine and recognised certificate from a country not on the red list would be able to replace their day 2 test with a cheaper lateral flow test, reducing the cost of tests on arrival into England.\n\nHowever, the Federal Government, reacting on Tuesday, said Nigeria was not among the countries approved \u201cbecause the UK Government is reviewing vaccination certification programme of countries in phases and it is not yet Nigeria\u2019s turn\u201d.\n\nAccording to Faisal Shuaib, executive secretary, national primary healthcare development agency (NPHCDA) the UK will be assessing Nigeria\u2019s vaccination program in few weeks\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cThe current listing of countries with approved vaccination certification has just started in the UK. They are reviewing the countries\u2019 programmes in phases. If you go through the list of 50 closely, no African country made the list.\n\n\u201cFrom my communication with the UK Government officials, the vaccines administered in Nigeria are approved by the UK Government. They are also involved with the vaccination programme in Nigeria through the Foreign, Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) and they are optimistic that by the time Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination programme certification is assessed, it will be approved\u201d Shuaib said.\n\nHe spoke: \u201cThere are many countries in the world, so we like many other countries are in the queue for this assessment. Once it gets to our turn, we are more likely going to get approved in the coming weeks. Like the UK Government have clearly stated, the process of assessment would occur in phases.\u201d\n\nShuaib further informed that the Nigerian government was working to ensure rapid uptake of vaccinations, but noted that more work still needed to be done.\n\nHe informed that Nigeria on Monday received 501,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the COVAX facility as donation from the Government of France, adding that the country would also be receiving additional 3,577,860 doses of Pfizer vaccines within the next two weeks.",

However, concerns are raised as to whether the growth recorded reflects the realities of the struggling sector.\n\nAnalysts at FBN Quest note that one of the impacts of the global headwinds was the cut in supply of imported inputs and materials used for production by manufacturers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe headlines are full of faltering supply chains, which in the case of Nigeria are made worse by challenges surrounding the cost of, and access to foreign exchange,\u201d according to the analysts.\n\nThe supply cut caused a shortfall in the availability of raw materials and inputs which drove an increase in production cost to 21 percent in the second quarter of 2021, according to data from the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector records trade deficit of N4.3trn in Q2 2021\n\nHamma Kwajaffa, director-general, Nigerian Textile Employers Association (NTEA) told BusinessDay that the situation is further aggravated by the scarcity and increased price of raw materials due to the extended lockdown of principal partner countries like Southern China which has clogged ports critical to global trade.\n\n\u201cThere are fears that this may intensify in future as China plans to retain its pandemic border restrictions for at least one more year due to the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and a schedule of major events and exhibitions,\u201d Kwajaffa added.\n\nDisruptions at the global supply chain have propelled manufacturers to look inwards for local sourcing of raw materials and inputs.\n\nYemi Osinbajo, Nigeria\u2019s vice president said at a recent MAN summit that manufacturers need to expand their capacity and become more competitive through the use of value addition and regional value chain in the production process.\n\n\u201cThe regional value chain can be utilised for creation, design, raw material supply, processing, transportation, storage, marketing and sales,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector recorded 3.49 percent growth in the second quarter of 2021 which was also the highest Q2 figure across six years. However, analysts at FBN Quest expected a stronger rebound from the -8.8 percent it achieved in the corresponding period of 2020 when the lockdown was in effect.",

It is about our people. The first thing any good government will do for its people is to give them a good quality education.\n\n\u201cAt the core of our educational system is the teacher. We proved it with the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme. If the teachers do not accept it, we won\u2019t have the type of transformation now visible in our educational sector.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cWe need you to keep helping us drive this process. That is why I am here to demand more from you; I have no doubt that you will respond.\n\n\u201cToday, we are not talking about teachers\u2019 promotion again. Now, we are working on those who didn\u2019t get a promotion even before we came into office. If we were able to promote people since 2016, it means that we believe in it. We have to sit down and review the matter of those who were affected from 2014 to 2015.\n\n\u201cFor those teachers who retired in August 2021, it is only fair that they are paid their full salary. After reviewing all your requests, I believe there is nothing difficult there that we cannot do. This is how I want our relationship to be. Your lives mean a lot to us. Now, there is trouble in Nigeria, we need to come together to help save this country.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWith the issue of insecurity in some parts of the country, security in our schools has to be our number one priority. We need to have our schools safe for learning. The other issue is your health during this period of COVID-19 pandemic. I urge you to obey all the guidelines, get vaccinated as I am not making vaccination compulsory.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we respect seniority in appointing heads and it must be earned. We will continue to do the right thing. I can assure you that as governor, we will not persecute anybody. We will continue to respect our teachers; we will continue to prioritise payment of your salaries. No matter how hard and difficult things become, the teacher is still our number one priority,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his address, the Edo State Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Mr. Pius Okhueleigbe, commended Governor Obaseki for implementing the 2016 to 2019 promotion arrears to affected teachers.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Tuesday presented a total sum of One Hundred and Twenty-Nine Billion, Seven Hundred and Fifty-Six Million, Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand, Seven Hundred and Ninety Naira (N129,756,450,790.00) to the State Assembly as draft budget of the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nThis is even as the Governor reiterated his Administration\u2019s commitment to sustainable development and the advancement of the State\u2019s economy.\n\nThe details of the Appropriation Bill revealed that the larger chunks were earmarked for infrastructure, education and health sectors, with the Agriculture sector also getting its fair share.\n\nThe 2022 draft Budget size was higher than the year 2021 budget N109.8bn by over N20bn.\n\nThe draft Budget, which is christened \u201cBudget of Sustainable Development\u201d, was anchored on the commitment of the Administration to providing conducive living and working environment for the people of Osun.\n\nAccording to the draft Budget, the Total Recurrent Expenditure was N53,593,627,990.00, representing 41.30%, while the Total Capital Expenditure was N76,162,822,800.00, representing 58.70% respectively.\n\nThe Appropriation Bill revealed that a total sum of N26,609, 441, 740.00 went to Education; over N19 billion to Infrastructure Sector; about N16 billion to the Health Sector and about N7 billion to the Agriculture Sector.\n\nPresenting the 2022 budget before the lawmakers, Oyetola said the budget was aimed at further cementing and pursuing the policy thrust of his Administration, and consolidating various achievements so far recorded in each sector of the economy of the State.\n\nGovernor Oyetola said that in view of the prevailing economic realities, the main focus of the budget would be aggressive improvement of the Internally Generated Revenue drive to ensure optimum performance in the coming years.\n\nHe said workable strategies have been put in place to boost the revenue of the State without putting unnecessary burden on the residents.\n\nThe Governor also disclosed that all the General Hospitals across the State would be rehabilitated, just as he hinted that government would embark on massive construction of more roads in 2022.\n\n\u201cIn line with our Administration\u2019s commitment to ensuring that there are no abandoned projects in the State, all existing on-going road projects are being worked upon and will be delivered soon. Notable among these Roads are the 17.5km Oba (Sir) Adesoji Aderemi (East by pass) Road; 30km Gbongan \u2013 Akoda Road; 40km \u2013 Osogbo \u2013 Ikirun \u2013 Ilaodo \u2013 Kwara State boundary Road which are on-going, as well as the complete rehabilitation of 30km Ilesa \u2013 Iperindo \u2013 Ipetu Ijesa Road. This Administration has also embarked on massive construction and rehabilitation of roads across the State. While some are completed, others are on-going. Notable among these are the construction of 18.1km Osogbo \u2013 Kelebe \u2013 Iragbiji Road (including Orita Idiodan \u2013 Araromi \u2013 Anaye Mkt.); Rehabilitation of 25.8km Ede (Army Barrack) \u2013 Ara \u2013 Ejigbo Township Road; Construction of 0.68km Flyover at Olaiya, Osogbo; Rehabilitation of 1.3km Kuta Palace junction \u2013 Isale Oba Road \u2013 Asamu Junction Road; Rehabilitation of 2.3km Iloro \u2013 Aganun \u2013 Division C Police Headquarter, Ile-Ife; Reconstruction and completion of 8.1km Moro-Yakoyo-Ipetumodu-Asipa Road; Rehabilitation of 2.6km Nike Gallery \u2013 Ido \u2013 Osun Township airport with palace spur; Rehabilitation of 2.5km Ikirun \u2013 Eko-Ende Road; as well as the construction of 0.31km access road to Fountain University, Osogbo which are on-going.\n\n\u201cIn a matter of days, work will commence on Lawyer Atanda Road in Iwo. For network of roads in Ikire and Ife, they are undergoing procurement process, while work has commenced on the Ila-Arandun-Kwara Boundary Road, to mention but a few. All these are designed to aid ease of doing business, facilitate easy and smooth movement of citizens and help in the transportation of farm produce to urban markets. I want assure the people of Osun that more notable road projects would be awarded as part of Government\u2019s efforts to improve the socio-economic activities of the residents of the State. This is also in furtherance of the present Administration\u2019s goal to deliver adequate, quality and equitable services to the good people of Osun.\n\nHe further said \u201cWe have laid important foundations for the development of our State\u2019s economy over the past three (3) years with various developments in infrastructure, security, environment and major improvements in the Ease of Doing Business and growing our Internally Generated Revenue.\n\n\u201cWe must now focus on gearing up the momentum of building on the achievements so far, and by so doing, delivering accelerated economic growth and development for all.\n\n\u201cAs a state, our vision of the future is clear. Our goal is to achieve inclusive socio-economic growth that is rooted in our 10-Year Osun Development Plan (2019-2028). Our plan rests on four developmental pillars: Economic Development, Infrastructure Development, Human Capital Development and Security, and Environmental Sustainability.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, we commit ourselves to deepening the foundation for revenue diversification and economic sustainability by focusing on Agriculture, Mining, ICT and Innovation, Culture and Tourism and Creative economy without neglecting other important sectors like Infrastructure, Water and Sanitation, Commerce and Industry, Education and Health.\n\n\u201cIn a broader view therefore, the central focus of our Administration is to make Osun a prosperous State in a secure and sustainable environment through pragmatic, transparent, accountable and inclusive governance.\u201d\n\nOn Tourism, he said \u201canother innovation of our administration is the conscious use of arts and culture to re-energise our state economy. In line with this, the State government had announced the wearing of \u2018Adire Osun\u2019, especially by Cabinet members and other political functionaries in the State on Thursday of every week. The idea is to stimulate interest in the promotion of our culture, encourage others to embrace the idea so as to boost our local economy in the long run. Enumeration of local producers of \u2018Adire Osun\u2019 is ongoing. Our intention is to link producers with finance to boost production so as to match expected surge in demand as a result of this policy pronouncement. This will be aided with the Government intervention to open \u2018Adire Osun\u2019International Market in the nearest future.\n\n\u201cWe have not relented in the promotion of our cultural activities in the State. Osun Osogbo festival, Iwude Ijesa, Olojo festival Ile-Ife, Isinro Ila-Orangun, Oke Iragbiji and others, will continue to enjoy necessary government support in the coming year. Although we may not be where we are supposed to be, we are certainly making steady progress in our effort to make our Tourism Sector a money spinner for the State. For instance, we have progressed from generating cumulatively less than Two Million Naira (N2m) in three years combined (2017, 2018 and 2019) to generating more than Twenty Million Naira (N20m) in 2020 alone and so far made over Ten Million Naira (N10m). We are determined to make it better in the coming years,\u201d Oyetola added.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye lauded the Administration of Governor Oyetola for prioritising accountability, probity and prudence in the management of the scarce resources accruable to the State.\n\nHe promised that the legislature would display the commitment needed to ensure speedy passage of the budget as it has been doing in the past saying \u201cwe will continue to play a supportive role to the executive arm to continuously better the lives of the citizens.\n\n\u201cI wish to commend Governor Oyetola and everyone who took part in the implementation of the 2021 budget for the wonderful job. With a 97% performance in 2020 and 77% as at the second quarter of 2021 budget, our performance has greatly increased our standing in the comity of States and also makes us an investment destination for local and foreign investors.\n\n\u201cIt is important for us as a people to commend the Governor and his team for their probity and exceptional strategy in managing the finances of the State. Our people must also begin to reciprocate that gesture by paying their taxes accurately and promptly,\u201d Owoeye added.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electrical Commission (INEC), has expressed concern over what it described as escalating security threats in Anambra, ahead of the November 6 governorship election.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu expressed the concern at an emergency meeting of the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nThe meeting comes amid escalating attacks by gunmen who appear to be determined to scuttle the election.\n\nYakubu said that during the last ICCES quarterly meeting on Sept. 9, major concern was raised by the committee on the security situation in Anambra and the adjoining states.\n\nHe said the concern was raised on how the situation might affect preparations and possibly the conduct of the Anambra election.\n\nYakubu said that unfortunately, the situation had deteriorated since the last meeting, as many innocent lives had been lost and property destroyed in the state, Vanguard reported.\n\n\u201cFrom reports that we have received, the stated goal of many of the attackers is that the governorship election scheduled for Nov. 6 must not hold.\n\n\u201cThis is worrisome for the commission. We are deeply concerned that specific electoral facilities and materials could once more become targets of attack,\u201d he said.\n\nYakubu said that in May 2021the INEC office at Awka was attacked and all the non-sensitive materials assembled for the election were destroyed.\n\nHe added that the commission\u2019s store, collation centre and the main office building were either totally or substantially damaged, while INEC also lost several vehicles billed for the election.\n\n\u201cHappily, we have almost fully recovered from that attack. The destroyed buildings have either been completely repaired or are nearing completion and we have fully replaced the materials destroyed.\n\n\u201cThis rapid recovery has only been possible because this is an off-season election. We have sourced some of these materials such as the 326 electric generators and vehicles destroyed in the attack from neighbouring states.\n\n\u201cHowever, should we again lose vital materials and facilities, the ongoing preparations will be adversely affected,\u201d he said.\n\nYakubu said that INEC was particularly concerned about the safety of voters and election duty staff, including security officials who have also became targets of the attacks.\n\nHe said that INEC was also concerned about safety of thousands of young Nigerians from National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and university students who were to be engaged in the conduct of the election.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, deployment for the election will involve the movement of huge consignments of sensitive and non-sensitive materials to the 21 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state, 326 wards or Registration Areas and 5,720 Polling Units.\n\n\u201cThat means over 6,000 locations to be protected.\n\n\u201cIf we add that to about 26,000 officials that will be deployed for the election, we begin to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge of securing the Anambra Governorship election which is only 32 days from today,\u201d he said.\n\nYakubu appreciated the enormous challenges that the security agencies were facing in Anambra which entailed not only securing the electoral process, but also enforcing law and order.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly worrisome because the security agencies have also become prime targets of these mindless attacks.\n\n\u201cIt is in the light of these recent and seemingly escalating threats to the election that the commission has convened this emergency meeting,\u201d he said.\n\nYakubu, while assuring that the process of the election would proceed as scheduled, said that INEC would continue to work with security agencies and respected opinion leaders in the state to ensure the success of the election.\n\nHe said that to underscore the determination, INEC would implement two more activities on the timetable for the election in the next few days.\n\nThese according to him, includes the presentation of register of voters to political parties in Awka and publication of final list of candidates for the election on Thursday, Oct. 7.\n\nHe expressed confident that at the end of the meeting, INEC would firm up on specific measures to guarantee the safety of all the people to be involved in the election from voters, election officials, observers and media organisations among others.\n\nIn his remark, the National Security Adviser (NSA) and Co- Chairman of ICCES, Retired Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno, said that his office was working with all security agencies in the country to address the security situation in the South East.\n\nMonguno, represented by Mr Sanusi Galadima, reiterate the Federal Government commitment for the protection of lives and property of all law abiding citizens before, during and after the elections, according to Vanguard.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Director-General National Pension Commission (PenCom), Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar, has disclosed that an accumulated pension asset in excess of N13 trillion has been invested in various sectors of the Nigerian economy.\n\nDahir-Umar who stated this in her goodwill message at the opening ceremony of the two-days sensitization workshop on the \u201cEradication of Pension Fraud in Nigeria, said the fund is still growing.\n\nPension assets have continued its growth trajectory monthly, soaring to N12.78 trillion as of July 31, 2021.\n\n\u200c\n\nIn its recent data, PenCom stated that the pension fund asset stood at N12.31 trillion as of December 31, 2020, and soared to N12.78 trillion by July 31, 2021, indicating a difference of N47 billion.\n\nAccording to Dahir-Umar, PenCom is, indeed, pleased to partner with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in this awareness creation initiative, which essentially seeks to examine the incidences of fraud in the pension sector in Nigeria and ways of eradicating the menace in a proactive manner.\n\nShe noted that the continued collaboration with the EFCC would certainly serve as a catalyst for reducing the menace of fraud in the pension industry to the barest minimum.\n\nHer words: \u201cThis event will, no doubt, create the synergy needed to boost the efforts of the two organizations in the discharge of their respective statutory mandates relating to the theme of the workshop.\n\n\u201d The problems of fraud and mismanagement in the pension sector in Nigeria were amongst the reasons that necessitated the pension reform of 2004 by the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nThe Pension Reform Act 2004, which was later reviewed and re-enacted in 2014, introduced legal and institutional frameworks aimed at addressing the rot that characterized the administration of pensions in the pre-reform era.\n\nThe Act also established PenCom to regulate and supervise all pension matters in Nigeria, including the licensing of Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) and Pension Fund Custodians (PFCs).\n\nThe Pension Transitional Arrangements Directorate (PTAD) was also established by the PRA 2014 to administer, in a transparent manner, the Defined Benefits Scheme (DBS) for pensioners exempted from the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS).\n\nAccording to the DG, these measures substantially restored credibility and confidence in Nigeria\u2019s pension systems.\n\n\u201cThus, we have today, an industry that has accumulated pension assets in excess of N13 trillion, invested in various aspects of the economy and still growing.\n\n\u201cPursuant to its statutory mandate under Section 23(f) of the PRA 2014, PenCom has consistently undertaken public education, enlightenment, and awareness campaigns on the CPS and other pension matters.\n\n\u201cIt has also developed and established structures, systems, and procedures that ensure transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the administration of pensions in Nigeria,\u201d she stated.\n\nThese systems and procedures she added, have become reference points for other African countries, many of whom have undertaken study visits to the Commission.\n\nHowever, she regretted that as is the case with every human endeavor, retrogressive elements continued to exploit procedural gaps in the operations of pension practitioners in both the CPS and DBS to the detriment of the unsuspecting public.\n\n\u201cThus, new issues and challenges continue to emerge, which place a special responsibility on the regulators, the operators, and other stakeholders to constantly review their operating environment with a view to finding solutions to address the problems,\u201d she said.\n\nThe PRA 2014 had strengthened Nigeria\u2019s pension institutions in both the Contributory and Defined Benefits Schemes and imbued them with the capacity to rise above emerging challenges",

          "title": "Report Reveals How Kebbi Gov, Atiku Bagudu Hid Billions Amassed Through Abacha",
          "text": "Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State is currently in the eye of the storm over the controversial wealth he allegedly got through General Sani Abacha, a former Head of State.\n\nThere have been reports on how Bagudu used phoney companies to siphon and move funds allegedly stolen by Abacha but the governor has denied the stories.\n\nIn a fresh controversy, Pandora Papers, one of the biggest leaks of financial documents in the world, has uncovered how Bagudu dispatched a delegation to Singapore in search of a new haven to shelter which is a target of ongoing forfeiture proceedings by the United States Department of Justice.\n\nPandora Papers investigation \u2013 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, including more than 600 journalists, including some from PREMIUM TIMES, reported that huge funds, warehoused offshore, is part of billions of dollars Bagudu helped the Sani Abacha family to steal from Nigeria in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cReferred by Farrer and Co., a prestigious centuries-old London law firm that has represented the British royal family, Bagudu\u2019s choice of secrecy provider in Singapore was Asiaciti Trust, an entity notorious for helping clients hide behind opaque offshore trusts to launder dirty money across borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Monetary Authority of Singapore, MAS, imposed a fine of one million and a hundred thousand dollars on Asiaciti in July 2020 for \u201cserious breaches\u201d of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations between 2007 and 2018.\n\nBagudu\u2019s brother fingered in \u2018dirty wealth\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen on February 23, 2010, Mr Bagudu\u2019s delegation \u2013 comprising his brother, Ibrahim Bagudu, and London lawyer, Ben Davies, from Byrne and Partners, now a part of PCB Byrne \u2013 met with Asiaciti\u2019s officials, they registered his preference for a new structure of secrecy to oil the flow of his dirty wealth for the benefits of himself and his family.\n\n\u201cIn 1997, some 13 years earlier, Mr Bagudu had structured offshore holdings Ridley Trust and Ridley Group in notorious tax and secrecy havens, Guernsey and the British Virgin Islands, positioning himself as the unseen but ultimate beneficiary. But in 2010, he wanted to terminate the Ridley structure and transfer his assets into another structure, hence the need for Asiaciti\u2019s service in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe reason, according to a 2010 Asiaciti memo, was control. As noted in the memo, Ibrahim told the February 2010 meeting that his brother, Mr Bagudu \u2013 \u201cthe client\u201d \u2013 had become \u201cdisillusioned\u201d with institutional and independent trustees (of the Ridley Trust) as they (he and his brother) had no control over their action or inaction and suggested they feared they could lose the hidden assets.\n\n\u201cHe then insisted that any new trustee arrangements to be erected in Singapore \u201cmust ensure that the family cannot lose \u2018control\u2019 of the assets,\u201d PREMIUM TIMES said in its report.\n\n\u2018Millions in cash transferred abroad\u2019\n\nThe report added in months that followed, 99 million euros in cash and securities was then transferred from Ridley to a new structure enabled by Asiaciti, which brushed aside red flags about Bagudu\u2019s controversial background and source of his wealth.\n\n\u201cAsiaciti acted with advice from Farrer and Co. and Byrne and Partners, now a part of PCB Byrne, documents showed,\u201d the report read.\n\nThe Bagudu Blue structure\n\nDocuments showed that Asiaciti helped Bagudu to set up a multi-layered structure with footprints in at least three countries, namely Singapore, Cook Islands, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the head of the structure is Blue Holdings Trust, registered in Cooks Island as a \u201cpurpose trust\u201d to \u201cwholly\u201d own a Singapore-incorporated private trust company, Blue PTC Pte Ltd., with Bagudu\u2019s brother, Ibrahim, and an Asiaciti nominee as directors.\n\nThe Blue PTC Pte Ltd is in turn the trustee of two family trusts \u2013 Blue Family Trust (1) and Blue Family Trust (2).

          "title": "Report Reveals How Kebbi Gov, Atiku Bagudu Hid Billions Amassed Through Abacha",
          "text": "Governor Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi State is currently in the eye of the storm over the controversial wealth he allegedly got through General Sani Abacha, a former Head of State.\n\nThere have been reports on how Bagudu used phoney companies to siphon and move funds allegedly stolen by Abacha but the governor has denied the stories.\n\nIn a fresh controversy, Pandora Papers, one of the biggest leaks of financial documents in the world, has uncovered how Bagudu dispatched a delegation to Singapore in search of a new haven to shelter which is a target of ongoing forfeiture proceedings by the United States Department of Justice.\n\nPandora Papers investigation \u2013 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, including more than 600 journalists, including some from PREMIUM TIMES, reported that huge funds, warehoused offshore, is part of billions of dollars Bagudu helped the Sani Abacha family to steal from Nigeria in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cReferred by Farrer and Co., a prestigious centuries-old London law firm that has represented the British royal family, Bagudu\u2019s choice of secrecy provider in Singapore was Asiaciti Trust, an entity notorious for helping clients hide behind opaque offshore trusts to launder dirty money across borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Monetary Authority of Singapore, MAS, imposed a fine of one million and a hundred thousand dollars on Asiaciti in July 2020 for \u201cserious breaches\u201d of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations between 2007 and 2018.\n\nBagudu\u2019s brother fingered in \u2018dirty wealth\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen on February 23, 2010, Mr Bagudu\u2019s delegation \u2013 comprising his brother, Ibrahim Bagudu, and London lawyer, Ben Davies, from Byrne and Partners, now a part of PCB Byrne \u2013 met with Asiaciti\u2019s officials, they registered his preference for a new structure of secrecy to oil the flow of his dirty wealth for the benefits of himself and his family.\n\n\u201cIn 1997, some 13 years earlier, Mr Bagudu had structured offshore holdings Ridley Trust and Ridley Group in notorious tax and secrecy havens, Guernsey and the British Virgin Islands, positioning himself as the unseen but ultimate beneficiary. But in 2010, he wanted to terminate the Ridley structure and transfer his assets into another structure, hence the need for Asiaciti\u2019s service in Singapore.\n\n\u201cThe reason, according to a 2010 Asiaciti memo, was control. As noted in the memo, Ibrahim told the February 2010 meeting that his brother, Mr Bagudu \u2013 \u201cthe client\u201d \u2013 had become \u201cdisillusioned\u201d with institutional and independent trustees (of the Ridley Trust) as they (he and his brother) had no control over their action or inaction and suggested they feared they could lose the hidden assets.\n\n\u201cHe then insisted that any new trustee arrangements to be erected in Singapore \u201cmust ensure that the family cannot lose \u2018control\u2019 of the assets,\u201d PREMIUM TIMES said in its report.\n\n\u2018Millions in cash transferred abroad\u2019\n\nThe report added in months that followed, 99 million euros in cash and securities was then transferred from Ridley to a new structure enabled by Asiaciti, which brushed aside red flags about Bagudu\u2019s controversial background and source of his wealth.\n\n\u201cAsiaciti acted with advice from Farrer and Co. and Byrne and Partners, now a part of PCB Byrne, documents showed,\u201d the report read.\n\nThe Bagudu Blue structure\n\nDocuments showed that Asiaciti helped Bagudu to set up a multi-layered structure with footprints in at least three countries, namely Singapore, Cook Islands, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAt the head of the structure is Blue Holdings Trust, registered in Cooks Island as a \u201cpurpose trust\u201d to \u201cwholly\u201d own a Singapore-incorporated private trust company, Blue PTC Pte Ltd., with Bagudu\u2019s brother, Ibrahim, and an Asiaciti nominee as directors.\n\nThe Blue PTC Pte Ltd is in turn the trustee of two family trusts \u2013 Blue Family Trust (1) and Blue Family Trust (2). Under each trust, then, is a Singapore family-owned investment holding company, FHIC, Blue Holdings (1) Pte Limited, and Blue Holdings (2) Pte Limited, respectively.\n\nEach of the FHIC has an investment account with Waverton Investment Management, formerly JO Hambro Investment Management, and James Hambro and Partners, both London-based firms.

          "text": "Operatives of the Nigeria Police Special Tactical Squad have arrested a nine-man syndicate of high-profile kidnappers that specializes in the abduction of travelers on major highways in the North-Western region of the country.\n\nThe suspects are: Bashir Sule, 25; Abubakar Haruna, 30; Babangida Bature; Aliyu Idris, 24; Adam Jafar, 26; Usman Idris; Yusuf Idris, 45; Sale Musa, 25 and Umar Sale, 22.\n\nThey were arrested following investigations by the Police team which uncovered plans by the syndicate to carry out a major abduction of travelers along the Kano-Katsina expressway.\n\nA statement issued by Force Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba on Tuesday said police investigations revealed that the modi operandi of the syndicate involve the principal suspect, Bashir Sule taking a commuter bus to a motor-park, acting as a driver, to convey passengers.\n\n\u201cBashir, while driving to the expected destination, stops at an agreed meeting point where his other gang members swoop in, attack, rob and abduct the passengers.\n\n\u201cThe criminals thereafter contact the families of the victims for ransom before their release. Investigations further revealed that the principal suspect, Bashir, sometimes joins commuter buses as a passenger and in the course of the journey provides information to his other gang members who then lie in wait for the innocent co-travellers. Bashir in both instances, acts as a victim who barely escaped the attack.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the police team arrested an 11-man notorious gang for their involvement in series of violent crimes including kidnapping, armed robbery, illegal possession and illicit sale of prohibited firearms.\n\n\u201cThe gang which has two female members \u2013 Hafsat Adamu, 24-years old and Aisha Ibrahim, 30-years-old \u2013 rely on these women to transport their weapons from one point to another, taking advantage of the innocuous look and sentiments associated with their gender,\u201d Mba explained.\n\nMba also disclosed that the Police arrested a trans-national car theft syndicate that specializes in stealing cars from Nigeria and smuggling same to Niger Republic and other neighbouring countries.\n\nHe said 15 cars were recovered from the suspects, with two jamming devices which aid the suspects in moving the stolen vehicles undetected.\n\nMba said the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, while reiterating the commitment of the Force to the protection of lives and property in the country, called on motor park operators to ensure adequate screening of their drivers and vehicle owners before permitting them to operate in their motor parks.\n\n\u201cThe IGP noted that thirty-four (34) suspects including 32-male and 2-female were arrested. Eleven (11) high-calibre grenades, eleven (11) sophisticated firearms, fifteen (15) stolen cars, two (2) vehicle jammers, three hundred and eighty-nine (389) AK-47 ammunition, amongst others, were recovered from the suspects.\n\n\u201cAll the suspects will be charged to court on conclusion of investigations,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "There Is No Peace In South East Despite Our Departure \u2013 Miyetti Allah",
          "text": "Despite their departure from the South-East and the enforcement of the anti-open grazing law, Fulani herdsmen affiliated with the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore claim the region remains insecure.\n\nThe spokesman for the group, Saleh Alhassan, stated this during a chat with PUNCH Live on Tuesday, adding that the development was evidence that Fulani herders were never the problem.\n\nHe said that there was no more open grazing in most parts of the South-East but only cattle trading, adding that the cows being sold in the South-East mostly belong to Igbo traders.\n\nAlhassan stated, \u201cThat nonsense you see in the South-East is a manifestation of frustration\u2026 They will continue burning their cities, killing themselves.\n\n\u201cNow that the herders are not there, they are still killing themselves. Sometimes they wear Fulani attires to continue to commit heinous crimes.\n\n\u201cNow that the herders are not there, are they having peace in the East?\u201d\n\nAlhassan added that the constant sit-at-home orders given by the Indigenous People of Biafra which were being violently enforced had led to the loss of cattle, hence the exit of Miyetti Allah.\n\n\u201cThose Biafrans are shooting and killing their animals. Those making noise in the media are cattle traders. They will not go anywhere. The cows you see there now belong to the Igbo,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Miyetti Allah spokesman said the group would not obey the anti-open grazing law being passed in most parts of the South because open grazing remains a way of life.\n\nHe said that the group would be suing all the states enforcing the law, adding that Miyetti Allah would also make political and spiritual steps.\n\n\u201cFirst, we take legal action; secondly, we\u2019ll seek a political solution and then spiritual. We will invoke the wrath of God on those opposing the open grazing law,\u201d Alhassan said.\n\nThe Miyetti Allah spokesman also denied reports that Dr. Chike Akunyili was murdered by herdsmen last week.\n\nHe argued that the blanket ban on open grazing in the South was connected to the 2023 elections and was a ploy by southern governors to force their northern counterparts to negotiate for the presidency amid the raging debate on zoning.\n\nAlhassan, however, vowed that the group would never support the presidential ambition of any governor that is enforcing the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe said a governor like Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State who is at the forefront of enforcing the ban on open grazing should forget about getting their support.\n\nWhen asked why herders are not embracing ranching, the Miyetti Allah spokesman argued that ranching was expensive and could not be done overnight.\n\nHe advised governors to set up ranches and then lease them to herders rather than ban open grazing without providing an alternative.",

          "title": "2023 Presidency: PDP under pressure to reverse govs\u2019 zoning arrangement",
          "text": "Ahead of Thursday\u2019s National Executive Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), members and leaders of the main opposition party are mounting pressure on the leadership to reject the zoning arrangement as proposed by the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led committee.\n\nMajority of the PDP governors had voted in favour of zoning national chairman of the party to the North, a development that may have shut out the northern zone from contesting the nation\u2019s presidency.\n\nGroup explains\n\nRejecting the proposal Tuesday in Abuja through a statement by its convener, Reverend Olusola Salau, the PDP National Leaders Forum, called on the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) that is meeting Thursday to jettison what it described as the \u201cself-serving proposal and maintain the status quo.\u201d\n\nThe PDP chieftain said the composition of the Zoning Committee of the party was faulty for the reason that it was lopsided and deliberately skewed to satisfy the interest of a section of the party.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Benue State has five representatives while Osun has no single representative. Even when that observation was raised at the meeting, a certain Governor from the South- South bullied everybody to ignore something as fundamental as that,\u201d Salau said.\n\nThe statement also alleged that some members of the committee used the opportunity of being members of the committee to serve their political interest at the detriment of the party.\n\nThe group said: \u201cWe have it on good authority that one member of the committee who is a Governor in a South-South state was busy offering monetary inducements to sway other members from toeing the logical path. We know who this Governor is and we are aware that he is nursing a presidential ambition. We do not have any objection to his ambition. However, we will not accept a process that will make anyone fetch the presidential ticket of our great party through a manipulative process.\u201d\n\nAlso, the group described the procedure by which the zoning committee rendered its report as \u201cobnoxious and not known to the established pattern of how similar previous reports are presented in the party.\n\n\u201cThe report is self-serving, ridiculous and embarrassing because the PDP NEC empowered and mandated the committee to recommend zoning of party offices. The normal practice is that the report must first be laid before the NEC for consideration and the party will then approve and announce final ratification just like the Governor Bala-led fact finding committee on the 2019 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIts report was laid before the NEC and approved. But in this case, the Governors and zoning committee acted in bad faith and if care is not taken the party will pay dearly for it in 2023.\u201d\n\nAnother area of objection which the group cited bordered on the current zoning arrangement in the PDP which stipulates that the national chairman\u2019s position is supposed to remain in the South.\n\nTherefore, \u201cmust we punish the South alongside the outgoing chairman? Why is the committee in a hurry to throw away the baby with the bath water? For the avoidance of doubt there have been two zoning arrangements in the history of the PDP: one in 2007 and the other in 2017 which was to lapse in 2025. This arrangement gave the south the privilege to produce the national chairmanship of the party till 2025.\n\n\u201cIf there were to be any zoning, it should be amongst the three zones of the South and, in that case, the Southwest that has never attained the position of the PDP National Chairman is more deserving of the position. This is even more so that the next two governorship elections before the 2023 general election will be in Osun and Ekiti. Thus, what will the PDP take to the Southwest to enable the zone to give our party a deserving victory in those two crucial elections?\n\nLastly and more importantly, the group said: \u201cThe PDP has a pedigree of being the only political party in Nigeria that comes to intervene when the country is at a boiling point as it is today. Be it at the time that the country was transitioning from military junta to civilian rule or when the country was burdened with a leadership vacuum that necessitated the doctrine of necessity, the PDP has always been the party that steers the country off the cliffs.\n\n\u201cThis time around, Nigeria needs the PDP to come to its rescue once again. Our party needs to put someone with capacity and experience forward to do this job \u2013 not some characters that can\u2019t even put the national interest ahead of their political ambition in a simple party assignment.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Nigeria has never been this divided and broken and it is expedient on the principle of natural priority that another person from the North, who is more qualified and experienced should be our party\u2019s candidate for the job to get Nigeria fixed.\n\n\u201cIt is not the responsibility of the PDP to toe the line of ethic divisiveness that our main opponents are known for. Ours is a party built on principles and mutual respect for all shades of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that we humbly demand that the National Executive Committee of our great party reject in its entirety the submissions of the zoning committee. Zoning arrangement is a responsibility of the highest decision making organ of the party, not some self-serving governors and their cohorts.\u201d\n\nNorthern youth kick\n\nIn a related development, the Northwest youth wing of the PDP is also against the party\u2019s decision on zoning.\n\nAccording to the PDP youth, the North is yet to complete its term of presidency under PDP as former President Goodluck Jonathan completed late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s tenure and went ahead to run his own first term at the expense of the North.\n\nTo this end, they said the North must complete its outstanding terms of office, vowing not to accept anything less in 2023.\n\nCoordinator of the PDP National Youth Wing, Northwest Zone, Hon. Ibrahim Ahmadu, made the position known Tuesday in a statement in Kaduna.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe recent meeting held by southern governors and the demand that the next president should come from the south would be met with stiff resistance and vehemently rejected.\n\n\u201cWe are going to fight it should the southern governors insist on zoning presidency to the south. Democracy is about equal representation with concerns for equity, justice and fairness, Where is the fairness if after 13 years of reign in the presidency, southerners are still demanding for presidential ticket come 2023?\n\n\u201cSoutherners have enjoyed 13 out of the 16 years PDP has ruled this country. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo ruled for two terms of office (8 years), former President Goodluck Jonathan ruled for a term of 4 years and completed Late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s remaining one year in office (5 years). Altogether power resided in the south for 13 years out of the 16 years PDP reigned in power.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution of PDP stipulates two terms for any political office holder, but late Yar\u2019Adua only spent three year and died while in office.\u201d\n\nThe PDP youth wing further said it would work and mobilise party members across the North to stop the passage of resolutions at the national convention scheduled for October 30th and 31st in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe are battle ready to fight this injustice and insensitive decision and resolutions in the interest of progress and justice.\n\n\u201cPDP is known for grassroots governance and fair democratic decision and these positions we are willing to maintain ahead of the 2023 general elections. We are calling on all party members to rise up now and say \u201cNo to zoning presidency to the South again.\u201d Northerners especially should come together and speak with one voice,\u201d the northern youth further warned.\n\n",

          "text": "Ahead of presentation this Thursday, President Muhammadu Buhari has increased the total expenditure profile of the projected 2022 budget from N13.98trillion to N16.45trllion.\n\nThe increase in the projected budgetary proposals contained in the revised 2022- 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)/ Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP) was forwarded to both chambers of the National Assembly for expeditious consideration.\n\nSpecifically, it also affected the earlier proposed N5.6trillion deficit which now rises to N6.2trillion.\n\nWhile the margin of increase in the projected total expenditure profile is N2.47trillion, that of deficit in the proposed budget is N692billion.\n\nAs contained in the revised MTEF / FSP documents and separately read on the floor of both chambers, the increase in the total expenditure profile of the budget covers additional N100 billion provision made for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for conduct of the 2023 general elections and additional provision of N510 billion in the service wide votes to cater for National Poverty Reduction.\n\nOthers are additional capital provision of N1.70 trillion following projected increases in capital supplementation by N179.1billion, GOEs Capital by N222.1 billion and TETFUND expenditure by N290.7billion.\n\nOthers are Multi-lateral /Bi-lateral Project-tied Loans by N517.5 billion and MDAs Capital Expenditure by N390.5billion .\n\nIn the revised documents, President Buhari said \u201cthe aggregate deficit (inclusive of GOEs and Projected Loans), is projected to increase by N692billion or 3.4% of GDP from 3.05% of GDP.\u201d\n\nThe request titled: \u201cSubmission of the Revised FGN 2022 \u2013 2024 Fiscal Framework\u201d reads: \u201cIt is with pleasure that I forward the Revised 2022-2024 Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTEF) for the kind consideration and approval of the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cThe revision was necessitated by the need to reflect the new fiscal terms in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, as well as other critical expenditures in the 2022 Budget.\n\n\u201cThe underlying drivers of the 2022 fiscal projections, such as oil price benchmark, oil production volume, exchange rate, GDP growth, and inflation rate reflect emergent realities and the macroeconomic outlook, and remain unchanged as in the previously approved 2022-24 MTEF&FSP.\n\n\u201cThe PIA establishes a progressive fiscal framework aimed at encouraging investment in the Nigerian petroleum industry. This significantly alters the Oil and Gas fiscal terms and has necessitated changes in the 2022-2024 Medium Term Fiscal Framework.\n\n\u201cThe fiscal effects of PIA implementation are assumed to kick in by mid-year 2022. The revised 2022-24 Fiscal Framework Is the premised on hybrid of January-June (based on current fiscal regime) and July-December (based on PIA fiscal regime), while 2023 and 2024 are now fully based on the PIA.\n\n\u201cArising from this, and other critical expenditures that should be accommodated in 2022 Budget, the changes to the 2022 Projections in the Fiscal Framework are as follows:\n\n\u201cFederation Account Revenue: a. Gross revenue projection decreased by N341.57 billion, from N8.870 trillion to N8.528 trillion.\n\n\u201cb.

This is to ensure, among others, protection, assistance and strategic provision of sustainable and durable solutions for persons of concern.\n\nThe Project Zero Hunger Initiative will fight food insecurity and stem the threat of famine in our land. The Project will additionally assuage the growing burden of hunger amongst persons of concern. This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "Justin Bieber officially enters the cannabis industry with Peaches, a limited-run weed product that comes in a sleek, stylized preroll joint pack. Peaches is made exclusively with the cannabis brand Palms Premium. Adults and medical cannabis patients across the country can purchase Bieber\u2019s weed beginning on October 4, 2021. It will be sold in four states: California, Nevada, Massachusetts, and Florida.\n\nBieber is a Grammy-award winning artist with a voracious, international fan base that includes 198 million followers on Instagram alone. Bieber\u2019s viral mention of cannabis in the song \u201cPeaches\u201d off of his latest album Justice is the namesake inspiration for this preroll pack.\n\nIn California, you can find Peaches on shelves at select dispensaries including Haven and MedMen, as well as through delivery partnerships with Eaze and Amuse. In Nevada, expect to see the Peaches line grown by Flower One and sold at MedMen and Planet13. In Massachusetts, Peaches will be sold at NETA Dispensaries and in Florida, it will be found at Surterra Wellness retail stores through a partnership with cannabis cultivators at Parallel in both states.\n\n\u201cOur goal with Palms is simply to open the conversation and destigmatize recreational cannabis,\u201d says Tyler Breton, co-founder of Palms. Breton says the Palms brand is for \u201cnot only experienced users, who will appreciate the quality and attention to detail, but first time and casual consumers exhibiting the approachability and benefits of our products.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2018 with headquarters in Hollywood, Palms is an elevated preroll brand that can be found on shelves throughout Nevada and California. Palms and Bieber came together through a mutual connection in the industry: Ceres, Scooter Braun\u2019s cannabis fund. Braun is Bieber\u2019s longtime manager. Ceres is a SPAC that invests in international brands with a focus on cannabis wellness, CBD, and health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty excited about it,\u201d says Noah Annes, co-founder of Palms. \u201cThe whole goal of Palms is to destigmatize cannabis consumption. To be approachable, to be elevated, for people who are less familiar or comfortable with cannabis. To work with Justin is really consistent with our mission.\u201d\n\nBieber has used his celebrity status to be candid about his mental health journey. The musician offered an intimate portrait of his struggles with mental health on his YouTube Original docuseries Seasons.\n\n\u201cJustin [Bieber]\u2019s vulnerability and openness about his mental health struggles impressed us beyond measure, and we knew immediately we would want him to be at the helm of our first-ever collaboration,\u201d says Annes. \u201cWith Justin\u2019s help shining the spotlight on these important topics, we hope to inspire others to talk more freely about both mental health and cannabis consumption.\u201d",

          "text": "Facebook Inc blamed a \u201cfaulty configuration change\u201d for a nearly six-hour outage on Monday that prevented the company\u2019s 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.\n\nThe company in a late Monday blog post did not specify who executed the configuration change and whether it was planned.\n\nSeveral Facebook employees who declined to be named had told Reuters earlier that they believed that the outage was caused by an internal mistake in how internet traffic is routed to its systems.\n\nThe failures of internal communication tools and other resources that depend on that same network in order to work compounded the error, the employees said. Security experts have said an inadvertent mistake or sabotage by an insider were both plausible.\n\n\u201cWe want to make clear at this time we believe the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change,\u201d Facebook said in the blog.\n\nThe Facebook outage is the largest ever tracked by web monitoring group Downdetector.\n\nThe outage was the second blow to the social media giant in as many days after a whistleblower on Sunday accused the company of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation.\n\nAs the world flocked to competing apps such as Twitter and TikTok, shares of Facebook fell 4.9%, their biggest daily drop since last November, amid a broader selloff in technology stocks on Monday. Shares rose about half a percent in after-hours trade following resumption of service.\n\n\u201cTo every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer tweeted, adding that it \u201cmay take some time to get to 100%.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook basically locked its keys in its car,\u201d tweeted Jonathan Zittrain, director of Harvard\u2019s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.\n\nTwitter on Monday reported higher-than-normal usage, which led to some issues in people accessing posts and direct messages.\n\nIn one of the day\u2019s most popular tweets, video streaming company Netflix shared a meme from its new hit show \u201cSquid Game\u201d captioned \u201cWhen Instagram & Facebook are down,\u201d that showed a person labeled \u201cTwitter\u201d holding up a character on the verge of falling labeled \u201ceveryone.\u201d\n\nInside a Facebook group for ad buyers, one member wisecracked after service returned that \u201clots of people searched today \u2018how to run google ads for clients.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook, which is the world\u2019s largest seller of online ads after Google, was losing about $545,000 in U.S. ad revenue per hour during the outage, according to estimates from ad measurement firm Standard Media Index.\n\nPast downtime at internet companies has had little long-term affect on their revenue growth, however.\n\nFacebook\u2019s services, including consumer apps such as Instagram, workplace tools it sells to businesses and internal programs, went dark noon Eastern time (1600 GMT). Access started to return around 5:45 pm ET.\n\nSoon after the outage started, Facebook acknowledged users were having trouble accessing its apps but did not provide any specifics about the nature of the problem or say how many users were affected.\n\nThe error message on Facebook\u2019s webpage suggested an error in the Domain Name System (DNS), which allows web addresses to take users to their destinations. A similar outage at cloud company Akamai Technologies Inc took down multiple websites in July.\n\nOn Sunday, Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, revealed that she was the whistleblower who provided documents underpinning a recent Wall Street Journal investigation and a U.S. Senate hearing last week on Instagram\u2019s harm to teen girls.\n\nHaugen was due to urge the same Senate subcommittee on Tuesday to regulate the company, which she plans to liken to tobacco companies that for decades denied that smoking damaged health, according to prepared testimony seen by Reuters.",
