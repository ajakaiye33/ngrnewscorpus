          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA Consultant Dermatologist and Venereologist at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Dr. Sebastien Oiwoh, has cautioned against constant relaxing and straightening of hair, noting that it can lead to some form of alopecia.\n\nAlopecia is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the partial or complete absence of hair from areas of the body where it normally grows.\n\nAccording to the skin expert, the chemicals found in the relaxer can predispose the user to hair loss.\n\nOiwoh also noted that alopecia can be referred to as baldness or hair loss. According to the consultant dermatologist, alopecia generally means any hair loss on any hair-bearing part of the body.\n\nHe noted that it can occur on one spot or several spots of one or several parts of the body or it can be total loss of hair in any or all hair-bearing parts of the body.\n\nOiwoh stated that while alopecia is commonly reported on the scalp as it is the part of the body with the greatest number of hair, it can also occur in other hair-bearing parts of the body like the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard area, armpits, pubic areas, abdomen, legs, in a person who previously had hair in these areas.\n\nExplaining further, Oiwoh said while there are different causes and types of alopecia, alopecia caused by one\u2019s grooming hairstyle is referred to as central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia.\n\nAccording to JAMA Network Open, a monthly open-access medical journal published by the American Medical Association, \u201ccentral centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is a disease characterised by permanent hair loss in the crown region of the scalp, inflammation, and scarring.\n\n\u201cIt occurs almost exclusively in black women aged 30 to 55 years. It is estimated that CCCA may affect up to 15 per cent of black women, but the precise number of individuals affected in the general population is unknown.\u201d\n\nExplaining how the symptoms of this condition manifest, JAMA Network Open said \u201cCCCA presents as hair breaking and thinning in the crown of the scalp.\n\n\u201cThe area of thinning hair expands over time and progresses to more severe, permanent hair loss. Some patients experience burning, itching, tenderness, redness, scaling (flaking), and acne-like pimples or bumps in the region of hair loss.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further with PUNCH HealthWise, Oiwoh said, \u201cChemical relaxers, straightening of hair, tight braids and other hairstyles, as well as other grooming practices on the hair of an African woman, have been implicated in some forms of alopecia.\n\n\u201cCCCA is the most common scarring alopecia affecting African women. It starts from the crown of the head and may cause itching, scales, and pain.\n\n\u201cIt can result from hair grooming practices although genetic mechanisms have been reported in some Africans.\u201d\n\nOiwoh acknowledged that there is no one treatment for alopecia that can be applied to all types of alopecia.\n\nHe advised that \u201cfor the best management of hair loss, the person involved must first visit the nearest Dermatologist.\n\n\u201cThe comprehensive care is hinged on knowing the specific type of hair loss that can be gotten through specific questions to know the risks or causes.\n\n\u201cThen the general and specific examinations of the affected area as well as all parts of the skin and other parts of the body. This is so because many hair loss forms a part of many other diseases in other parts of the body.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri\n\nABUJA\u2013Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, on Friday, barred journalists from covering the ongoing trial of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe court is billed to rule on an application Kanu filed to quash the 15-count treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against him.\n\nSecurity operatives from the Department of State Service, DSS, and the Nigeria Police Force, had blocked all access routes to the high court premises.\n\nThough accredited journalists were allowed to enter the press centre situated in the court\u2019s basement, they were however denied entry into the courtroom.\n\nA security operative who pleaded anonymity told Vanguard that the order for journalists not to be allowed into the courtroom came from the trial judge, whom he said based her decision on the new practice directions the court issued on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, we have the list of all the journalists here. We did not block anyone on the list from entering the court premises\u201d.\n\nEfforts by the Chief Information Officer of the court, Dr. Catherine Oby Christopher, to help select journalists to enter the courtroom around 12pm, proved abortive, as DSS operatives insisted that the judge was already sitting.\n\nThe court had in the new practice direction, maintained that proceedings in terrorism cases, would henceforth, be held in camera or as may be ordered by the trial judge.\n\n\u201cProceedings of offences of terrorism, subject to the provisions of section 232 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 and section 34 of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011 (as amended), shall be held in camera or as may be ordered by the Court.\n\n\u201cThe names, addresses, telephone numbers and identity of the victims of such offences or witnesses in the proceedings shall not be disclosed in any record or report of the proceedings and it shall be sufficient to designate the names of the victims or witnesses with a combination of alphabets.\n\n\u201cIn any proceedings where the Court deems it necessary to ensure the safety and/or protect the identity of the victim or a witness, it may take any or all of the following protective measures:\n\n\u201cHold its proceedings at any place to be designated by the Chief Judge and in the case of the Abuja Judicial Division, the venue, for the time being, shall be the premises of the Code of Conduct Tribunal;\n\n\u201cReceive evidence by video link; Permit the witness to be screened or masked; Receive written depositions of expert witnesses; Direct that all or any part of the proceedings of the Court shall not be published in any manner;\n\n\u201cExclude from the proceedings any person other than the parties and their legal representatives;\n\n\u201cMake order as to any electronic devices that would be allowed during the proceeding\n\n\u201cMake an order on any other measure that the Court considers appropriate in the circumstances\u201d.\n\nOn the coverage of proceedings in terrorism cases, it read: \u201cThe coverage of proceedings under these Practice Directions is strictly prohibited, save as may be directed by the Court.\n\n\u201cA person who contravenes an order or direction made under these Practice Directions shall be deemed to have committed an offence contrary to section 34(5) of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nKanu, in the application he filed through his team of lawyers led by Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, maintained that the charge against him was legally defective.\n\nHe argued that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try him on the strength of an incompetent charge.\n\nOzekhome, told the court that his client was \u201cunlawfully, brutally and extraordinarily renditioned from Kenya without his consent\u201d.\n\nHe argued that since some of the allegations FG levelled against Kanu, were purportedly committed outside the country, the high court, therefore, lack the jurisdiction to entertain the charge.\n\n\u201cThe charges appear to give this court a global jurisdiction over offences that were allegedly committed by the Defendant, without specifying the location or date the said offences were committed\u201d.\n\nHe argued that under the Federal High Court Act, such a charge must disclose the specific location where the offence was committed.\n\nMore so, Ozekhome contended that Kanu could not be charged with belonging to an unlawful organization since the action of FG, in proscribing the IPOB, is still subject to legal dispute at the Court of Appeal and therefore subjudice.\n\nConsequently, Ozekhome urged the court to dismiss the charge, as well as to discharge and acquit the Defendant of the entire 15-count charge pending against him.\n\n\u201cThis case is hollow, there is nothing in it. It is dead on arrival. Elements constituting the offence must occur within the jurisdiction of this court\u201d, he argued.\n\nHowever, FG\u2019s lawyer, Mr Shuaibu Labaran, prayed the court to strike out Kanu\u2019s application and order the Prosecution to open its defence.\n\nHe argued that the application would touch the substance of the case that is yet to be heard.\n\n\u201cThe position as of now is that the IPOB is a proscribed organization which was duly proscribed through the due process of law\u201d.\n\nHe argued that Section 32 of the Terrorism Prevention Act imbued the court with the requisite jurisdiction to handle the trial.\n\n\u201cWe urged my lord to refuse the application to pave way for the commencement of the trial in Ernest.\n\n\u201cThis is a matter that has been pending for over five years now\u201d, the Prosecution counsel added.",

          "text": "By Dayo Johnson, Dapo Akinrefon & Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\n\u2022It\u2019s an obnoxious choice \u2014Omo Eko Pataki, PDP\n\n\u2022Ondo Motor Park Mgt C\u2019ttee temporary \u2014Akeredolu\n\nLAGOS\u2014Lagos State Government\u2019s appointment of Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly called MC Oluomo, as Chairman of Lagos State Parks and Management Committee, yesterday, generated angry reactions, as the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and a socio-political organisation, Omo Eko Pataki, described it as an obnoxious choice.\n\nThe state government, however, justified the decision, saying it was aimed at restoring sanity within the National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW.\n\nThis followed a lingering leadership crisis between the NURTW and its Lagos council, led by MC Oluomo, whose leadership had been dissolved by the national body.\n\nThe state government had suspended the NURTW operations in all parks and garages, following the tension sparked by some events in the union.\n\nCommittee members\n\nMembers of the committee are Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Hakeem Odumosu (retd) (Government Liaison Officer); Musiliu Akinsanya (Chairman), Sulyman Ojora (Deputy Chairman), and Dr Taiwo Salaam (Secretary).\n\nOthers are Messrs Olayiwola Lemboye, Mustapha Adekunle, Ganiyu Shittu, Mukaila Runsewe, Sulyman Yusuf, Mufutau Mutiu, Yinka Hassan, Sunday Ogunleye, Moshood OmojowaI, Ismaila Aigoro, Ibrahim Yusuf, Akeem Tijani, Mrs Omolabake Adelakun, Kazeem Hassan, Wasiu Amole, GaniyuAyinde, Anthony Adeboye, John Owolabi, Saburi Salami, Ibrahim Onitiju and Odusanya Gbenga.\n\nAnnouncing the setting up of the park management committee, the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, in a statement, explained that the measure was in fulfilment of the state government\u2019s promise to ensure that events in the NURTW were not allowed to threaten law and order.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe State Government has, therefore, exercised its constitutional powers to ensure that no vacuum, which can disrupt the peace of our dear State, is allowed to exist in the parks. \u201cThis is a duty we owe all Lagosians and visitors.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that members of the committee have been contacted and directed to report to the Ministry of Transportation, Alausa Secretariat, Ikeja today for further briefing.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate \u2014Lagos PDP\n\nA former member of the PDP caretaker committee, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cThat tells you the level of indiscipline that we have in the Lagos State government and that tells you the kind of patronage the Lagos State gets from them. If the national body could rise to their task of trying to curb the menace of these miscreants and the Lagos State government deems it fit to promote them in that light, it is unfortunate. I wonder what that portrays for the upcoming youths.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an obnoxious choice \u2014Omo Eko Pataki\n\nFaulting the choice of Oluomo as chairman of the parks committee, the Omo Eko Pataki described it as an obnoxious choice adding that the state government committed a grave tactical error.\n\nThe Secretary-General of Omo Eko Pataki, Prince Uthman Shodipe-Dosunmu said: \u201cWe read with dismay and utter disgust the alleged appointment of one MC Oluomo as the Chairman of Lagos State Parks and Management Committee. This very inappropriate step is coming after the said Oluomo had been fired and the branch he led has been dissolved by the national body of NURTW.\n\n\u201cThe Babajide Sanwo-Olu government has committed a grave tactical error in aligning with Oluomo whose reign as the Lagos state chairman of NURTW has been marred by killings, maiming, looting and general dislocation of our dear state.\n\n\u201cWe, at Omo Eko Pataki, believe that the Sanwo-Olu government has made a very wrong and tendentious choice in this instant. It also demonstrates that Sanwo-Olu\u2019s government is either complicit or indifferent to the activities of Oluomo. Either way, the choice of this person does not signify any seriousness in the acme of government in Alausa. It demonstrates aiding and abetting of a goon squad activity in a megalopolis like ours. We reject in totality this obnoxious choice.\u201d\n\nMotor Park Mgt C\u2019ttee temporary\u2014Akeredolu\n\nMeanwhile, the Ondo State government, yesterday, stated that the inauguration of a 21-man Motor Park Management Committee, following the sacking of the NURTW in the state was a temporary measure toward resolving the crisis within the union.\n\nNo fewer than 10 members of the union were injured during a bloody clash between the supporters of the newly installed committee and the faction against the imposition of the Union\u2019s former state chairman, Jacob Adebo, as the chairman of the motor park committee.\n\nAddressing newsmen in Akure, the information and Orientation Commissioner, Mr Donald Ojogo, said: \u201cThe inauguration of a 21-man Motor Park Management Committee was a temporary measure toward resolving the crisis rocking the union in the state. The temporary measure is to meander our way through.\n\n\u201cIt is not to erode the functions of the NURTW, and those put at the helms of this park should not see it as a permanent arrangement.\n\n\u201cThe committee was not to place any of the warring groups above another, but as a responsible government, it must ensure the smooth running of the parks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to pitch the groups against each other because the state government remains unbiased and does not intend to subjugate one group above another.\u201d\n\n\u201cMechanisms have been put up for continuous dialogue until the matter is resolved.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, normalcy has returned to major motor parks in Akure after the clash as armed police officers were still manning all the major motor parks in the state capital.",

          "text": "*Receives N40m purchased forms\n\nBy Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo\n\nGOVERNOR Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has yielded to the call from some Nigerians through a human rights media outfit, the Brekete Family, to join the 2023 presidential race.\n\nEmmanuel made his acceptance of Nigerians call known at Government House, Uyo Thursday evening, when he received the N40million Expression of interest and nomination form of his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) purchased for him by the popular Brekete Family Radio/TV show.\n\nHe specially thanked the Founder of the media organization, Ahmed Isah and his team who contributed their money to purchase the presidential nomination form for him, stressing that he was overwhelmed by the great confidence bestowed on him by Nigerian citizens.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the media group had sought the consent of God before embarking on the venture, adding that what Nigeria needs now is leader with the capacity, sincerity of purpose, and readiness to make sacrifices.\n\nHis words: \u201cI appreciate this gesture.Be rest assured that I have accepted the form I have accepted this nomination form. All Nigerians cannot come together to give me something and I will refuse it.\n\n\u201d Honestly, when I heard this plan to buy me a Presidential nomination form was going on, I asked myself, how can they raise up to N40million to go and buy me a form? .But today it has become a reality.\n\n\u201cThere are over 200million Nigerians, but you chose to accord me this honour and privilege. I don\u2019t take this for granted. I really want to appreciate this family, I register my appreciation to all Nigerians for this confidence.\n\n\u201cThis is a job well done. And a job well done means more job to be done. You have taken the first step, go all way out and take all the steps and achieve results. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not the effort that matters, but the results\u201d\n\nThe Governor, however, frowned at a situation where high level qualifications and experience was set as requirements to engage someone to manage organisations, but only a Secondary School Certificate required constitutionally, to manage a country with over 200million people.\n\nHe stressed that certain things must be corrected in 2023, in order to move the country forward, and therefore advised that Nigerians must joins hands to make that better Nigeria that they crave a reality.\n\n\u201cMoney is a principal thing. Nigeria today needs someone who understands money. It is unfortunate that if we are looking for a Managing Director of a particular company, the CV we seek, spans 3-4 pages, but when we are looking for a President of the country, based on the constitution, all we need is WAEC, no experience.\n\n\u201cIn business if one can manage a kiosk, he can manage a shop, if he can manage a shop, it means he can manage a supermarket. So any governor who has managed a state well for eight years can manage a country well too.\n\n\u201cWhatever we can achieve as a country can never be a one-man-show. I believe everybody should join hands and make sure that we get it right in 2023\u201d, governor Emmanuel advised.\n\nPresenting the nomination form to the governor the leader of the delegation, Mr Innocent Orji explained that their decision to purchase the presidential forms came after a delegation from the organization visited the state to critically assess and evaluate his performance.\n\nOrji, popularly known as Scaffold said\n\nthat the tour actually affirmed what the governor had told them during a Television interview in January 2022, and assured that they work hard to ensure he emerged as the next president in 2023.\n\nOrji said: \u201cSo we all agreed that if you can do these things in a State, if given that opportunity, you will do even better in the national level. We don\u2019t believe in too much talk, so here today we are presenting to you the nomination form for presidential candidate of your party.\n\nOn his part, a former Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Alhaji Buhari Bala and member of the delegation noted: \u201cAfter that programme, the Brekete Family sent in a delegation to Akwa Ibom State. They spent about three days here and sent in a report.\n\n\u201cAnd in that report, they said what they found on ground was more than what you told them during the live TV programme. For that reason, a decision was taken by Brekete family, that when the time comes they will contribute money to purchase a form for you to contest for the position\u201d",

          "text": "The Northern Youth Vanguard has lambasted the Arewa Youth Assembly for warning the Federal Government of Nigeria over a pipeline surveillance contract allegedly awarded to High Chief Government Ekpemupolo aka Tompolo.\n\nThe Northern Youth Vanguard decried the position of the Northern Youth Assembly as very embarrassing and shameful considering the plethora of security challenges facing the country and particularly the north, it said the group should bury its head in shame.\n\nThe group wonders how any right thinking northern youths would questions the federal government over trying to solve the insecurity challenges in the country, it said we have all been witnesses to the media coverage the last couple of days as investors and other stakeholders in the oil and gas sector, the nation\u2019s most critical assets have cried out over the parlous state of the oil industry, we have all heard that as much as 95 percent of our crude oil production is being stolen by criminals and economic saboteurs, this is alarming and clearly unacceptable in any government more so in a Buhari\u2019s administration that came on board with the anti corruption mantra.\n\nIt said the government has the prerogative to secure the critical economic assets of the nation and as such can delegate the contractual obligations to a capable entity that can secure the pipelines and add value to the nation\u2019s resources and security.\n\nThis nation at this critical cross road cannot add the vandalization of pipelines and the continues and brazen pillaging of its main revenue earner and economic mainstay to the humongous challenges it is already facing \u2013 security and other wise. This is beginning to look like a sabotage to the nation and current government, it seems the intention is to cripple government.\n\nIt wondered how northern youths could misplace its priorities in the face of the bedlam of security and other social challenges tearing the region apart, our once peaceful region has now become notorious and infamous globally for acts of terror that would make even the devil cringe, for the first time we are now faced with existential threats that is savagely tearing apart our once closely knitted communities in the north and yet a section of our collegiate youth leadership have the luxury of time to warn the federal government over pipeline surveillance contracts in the Niger Delta.\n\nIt said if at all, there is so much the northern youth groups and communities should learn from Tompolo and the other youth leaders of the Niger Delta region, it said Tompolo provided a selfless and cohesive leadership that highlighted the Niger Delta\u2019s region plight to the world and when criminals embedded its activities and started derailing from its lofty objectives ostensibly using the cover of the holistic agitations to terrorise the region\u2019s communities and waterways, the youth leadership of the Niger Delta under Tompolo arrested the situation and purged the vast water ways and communities of the Niger Delta of these sea pirates and other criminal elements, today the Niger Delta is better for it, its unalloyed demands today is well articulated before the world. The Northern Youth Vanguard spokesman rhetorically asked \u201d can we have the courage and leadership resolutions like Tompolo and his fellow Niger Delta Youth activists so that we can begin to take back our lives and communities from Boko Haram, Bandits, kidnappers, Herdsmen and terrorists that has ravaged and laid bare our north.\n\nThe Northern Youth Vanguard continued, drawing attention to the gory spectre of terror that happened in the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna bound passenger train just some days ago and at the Kaduna Airport, it concluded our priorities should be focused on drawing the world\u2019s attention to the daily acts of terror in the north and the ever growing number of our displaced and scarred people, particularly women and children. It called and challenged the Arewa Youth Assembly to take a tour of the ravaged communities in the north and come up with ideas for solutions to the present quagmire in the northern region.",

          "text": "Consistent with its recognition of the academia as a central stakeholder in its commitment to linkages and local development sphere of Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications sector, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has awarded fresh research grants and endowed professorial chairs in some Nigerian universities in the sum of N233 million.\n\nFrom the total sum, N172.5 million was awarded to support 13 proposals found to have met the stipulated criteria in the advertised 2021 Request for Proposal (RfP) for Telecommunications-Based Research Innovations from Nigerian Tertiary Institutions (research grant) Programme. Additionally, three universities received the sum of N20 million each for the endowments of the professorial chair by the Commission.\n\nSpeaking at the award ceremony, which took place at the Commission\u2019s Head Office in Maitama, Abuja, on Thursday, April 7, 2022, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the event demonstrated Commission\u2019s strong resolve in advancing the impact of digital technologies on the national economy, using indigenous products and solutions.\n\nWhile presenting award letters to the Lead Researchers of the beneficiaries of the 13 research grants, Danbatta said, under the Telecommunications-Based Research Innovations, tertiary institutions submit a detailed and well-thought-out research proposal, on specific thematic areas provided by the Commission. The proposal is expected to result in the development of commercially-viable prototypes as concrete harvests.\n\nAccording to Danbatta, in 2021 RfP, the Commission received a total of 55 research proposals that focused on five emerging technology areas, namely: Fifth Generation (5G) deployment; Innovative Clean Energy; Advanced Method of Quality of Service (QoS)/Quality of Experience Management and Test Mechanism; Internet of Things (IoT); Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) Technology; and Monitoring and Localising of Drones.\n\n\u201cAfter thorough evaluations, 13 proposals were found to have met the stipulated criteria. Indeed, this is a clear testimony to the objectivity and painstaking approach to the evaluation process aimed at ensuring that the best quality is achieved and only researches that could produce prototypes with the potential of providing solutions to both local and global challenges were selected,\u201d Danbatta said as he congratulates the 13 successful research awardees.\n\nThe EVC also presented dummy cheques of N20 million each to the Vice-Chancellors of three Nigerian universities, namely: University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State; Usman Danfodio University, Sokoto; and Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State, who are the beneficiaries of the NCC\u2019s Professorial Chair Endowments.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has endowed professorial chairs in tertiary institutions across the country, as a mechanism in entrenching innovations in our tertiary institutions, as well as having graduates that are \u201cindustry-ready\u201d.\n\nThe endowment of professorial chairs in universities is one of the Commission\u2019s initiatives in supporting the academia to focus on research in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in order to enhance the advancements of emerging technologies,\u201d Danbatta stated, to underscore the purpose for instituting professorial chairs in tertiary institutions.\n\nThe fresh endowment in the three universities brings to seven, the number of universities that the Commission has endowed professorial chairs. Earlier, the NCC had instituted professorial chairs at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo State; Bayero University, Kano, Kano State; Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi State; and University of Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nMeanwhile, the EVC stated that while the implementation of the endowment is through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Commission and each benefitting university just as the Commission recently included the sighing of MoU as part of the implementation of the Telecommunications-Based Research Innovations.\n\nThe EVC stated that with the latest awards and endowments, the Commission has committed more than N660 million to Nigerian tertiary institutions for ICT-focused research innovations.\n\nThis is in demonstration of commitment to driving the attainment of the goals of the Federal Government\u2019s agenda on the digital economy, as captured in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), 2020-2030.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, NCC\u2019s Head of Research and Development (HRD), Kelechi Nwankwo, thanked the EVC for his vision to continually deepen collaboration between the Commission and the Academia.\n\nNwankwo expressed optimism that the Management of the Commission would continue to allocate the requisite resources to research, development and innovations that are necessary for the industry to continue to contribute to the socio-economic development of the country.\n\nThe HRD said the initiatives which are policy-driven were instituted as proof of the Commission\u2019s appreciation of the importance of working with stakeholders to engender innovations and build indigenous technological capabilities that would strengthen the ICT ecosystem, not only in the provision of services but also in the development of the communications manufacturing and supply sector within the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe said collaborations such as the one with academia are in line with the NCC\u2019s Strategic Management Plan (SMP), 2020-2024 because strategic partnering has been identified as a critical pillar for the attainment of NCC\u2019s corporate objectives.\n\nNwankwo encouraged the beneficiaries of the research grants and the universities that benefited from the endowment of professorial chairs, to put the financial resources into proper use that will produce research outputs that address societal problems and contribute to further growth of the telecoms sector.\n\nExpressing appreciation on behalf of the beneficiaries, the Vice-Chancellor, Usman Danfodio University, Prof. Lawal Bilbis, assured the Commission that the funds will be put to judicious use.",

          "text": "By Faith Yahaya, Abuja, AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna and Okodili Ndidi, Abuja\n\n\u2018My expectant sister, husband with terrorists\u2019\n\nProtesting pastors seek bombing of bandits\n\nDHQ to Nigerians: don\u2019t despair\n\nAn expectant mother and her husband, a couple and two sisters are among those being held by terrorists who attacked an Abuja-Kaduna train, it was learnt yesterday.\n\nAliyu Mahmud, a relative of the seven-month pregnant woman, was among the victims\u2019 families who staged a peaceful protest at the Radio House in Abuja yesterday.\n\nThe protesters, who bore placards, spoke with reporters.\n\nTerrorists on March 28 blew up rail tracks on the Abuja-Kaduna route, killing eight passengers.\n\nNo fewer than 41 people were injured. Many were abducted.\n\nOf those abducted, Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA) Alwan Ali-Hassan was freed on Wednesday.\n\nThe terrorists threatened to kill the other hostages if the government does not do \u201cwhat we want\u201d.\n\nThe families urged the Federal Government to double its efforts in rescuing their loved ones.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters yesterday assured Nigerians that it was working towards ending all forms of terrorism.\n\nMahmud said: \u201cI have my sister who is seven months pregnant with her husband.\n\n\u201cWords cannot explain what they are going through and what we are going through.\n\n\u201cPlease, the government should do the needful and let this come to an end as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cThey should try as much as possible to reach out to the perpetrators and rescue our loved ones.\n\n\u201cThere are children there, pregnant women, the sick, the aged and only God knows what they are going through.\n\n\u201cThey have been in captivity for ten days, so you can only imagine what they are going through and how it is affecting g us.\n\n\u201cWhatever we do, we think of them. When we eat, we think of them. When we sleep, anything we do, we think of them.\n\n\u201cWe are pleading with the government to please do the needful so that this situation will come to an end as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAnother protester, Aminu Uthman, said it had been some difficult ten days since his brother and wife were abducted.\n\n\u201cMy immediate younger brother and his wife are amongst the victims.\n\n\u201cIt is a nightmare and the most difficult ten days I have has in my life. I cannot sleep or eat. A lot of things are going wrong.\n\n\u201cThe bandits called only once and they gave him the phone to speak to us. They are yet to make any request but they called and he is with them.\n\n\u201cWe voted for this government because of insecurity. We had the trust that they would address insecurity.\n\n\u201cThis protest is not for the family members alone, it is for Nigerians generally. This thing can happen to anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother relative, Hajia Idayat Yusuf, pleaded for the release of her two sisters.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt has been hell for me. My two sisters from the same parents were abducted.\n\n\u201cSome of those abducted have underlying ailments such as ulcers, diabetes, hypertension and there is no medication. We are really concerned.\n\n\u201cIn the last ten days, it has been hell, we cannot sleep, and we cannot eat. We are fasting but we are fasting abnormally.\n\n\u201cWe are really begging that the government should come to our rescue.\n\n\u201cPlease, the government should come to the aid of those that are alive.\n\n\u201cWe are sorry for those that have lost their lives. We sympathise with the families of those in the hospital but for those alive, at least, bring them back.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the government to do something.\u201d\n\nYusuf said the families had received assurances that the victims would be rescued.\n\n\u201cWe were told that the government was making a serious effort to rescue them.\n\n\u201cThey also assured us that no life was lost among those kidnapped and that we should keep praying for their release.\n\n\u201cBut we do not know the efforts of the security agencies. That is why we are here for the government to tell us the position of things.\n\n\u201cThey should sincerely tell us what is happening because our loved ones are there.\u201d\n\nMinister of State for Transportation, Ms. Gbemisola Saraki, said security agencies were working hard to free the victims.\n\nSpeaking at a ministerial briefing, she said: \u201cThe Ministry of Transportation is working with security agencies. It will be premature for us to say too much before the outcome of the exercise.\n\n\u201cI assure you that it is a comprehensive exercise and we implore each and all of us to exercise patience pending the outcome.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about those kidnapped and we assure you that the security agencies are doing the best they can.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are with families of the deceased.\u201d\n\nPastors protest, demand bombing of Kaduna forests\n\nAlso yesterday, some pastors in Kaduna took to the streets to protest the spate of terror attacks, kidnapping and killings in the state.\n\nLike Governor Nasir El-Rufai, they demanded precision bombing of the forests used as hideouts by terrorists and kidnappers.\n\nThe pastors, under the aegis of Interfaith Alliance, terminated the protest at the popular Lagos Roundabout.\n\nThey said enough was not being done by security agencies to stem the rising security crises in the state.\n\nThey also appealed to the government to compensate all the victims of the attacks, award scholarships to their children and rebuild affected communities.\n\nConvener of the Interfaith Alliance, Rev. Emmanuel Adebayo, said: \u201cWe believe that the government is doing their best but their best is not good enough.\n\n\u201cObviously we are not satisfied with the way the government is going about insecurity at the federal level.\n\n\u201cThe government needs to be more proactive. We have been hearing about the cry of our governor; he said he has been taking the reports to those concerned.\n\n\u201cHe said they know where they (terrorists) are and that they listen to their telephone conversations but the responses from the security agencies are not good enough.\n\n\u201cWhat we expect is that the government should carry out precision attacks in the forests in order not to harm innocent people.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the government can monitor their (terrorists) movements through intelligence and then carry out the bombing.\u201d\n\nDHQ to Nigerians: don\u2019t despair\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has enjoined Nigerians not to be weighed down by the recent spate of attacks in some parts of the country.\n\nIt assured that the security agencies remained undaunted in the task of crushing the terrorists and other criminal elements..\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations Maj. Gen. Benard Onyeuko, stated these during his biweekly media parley with Defence reporters in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe military high command wishes to use this opportunity to assure Nigerians on the determination of the Armed Forces, the Police and other security agencies to deal with all terrorists and other criminal elements in the Country. The events of the last few days should not bring despair to the populace.\n\n\u201cThe Armed Forces is committed in its resolve to bring peace back to the country as we are stepping up our operations in all the theatres\u201d.\n\nOnyeuko also disclosed that as of April 5, 51, 114 terrorists and their family members, had surrendered to troops in the Northeast..\n\nThe Defence Operations spokesman added: \u201cIn the last two weeks, \u2026troops took control of terrorist\u2019s stronghold by Ukba/Camp Zairo in the Sambisa Forest where some artillery guns, Armored Personnel Carrier, trailers, and a large cache of arms and ammunition were captured.\n\n\u201cAlso, own troops destroyed terrorist enclaves, captured some terrorists, destroyed terrorists improvised explosive making factory.\n\n\u201cTroops neutralised scores of terrorists arrested 22 terrorist spies and three logistics suppliers; rescued 30 civilians and of more significant was the surrender of a high-profile terrorist, Commander Sale Mustapha (Ibin Kathir).\n\nAsked what the military was doing to prevent operational setbacks like the one in Birnin Gwari, Kaduna State where 17 soldiers were killed, and the recent Abuja-Kaduna train attack, Onyeuko said that security agents were conducting a series of operations that have forced terrorists to flee.",

          "text": "Let\u2019s start with a caveat: free comments are part of democracy, and so this is not an attempt to muzzle anyone. Nobody should come and shout, oh, they don\u2019t want us to say our minds again. They want to padlock our mouths. Not at all. President Muhammadu Buhari is not even the type that would gag anyone, and the polity is today suffused with all kinds of comments, the responsible, and the not so responsible. The inspiring, and the bilious. The encouraging, and the poisonous. The reasonable, and the not so reasonable.\n\nNobody would deny that Nigeria has very severe security challenges, though the intensity often varies from time to time. There are seasons when our courageous security agencies have the upper hand, clobber the criminals black and blue, and things calm down. At other times, they suffer reversals. That is the fair assessment of developments.\n\nBut fair? That word doesn\u2019t seem to exist in the dictionary of some Nigerians who want you to perpetually believe that \u2018worsening insecurity\u2019 is the only thing happening in the country. They never talk of the second Niger Bridge. Loko-Oweto Bridge. Bodo-Bonny road. Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Airports. Rail revolution. Fertilizer availability. Rice and maize pyramids. And many others.\n\nNo, they don\u2019t see those ones. They only talk of how you can\u2019t travel by road, by rail, by air, and how nobody is safe anywhere in the country. How Federal Government is allegedly overwhelmed by security challenges. They trumpet only the things that give the impression of total anarchy. They know what they are doing. It\u2019s all about the struggle for power, for control of the political and economic strings of the country. The allure of power remains sweet to them eternally.\n\nThese instigators cut across all class of people. Former leaders, current political actors, pastors, imams, social commentators, talkshow hosts (and hostesses), so-called human rights activists, socio-political groups, and many others. All they want is to give a sense of anomie in the land, and divert attention from whatever is going right. There is a lot going right, but they never talk of those, simply because of the struggle for power.\n\nWho is that Fulani cattle rearer who dare build a second bridge over the River Niger, something we could only dream of in our 16 years in power? He is even covering the national landscape with rail lines. Who is his father? He\u2019s building new airports, massive expressways, gas pipelines, achieving food security. Come, let\u2019s run him down, even run him out of town, lest he become a national hero. Let\u2019s trumpet the insecurity in the land, till our voices are hoarse.\n\nWhen negative things happen, like the sad and evil attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train, they pretend to be sympathizing with the country. But their choice of words gives them out. They are who the Good Book calls \u201cmiserable comforters.\u201d They are merely adding petrol to a flaming fire, and salt to injury. Under the umbrella of condolence, they are taking potshots at a government they both fear and hate.\n\nThere are comments that exacerbate matters, rather than mollify them. There are words that are meant to incite people against leadership, give them a sense of hopelessness, and encourage them to revolt. That is what these people do. Muhammadu Buhari is their headache, and he must be portrayed as a failure by all means. Give him a bad name, erase his footprints on the sands of time, make him look incompetent, a ne\u2019er do well. That is their motive, and if the country goes up in flames in the process, it doesn\u2019t bother them.\n\nThey pretend to be speaking truth to power, but you can see through the facade, if you are discerning. You can tell the truth without inciting or instigating people against leadership. What they want is chaos, disorder, anarchy, all in the name of \u2018speaking truth to power.\u2019 Liars. Anarchists. People who have not made successes of their own homes or personal affairs, now attempting to dictate how the country should run.\n\nIf a preacher brings down fire seemingly from Heaven, but speaks evil about the leadership of his own country, he impresses me not. Because the Good Book enjoins us to pray for those in authority, for there can be no power, except the one God has ordained. He installs kings, and deposes them. Even as a preacher, Christian, Muslim, God has not ceded that authority to you. He sits in Heaven, and makes the earth His footstool. The clouds of the sky are the dusts of His feet. That is God, and no man should compete with Him. But uncouth language is the stock-in-trade of some preachers today. Words are no longer seasoned with grace.\n\nMost of those who utter incautious, inflammatory words about the state of insecurity in the land, only want power through the back door. Some had never liked Buhari, so he must fail. Others supported him in the past, thinking they would be able to lead him by the nose. When they failed, they said he wouldn\u2019t get a second term in office. Before their very eyes, he coasted to victory. Still they are unrelenting in their opposition. But there\u2019s nothing you can do against a man who God has ordained for certain roles.\n\nIt\u2019s funny to hear some others asking the government to quit. And so, what follows? Disorder. Higgledy-piggledy. People running helter-skelter, insurgents and bandits taking over. They don\u2019t care about the country, nor about the people. When things burst, they take the next flight out of the country on first class seats.\n\nThe security challenges we have are being tackled. Robustly. President Buhari, more than any other leader in the past, has equipped, trained, and motivated the security agencies, who are rising to the occasion, with many of them even paying the supreme price. To be condemnatory of the entire effort is to be unkind, evil, unappreciative.\n\nSome people merely excoriate without suggesting viable alternatives. What can our security agencies do better? How can they do it? No, that is not in their agenda. All they want to see is that Buhari should fail, and fall. But they are not God.\n\nWhat the times call for is an encouragement of our security forces, not wanton denouncement or chastisement of their work and sacrifices. \u2018May God bless our troops\u2019 should be the singsong, not petty politics and grossness.\n\nNigeria will win the war against evil. The Buhari government will win the war of tongues unleashed against it. Happily, majority of Nigerians know the truth. They may not have the platform to speak out like the vocal minority, but they know those truly serving them, and those merely interested in sticking their snouts in the nectar of office. The year 2023 will show.\n\nUnguarded comments can further inflame the insecurity in the land, and it surely does. And those shooting off their mouths know what they are doing. They want things to become topsy-turvy, jumbled, so they can come out and say, \u2018we told you.\u2019 But they won\u2019t succeed, because God is interested in Nigeria, and in the lot of millions of helpless people. That is why President Buhari will land safely, and soundly, to the glory of the Almighty.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "title": "Soyinka Denies Asking Nigerians to Vote for Buhari in 2015",
          "text": "*Says he only urged Nigerians to vote out Jonathan\n\nNobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has denied asking Nigerians to vote for President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Following the poor performance of the President Buhari-led administration, characterized by hardship and worsening insecurity, Soyinka has been at the receiving end of criticisms from Nigerians. Some Nigerians have been blaming him for the role he played in the election of President Buhari in 2015.\n\nHowever, he said he never endorsed President Buhari\u2019s candidacy in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is false to say that I supported the election of Buhari,\u201d he said, adding that what he said at the time was \u201cdo not vote for Jonathan.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that although he didn\u2019t support Jonathan\u2019s second term bid, he now believes the former president \u201credeemed himself in such a magnificent way. Buhari never won the election, Jonathan lost it.\n\n\u201cThere are those who see a problem and say let\u2019s tackle the problem now and there are others who see a problem and say who is responsible for that problem? In other words, they are looking for someone to blame. Jonathan had a chance to win that election, but he blew it,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to him, what he said in 2015 was that if Nigerians elected Mr Buhari, they should support him as a born-again democrat and be allowed to carry out his duties.\n\nHe, however, said President Buhari failed Nigeria at its critical moments. \u201cHe failed when he went to Benue, after the killings by herdsmen, and told the people to live with their neighbours. Having been on the other side of power, he should have had a rethink, but alas, Buhari failed,\u201d he declared.\n\nMeanwhile, Soyinka has criticized the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the election of ex-Osun State deputy governor, Chief Iyiola Omisore, as its National Secretary. He expressed willingness to be involved in legal proceedings to unravel the killers of a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Bola Ige.\n\nAccording to him, the former deputy governor\u2019s choice was like \u2018rubbing the death of late Chief Bola Ige on the faces of Nigerians\u2019 and raised questions over President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pledge to reopen the investigation into the case.\n\nIge, an ex-governor of old Oyo State, was assassinated by gunmen at his Bodija, Ibadan home on December 23, 2001. In 2002, Omisore was arraigned for Ige\u2019s murder but was later acquitted alongside 10 others.\n\nSoyinka, had in a statement last Saturday, said the resumption of an investigation into Ige\u2019s murder was already hamstrung and disrobed of credibility with the emergence of a prime suspect in the case as the National Secretary of the ruling party.\n\nOmisore, who replied to Soyinka\u2019s position in a statement, instructed his lawyer, Kayode Ajulo, to write the Nobel Laureate, demanding a retraction of the comments.\n\nAlso yesterday, Ajulo, in an advertorial published in a national daily, explained how Omisore was discharged by Oyo State High Court of all allegations of complicity in the murder of Ige and going forward, \u201che has been instructed to activate legal processes against anyone for defamation and probable prosecution of any person who continues to make disparaging comments about Omisore not in tandem with the true representation of facts. \u201d\n\nBut Soyinka said there was a need to unearth the circumstances surrounding the death of Ige, which he believes would be of enormous value to the course of democracy and education.\n\n\u201cWe are talking of somebody who was capable of attacking a Minister of Justice, taking off his cap in the palace of the spiritual head of a large group of people, that person is not fit to be seen as national secretary of a ruling party.\n\n\u201cActions of disgracing and humiliating a highly respected individual, a traditional chief, a minister, who was a guest at the revered palace, that action alone and the consequence of it disqualifies whoever initiated that action from aspiring to a respected position.\n\n\u201cWe heard a case of the judge who kept the diary, recording the pressure that he was receiving from very high quarters during that period. There are cases of vanishing witnesses and retraction of statements.\n\n\u201cI say to the leadership of the APC, I\u2019m not talking to Buhari alone, I am saying what has happened to your sensibilities, were you so short of materials even within your party that you have to unleash scorpions on our memories, which we are just managing to forget since that event?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe stated that such a person should have been made an envoy if the party desired to give him a post, but not the secretary of a ruling party. \u201cEven if President Buhari or the APC wanted to reward Omisore, he ought to have been given an ambassador appointment, even if it is to Ukraine and not a national secretary of the ruling party.\n\n\u201cWe are talking of the party of those in charge of the governance and justice of this country; the leadership of APC and I am not talking of Buhari alone. Do you have to unleash scorpions on our memory? It is not Soyinka who provided this. It\u2019s those who were so insensitive, who rubbed that murder in our faces. I will be delighted to go to court so that we can go into details. I ask the APC leadership to have a rethink because the issue will not go away.\n\n\u201cThose who want to go to court because Wole Soyinka said this, I will be delighted, then we can really go into details. Perhaps what we need is a judicial enquiry. The court had done their work; we accepted the verdict of the court. But there is a lot to be unearthed, which are of enormous value to the education and course of democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe nation\u2019s 30-year-old revenue allocation formula would soon be reviewed with a proposal by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) for the reduction of the allocation to federal government by 3.3 percent while the allocation to the 36 states and the 774 local government councils would be increased by 3.07 per cent and 0.44 per cent respectively.\n\nThis is just as President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that he would await the final outcome of the constitutional review process before presenting the report of the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nThe vertical review of the revenue formula also affected Special Funds, with the RMAFC proposing an increase of 0.2 per cent for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of 0.38 per cent for Development of Natural Resources.Speaking yesterday at the State House, Abuja, while receiving the report by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), from its Chairman, Elias Mbam, Buhari stressed that for the nation to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of Government.\n\nIn particular, he noted that the proposal seeks a 3.33% reduction in the current federal government\u2019s allocation and on the other hand an increase of 3.07 per cent and 0.44 per cent for the states and local governments on the other hand.He added that with regards to the Special Funds, the report by the RMAFC proposed an increase of 0.2 per cent for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of 0.38 per cent for the Development of Natural Resources.\n\nThe president recounted that the federal government also made its input into the process of reviewing the vertical revenue allocation formula based on existing constitutional provisions for roles and responsibilities for the different tiers of government.\u201cWe must note the increasing visibility in Sub-national level responsibilities due to weaknesses at that level, for example:\n\nPrimary Health Care; Basic Primary Education; Levels of insecurity, and; Increased remittances to State and Local Governments through the Value Added Tax sharing formula, where the Federal Government has only 15 per cent and the States and Local Government share 50 per cent and 35 per cent respectively\u201d.Buhari said he would have gone ahead to present the revenue allocation report to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nHe, however, explained that since the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula was a function of the roles and responsibilities of the different tiers of government, \u201cI will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process, especially as some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained herein.\u201dHe listed some of the recommendations in the report to include:\n\n\u2018\u2018Establishing local government as a tier of government and the associated abrogation of the state/local government account; moving airports; fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list, empowering the RMAFC to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account as well as streamlining the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula.\u2019\n\n\u2019The president assured members of the Commission that the federal government would immediately subject the report to its internal review and approval processes, while awaiting finalisation of the efforts by the National Assembly.According to him, this strategy, rather than issuing an Executive Modification order, as was done in 1992, was more in line with entrenching our democratic tenets.\n\nHe commended the RMAFC for a job painstakingly done, pledging his unwavering commitment and support to them in carrying out their constitutional mandates.The president also thanked Nigerians, especially the state and local governments, for making their inputs through the broad stake-holder engagement processes that produced the report. \u2018\u2018I am aware that the present revenue allocation formula has not been reviewed since the last exercise carried out in 1992.\n\n\u2018\u2018Considering the changing dynamics of our political-economy, such as privatisation, deregulation, funding arrangement of primary education, primary health care and the growing clamour for decentralisation among others; it is necessary that we take another look at our Revenue Sharing Formula, especially the vertical aspects that relate to the tiers of government.\u2018\n\n\u2018This becomes more compelling as we need to reduce our infrastructural deficit, make more resources available for tackling insecurity, confront climate change and its associated global warming and make life more meaningful for our rapid growing population.\u2019\u2019Buhari said as an advocate for grassroots development, he has always remained committed to ensuring that all tiers of Government are treated fairly, equally and justly in the sharing of national resources.\n\n\u2018\u2018I want to let you all know that I have keenly followed most of the discussions held in the geo-political consultative process and one thing that struck me clearly was the agreement that a review of our vertical revenue formula cannot and should not be an emotional or sentimental discussion and it cannot be done arbitrarily.\u2018\u2018All over the world, revenue and resource allocation have always been a function of the level of responsibilities attached to the different components or tiers of government. \u2018\u2018I am, therefore, happy to note that the discussions were held along these lines and rested squarely on roles and responsibilities as spelt out in the 1999 Constitution (as amended). \u2018\u2018However, I also note that in reaching the final decisions at most of these engagements, not much emphasis was placed on the fact that the Second Schedule of the Nigerian constitution contains 68 items on the Exclusive Legislative List and the remaining 30 items on the Concurrent List requiring both the Federal and State Government to address.\n\n\u201dEarlier in his remarks, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said the RMAFC followed due process in undertaking the exercise, and sought the opinion of the federal government before finalising the report.Giving a synopsis of the report, Mustapha said it was in four volumes, including a summary in the main report.He added: \u2018\u2018Volume 1 contains the various memoranda submitted by the Federal and State Governments as well as the FCT. Volume 2 details the presentation from the academia, civil society, professional bodies, traditional rulers, individuals, as well as women and youth council.\n\n\u2018\u2018To complete the inclusiveness of the stakeholder participatory processes adopted, Volume 3 is a research that captures the body of knowledge that supported the review while Volume 4 is a further distillation of submissions by the State and Local Governments as well as NGOs and Area Councils of the FCT.\u201dAlso speaking, RMAFC Chairman Mbam said the leading philosophy behind the proposed review was guided by the need for distributive justice, equity and fairness as enshrined in relevant Sections of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nHe added that the principles took into cognisance the indivisibility of the country, public opinion and weighted Constitutional responsibilities and functions of the three levels of Government.He announced that the proposed vertical revenue allocation formula advised 45.17 per cent for the federal government, 29.79 per cent for state governments and 21.04 per cent for the local governments.Under Special Funds, he said, the Report by the Commission recommended one per cent for Ecology, 0.5 per cent for Stabilisation, 1.3 per cent for Development of Natural Resources and 1.2 per cent for the FCT.\n\nIn arriving at the new vertical revenue allocation formula, Mbam told the president that the Commission had wide consultation with major stakeholders, public hearing in all the geo-political zones, administered questionnaires and studied some other federations with similar fiscal arrangements like Nigeria to draw useful lessons from their experiences. According to the RMAFC chairman, the Commission also visited all the 36 States and the FCT, the 774 local government areas to sensitise and obtain inputs from stakeholders.\n\nHe added that literature reviews were conducted on revenue allocation formula in Nigeria dating back to pre-independence period while the Commission received memoranda from the public sectors, individuals and private institutions across the country.\n\nExplaining the major reasons for the exercise, Mbam noted that since the last review was conducted in 1992, 29 years ago, the political structure of the country has changed with the creation of six additional States in 1996, which brought the number of States to 36.Correspondingly, he said, the number of local governments councils also increased from 589 to 774.\u2018\n\n\u2018There have been considerable changes arising from the policy reforms that altered the relative share of responsibilities of the various tiers of government such as deregulation, privatisation and the lingering controversies over funding of primary education, primary healthcare.\u201dThe RMAFC chairman noted that while Section 32(b), Part 1 of Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution 9 (as amended) empowers the Commission to review from time to time the revenue allocation formulae; the inadequate and decaying infrastructure, as well as heightened widespread internal security challenges across the country also necessitated the exercise, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Demobilises 30 illegal refineries\n\n*Kyari foresees return to normal production in two months, urges collective action\n\n* Insists pipeline vandalism an elitist business\n\n\n\nKingsley Nwezeh, Udora Orizu in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nAs the battle against crude oil theft, a development that has resulted to severe revenue to the country as well as its inability to meet its production quota, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) yesterday disclosed that it had launched a special operation code named \u2018Operation Dakatar da Barawo\u2019 in order to curb crude oil theft and illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta region.\n\nIt also revealed that 30 illegal oil refineries had been demobilised in the region by the naval troops in the last two weeks.This was just as the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, yesterday expressed optimism that the country would return to normal crude oil production in the next two months, even as he stressed the need for collective action to address the unfortunate situation.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing in Abuja, the Director, Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj Gen Benard Onyeuko, said the new operation in the Niger Delta region was aimed at reinvigorating the already existing operation Delta Safe, with a view to containing economic saboteurs in the region.\n\nOther objectives of the new operations include, \u201cto secure critical maritime infrastructure, create enabling environment for the sustenance of desired level of hydrocarbon production, safe shipping and economic activities, and restore investor confidence in Nigeria\u2019s Maritime domain, among others\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that troops of Operation Delta Safe had continued to dominate the zone and had conducted anti-crude oil theft and anti-illegal oil bunkering related operations at different locations. He listed the locations to include Opuama Celestial, Lolomu Ruler in Warri North Local Government Area, Obodo water-ways in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\nOther locations are: Egbeda, Ibaa, Oduoha, Rumekpe in Emohua Local Government Area, Elele; Ikwere Local Government Area of River State and Brass Creek in Ozobo community in Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\u201dAccordingly, troops discovered and destroyed 30 illegal refining sites, 37 reservoirs, 31 ovens, 12 large wooden boats, two cooling systems, three receivers, three storage pits and a metal drums. \u201cCumulatively, troops within the period under review recovered 12,150,000 liters of illegal refined Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) 4,000 liters of stolen crude oil, three tankers, three vehicles, 73 galvanised pipes, two motorcycles, one bus, one Toyota Camry, Mercedes Benz car,\u201d he revealed.\n\n\n\nKyari Foresees Return to Normal Oil Production in Two Months\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari, while addressing members of the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Upstream investigating reasons why Nigeria had not been able to meet its production quota, said the federal government was not only working on recovery of its production quota, but its sustainability as well.\n\nHe explained that the scale of crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism seen in the host communities was beyond explanation, and has rendered the oil and gas industry unworkable. The GMD while describing vandalism as an elitist business, lamentedthat nefarious activities were forcing production shutdown. Kyari said, \u201cYes, we have not gotten back production, but today, with activities that are going on, we promise that within the next one or two months, we will restore some level of normalcy.\n\nWhat is going on has nothing to do with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\u201cIt is purely activities of thieves, act of vandals which has rendered the industry unworkable and taken us to the level where today, our production is around 1.49 million barrel.\u201cWhat this did also as you may be aware is that the diesel that you see until last week, when we clamped down on some of these illegal refineries were actually coming from these illegal refineries. Until last three weeks ago, most of the diesel that you used in your homes are coming from these refineries and that why when we took them out, we cut off the line of supply by stopping the movement, that\u2019s when you heard that AGO got to N900 per litre.\u201cThat\u2019s not the market price for AGO.\n\nThen obviously, once supply becomes constrained, prices will go up and we are happy that NNPC\u2019s intervention has brought down the price of diesel to normal market price and we are happy to do.\u201cWhy people bought it was because it was cheaper when it was being sold in the market. We are happy that this intervention is working and hopefully in the one or two months, we will bring sanity back. The act of vandals and thieves has gotten to a level where we had to shut down the pipeline and declare force majuro on it.\n\n\u201cAlso the FXTL pipeline. So, as we speak now, there is no production going on there because we can no longer sustain the operation. This is not because we don\u2019t go back to replace pipeline that are damaged. But as we do, we have repeated insertions on these pipeline. It got to a point that when we inject 239,000 barrel per day, we only receive 3,000 barrel per day. There was simply no business for anyone to continue to produce.\n\nWhen you loss about 200,000 barrels per day, even at an average price of $65 per barrel, we lost close to $1 billion between January and March.\u201cFrom January till date, we lost an average of 250,000 barrel per day and at the current price of about $100 to the barrel, even within this short period, we have lost close to $1.5 billion.\u201dHe further revealed:\n\n\u201cIn January 2021, we were producing 239,000 barrel from the line linking Bonny Terminal and we only received 190,000 barrel meaning that we lost about 19,000 barrel to thieves then per day. This situation deteriorated to the extent that by March 7, 2022, it came to zero and so, we shut down the line and declared force Majeure.\u201cEven on our most reliable pipeline, which is the Forcados pipeline, we still loss about 7,000 barrel per day. Needless to say that these are all coming as a result of act of vandals and oil thieves.\n\nSo many interventions have taken place and we have continued to remove the insertions. To put it in context, within a distance of less than 20 kilometers, we removed 85 insertions. So, you can imagine when you are running a pipeline of about 300 to 400 kilometers.\u201d Kyari called for establishment of a special and independent court for speedy prosecution oil thieves.He warned that without speedy prosecution and conviction of the criminals, it would have an impact on the country\u2019s economic outlook and its ability to generate foreign exchange.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number of arrests made by the JTF, even vessel operators have made some arrests and also the Nigerian Navy in the last two weeks. Even more arrests have been made. Many of these illegal refineries are being taken down and also the insertions are being constantly removed and we believe that these interventions will pay off.\u201cAnd we will able to restore production. And this is centrally coordinated.\n\nThere is a coordinated action now because we are using a number of strategies including community-based security outfits. \u201cNo doubts it is a very difficult time and that\u2019s why despite the good intentions of the PIA, no one will produce oil, recover zero and put money back into the business. And that\u2019s why investments are very weak despite the good environment that the PIA has brought. All we need to do is to increase the advocacy so that the legal process takes its cause and prosecutions are done timely.\u201cI will recommend that we set up a special court for this. Such cases will be speedily dealt with, so that it is not just the ordinary \u2018small\u2019 people that you see at those locations that are prosecuted. We know that to sell crude oil in the international market, it is not the business of the ordinary people that you see in these illegal refineries; it is an elitist business and we must have the courage to set up very independent special courts to try cases related to this.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the impact it has on our economic outlook \u2013 our ability to generate foreign exchange and in terms of energy security for this country \u2013 is threatened by a very few people.\u201dSpeaking further, the GMD reiterated President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directive that the NNPC should strengthen its collaboration with security agencies and other stakeholders to tackle oil theft and illegal refineries in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are not helpless. Yes, it\u2019s a very daunting situation, no doubts, Mr. President in his wisdom directed the Chief of Defence Staff to lead a war, clearly it is a way to contain this situation and bring it to the barest minimum. So much is going on needless to say and I can share with you.\u201cThere is a massive activity going on by some government security agencies in collaboration with the industry, NNPC, two regulatory institutions and the Nigerian Army, Navy and Airforce and DSS with the collaboration of another agencies including NIMASA and others. \u201cThey are all working together to contain this situation.\n\nEvery agency of government is involved now. The DSS, EFCC to trace and track the movement of funds, NFIU to also trace movement of funds from all levels and we believe that this will pay off and ultimately, we will contain this situation,\u201d he added\n\n\n\nUrges Collective Action against Oil Thieves\n\nIn a related development, Kyari in his goodwill message at the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), 5th Quadrennial Delegates\u2019 Conference with the theme, \u201cJust Energy Transition: For Oil and Gas Workers Social Welfare and Security,\u201d in Asaba, yesterday, called for urgent collaborative effort of all stakeholders to stem the tide of oil theft. He said the NNPC would continue to partner NUPENG to sustain the production of oil and gas, adding that the sector would remain relevant at all times irrespective of emerging transitions in the energy sector.According to him, though global energy transition was going on, oil would still be available and in high demand till year 2050 and beyond.Kyari said: \u201cLocally, our industry is seriously being challenged.\n\nWe have seen vandalism around our areas of operation not just in the Niger Delta but across the various corridors of our product supply.\u201dThe activities oil thieves that have got to limit that we haven\u2019t seen before, almost bringing this industry to its knees today. \u201cThe NNPC GMD noted that with the current dismally low levels of production, every stakeholder must join hands to fight to sustain the industry to enable it survive for all.\n\nOn his part, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, who was represented by the Secretary to State Government (SSG) Chief Patrick Ukah, while declaring the event open, noted that NUPENG remains a critical and respected trade union in the oil and gas industry, urging the union leadership to always forget harmonious working relation with the management cadre in the oil and gas industry in order to stave off needless friction.The governor stressed the need for all the workers to be abreast of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act in the overall interest of the nation.\n\nAlso, The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, Ayuba Wabba, vowed that labour union would continue to engage the political class to ensure improved welfare for workers.He said that the strike action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) was not unpatriotic, even as he urged the federal government to get back to the negotiation table with a view to addressing the long-standing demands of the university teachers.\n\nHe also described casualisation of workers as evil and tantamount to slavery that must be resisted by workers.Also speaking, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, noted that the petroleum sector plays a key role in the country\u2019s economy and called for diversification from oil to agriculture to address the economic and social crises from the oil and gas industry. He said only a formidable workforce with good welfare could rebuild the failing economy and address all the the challenges in the various sectors including the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Minister of Labour, Dr Chris Ngige, represented by the Delta State Controller of Works, Mrs. Eucharia Ozurumba, lauded NUPENG for its welfare activities but charged the union to sustain struggles for welfare of workers and the fight against casualisation. Earlier in his welcome address, Prince Williams Akporeha, President of NUPENG, said the union would sustain fight against casualisation of oil workers even as he lamented other worrisome aspects of the national life including insecurity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations says global food prices surged by 13 per cent in March, making a giant leap to the highest level ever.\n\nIn its monthly Food Price Index released on Friday, FAO said food prices averaged 159.3 points in March, up 12.6 per cent from February, when it had already reached its highest level since its inception in 1990.\n\nThe Index tracks monthly changes in the international prices of a basket of commonly-traded food commodities.\n\nThe latest level of the index was 33.6 per cent higher than in March 2021, FAO said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest increase reflects new all-time highs for vegetable oils, cereals, and meat sub-indices, while those of sugar and dairy products also rose significantly.\n\nThe report added that they were driven by large rises in wheat and all coarse grain prices largely as a result of the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe Russian Federation and Ukraine, combined, accounted for around 30 per cent and 20 per cent of global wheat and maize exports, respectively, over the past three years,\u201d the report reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWorld wheat prices soared by 19.7 per cent during the month, exacerbated by concerns over crop conditions in the United States of America. Meanwhile, maize prices posted a 19.1 per cent month-on-month increase, hitting a record high along with those of barley and sorghum.\n\n\u201cContrasting trends across the various origins and qualities kept the March value of FAO\u2019s Rice Price Index little changed from February, and thus still 10 per cent below its level of a year earlier.\u201d\n\nFAO said the expected loss of exports from the Black Sea region exacerbated the already tight global availability of wheat.\n\nAccording to the report, vegetable oil prices rose by 23.2 per cent, driven by higher quotations for sunflower seed oil, of which Ukraine is the world\u2019s leading exporter. Palm, soy, and rapeseed oil prices also rose markedly as a result of the higher sunflower seed oil prices and the rising crude oil prices, with soy oil prices further underpinned by concerns over reduced exports by South America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFAO said prices of sugar also rose by 6.7 per cent from February, reversing recent declines to reach a level more than 20 per cent higher than in March 2021.\n\nIt further noted that higher crude oil prices were a driving factor, along with currency appreciation of the Brazilian Real, while favourable production prospects in India prevented larger monthly price increases.\n\n\u201cThe meat price index increased by 4.8 per cent in March to reach an all-time high, led by surging pig meat prices related to a shortfall of slaughter pigs in Western Europe. International poultry prices also firmed in step with reduced supplies from leading exporting countries following avian flu outbreaks,\u201d the report added.\n\nFor African countries like Nigeria, the effect of a surge in global food prices, especially wheat, had seen higher prices in the price of bread and noodles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, African Development Bank (AfDB) unveiled plans to raise $1 billion to boost wheat production in Africa to avert potential food shortages arising from the Russia-Ukraine war.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nCounselling Awareness Month is observed in the United States in April. Today, Friday, April 8, 2022, is Teal Day. Everyone is encouraged to wear teal \u2013 a dark greenish-blue colour \u2013 to support the nationwide effort to raise counsellor awareness and promote mental health.\n\nWhile we are not in the US, I believe now is an excellent time to sensitise you on the importance of counselling.\n\nSo, what is counselling? Counselling \u2013 also known as therapy \u2013 is a therapeutic approach that focuses on a client\u2019s emotional and intellectual experience: how they feel and what they think about the issue for which they have sought help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there is a widespread misconception that therapy is only for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. This is wrong; people seek therapy for various reasons, including discussing their lives and emotional upheavals, resolving conflicts, healing from trauma, and having a safe space to talk with someone who is not a part of their personal life.\n\nCounselling can offer immediate solutions and support. It\u2019s a collaborative effort between the client and the counsellor to clarify issues, explore options, develop strategies, and raise self-awareness.\n\nMost importantly, it isn\u2019t a waste of time because talking about your problem helps you feel better. So, why not give therapy a shot? While you\u2019re thinking about it, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll be discussing today:\n\nNIN-SIM linkage deadline extension\n\nImaliPay\u2019s $3 million seed\n\nFolklore Group\u2019s shift to B2B\n\nUnrelated, but an update is needed. Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form.\n\nIs the NIN-SIM linkage deadline extension really over?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat appeared to be an order that would never be carried out due to its deadline extension is now in effect. That came unexpectedly!\n\nWhat is the gist? On Monday, April 4, 2022, the Nigerian federal government barred all outgoing calls from all Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM) cards not linked to the National Identification Number (NIN) of the telecom subscriber.\n\nFollowing the continuous extension of deadlines, one might have concluded that the government wasn\u2019t serious about the NIN-SIM linkage. To put things in perspective, the deadline has been extended NINE times.\n\nThe initial January 19, 2021 deadline was pushed back to February 9, April 6, May 6, June 30, July 26, October 31, December 31, and finally, March 31, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the minister, the March 31, 2022 extension was granted in response to requests from stakeholders, including citizens, legal residents, and Nigerians in the diaspora. He also revealed that 71 million Nigerians had obtained their NIN, with an average of three to four SIMs per NIN.\n\nAs the famous phrase goes, \u201ceverything that has a beginning has an ending.\u201d I think we might have come to the end of the SIM-NIN-linkage deadline extension. B-but could this really be it?\n\nI mean, won\u2019t some stakeholders and Nigerians in the diaspora file an appeal, given that only 125 million subscribers had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification, and authentication when the order was issued?\n\nMoreover, as of February 2022, Nigeria had 197,768,482 active mobile subscribers across all networks, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecoms industry regulator.\n\nGiven that a single subscriber has more than two lines registered to their name, it appears that approximately 37 million telecom subscribers across networks have been affected.\n\nInterestingly, yesterday, April 7, 2022, at the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters in Alausa, Lagos State, a crowd gathered at the gate, with issues ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. Nonetheless, it appears that a larger number were there to register for their NINs.\n\nTechpoint Africa went on a short trip to confirm the situation but encountered some unpleasant scenes. For an in-depth look at the drama, please read here: NIN-SIM linkage: Worrying scenes at NIMC office, as the Nigerian government directs telcos to block defaulting subscribers\n\nImaliPay\u2019s $3 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to careers, most countries consider full-time work to be the norm. And if you don\u2019t have a 9-5, in some cases, you aren\u2019t regarded as employed and unlikely to be treated with respect. Also, if you appear younger than your age \u2013 as I do \u2013 know that you\u2019re just another adolescent on the street.\n\nAs an example, last year, a 200-level medical student approached me. To them, I was just another student in class 9 (JSS3). This might surprise you, but I get things like that or related to it, and they can be amusing or humiliating.\n\n2020 heralded a new era where the world transitioned to remote work, with COVID-19 leading to an increase in informal employment through digital platforms and innovation, thereby boosting the gig economy.\n\nConsequently, the gig economy in Africa has grown significantly, serving as a temporary measure for consumers when businesses closed during the lockdowns and providing employment for those who are excluded from formal and even informal opportunities.\n\nFor context on the gig economy in Africa, please, read: The gig economy is a big boost, but still a different story in Africa\n\nWhile the gig economy is growing, per research, gig workers in Africa do not have access to certain financial services. And ImaliPay, a \u201cone-stop-shop financial services platform,\u201d claims it addresses this issue.\n\nFounded in late 2020 by Tatenda Furusa and Oluwasanmi Akinmusire, the platform which provides financial services to ride-hailing companies to drive productivity has announced that it has raised a $3 million seed round in debt and equity.\n\nImaliPay, which is already present in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, will use the funds to expand its 50-person team, improve its technology, and expand into new markets such as Ghana and Egypt.\n\nFolklore Group\u2019s shift to B2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing The Folklore Group\u2019s $1.7 million pre-seed announcement yesterday, Thursday, April 7, 2022, the company also revealedf a shift from business-to-consumer (B2C) to business-to-business (B2B) wholesale.\n\nDo you know what B2B and B2C are? If you don\u2019t, please, read this: B2B vs B2C Ecommerce: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nThe funding round was led by Slauson & Co., a Los Angeles-based Venture Capital firm focused on early-stage technology investments, with participation from the Fearless Fund and other notable Black angel investors, including WNBA star Nneka Ogwumike.\n\nFounded by Amira Rasool (CEO) in 2018, the e-commerce company previously sourced, shipped, and did last-mile delivery to customers in 20 countries, including the US. However, that didn\u2019t allow it to grow quickly enough.\n\nWhat changed? A surge in demand for the fashion and lifestyle items the company sold accelerated the startup\u2019s transition to B2B wholesale. Now called Folklore Connect, the company will connect luxury fashion brands in emerging markets with bulk retailers in North America and, later, Europe.\n\nThe company is also launching a new marketplace for fashion brands or platforms to become affiliate partners and The Folklore Edit, an online media site that will feature fashion stories.\n\nThe CEO claims that the Folklore Group is opening up new markets for luxury and emerging brands from Africa and worldwide while also meeting the growing demand from retailers who value diversity and inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\neLimu (CcHub) is hiring a mid-level Game Developer.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, April 4, 2022, after nine deadline extensions, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government directed all telcos to block Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards that have not been linked National Identity Numbers (NIN) from making outgoing calls. A decision that seems to have spurred Nigerians into action.\n\nAt the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters, Alausa, Lagos State, today, April 7, 2022, a crowd gathered at the gate, with problems ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. However, it appears that a larger number were there to enrol for their NINs.\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) ordered all mobile subscribers to link their NINs to their SIM cards. People without NINs were to quickly register or risk being blocked by December 30, 2021.\n\nA decision that seemed questionable, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have your NIN, linking your SIM to your NIN is relatively seamless and can be done by dialling a code specific to your telecom provider or by calling customer care.\n\nHowever, going by the unhappy crowd at NIMC\u2019s office, the prospect of a NIN-SIM linkage could still be a long way off for some people.\n\nTechpoint Africa embarked on a little trip to confirm the situation but met with some unpleasant scenes.\n\nMembers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were on the ground to disperse the crowd. It took over 45 minutes to make it across the gate, even when we had an ID card with PRESS boldly written on it.\n\nUsing forceful methods for crowd control, the Civil Defence Corps flogged Nigerians in the crowd. Sadly, our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, also received a few strokes and a shove on the chest from the trigger-happy corps member.\n\nWhips and batons are used in riots and other violent situations. However, for a civil action like registering for a national identity, we find it worrying that whips, and not more humane solutions, are the preferred method for crowd control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn NSCDC member using a whip on Techpoint journalist\n\nUnnecessary NIN-SIM linkage crowds\n\nA lady at the scene confirmed that her SIM had been banned from making calls. While she could receive calls and use the Internet, she has been unable to make any calls since Monday.\n\nAccording to another lady, she has been coming to the NIMC office since the directive was given on Monday and has not been able to move past the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince Monday, there has been a crowd here. I\u2019ve been coming since Monday.\u201d\n\nA glance at the NIMC website reveals that these crowds and the ensuing whipping by Civil Defense staff could have been significantly avoided.\n\nInterestingly, one of our reporters, who had two of his SIMs blocked was able to quickly remedy this after dialing the respective NIN-SIM linkage codes for both service providers. One of his network providers is yet to block him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the NIMC compound. Some of these people have been here since Monday\n\nFrom the lady\u2019s explanation, she went to an agent enterprise to enrol for her NIN, had received her NIN, and linked it to her SIM. However, she has not been able to make calls since Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you want to use money and to do it in another place, when you bring it, they will say that one is fake,\u201d she said.\n\nNIMC licenses these agents to serve as registration centres for enrolment and retrieval, among other things.\n\nHowever, going by the lady\u2019s story, even people who have registered and gotten their NIN are also affected.\n\nWe also noticed that people who lost their SIMs and had to retrieve them also faced the same predicament. Even though they had valid NINs already linked to the lost line.\n\nHow to validate your NIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-section of the crowd at the NIMC office\n\nPeople in the lady\u2019s predicament and those in the latter situation have to go through a separate process called validation.\n\nSpeaking to staff within the compound concerning validation, we could not glean much.\n\n\u201cYou come here and validate,\u201d the staff said.\n\nWhen asked if it was a new process, she answered in the affirmative. \u201cIt\u2019s better to validate immediately you register.\u201d\n\nApparently, the validation process is usually done along with enrolment, which some people might have skipped for some reasons (including going through backdoors?); having your NIN might not be enough as it may be inactive.\n\nYou can solve this problem using the NIMC app, but you have to make sure to use the number connected to your NIN as you would receive a one-time password.\n\nDear Applicants,\n\n\n\nFor NIN Validation:\n\n\n\n1. Download the NIMC Mobile App\n\n2. Insert your NIN on the App\n\n3. The mobile number tied to you would be shown on the screen pic.twitter.com/ha1gPJYTQZ \u2014 NIMC (@nimc_ng) March 25, 2022\n\nIntriguingly, even though telecom companies can enrol people for their NINs, people on the scene complained that their network providers had redirected them to NIMC.\n\nMeanwhile, we hope you can make do with the information provided above and in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRecently, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Phillip Shaibu flagged-off Lassa fever eradication campaign at Auchi. He called for total neatness and cleanliness within our environments and complete adherence to all preventive measures.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are here again to deal with the disease which is a major concern to government at the moment. Today, we decided to flag off Lassa fever eradication campaign. In 2018, we did a similar thing when Auchi was almost becoming an epidemic centre. With the cooperation of all major stakeholders at all levels, we were able to reduce the impact to a single digit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time, it is not to eliminate Lassa fever but to sustain the process to arrive at a zero digit. This time, we decided that our Royal father, the Otaru of Auchi should host us to quicken the message down to the various communities.\u201d\n\nLassa fever has caused Edo State more harm than any other diseases that has affected this state. Over twenty one persons have died of Lassa fever this year. This disease is preventable because it is transmitted to humans via rats even when it has ravaged our communities.\n\nLassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease. It was first discovered in Nigeria, when two missionary nurses became ill with the virus in 1969. Its name is derived from the village of Lassa, where it was first documented. Lassa fever is a viral infection carried by a type of rat that is common in West Africa. This is one of the most common rodents in equatorial Africa, found across much of sub-Saharan Africa. Lassa fever mainly occurs in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria. However, the Mastomys rat is common in neighboring countries, so these areas are also at risk.\n\nOnce a Mastomys rat is infected with the virus, it can excrete the virus in its faeces and urine, potentially for the rest of its life. As a result, the virus can spread easily, especially as the rats breed rapidly and can inhabit human homes. The most common method of transmission is by consuming or inhaling rat urine or faeces. It can also be spread through cuts and open sores.\n\nThe rats live in and around human habitation, and they often come into contact with foodstuffs. Sometimes people eat the rats, and the disease can be spread during their preparation. Person-to-person contact is possible via blood, tissue, secretions or excretions, but not through touch. Sharing needles may spread the virus, and there are some reports of sexual transmission. Lassa fever can also be passed between patients and staff at poorly equipped hospitals where sterilization and protective clothing is not standard.\n\nSymptoms include: Malaria, sore throat, bleeding in the gums, nose, eyes, or elsewhere, difficulty in breathing, a cough, vomiting and diarrhea, both with blood, difficulty swallowing, hepatitis, swollen face, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, shock, hearing loss, which may be permanent, high or low blood pressure etc.\n\nDeath can occur within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms due to multiple organ failure. However, health organizations hope that current work on vaccine development will be successful. Rehydration and treatment of symptoms can improve the chances of survival if there is an early diagnosis.\n\nThe main focus of prevention is \u201ccommunity hygiene,\u201d to control the rat population. These include: regular hand-washing, storing foods in rodent-proof containers, keeping garbage away from the home, keeping pet cats, avoiding blood and other bodily fluids when caring for sick relatives, following safe burial procedures, using protective equipment in a healthcare setting, including masks and eyewear. There is a test centre at Irrua Specialist Hospital, Irrua, Edo State University, Uzarue and the Edo State Government is presently planning a healthy to establish a centre at Auchi Central Hospital. .\n\nThe Mastomys rat is so widespread that it cannot realistically be eradicated. As a result, the main aim is to avoid these rodents and prevent them from sharing human habitation.\n\nComrade Shaibu said: \u201cIf we have a clean environment, then we are sure of having a healthy living.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

They want him dead. And we believe it is not unconnected with the constant appearance of his name in the forthcoming 2023 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo such satanic agents, the only way to stop the rumoured plot to return Jonathan back to Aso Rock in 2023 is to eliminate him. We know in Nigeria, there is nothing desperate politicians, who see others as a threat to their ambitions, cannot do,\u201d he said.\n\nIgbifa warned that the entire Niger Delta and the Ijaw nation would rise in an unprecedented revolution that would if anything happened to Jonathan.\n\nHe said Jonathan was not just an asset to the country but a priceless and cherished gift to the global community because of his disposition for peace and entrenchment of democratic values in Africa and the world.\n\nHe called on security agencies to beef up security around Jonathan, saying it would be the highest national embarrassment if anything happened to him through a planned accident.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe can swallow all the insults and marginalisation thrown at us as a people but what we cannot take is making attempts on the lives of our icons.\n\n\u201cTherefore, those who are against the return of Jonathan to Aso Rock should explore other peaceful ways to stop him instead of resorting to violence that can plunge the entire country into endless crisis.\n\n\u201cThis is the same with any Niger Deltan contesting for the office of President across political parties. Don\u2019t attempt to take their lives rather, defeat them politically.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on security agencies to rise up to their responsibilities and beef up security around the former President. They should probe this accident and make public the circumstances that led to it. The blood of our hero cannot be used to settle political scores\u201d.",

We are happy to hear that you are interested in various forms of support not just to the country but also to civil society organizations in such a way that they will be strengthened.\n\n\u201cWe think this will go along with some of the technical support particularly that will facilitate electronic transmission of results and other areas that we have to check election malpractices are very important to us.\u201d\n\nHe boasted that the PDP will win any free and fair election as it has demonstrated that in recent times.\n\nAyu, who cited the recent Federal Capital Territory (FCT) elections, added \u201cWe\u2019re very confident in a free and fair election. We will return to winning ways and will be able to win several states and then next year, when we have the presidential elections, we will definitely win the presidential elections. The only obstacle in the way, we believe, is when elections are not conducted freely and fairly.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Mr Kubwimana said said their mission which is an electoral Needs Assessment mission is in response to a request for electoral support.\n\n\u201cSo we are here to assess the needs of the country but also of the key stakeholders that play a role in elections, but also to assess the overall context, possible challenges that may affect the electoral process and how best the UN could assist the Government and the various stakeholders in the lead up to those elections,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "As the battle against crude oil theft, a development that has resulted to severe revenue to the country as well as its inability to meet its production quota, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) on Thursday disclosed that it had launched a special operation code named \u2018Operation Dakatar da Barawo\u2019 in order to curb crude oil theft and illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta region.\n\nIt also revealed that 30 illegal oil refineries had been demobilised in the region by the naval troops in the last two weeks.\n\nThis was just as the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, on Thursday expressed optimism that the country would return to normal crude oil production in the next two months, even as he stressed the need for collective action to address the unfortunate situation.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing in Abuja, the Director, Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj Gen Benard Onyeuko, said the new operation in the Niger Delta region was aimed at reinvigorating the already existing operation Delta Safe, with a view to containing economic saboteurs in the region.\n\nOther objectives of the new operations include, \u201cto secure critical maritime infrastructure, create enabling environment for the sustenance of desired level of hydrocarbon production, safe shipping and economic activities, and restore investor confidence in Nigeria\u2019s Maritime domain, among others\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that troops of Operation Delta Safe had continued to dominate the zone and had conducted anti-crude oil theft and anti-illegal oil bunkering related operations at different locations.\n\nHe listed the locations to include Opuama Celestial, Lolomu Ruler in Warri North Local Government Area, Obodo water-ways in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\nOther locations are: Egbeda, Ibaa, Oduoha, Rumekpe in Emohua Local Government Area, Elele; Ikwere Local Government Area of River State and Brass Creek in Ozobo community in Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, troops discovered and destroyed 30 illegal refining sites, 37 reservoirs, 31 ovens, 12 large wooden boats, two cooling systems, three receivers, three storage pits and a metal drums.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, troops within the period under review recovered 12,150,000 liters of illegal refined Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) 4,000 liters of stolen crude oil, three tankers, three vehicles, 73 galvanised pipes, two motorcycles, one bus, one Toyota Camry, Mercedes Benz car,\u201d he revealed.\n\nKyari Foresees Return to Normal Oil Production in Two Months\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari, while addressing members of the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Upstream investigating reasons why Nigeria had not been able to meet its production quota, said the federal government was not only working on recovery of its production quota, but its sustainability as well.\n\nHe explained that the scale of crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism seen in the host communities was beyond explanation, and has rendered the oil and gas industry unworkable.\n\nThe GMD while describing vandalism as an elitist business, lamented\n\nthat nefarious activities were forcing production shutdown.\n\nKyari said, \u201cYes, we have not gotten back production, but today, with activities that are going on, we promise that within the next one or two months, we will restore some level of normalcy. What is going on has nothing to do with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\n\u201cIt is purely activities of thieves, act of vandals which has rendered the industry unworkable and taken us to the level where today, our production is around 1.49 million barrel.\n\n\u201cWhat this did also as you may be aware is that the diesel that you see until last week, when we clamped down on some of these illegal refineries were actually coming from these illegal refineries. Until last three weeks ago, most of the diesel that you used in your homes are coming from these refineries and that why when we took them out, we cut off the line of supply by stopping the movement, that\u2019s when you heard that AGO got to N900 per litre.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the market price for AGO. Then obviously, once supply becomes constrained, prices will go up and we are happy that NNPC\u2019s intervention has brought down the price of diesel to normal market price and we are happy to do.\n\n\u201cWhy people bought it was because it was cheaper when it was being sold in the market. We are happy that this intervention is working and hopefully in the one or two months, we will bring sanity back. The act of vandals and thieves has gotten to a level where we had to shut down the pipeline and declare force majuro on it.\n\n\u201cAlso the FXTL pipeline. So, as we speak now, there is no production going on there because we can no longer sustain the operation. This is not because we don\u2019t go back to replace pipeline that are damaged. But as we do, we have repeated insertions on these pipeline. It got to a point that when we inject 239,000 barrel per day, we only receive 3,000 barrel per day. There was simply no business for anyone to continue to produce. When you loss about 200,000 barrels per day, even at an average price of $65 per barrel, we lost close to $1 billion between January and March.\n\n\u201cFrom January till date, we lost an average of 250,000 barrel per day and at the current price of about $100 to the barrel, even within this short period, we have lost close to $1.5 billion.\u201d\n\nHe further revealed: \u201cIn January 2021, we were producing 239,000 barrel from the line linking Bonny Terminal and we only received 190,000 barrel meaning that we lost about 19,000 barrel to thieves then per day. This situation deteriorated to the extent that by March 7, 2022, it came to zero and so, we shut down the line and declared force Majeure.\n\n\u201cEven on our most reliable pipeline, which is the Forcados pipeline, we still loss about 7,000 barrel per day. Needless to say that these are all coming as a result of act of vandals and oil thieves. So many interventions have taken place and we have continued to remove the insertions. To put it in context, within a distance of less than 20 kilometers, we removed 85 insertions. So, you can imagine when you are running a pipeline of about 300 to 400 kilometers.\u201d\n\nKyari called for establishment of a special and independent court for speedy prosecution oil thieves.\n\nHe warned that without speedy prosecution and conviction of the criminals, it would have an impact on the country\u2019s economic outlook and its ability to generate foreign exchange.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number of arrests made by the JTF, even vessel operators have made some arrests and also the Nigerian Navy in the last two weeks. Even more arrests have been made. Many of these illegal refineries are being taken down and also the insertions are being constantly removed and we believe that these interventions will pay off.\n\n\u201cAnd we will able to restore production. And this is centrally coordinated. There is a coordinated action now because we are using a number of strategies including community-based security outfits.\n\n\u201cNo doubts it is a very difficult time and that\u2019s why despite the good intentions of the PIA, no one will produce oil, recover zero and put money back into the business. And that\u2019s why investments are very weak despite the good environment that the PIA has brought. All we need to do is to increase the advocacy so that the legal process takes its cause and prosecutions are done timely.\n\n\u201cI will recommend that we set up a special court for this. Such cases will be speedily dealt with, so that it is not just the ordinary \u2018small\u2019 people that you see at those locations that are prosecuted. We know that to sell crude oil in the international market, it is not the business of the ordinary people that you see in these illegal refineries; it is an elitist business and we must have the courage to set up very independent special courts to try cases related to this.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the impact it has on our economic outlook \u2013 our ability to generate foreign exchange and in terms of energy security for this country \u2013 is threatened by a very few people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the GMD reiterated President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directive that the NNPC should strengthen its collaboration with security agencies and other stakeholders to tackle oil theft and illegal refineries in Nigeria. \u201cWe are not helpless. Yes, it\u2019s a very daunting situation, no doubts, Mr. President in his wisdom directed the Chief of Defence Staff to lead a war, clearly it is a way to contain this situation and bring it to the barest minimum. So much is going on needless to say and I can share with you.\n\n\u201cThere is a massive activity going on by some government security agencies in collaboration with the industry, NNPC, two regulatory institutions and the Nigerian Army, Navy and Airforce and DSS with the collaboration of another agencies including NIMASA and others.\n\n\u201cThey are all working together to contain this situation. Every agency of government is involved now. The DSS, EFCC to trace and track the movement of funds, NFIU to also trace movement of funds from all levels and we believe that this will pay off and ultimately, we will contain this situation,\u201d he added\n\nUrges Collective Action against Oil Thieves\n\nIn a related development, Kyari in his goodwill message at the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), 5th Quadrennial Delegates\u2019 Conference with the theme, \u201cJust Energy Transition: For Oil and Gas Workers Social Welfare and Security,\u201d in Asaba, on Thursday, called for urgent collaborative effort of all stakeholders to stem the tide of oil theft.\n\nHe said the NNPC would continue to partner NUPENG to sustain the production of oil and gas, adding that the sector would remain relevant at all times irrespective of emerging transitions in the energy sector.\n\nAccording to him, though global energy transition was going on, oil would still be available and in high demand till year 2050 and beyond.\n\nKyari said: \u201cLocally, our industry is seriously being challenged. We have seen vandalism around our areas of operation not just in the Niger Delta but across the various corridors of our product supply.\n\n\u201cThe activities oil thieves that have got to limit that we haven\u2019t seen before, almost bringing this industry to its knees today. \u201c\n\nThe NNPC GMD noted that with the current dismally low levels of production, every stakeholder must join hands to fight to sustain the industry to enable it survive for all.\n\nOn his part, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, who was represented by the Secretary to State Government (SSG) Chief Patrick Ukah, while declaring the event open, noted that NUPENG remains a critical and respected trade union in the oil and gas industry, urging the union leadership to always forget harmonious working relation with the management cadre in the oil and gas industry in order to stave off needless friction.\n\nThe governor stressed the need for all the workers to be abreast of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act in the overall interest of the nation.\n\nAlso, The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, Ayuba Wabba, vowed that labour union would continue to engage the political class to ensure improved welfare for workers.\n\nHe said that the strike action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) was not unpatriotic, even as he urged the federal government to get back to the negotiation table with a view to addressing the long-standing demands of the university teachers.\n\nHe also described casualisation of workers as evil and tantamount to slavery that must be resisted by workers.\n\nAlso speaking, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, noted that the petroleum sector plays a key role in the country\u2019s economy and called for diversification from oil to agriculture to address the economic and social crises from the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said only a formidable workforce with good welfare could rebuild the failing economy and address all the the challenges in the various sectors including the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Minister of Labour, Dr Chris Ngige, represented by the Delta State Controller of Works, Mrs. Eucharia Ozurumba, lauded NUPENG for its welfare activities but charged the union to sustain struggles for welfare of workers and the fight against casualisation.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Prince Williams Akporeha, President of NUPENG, said the union would sustain fight against casualisation of oil workers even as he lamented other worrisome aspects of the national life including insecurity.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh, Udora Orizu in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba",

          "title": "Nigeria: New Revenue Formula Proposes Reduction of FG\u2019s Allocation By 3.33%, States to Increase By 3.07%",
          "text": "The nation\u2019s 30-year-old revenue allocation formula would soon be reviewed with a proposal by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) for the reduction of the allocation to federal government by 3.3 percent while the allocation to the 36 states and the 774 local government councils would be increased by 3.07 per cent and 0.44 per cent respectively.\n\nThis is just as President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that he would await the final outcome of the constitutional review process before presenting the report of the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nThe vertical review of the revenue formula also affected Special Funds, with the RMAFC proposing an increase of 0.2 per cent for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of 0.38 per cent for Development of Natural Resources.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the State House, Abuja, while receiving the report by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), from its Chairman, Elias Mbam, Buhari stressed that for the nation to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of Government.\n\nIn particular, he noted that the proposal seeks a 3.33% reduction in the current federal government\u2019s allocation and on the other hand an increase of 3.07 per cent and 0.44 per cent for the states and local governments on the other hand.\n\nHe added that with regards to the Special Funds, the report by the RMAFC proposed an increase of 0.2 per cent for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of 0.38 per cent for the Development of Natural Resources.\n\nThe president recounted that the federal government also made its input into the process of reviewing the vertical revenue allocation formula based on existing constitutional provisions for roles and responsibilities for the different tiers of government.\n\n\u201cWe must note the increasing visibility in Sub-national level responsibilities due to weaknesses at that level, for example: Primary Health Care; Basic Primary Education; Levels of insecurity, and; Increased remittances to State and Local Governments through the Value Added Tax sharing formula, where the Federal Government has only 15 per cent and the States and Local Government share 50 per cent and 35 per cent respectively\u201d.\n\nBuhari said he would have gone ahead to present the revenue allocation report to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nHe, however, explained that since the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula was a function of the roles and responsibilities of the different tiers of government, \u201cI will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process, especially as some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained herein.\u201d\n\nHe listed some of the recommendations in the report to include: \u2018\u2018Establishing local government as a tier of government and the associated abrogation of the state/local government account; moving airports; fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list, empowering the RMAFC to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account as well as streamlining the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president assured members of the Commission that the federal government would immediately subject the report to its internal review and approval processes, while awaiting finalisation of the efforts by the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to him, this strategy, rather than issuing an Executive Modification order, as was done in 1992, was more in line with entrenching our democratic tenets.\n\nHe commended the RMAFC for a job painstakingly done, pledging his unwavering commitment and support to them in carrying out their constitutional mandates.\n\nThe president also thanked Nigerians, especially the state and local governments, for making their inputs through the broad stake-holder engagement processes that produced the report.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am aware that the present revenue allocation formula has not been reviewed since the last exercise carried out in 1992.\n\n\u2018\u2018Considering the changing dynamics of our political-economy, such as privatisation, deregulation, funding arrangement of primary education, primary health care and the growing clamour for decentralisation among others; it is necessary that we take another look at our Revenue Sharing Formula, especially the vertical aspects that relate to the tiers of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018This becomes more compelling as we need to reduce our infrastructural deficit, make more resources available for tackling insecurity, confront climate change and its associated global warming and make life more meaningful for our rapid growing population.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari said as an advocate for grassroots development, he has always remained committed to ensuring that all tiers of Government are treated fairly, equally and justly in the sharing of national resources.\n\n\u2018\u2018I want to let you all know that I have keenly followed most of the discussions held in the geo-political consultative process and one thing that struck me clearly was the agreement that a review of our vertical revenue formula cannot and should not be an emotional or sentimental discussion and it cannot be done arbitrarily.\n\n\u2018\u2018All over the world, revenue and resource allocation have always been a function of the level of responsibilities attached to the different components or tiers of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am, therefore, happy to note that the discussions were held along these lines and rested squarely on roles and responsibilities as spelt out in the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u2018\u2018However, I also note that in reaching the final decisions at most of these engagements, not much emphasis was placed on the fact that the Second Schedule of the Nigerian constitution contains 68 items on the Exclusive Legislative List and the remaining 30 items on the Concurrent List requiring both the Federal and State Government to address.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said the RMAFC followed due process in undertaking the exercise, and sought the opinion of the federal government before finalising the report.\n\nGiving a synopsis of the report, Mustapha said it was in four volumes, including a summary in the main report.\n\nHe added: \u2018\u2018Volume 1 contains the various memoranda submitted by the Federal and State Governments as well as the FCT. Volume 2 details the presentation from the academia, civil society, professional bodies, traditional rulers, individuals, as well as women and youth council.\n\n\u2018\u2018To complete the inclusiveness of the stakeholder participatory processes adopted, Volume 3 is a research that captures the body of knowledge that supported the review while Volume 4 is a further distillation of submissions by the State and Local Governments as well as NGOs and Area Councils of the FCT.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, RMAFC Chairman Mbam said the leading philosophy behind the proposed review was guided by the need for distributive justice, equity and fairness as enshrined in relevant Sections of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nHe added that the principles took into cognisance the indivisibility of the country, public opinion and weighted Constitutional responsibilities and functions of the three levels of Government.\n\nHe announced that the proposed vertical revenue allocation formula advised 45.17 per cent for the federal government, 29.79 per cent for state governments and 21.04 per cent for the local governments.\n\nUnder Special Funds, he said, the Report by the Commission recommended one per cent for Ecology, 0.5 per cent for Stabilisation, 1.3 per cent for Development of Natural Resources and 1.2 per cent for the FCT.\n\nIn arriving at the new vertical revenue allocation formula, Mbam told the president that the Commission had wide consultation with major stakeholders, public hearing in all the geo-political zones, administered questionnaires and studied some other federations with similar fiscal arrangements like Nigeria to draw useful lessons from their experiences.\n\nAccording to the RMAFC chairman, the Commission also visited all the 36 States and the FCT, the 774 local government areas to sensitise and obtain inputs from stakeholders.\n\nHe added that literature reviews were conducted on revenue allocation formula in Nigeria dating back to pre-independence period while the Commission received memoranda from the public sectors, individuals and private institutions across the country.\n\nExplaining the major reasons for the exercise, Mbam noted that since the last review was conducted in 1992, 29 years ago, the political structure of the country has changed with the creation of six additional States in 1996, which brought the number of States to 36.\n\nCorrespondingly, he said, the number of local governments councils also increased from 589 to 774.\n\n\u2018\u2018There have been considerable changes arising from the policy reforms that altered the relative share of responsibilities of the various tiers of government such as deregulation, privatisation and the lingering controversies over funding of primary education, primary healthcare.\u201d\n\nThe RMAFC chairman noted that while Section 32(b), Part 1 of Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution 9 (as amended) empowers the Commission to review from time to time the revenue allocation formulae; the inadequate and decaying infrastructure, as well as heightened widespread internal security challenges across the country also necessitated the exercise, among others.",

          "text": "In submission to the principle of \u2018Stare disisis\u2019 Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court, on Thursday refused to order the removal of Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade and his Deputy, Prof. Ivara Esu from office.\n\nThe judge had on March 22, sacked two members of the National Assembly from Cross River State and 18 lawmakers of the State House of Assembly for dumping the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that brought them to power in 2019.\n\nJustice Taiwo had on March 25, adjourned to April 6, to deliver his judgment in the suit seeking the sack of Ayade and his deputy due to their defection from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC), last year.\n\nHowever, when the matter came up Wednesday, the judge asked lawyers to parties in the suit to address him on the propriety of going ahead with his judgment in the light of a Court of Appeal judgment that held that a governor cannot be sacked on account of defection from one political party to another.\n\nAfter taking submissions from counsel, Justice Taiwo had announced that judgment would be delivered Thursday.\n\nDelivering judgment, the judge agreed with the submission of Chief Mike Ozekhome, counsel to Ayade and his deputy, on the need to abide by the judgment of a Court of Appeal, Enugu Division, which held that a court lacks powers to remove a sitting governor who defects because the constitution has yet to make it an offence.\n\nJustice Taiwo held that governors and their deputies could only be removed from office in line with sections 180, 188 and 189 of the constitution which stipulated that elective office holders could only be removed from office on account of death, resignation or impeachment.\n\nHe said since defection was not one of the constitutional provisions to remove any governor, no court has power to insert such into it.\n\nWhile agreeing that defection was immoral, improper and condemnable, the judge however, held that judicial precedents of a higher court must be followed by a lower court and applied in similar matters so as to avoid judicial rascality and anarchy.\n\nThe court held that although parties and facts in the matter that led to Court of Appeal\u2019s new decision are fundamentally different from those before it except on defection alone, the application of judicial precedent must be followed and in fact, binding on lower courts.",
