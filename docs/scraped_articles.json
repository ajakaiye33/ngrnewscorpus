          "title": "Thugs invade Edo court, chase staff, cart away documents",
          "text": "There was pandemonium in the Court of Appeal in Benin City late Friday as suspected thugs allegedly supported by persons in security outfit uniforms, invaded the courtroom, chased away court workers and carted away several documents.\n\nIt was gathered that some lawyers had approached the Appellate court to file an appeal arising from a judgment of the State High Court on issues relating to the crisis rocking the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party in Edo State.\n\nThe crisis concerned whose faction of the party loyal to the governor of the state, Godwin Obaseki and the Vice Chairman, South-South of the party, Chief Dan Orbih, have the authentic delegates list to participate in the party\u2019s primary elections.\n\nA lawyer who pleaded anonymity for security reasons said he was shuttling between a business centre in Akpakpava and the Appeal Court which is temporarily operating from a section of the Edo State High Court premises along Sapele Road as a result of the rehabilitation work going on its permanent premises in Aduwawa area of Benin City when the incident happened.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere was an injunction against the PDP faction led by Dan Orih and Ogbeide-Ihama recognising the delegates from Obaseki as the authentic delegates for the purpose of the congress of the PDP primary elections.\n\n\u201cThey retained our services and we quickly swung into action and we were at the court to file necessary documents because the state High court had refused to join us as interested parties and then went ahead to give the ruling.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Court of Appeal which granted our application to be joined. They now directed that we should compile and transmit our records; file all the papers we needed to file so that they can hear the case on Monday in the main appeal. That was what we were doing when suspected thugs and uniformed men came into the courtroom and chased away the staff.\n\n\u201cOne of my staff was carried away in their bus because she refused to surrender the documents with her to the suspected thugs. She had to release the documents to save her life.\u201d\n\nConfirming the incident, the Head of Department, Litigation of the court, Dennis Ayama said he was already at home when he got a call to receive application from some lawyers at about 5 pm only for him to get there and saw some strange looking persons numbering about 20 who said they are from government house and that they heard something illegal was taking place at the court.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey demanded for my ID card which I showed them, then they forcefully collected documents and files from the lawyers who came to file.\u201d\n\nOn why he was receiving court documents at the time, he answered, \u201cWe can come at anytime to collect court processes even at 12 midnight.\u201d\n\nReacting to the incident, the chairman, Benin Branch of the Nigerian Bar Association, Pius Oiwoh, said, \u201cI heard it too. We condemn the invasion in its entirety. We see it as an affront against the sanctity of the judiciary and we are not pleased at all.\n\n\u201cWe are disturbed by it. We call on the security agencies to unmask those behind it. The judiciary is sacred and should not be invaded the way it has been so done.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Bello Kontogns said, \u201cI am not aware of the incident. No such report has come to my table.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

She told her stepfather Chris Madaki when she went to Abuja that this man will kill me.\u201d\n\nThe judge also held that the evidence of the sixth prosecution witness (PW6) that on April 5, 2018, at 4:10am, she saw Peter Nielsen beating and hitting Zainab\u2019s head on the floor collaborated the oral evidence of prof John Obafunwa (PW4).\n\nNielsen was arraigned on June 13, 2018, on a two-count charge of murder.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty, to the two-count charge of murder contrary to Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015,\n\nfollowing which trial commenced.\n\nThe Lagos State Government accused Nielsen, now 57, of smothering Zainab and their daughter Petra Nielsen to death at about 3:45am, on April 5, 2018, at No. 4, Flat 17, Bella Vista Tower, Banana Island, Ikoyi.\n\nWhen trial commenced the prosecution called 9 witnesses and closed their case on September 20, 2019.\n\nThe defence opened its case and also called 9 witnesses with the\n\ndefendant being the 9th witness.\n\nOkikiolu-Ighile, held that oral and documentary evidence before the court showed that prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that Nielsen smothered his wife and daughter.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the cases of domestic violence.\n\n\u201cThe DNA analysis of nail scraping brought out the assailant of Zainab.\n\n\u201cZainab tried so much to defend herself. The evidence shows that Peter Nielsen killed his wife and daughter.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence before the court that there is a fight between the defendant and his wife,\u201d the judge held.\n\nShe held that Prosecution Witnesses (PW5 and PW6) testified that they heard Zainab calling Mimi (one the girls living with the couple) for help and they heard Zainab telling the defendant to check her phone but he kept hitting her head.\n\n\u201cThe act of the defendant shows that he suffocated his wife and daughter.\n\n\u201cPeter has always domestically abused his wife which was shown in the police extract from Ikoyi Police Station.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t know that her marriage to the defendant was void abi nitio because Peter was already married in Denmark.\n\nHowever, on the issue of the night gown worn by Zainab on the night she died, the judge expunged the evidence.\n\nShe said that the pathologist who analysed the DNA on the nightgown was thoroughly examined and cross-examined by the defence.\n\nThe judge, however, said that on October, 20, 2020, the high court of Lagos was vandalised and burnt, which affected the night gown, a jumpsuit, towel and pant worn by Zainab and Petra.\n\nThe judge, however, said that the contention of the defendant was not for cross-examination but for them to take the items for DNA examination for their own case.\n\n\u201cIt is trite law that all documentary evidence must be scurtinised but the defendant is argued that he didn\u2019t have opportunity to produce his own examination.\n\n\u201cThe defendant made application to expunge such items from the evidence.\n\n\u201cI have considered the application, exhibits, PWN (Zainab\u2019s nightgown, Petra\u2019s jumpsuit, towel and pant) is hereby expunged.\n\nThe judge however said that apart from the night gown, there were other reports which were the mens rea (state of mind of the accused).",

          "title": "LASG clarifies clampdown on Okada",
          "text": "File image.\n\n..Says Keke Marwa not excluded\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Government has described the ongoing enforcement of restrictions on the operations of commercial motorcycles, popularly called okada, in certain parts of the state as a necessary step to curb their indiscipline, save lives and improve security.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, made the remark when he spoke on Channels TV Sunrise Daily about the new enforcement order given by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the backlash recorded in a part of the state.\n\nAccording to Omotoso, the resurgence of Okada operations and acts of indiscipline being exhibited by riders have become a serious source of concern as many people have lost their limbs and lives through Okada accidents.\n\nAccording to the commissioner, \u201cOur doctors are complaining that more and more people are coming with Okada-related emergency. About 1,712 accidents have been recorded in Lagos in the first quarter of this year. Out of this figure, about 45 percent; to be precise, 767 of the accidents were caused by Okada. And it is shocking to know that about 54 percent of the victims are between the ages of 30 and 39.\n\n\u201cThese are our able-bodied young people who are getting cut down like that all because they mounted okada.\u201d\n\nAttributing the high fatality rate of riders and passengers to plying about 500 highways, major roads and bridges, which the Road Traffic Law prohibited, Omotoso affirmed that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s order was to reinforce the law and give the riders an opportunity to move out and find some other things to do.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is a Law that lists all the routes commercial motorcycles are restricted from plying. The Law is still there; it has not been repealed. So, the enforcement is not new and it is going to continue as the June 1st deadline stands.\u201d\n\nDescribing as unfortunate the insecurity in some parts of the country that has forced many people to migrate to Lagos to make ends meet by riding Okada, the Commissioner explained that the development led to complaints from residents who have expressed their rejection of okada.\n\n\u201cLagosians are worried about the mystery of Okada; they don\u2019t know where they come from; the riders are unknown; they don\u2019t even have number plates. They don\u2019t come for Lagos State Residents Registration LASRRA, registration, so we can\u2019t account for them,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, the Commissioner described the approach to the renewed enforcement as well planned and strategic because the state expected the kind of backlash the exercise has generated but assured all that it was an experience the law enforcement agents were used to.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nOn possible increase in crime rate, following the enforcement, Omotoso said \u201ceverything the law enforcement agencies need in terms of equipment, welfare and encouragement would be provided for them to step up enforcement and security of lives and property.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner expressed the determination of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ensure full enforcement and allayed fears that the government would want to go back because of politics.\n\nHe said: \u201cMr. Governor is a man of integrity; he is a man of his words. He is going to ensure that whatever it takes to enforce the law will be done. We have been encouraged by Lagosians who have seen the danger and who feel that moving with Okada from one place to another because it is very fast cannot be compared to the security threat they pose.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to have a Lagos without motorcycles because there is no megacity in the world that you go to and find this kind of mode of transportation.\n\n\u201cIt is also preposterous for anybody to say for our votes come and mess up Lagos. No, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Governor, is not going to do that. This is the last time we are going to have this as the bikes are being crushed to show people that we are very serious, and communicate to those bringing them in, that enough is enough.\u201d\n\nOmotoso, urged okada riders to look for something else to do as there are so many opportunities in Lagos for anyone who wants to stay in Lagos and wants to be law-abiding.\n\n\u201cYou should go and collect your LASRRA card and be an official resident of Lagos and find something to do. Artisans who left their jobs to ride Okada should find a reason now to go back to their jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "According to Omotoso, the resurgence of Okada operations and acts of indiscipline being exhibited by riders have become a serious source of concern as many people have lost their limbs and lives through Okada accidents.\nOut of this figure, about 45 percent; to be precise, 767 of the accidents were caused by Okada.\n\u201cLagosians are worried about the mystery of Okada; they don\u2019t know where they come from; the riders are unknown; they don\u2019t even have number plates.\nThey don\u2019t come for Lagos State Residents Registration LASRRA, registration, so we can\u2019t account for them,\u201d he said.\nArtisans who left their jobs to ride Okada should find a reason now to go back to their jobs,\u201d he said.",

Check all of us, look and determine who can even defend the interest of Ndi Igbo better than me?\n\n\u201cIt is not merely to talk. I mean who has the mind? Who has the courage? I have the mind and I have the courage. I will make sure the injustice in this country is being solved.\n\n\u201cAsk them, when they were in power, what did they do? How many of them have spoken out? Look, don\u2019t waste your votes on such people.\u201d\n\nWike observed that things had fallen apart in the country because leaders in the All Progressives (APC), who controlled the Federal Government lacked such capacity.\n\nThe Governor said he was prepared to effectively and productively take drastic decisions and do so courageously in order to promote national good.\n\nWike assured that in solving the country\u2019s numerous problems, he would also provide requisite logistics, and other support to the security agencies to enable them curb insurgency and activities of bandits within a given timeline.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat is what leadership is all about. You must be courageous to take decisions people are thinking that is impossible. Inability to take decisions, that is our problem in this country. But I will take those decisions that people are running away from. I will take it.\u201d\n\nAbia Governor Okezie Ikpeazu , who had earlier hosted Wike on a courtesy visit, said they found in Wike a leader, who was consistent, with a character and trustworthy.\n\nIkpeazu said the country was in a precarious situation with a bleak future and required Wike to forge national unity, rescue the country and stabilise socioeconomic development.\n\nFormer Abia Governor, Senator Theodore Orji, who is representing Abia Central at the National Assembly, described Wike as a performer, qualified to lead the country.\n\nHe assured the presidential aspirant that Abia state delegates would support him.\n\nFormer Gombe Governor Hassan Dakwambo restated that Wike was truly a tested politicia prepared psychologically and physically to be the best president of Nigeria.\n\nAbia PDP chairman, Dr. Alwell Asiforo Okere informed that most delegates were Wike\u2019s converts because they believed in his leadership.",

The funds, according to EFCC, were laundered through real estate investments in Kano and Abuja.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nMr. Idris was arrested after failing to honour invitations by the EFCC to respond to issues connected to the fraudulent acts. A competent source in EFCC who pleaded not to be named, told Saturday Sun that more staff, highly-placed persons and other interested government officials involved in the financial heist, will be arrested soon.\n\nThe source said what the public knows is a scratch on the surface compared to what further investigation by the anti-graft agency has so far revealed. He said the AGF was due for retirement about two years ago, but was reportedly extended by the presidency, despite the clear violation of the civil service rule.\n\nThe source said through a clandestine move, Idris used many pseudo names to invest in and outside of Nigeria. He wondered how a public officer who should catch thieves, has now become the thief. He listed United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and other Scandinavian countries, where the Idris starched the funds as investments. The EFCC source said the agency has already commenced moves to recover some of the assets, while reaching out to countries suspected to he harbouring some of the looted funds. He said when investigations are concluded, Idris will be charged to court. The source said Idris is working with operatives to bring a closure to the issue.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nBreaking!!!

          "title": "Obasanjo: Nigeria\u2019s Inability to Contain Insecurity a Choice by Her Leaders",
          "text": "\n\n*Says current period unlike any other in country\u2019s history\n\n*Terrorists killed 360, abducted 1,389 in three months in Kaduna, report indicates\n\n*What\u2019s happening in North-west far more serious, potentially more dangerous than we\u2019ve ever had in North-east, El-Rufai declares\n\n*Explains insecurity high in his state because terrorists find its forests comfortable\n\n\n\nJames Sowole in Abeokuta and John Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday, said Nigeria\u2019s inability to meet its security challenges was a choice by the country\u2019s leaders and not by God\u2019s design.\n\nObasanjo declared that the country was going through a more difficult time than any other period in its political history. He said he had no apology for having \u201cmad passion\u201d for Nigeria, \u201cbecause I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say, yes, I have come to live here.\u201d\n\nThe former president\u2019s comments came as a report recently presented by the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, stated that between January and March this year, a total of 360 people were killed by terrorist groups in the state, while 1,389 others were abducted.\n\nKaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, in his own assessment, said the epicentre of insecurity in Nigeria had moved from the North-east to the North-west. El-Rufai declared that what was currently happening in his North-west geopolitical zone was far more serious and potentially more dangerous than what happened in the North-east.\n\nThe governor said Kaduna State was becoming a haven for terrorists because they saw its forests as a comfortable fortress for their activities.\n\nObasanjo spoke at his penthouse residence within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, when he played host to a presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-Deen. The ex-president said Nigeria required a leader, who had passion, innovation, and vision for Nigeria, some who possessed adequate knowledge of the challenges faced the country.\n\nThe former president insisted Nigeria could overcome its security challenges within two years with the right leader willing to make tough decisions. He urged Nigerians to brace up and be ready to make sacrifices to put the country back on the right path.\n\nObasanjo explained, \u201cSome people say the human memories are short, maybe they are right, because if human memories are not short, some of the mistakes that we are making, we will not be making them.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a record, which some people may find a little bit not what they want to hear, but whatever people want to hear, I believe, like you (Hayatu-Deen) have rightly said, this period is not like any other period in the history of Nigeria and you used two words, decomposing and dissolving. I can\u2019t find any better words to describe the situation we have found ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt is an agonising situation for you, obviously, and also for me. I want to emphasise the point that the Nigerian situation, bad as it is, will only be put right by Nigerians at the forefront of our situation. So, Nigerians have to brace themselves up to do what needs to be done to put Nigeria back on the right path.\n\n\u201cAnd you are right in saying that wherever you go now, one of the things you hear is that Nigeria is not on the table, but why shouldn\u2019t Nigeria be on the table? What does it cost Nigeria to be on the table?\n\n\u201cI will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, maybe the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent, and, indeed, of the world is not that adequate. If that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right.\n\n\u201cThe second is vision, what is the vision that we have? And if you have no vision, you may have eyes, but you are blind. And I believe that is part of our situation.\n\n\u201cThe third is passion. And when you said you are involved in this with a passion, and I was telling some people this morning that passion means madness; that you are mad about Nigeria. I am and I have no apologies for that, because I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say, yes, I have come to live here.\n\n\u201cPassion means being mad about Nigeria, having a touch of madness and I look at you (Hayatu-Deen) and say, yes, you are mad about Nigeria, too.\n\n\u201cFourth one is innovation. We cannot be doing the same thing that we have done in the past that did not pay us and continue to repeat it and expect any change. We have to move out of it, we have to innovate, we have to re-strategise.\n\n\u201cAnd you talk about security and people ask me about it and I say I know that we can put all insecurity in Nigeria behind us within a space of two years. That we have not done or that we are still in the situation we are is a choice that has been made by our leaders, not the way God wants us to be.\n\n\u201cLike you said, I couldn\u2019t agree with you more, that no individual in Nigeria, no political party, no smuggled person can make a critical mass that will resolve the situation that we are on today. It has to be an all Nigerian hands on deck. No section of the Nigerian community should be left out.\u201d\n\nObasanjo said he believed Hayatu-Deen had the requisite knowledge, \u201cfrom what you have said, you have the vision, also you told me that you have the madness and you have innovation, but let me add, Nigeria is a complex country. And we need to understand the complexity of Nigeria and that complexity if we take care of it, Nigeria is not a difficult country to rule or to manage, but we must all be ready.\u201d\n\nEarlier at the PDP secretariat in Ogun State, Hayatu-Deen, a former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, declared that Nigeria was \u201cdecomposing and dissolving very fast\u201d. But he said he had the capacity, experience, and knowledge to turn things around for the country.\n\nThe aspirant, who said he had been to several parts of Nigeria, including South-west, described himself as a passionate and complete Nigerian.\n\nAccording to Hayatu-Deen, \u201cMy blood is a Nigerian blood. I had seen Nigeria with the eyes of a Nigerian and not from the perspective of a tribal man. I am prepared to govern Nigeria from the first day of inauguration on May 29, 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering from self-inflicted wounds. As an economist, I know how to fix the economy. I will provide social security, I will provide energy security, I will deal with the issue of national insecurity.\u201d\n\nTerrorists Killed 360, Abducted 1,389 in Three Months in Kaduna\n\nEl-Rufai expressed concern about the existence of Boko Haram and Ansaru terrorist enclaves, particularly, in Birnin-Gwari and Chikun local government areas of Kaduna State. He stated this while receiving the first quarter 2022 security report at the Government House, Kaduna.\n\nThe governor appealed to the military and other security agencies to take note of the situation before it got out of control.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that in spite of our investment in human, material and other resources to stem the tide of criminality in the state, the levels are still a source of concern,\u201d El-Rufai stated.\n\nHe said the security report \u201chas brought out new emerging concerns that I will want the security council to take note of and discuss and, maybe, to proffer some suggestions.\n\n\u201cThe first great concern is the emergence of Boko Haram terrorist enclave as well as activities of Ansaru, particularly, in Birnin-Gwari and Chikun local governments.\n\n\u201cAmong those kidnapped from the train was a roommate and classmate of mine, who was released upon payment of a ransom and throughout the period that he was in captivity, it was very clear that the terrorists were making comments like the forests in Kaduna are even better than Sambisa, so, they should all relocate here.\n\n\u201cI think this is an area we should all be concerned about. And that is why we have been making the point that the problem of insecurity now has moved from the North-east to the North-west.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in North-west is far more serious and, potentially, more dangerous than we have ever had in the North-east and we will like the military and other security agencies to take notice of this before it gets out of control.\n\n\u201cThe second, which is related to the first, is the use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and mines in the state. We have been lucky; thanks to the police, we have been able to defuse most of them without causing major loss of lives.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the IEDs issue was a major concern because \u201cit shows very clearly the movement from banditry to terrorism with expertise in making explosive devices\u201d.\n\nEl-Rufai lamented the high rate of drug abuse in the state and called for urgent action to curb the trend, saying, \u201cI think we should give KASUPDA (Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Agency) a clear directive that any building housing any patent medicine selling these drugs should be acquired by the government and demolished.\n\n\u201cThis will be a deterrent to those that give these people the wherewithal to poison our young people. We have to take this action, because it is related to banditry and all forms of criminalities drugs play a major role. We must cut the supply chain of drugs to the bandits.\u201d\n\nThe governor said action should be taken against communities constantly mentioned in criminal acts along the Abuja-Kaduna road.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat I noticed in the report is continuous mention of Rijana, Kateri and Akilibu axis (along Kaduna-Abuja highway) in all these crimes, particularly, as regards the safety or lack of it.\n\n\u201cWe have been exploring what to do about these three communities, whether to relocate them to near Kagarko, whether to clear the three communities. I will like the security council to deliberate on it and look at the options, because it is very clear that there are higher levels of informants and criminals in these locations, because why is it that anytime there is attack or any form of kidnapping on the road, it happens around this axis and nothing ever happens on the Kagarko axis?\n\n\u201cThere is something wrong with the Rijana, Katari axis and government should not refuse to do anything. We have to look at the options, including the clearance of the settlements completely and relocation of the people to where other more honest people can watch them.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai observed that the security agencies were overstretched and recruitment of vigilantes needed to be ramped up.\n\n\u201cI think the 1,000 (vigilantes) we trained have been very useful in assisting the army, the police and other security agencies and, perhaps, this is the time to get another 1,000 and send them to Police College for training,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor added, \u201cWe have already bought weapons that are with the Commissioner of Police, but we need more men and women.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that he would like to see resumption of flights at the Kaduna International Airport.\n\nFlight operations at the airport was suspended following terrorists\u2019 attacks in March.\n\nEl-Rufai said, \u201cWe are grateful to the Defence Headquarters for enabling the establishment of the NDA Demonstration Battalion. I will like to appeal to the Air Force, whose Area of Responsibility includes the Kaduna airport, to also have some kind of permanent deployment at the airport to secure it so that flights can resume.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u00b7 Analysts say proposed legislation will be for personal benefit of legislators\n\n\u00b7 Supreme Court joins Rivers on clause 84(12)\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nMembers of the National Assembly have started mounting President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the amended Section 84 (8) of the Electoral Act, which some analysts have said would amount to altering rules of the electoral process in the middle of the game.\n\nThis is coming at a time the Supreme Court has joined the Rivers State government in a suit seeking its interpretation of the controversial Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHowever, analysts also expressed concern that if the president yields to the pressure of the lawmakers and assents to the amended section of the Act, it might affect the timetable for the 2023 general elections that had been released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) because under the electoral body\u2019s schedule of activities, elections for delegates ought to have taken place this weekend.\n\nMore so, some analysts pointed out that what members of the National Assembly did was that they amended the Act for their own personal gains.\n\n\u201cEssentially, once they passed the Electoral Act, INEC released the timetable and the process started. They now went back and changed the rules when the game has already started,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe federal legislature, had last week amended Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act to enable some categories of non-elected offices within the executive officers of the 18 registered political parties vote at the various categories of party executives, including the President, Vice President, Governors and Deputy governors, at the congresses and national convention expected from Saturday.\n\nIn view of this, the 18 registered political parties have not been able to present their delegates lists, because the President has yet to assent the amended act.\n\nThe implication is that only the elected delegates could vote at the congresses expected to have commenced this Saturday.\n\nIn the PDP, for instance, a source said the delegates list was not ready, because the NWC was waiting for the signing of the amended section 84 (8) to enable the party compile a list of the executives from the wards to the states congresses.\n\nSpecifically, Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, initially allowed only elected delegates of a party to participate in conventions and congresses. But the National Assembly, last week, amended the Electoral Act to allow statutory delegate participate and vote in party conventions, congresses, and meetings.\n\nHowever, in his argument, the Deputy Senate President Omo-Agege, said the amendment sought to make provision for those who would not be elected as ad-hoc delegates to participate in the conventions, congresses, or meetings of political parties.\n\nHe further asserted that the initial section of the Bill was an error on the part of the legislature.\n\nCorroborating Omo-Agege\u2019s presentation, Senator Uche Ekwunife, said the amendment was a straightforward one, adding that, \u201cwithout this amendment, most of us will not have the liberty of voting during the convention. I support the amendment. Let us have it for second reading.\u201d\n\nSenator Sabi Abdullahi, said, \u201cThis Bill is a very straightforward Bill, and let us put in on record that this error was something that happened inadvertently. We have seen the error and that is why we are back here to ensure nobody suffers any harm.\u201d\n\nThe Bill was read the second time and referred to the Committee of the Whole where it was passed.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that if by the end of Friday, the bill was not signed into law by President Buhari, then, executives of the 18 political parties would not be allowed to vote at the presidential conventions, National Assembly congresses, governorship congresses and other congresses to elect the standard bearers of their candidates.\n\nS\u2019Court Joins Rivers in Case over Section 84 of Electoral Act\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court, yesterday, joined the Rivers State government in a suit seeking its interpretation of the controversial Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nThe apex court joined the state after its application for joinder was not opposed by other plaintiffs in the suit filed by President Buhari and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nThe hearing was earlier slated for May 19 but has now been adjourned to May 26 to enable parties exchange processes.\n\nBut the Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly and the State Attorney General, were joined as second and third defendants in the suit. The National Assembly is the first defendant.\n\nAccording to the applicants, they would be affected one way or the other by the outcome of the case since the subject matter in the originating summons relates to the validity and constitutionality of the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act enacted by the National Assembly and applicable through-out the country, including Rivers state.\n\nThe 1st applicant claimed that the outcome would affect the, \u201cLegal rights of the Rivers State House of Assembly and impinge upon its legislative powers to make laws in addition to, but not inconsistent with Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act enacted by the National Assembly and applicable in Rivers State and will affect the scope of its authority to make laws as conferred on it by Section 7 and Item E. 12 of the concurrent legislative list of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nThe AG of Rivers, said he should be joined in the suit as the state was constitutionally bound to be governed democratically in accordance with letters and spirit of the constitution.\n\nResponding, Buhari\u2019s counsel, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), said he was not opposed to the applicants joining the suit.In the suit filed on April 29, 2022, marked: SC/CV/504/2022 by the President and the Chief Law Officer of the country, wherein they are contending that the said Section of the Electoral Act 2022 was in conflict with constitutional provisions, has the National Assembly as the sole defendant.The plaintiffs noted that the Constitution has made provisions for qualifications and disqualifications for the offices of the President and Vice President, Governor and Deputy-Governor, Senate and House of Representatives and House of Assembly, Ministers, Commissioners and Special Advisers.\n\nBuhari and Malami added that the same Constitution has equally, \u201cThe qualifying factors for election into the office of President, Vice President, Governor, Deputy Gravenor, Senate, House of Representatives, Houses of Assembly and Ministers.\u201d\n\nThey also prayed the apex court to declare that, by the joint and or combined reading of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196, of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which also ignores Section 84(3) of the same Act, is an additional qualifying and/or disqualifying factors for the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential elections as enshrined in the said constitution, hence, unconstitutional, unlawful, null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that having regard to the clear provision of Section 1(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended, read together with Section 4 of the same Constitution, the legislative powers vested in the defendant do not permit or empower it to make any other law prescribing additional qualifying /disqualifying grounds for election to the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential election outside the express constitutional qualification and disqualification provisions as already provided in each or all of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), and without amendment to any of those sections is for reason of inconsistency, unconstitutional and therefore null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 disqualifying a political appointee from being a voting delegate or be voted for at a convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election is discriminatory, inconsistent with and in violent breach of the provision of each or all of Sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), as well as Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and some is null and void by reason of its inconsistency.\n\n\u201cA declaration that by the introduction of the provisions of Section 84(12) into the Electoral Act, 2022, but in disregard of Section 84(3) of the some Act, the Defendant has acted ultra vires the legislative powers vested in it under the provision of section 4 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and/or in violation or breach of the provisions of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196, thereby rendering Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 unconstitutional, null and void.\u201d\n\nThey also prayed for an order nullifying the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 by application of the blue pencil rule, for being unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and having been made in excess of the legislative powers of the defendant as enshrined in Section 4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nHouse Minority Caucus Urges Buhari to Sign Electoral Act\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately sign the one item amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 transmitted to him by the National Assembly, last week, to avert imminent political crisis in the country.\n\nThe caucus, in a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said the President\u2019s delay in signing the single amendment to Section 84 (8), has thrown the nation into serious confusion and constituted a huge threat to democracy and the smooth conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, warned that any further delay in signing the amendment to the Electoral Act to give political parties a sense of direction in the conduct of primaries for the election of candidates for the 2023 general election has the capacity to derail the entire democratic process and destabilise the nation.\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the people, the Minority Caucus, urges Mr. President to avert an imminent political crisis, which has the capacity of exacerbating the security situation in the country by immediately signing the Amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 and leaving a legacy of a credible electoral process to the nation.\n\n\u201cOur caucus calls on all Nigerians, the Civil Society, the International Community and all lovers of democracy to prevail on President Buhari to immediately sign the amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 and save our nation from an avoidable crisis.\u201d\n\nMark: PDP Will Not Compromise Her Rules\n\nIn a related development, Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 National Convention Organizing Committee, Senator David Mark, has urged party faithful across the country to imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship in the conduct of the exercises, promising that the PDP would not compromise her own rules.\n\nIn a statement issued ahead of the party primaries, which began with the election of candidates for the state Houses of Assembly seats on Saturday (May 21, 2022), Mark urged party men and women to comply with the rules of the game.\n\nThe former senate president between 2007 and 2015, said, \u201cThe Party has clear guidelines and rules for the exercises. Every aspirant should be guided by the processes. The party will not compromise any of the rules.\u201d\n\nHe counseled delegates to the congresses and conventions to consider the integrity and past accomplishments of aspirants in order to make informed choices of candidates for the elections.\n\n\u201cIn making your decisions, consider the interest of the people. Politics is a conveyor belt to serve humanity. The greater interest of our people is paramount,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, therefore, cautioned against politics of acrimony, bitterness or violence, saying, \u201csee politics like a sporting competition. If you don\u2019t win today, you can win tomorrow \u201c.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Says PIA capable of provoking, triggering commercial interests, investments in gas utilisation\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe federal government yesterday stated that Sub-Saharan Africa could require as much as $60 billion to access reliable electricity and clean cooking facilities between now and 2030.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who disclosed this, noted that an annual investment of around $35 billion could bring electricity access to 759 million Africans who currently lack it.\n\nSpeaking at the annual Symposium and Exhibition of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), in Lagos, Sylva added that another $25 billion a year could help 2.6 billion people globally to access clean cooking by 2030.\n\nThe SPE annual symposium and exhibition had as its theme: \u201cEnergy Transition in Africa: A Strategic Pathway to Net Zero.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnnual investments of around $35 billion could bring electricity access for 759 million people who currently lack it, and $25 billion a year can help 2.6 billion people gain access to clean cooking between now and 2030,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHowever, he stressed that the required investment represents only a small fraction of the multi-trillion-dollar global energy investment needed overall.\n\nSylva noted that despite contributing less than six per cent of world energy consumption and two per cent of total global emissions, there was need for the continent to shift to cleaner energy use.\n\nWith significantly untapped fossil fuel reserves, which could provide the much-needed foreign direct investment and export revenue, Sylva said Africa has the ability to play a leading role in this regard.\n\nHowever, the minister stressed that Nigeria has the mineral resources with approximately 208.62 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of proven gas valued at over $803.9 trillion and potential upside of 600TCF of gas, the most extensive in Africa, and in the top 10 globally.\n\nDescribing the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) as a game changer, Sylva said the legislation would help support the continent to alleviate energy poverty.\n\n\u201cThe PIA has generous incentives to enable development, distribution, penetration, and utilisation of gas even as it incentivises entry into the midstream, especially for pipelines with an additional five-year tax holiday for investment in gas pipelines.\n\n\u201cThe PIA is a supply-side enabler, capable of provoking and triggering commercial interests and investments in gas utilisation as well as treating gas as a stand-alone commodity.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we are following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transition from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role over the next generation, roughly between now and 2060,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister insisted that there must be multiple pathways to the energy transition in order to ensure that no country is left behind in the process of achieving net-zero by 2060.\n\n\u201cAs a continent, we need to be intentional and recognise the need to develop hydrocarbon resources in environmentally and socially responsible ways.\n\n\u201cAnd as alluded to by the African Union, we need to be realistic in choosing the energy transition pathways which addresses our unique requirements and circumstances,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nAccording to Sylva, global energy demand would likely be almost 60 per cent higher in 2060 than today and by 2070 the world is likely to be using at least 50 per cent more energy than it does currently as population grows and people seek to improve their quality of life.\n\n\u201cAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable energy is expected to support the growth of electricity from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of total energy supply by 2050.\n\n\u201cThe remaining energy demand that is impossible to electrify will require cleaner solutions, which can only come from natural gas \u2013 the closest ally to renewables,\u201d he noted.\n\nQuoting United Nations estimates, he noted that the current world population of 7.6 billion was expected to reach 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion in 2100, while half of the world\u2019s population increase is anticipated to occur in just five nations in Africa between 2017 and 2050.\n\nHe listed the countries as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda.\n\nSylva said around 900 million people are presently without access to clean cooking in Africa; and in 32 countries more than 75 per cent of the population are without access to clean cooking.\n\n\u201cLet me also mention that the world\u2019s 20 least-electrified countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the global unserved population live,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nBut he insisted that the foregoing does not mean it is all gloom and doom, maintaining that everyone in the world could have access to clean, affordable energy within the next nine to ten years if countries modestly increase investments.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Welby, who is the Senior Bishop and Principal Leader of the Church of England and the head of the Anglican Communion worldwide, condemned the violent murder of the late Deborah in a series of tweets late Wednesday.\n\nHe, therefore, called on the Nigerian government to ensure that religious rights are protected.\n\nWelby stated, \u201cI strongly condemn the appalling stoning to death of a Christian woman in Sokoto, Nigeria. This violence is a sin against God. I pray for the family and loved ones of Deborah Samuel, and I continue to pray fervently for the nation of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have spent much time in northern Nigeria working with others in pursuit of reconciliation and interfaith dialogue. I am profoundly disappointed and grieved that such violence still takes place in God\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for those Nigerian Muslim leaders that have condemned this atrocity. I call for renewed efforts by the Nigerian Government to ensure liberty and equality under the law \u2013 whether for Christians or Muslims \u2013 which was so tragically absent in this case. I urged people to pray for interfaith dialogue, reconciliation and peace in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nA legal team of 34 lawyers, led by a law lecturer at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, Professor Mansur Ibrahim, had on Monday appeared in defence of two suspects, Bilyaminu Aliyu and Aminu Hukunci, arraigned over the murder of Deborah.\n\nGroups and individuals have continued to react to Deborah\u2019s killing and have urged the Sokoto State government to ensure that justice was done.\n\nThe leadership of the umbrella body for lawyers in the country, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) recently called on the Government of Sokoto State to demonstrate seriousness and willingness in its prosecution of alleged culprits in the murder of a young Christian student in the state by ensuring that charges preferred against the defendants were true reflection of the gravity of the offense of murder.\n\nAlso, the African Bar Association (AFBA), in a statement signed by its President, Hannibal Uwaifo, had stated that it was completely taken aback by the fanatical support given to the callous action by top religious leaders, highly placed government officials and even lawyers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Declares FG has no plan to ban Facebook\n\n\u2022FEC okays N169.7bn private sector investments in road Infrastructure\n\n\u2022Approves N3.4bn for purchase of aviation property\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on the fate of members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) who decided to renounce their political ambitions and remain in the cabinet, so says Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\n\nMohammed also disclosed that the federal government had no plan to ban the social networking website, Facebook, in Nigeria over alleged biased reportage of happenings in some parts of the country.\n\nThe disclosure came as FEC approved N169.7 billion private sector investments for road infrastructure through the government\u2019s Tax Credit Programme (TCP), during the weekly virtual meeting.\n\nFEC also approved the sum of N3, 491,622,340 for the purchase of a property in Abuja for the Ministry of Aviation.\n\nMohammed, who briefed newsmen after the FEC meeting yesterday at the State House, Abuja, said he would need to confirm the status of the returning ministers from the president.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe question about ministers returning or not going, I think you need to give me more time so that I can tell you exactly what the situation is. Right now, I need to crosscheck.\n\n\u201cI need to confirm again from Mr President what the situation is. You see, the final decision on who is going, who\u2019s coming back, who\u2019s not, lies with Mr. President.\u201d\n\nPresidency sources yesterday told THISDAY that President had since asked the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and the Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele to stay on in their jobs even though they had initially nursed the ambition of contesting the 2023 election. While Malami had purchased forms to vie for Governor in his home State of Kebbi, a group of rice farmers purchased forms for Emefiele to contest for ticket to vie for the presidential election.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige; his Women Affairs counterpart, Dame Pauline Tallen; Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timpre Sylva, had rescinded their decisions to contest for elective offices in the 2023 general election.\n\nMalami was physically present at yesterday\u2019s council meeting, while Tallen and Sylva attended the meeting virtually from their offices in Abuja.\n\nNgige was said to be away on official engagement in South Africa, where he was attending the global conference on child labour in Durban, organised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\nThe information and culture minister also shed more light on the recent meeting between the federal government and Facebook\u2019s management over the alleged biased coverage of the country by the blogging platform. He said both parties had a fruitful discussion, adding that the government is not contemplating banning Facebook operations in the country.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cWe had a very robust discussion with Facebook. Facebook saw our point and they said they\u2019re going to do much more than what they were doing. So if they do that, why would we ban them? We don\u2019t ban for banning sake. We ban or we only suspend operations if, for any reason, lives are threatened and they do not listen.\u201d\n\nHe also said the government was able to express its reservation about some of the reports on Facebook.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAt that meeting, we expressed our displeasure that Facebook was becoming a power of choice for those who stay outside Nigeria, in particular, to incite violence, killings, burning of government properties, killing of soldiers and policemen. And that they do more than what they are doing now in looking at the contents, which are unwholesome, which are being used on their platforms.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, the BBC did a documentary on this particular issue and found out that some of them who call themselves social media warriors in England, in France, and other places, have in recent times been using the Facebook platform to incite violence in Nigeria. And we\u2019ve all seen the real life impact of those war mongering, the young couple who are going to marry, soldiers who were gruesomely murdered.\n\n\u201cOver this weekend in Anambra State, policemen were killed, military barracks were attacked. And we did warn Facebook to, please, do more than what they are doing now. And I must say that their response was quite encouraging. They said they are going to do much more.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the approval of N169.7 billion private sector investments for road infrastructure through the government\u2019s TCP, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who also briefed newsmen, stressed that the programme was initiated in 2019, through Executive Order 7 signed by the president, which allowed the private sector to finance public infrastructure in lieu of tax and then offset it overtime using tax credits.\n\nFashola said the first project FEC approved, based on TCP, was the 234-kilometre road from Bali to Sheti through Gashaka to Gembu in Taraba State at the sum of N95, 232,474,010.72. He disclosed that an existing N20 billion, under NNPC Tax Credit Scheme, would be used to kick-start the project.\n\nFashola said the second project, under the tax credit scheme, approved by Council covered three roads.\n\n\u201cThe applicant in this case is Mainstream Energy Solutions, a major energy player in the country, is now seeking to also participate in this policy by investing a total of N74, 486,577, 050,\u201d he said.\n\nFurthermore, Mohammed, who briefed journalists on behalf of his colleagues in aviation, power, and agriculture, said FEC approved the sum of N3, 491,622,340 for the purchase of a property in Abuja for the Ministry of Aviation. He said the property to be acquired was to enable the ministry co-locate with many of its agencies.\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cThis property will enable the ministry to be in the same building with many of its agencies. As of now, many of the agencies operate from rented properties and this is a drain on government, apart from the fact that it does not allow for good coordination of activities.\n\n\u201cNecessary checks and legal searches have been made and the council approved the purchase today.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said Council awarded a N553.575 million contract for the establishment and deployment of Advanced Report Generation Utility Engine Web-based Reporting Tools in favour of Messrs Sinecou Limited with delivery date of 12 months.\n\nMohammed further disclosed that the power ministry got approval for the upward review of the original contract sum in respect of the construction of 232 kilometres Yola, Song, Gombe, Mubi, Gulako 132 KV double circuit transmission line, from $16 million plus N1.248 billion, to $16.698 billion plus N2,337,643,640. He added that the sum of N409 million was approved for the power ministry to purchase replacements of defective circuit breakers, and disclosed that a memo from the Minister of Agriculture seeking approval for a National Agricultural Technology Innovation Policy was approved.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cAnother memo by the Minister of Power also sought approval for the repair and refurbishment of defective nine sets of 330 KV, 13 sets of 132 KV, and 26 sets of 33 KV Crompton grips circuit breakers for the Transmission Company of Nigeria. Some of these circuit breakers are weak, having been there for more than 35 years and the total sum is N409, 089,841. And this is to help the network of the TCN.\n\n\u201cA memo of the Minister of Agriculture seeking approval for a national agricultural technology innovation policy was approved. It is a policy that aims at better synergy and alignment with MDAs to overcome inadequate coordination on policy implementation. It will address the issue of fragmentation of mandates and rivalries among MDAs in the agricultural sector. It will help livestock development and it will support the establishment of functional models of ranches, grazing reserves and integrated meat and dairy processing among others.\n\n\u201cThe policy is also going to help promote knowledge creation and transfer through reorganising, unbundling and strengthening agricultural research and training systems. The policy will give access to mechanisation via tractor and implement hiring scheme. It will also impact on quality extension service delivery, leading to enhanced technology adoption to strengthen the value chain for quality crops, fisheries and aquaculture, among others.\u201d\n\nMinister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clement Agba, who also spoke after the FEC meeting, said the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, presented a memo on the Phase 3 of the Lighthouse programme on digital infrastructure of voluntary assets and income declaration scheme bids and tax harmonisation normalisation analytics and application programme interface.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Malami Accused Of Interfering With EFCC\u2019s Probe Of Multi-million-naira Pension Fraud In University Owned By Ex-lawmaker",
          "text": "Sunday Ajibade, a former worker of Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State has accused the management of the institution owned by a former House of Representatives member, Bode Ayorinde, of diverting millions of naira of pension contributions of staff members.\n\n\n\nHe also accused Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Abubakar Malami of allegedly interfering with the investigation of the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC) into the alleged misappropriation of pension funds at the university, urging him to issue a disclaimer to exonerate himself from the grave allegation.\n\nAjibade disclosed this in a letter to Malami titled \u2018Alleged Interference With EFCC Investigation Into Misappropriation Of Pension Funds/Pension Fraud At Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State\u2019.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, one Mr Oladokun Farinre, a Chartered Accountant (ICAN) and the university's bursary from 2008 to 2021 admitted that the institution did not enrol its employees in the nation's uniform contributory pension scheme.\n\n\n\nRather, it operated an unlicensed and unregulated pension scheme tagged \"University Savings Scheme\" where the management diverted the pension contributions of its staff members to.\n\n\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI am a former employee of Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State, where I worked as a lecturer between November 2012 and October 2017. In a letter dated 17 November 2020 written by my Attorney, A. A. Solagbade Esq. of Femi Emmanuel Emodamori & Co. and addressed to the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC), I reported the incident of misappropriation of pension funds and pension fraud at the University.\n\n\u201cI have annexed the acknowledged copy of that letter, for ease of reference. One Oshili Moses later invited me to the Commission\u2019s Ilorin Zonal Command to adopt the petition, so I visited the Zonal Command on 11 January 2021 for that purpose, following which the Commission invited the University officials. The University rebuffed the invitation, so operatives from the Zonal Command visited the University and arrested the Registrar and one other officer.\n\n\n\n\u201cI visited Ilorin again on 26 February 2021 and gave a supplementary statement in the presence of another officer named Ayo Bashir. During my third visit on 30 March 2021, I discussed with the Zonal Head, one Mr. Kazeem Oseni, and presented him with documentary evidence of my allegations, following which Mr. Oshili Moses stated that he would invite me in three weeks to provide additional information. This invitation did not materialize so I contacted Mr. Oshili, and he stated that the Headquarters office had recalled the case file, and would contact me.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Oshili\u2019s report staggered my imagination, and I began suspecting that the University officials, particularly Hon. Bode Ayorinde (PhD) (the University Pro-Chancellor, who is a politician and former member of the House of Representatives), were pulling strings behind the scenes to scupper further investigation into the University\u2019s illegal practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the EFCC never contacted me or my Attorney, and stonewalled all my attempts to follow up on the investigation. My suspicion was later justified when my Attorney received a motion on notice seeking leave to appeal the judgement of 28 September 2020 by the National Industrial Court, Akure Judicial Division, in Suit NICN/AK/23/2018: Sunday Adediran Ajibade vs Achievers Educational Investment Ltd & 2 Ors. In paragraphs 4(f) and (h) of the supporting affidavit deposed to by Toyin Bamifere, she averred amongst other things as follows:\n\n\u201c4(f) That by the time the University resumed early this year 2021, the Respondent through his counsel had already petitioned EFCC Ilorin Zone to harass, intimidate, arrest and detained the officers of the Applicants for days.\n\n\n\n\u201c(h) That it took the intervention of the Attorney General and Minister for Justice and Chairman EFCC before these officers detained were released and the EFCC stopped destructing the activities of the school.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have annexed a certified true copy of the motion on notice filed on 19 November 2021, the supporting affidavit and other accompanying processes. The import of Mrs. Bamifere\u2019s shocking revelation is that the Chief Legal Officer of the Federation interfered with and/or meddled in the EFCC\u2019s ongoing pension fraud investigation. Her depositions certainly cast a dark cloud over the investigative efforts of law enforcement agencies and further erode confidence in our criminal justice system. In addition, they nourish the narrative that highly connected individuals can leverage their influence to insulate their illegal activities from scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the record, Achievers University operates an unlicensed pension scheme tagged \u201cUniversity Savings Scheme\u201d, which it uses as a piggy bank to siphon hundreds of millions of Naira in employees\u2019 pension funds, in simulated compliance with the Pension (Reformed) Act, 2014.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the University is not even registered with the Pension Commission (PenCom), does not have an employer code, and is not registered under the mandatory contributory pension scheme, contrary to the Act. The University has thereby denied the national Pension Funds the legitimate access to pooling and investing pension contributions of the staff of the University and jeopardized my social security and that of other employees.\n\n\u201cMr. Oladokun Farinre (Chartered Accountant and University Bursar from 2008-2021) admitted these facts during his testimony as the University\u2019s sole witness in Suit NICN/AK/23/2018, which the Court reproduced in its judgement of 28 September 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Court equally found in Suit No. NICN/AK/25/2017: Olayiwola Akanji Popoola vs Achievers University, Owo, that these same admissions by Mr. Farinre were proof of the University\u2019s breach of the Pension (Reformed) Act, 2014. Your alleged intervention has now derailed the investigation of these admitted infractions of the law that I reported in my letters to the EFCC and PenCom. Consequently, criminal breach of trust and pension fraud at Achievers University lingers on.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honourable AG would recall that as at 31 December 2021, the Federal Government borrowed N8.77 trillion from Pension Funds to finance budget deficits and infrastructural development programmes. Such funds may become inaccessible, depleted, and threaten the national economy in future if they become subject to diversion and misappropriation by employers like Achievers University.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is therefore clear that the depositions in Mrs. Bamifere\u2019s affidavit are too grievous to be ignored or dismissed by a wave of the hand; for they suggest that the Minister of Justice (a Senior Advocate of Nigeria) is aiding and abetting pension fraud. Thus, it is imperative that the Honourable AGF respond to these claims bordering on gross misconduct, abuse of office and sabotage of a criminal investigation, comprehensively. I fear that silence and/or anything short of a robust response may not bode well, considering the avalanche of similar accusations against your exalted office in recent times.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Ayorinde said he had nothing to say as the matter was already in court.",

During my third visit on 30 March 2021, I discussed with the Zonal Head, one Mr. Kazeem Oseni, and presented him with documentary evidence of my allegations, following which Mr. Oshili Moses stated that he would invite me in three weeks to provide additional information. This invitation did not materialize so I contacted Mr. Oshili, and he stated that the Headquarters office had recalled the case file, and would contact me.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Oshili\u2019s report staggered my imagination, and I began suspecting that the University officials, particularly Hon. Bode Ayorinde (PhD) (the University Pro-Chancellor, who is a politician and former member of the House of Representatives), were pulling strings behind the scenes to scupper further investigation into the University\u2019s illegal practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the EFCC never contacted me or my Attorney, and stonewalled all my attempts to follow up on the investigation. My suspicion was later justified when my Attorney received a motion on notice seeking leave to appeal the judgement of 28 September 2020 by the National Industrial Court, Akure Judicial Division, in Suit NICN/AK/23/2018: Sunday Adediran Ajibade vs Achievers Educational Investment Ltd & 2 Ors.

The import of Mrs. Bamifere\u2019s shocking revelation is that the Chief Legal Officer of the Federation interfered with and/or meddled in the EFCC\u2019s ongoing pension fraud investigation. Her depositions certainly cast a dark cloud over the investigative efforts of law enforcement agencies and further erode confidence in our criminal justice system. In addition, they nourish the narrative that highly connected individuals can leverage their influence to insulate their illegal activities from scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the record, Achievers University operates an unlicensed pension scheme tagged \u201cUniversity Savings Scheme\u201d, which it uses as a piggy bank to siphon hundreds of millions of Naira in employees\u2019 pension funds, in simulated compliance with the Pension (Reformed) Act, 2014.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the University is not even registered with the Pension Commission (PenCom), does not have an employer code, and is not registered under the mandatory contributory pension scheme, contrary to the Act. The University has thereby denied the national Pension Funds the legitimate access to pooling and investing pension contributions of the staff of the University and jeopardized my social security and that of other employees.\n\n\u201cMr. Oladokun Farinre (Chartered Accountant and University Bursar from 2008-2021) admitted these facts during his testimony as the University\u2019s sole witness in Suit NICN/AK/23/2018, which the Court reproduced in its judgement of 28 September 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Court equally found in Suit No. NICN/AK/25/2017: Olayiwola Akanji Popoola vs Achievers University, Owo, that these same admissions by Mr. Farinre were proof of the University\u2019s breach of the Pension (Reformed) Act, 2014.

          "text": "Sunday Ajibade, a former worker of Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State has accused the management of the institution owned by a former House of Representatives member, Bode Ayorinde, of diverting millions of naira of pension contributions of staff members.\n\n\n\nHe also accused Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Abubakar Malami of allegedly interfering with the investigation of the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC) into the alleged misappropriation of pension funds at the university, urging him to issue a disclaimer to exonerate himself from the grave allegation.\n\nAjibade disclosed this in a letter to Malami titled \u2018Alleged Interference With EFCC Investigation Into Misappropriation Of Pension Funds/Pension Fraud At Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State\u2019.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, one Mr Oladokun Farinre, a Chartered Accountant (ICAN) and the university's bursary from 2008 to 2021 admitted that the institution did not enrol its employees in the nation's uniform contributory pension scheme.\n\n\n\nRather, it operated an unlicensed and unregulated pension scheme tagged \"University Savings Scheme\" where the management diverted the pension contributions of its staff members to.\n\n\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI am a former employee of Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State, where I worked as a lecturer between November 2012 and October 2017. In a letter dated 17 November 2020 written by my Attorney, A. A. Solagbade Esq. of Femi Emmanuel Emodamori & Co. and addressed to the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC), I reported the incident of misappropriation of pension funds and pension fraud at the University.\n\n\u201cI have annexed the acknowledged copy of that letter, for ease of reference.

          "text": "Garba Shehu, presidential spokesperson, says it is \u201cunfair\u201d to say President Muhammadu Buhari is not responsive to victims of violent attacks in the country.\n\nShehu spoke on Friday during an interview with Channels Television.\n\nBuhari is currently in Dubai for a condolence visit over the death of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThe president\u2019s visit to UAE had elicited varied reactions, with some Nigerians saying Buhari should focus on victims of violent attacks in his country, rather than pay condolence visits abroad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about the concerns raised, Shehu said he had accompanied the president on condolence visits to some states in Nigeria.\n\nThe presidential spokesperson added that condolence visits by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo are also on behalf of the presidency.\n\n\u201cThose Nigerians should be told that they should look at all of the facts. I have accompanied the president to Sokoto on a condolence visit after a major incident,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI accompanied him to Zamfara. He spoke to the governor, parliamentarians, religious and traditional leaders.\n\n\u201cI accompanied the president to Benue state. He addressed the governor in government house, Makurdi, after a major incident. I accompanied him to Jos after a crisis.\n\n\u201cSo, did the president go to all the places where there have been incidents of violence or killings? No, he did not go.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is unfair also to make the conclusion wrongly that he had not paid attention or had not visited. He had been to Maiduguri quite a number of times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt depends on what Nigerians choose to look at. The president has been responsive and he has been discharging the obligations that rest upon him as the president and commander-in-chief, in dealing with all of these matters. He has not cut short in any way.\n\n\u201cThe point I want to make is that the administration has been very responsive.

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nHow are you doing? How has your week been? No, I\u2019m not being clich\u00e9. It\u2019s not just about consuming my content and knowing how I\u2019m faring.\n\nPlease keep me updated on how you\u2019re doing, too. Also, engage my newsletter by leaving your thoughts and encouraging others to subscribe. Promise to do it? Pinky swear? I believe you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo, I\u2019m excited today, and you know why! \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a Tomorrow is the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Africa Summit (TABS)! Well, honestly, it\u2019s been a stressful week for the Techpoint Africa team. But, you know what? It\u2019s over already. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve registered, you\u2019ll see all the fantastic things we\u2019ve packaged just for you tomorrow. However, all tickets, including giveaways, are sold out.\n\nSo, prepare your NFT and web3 questions. You also don\u2019t want to miss the exhibition booth, networking, and the hackathon\u2019s grand finale. You\u2019re excited too, aren\u2019t you? \ud83d\ude09 I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\n\nIf you do not have a ticket to the physical event, you can register online for free here.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\nNetflix\u2019s Mystery Box\n\nTikTok\u2019s plan to credit creators\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory Farms, a Kenyan-based startup, has raised $5 million in new funding.\n\nEd Brakeman, a senior managing director at Bain Capital and Hans den Bieman, Founder and ex-CEO of Mowi, a company that claims to be one of the world\u2019s largest salmon businesses, led the investment.\n\nLaunched in 2015 by Joseph Rehmann (CEO), Victory Farms is a tilapia aquaculture startup and farm with hatcheries, nursery ponds, and deep-water cages.\n\nThe company claims to have grown twice as fast as any other African fish company. Also, the CEO says they have sold to mass market Africans through a highly innovative Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) cold chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Rehmann, the RTM cold chain uses predictive data to push fish to thousands of marketers every day across Kenya with less than 1% spoilage.\n\nCurrently, Victory Farms has more than 54 retail locations where over 15,000 market women go to buy fish, and according to Rehmann, they use no electricity or ice.\n\nThis funding will enable the company to expand into Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.\n\nNetflix for kids and people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix has launched \u201cMystery Box\u201d, a new feature that helps kids discover new movies and TV shows.\n\nWhy? Netflix wants children to try new movies. According to Netflix, children frequently rewatch their favourite shows, making it difficult to persuade them to try something new.\n\nAlso, the company says Mystery Box will provide kids with a personalised experience that will assist them in discovering their next favourite series or movies, and reconnect them with a familiar character.\n\nThis is now available on the company\u2019s connected TV platforms globally.\n\nNetflix is also expanding its accessibility features globally and launching a new collection featuring stories about people with disabilities in honour of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which was observed yesterday, May 19, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the company is expanding its subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) and audio descriptions (AD) offerings in additional languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\nWhy? Heather Dowdy, Netflix\u2019s Director of Accessibility, stated that they are adding more subtitles because more subscribers are watching disability-inclusive content globally.\n\nMoreover, remember that Netflix reported a 200,000-subscriber loss globally in the first quarter of 2022. Perhaps, this could be a strategy for Netflix to retain and gain more subscribers.\n\nTikTok to credit creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never used TikTok, but I\u2019m considering signing up. You\u2019re asking me why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\nJust this month, the company introduced two new features \u2014 Pulse and Branded Mission \u2014 for content creators to earn money on the app.\n\nDespite its popularity, TikTok has been criticised for amplifying trends without crediting the original creators. TikTok launched a new feature to that effect two days ago, May 18, 2022.\n\nThis feature, a button, allows creators to credit all types of inspiration for their content, like dances, jokes, and viral sounds. By tapping on \u201ccredit\u201d in the video\u2019s caption, TikTok viewers can discover the original creators behind the content.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nReport: The impact of Y Combinator in Africa over the years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know that YouTube can identify the most replayed parts of your video? This means you can skip some boring parts of YouTube videos. And no, you haven\u2019t missed out because the feature was introduced yesterday, May 18, 2022.\n\nThe company said it added a graph that people can use to quickly locate and watch parts played the most by other users. Per YouTube, \u201cif the graph is high, that part of the video has been replayed frequently.\u201d\n\nYouTube is also introducing another feature, Single Loop, which allows users to loop a video indefinitely. Moreover, in full-screen mode, a new panel will appear to display video information like the video description, video chapters, and comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, YouTube is expanding support for video chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles. It\u2019s a feature that enables users to skip ahead to a specific video section or easily rewatch that section.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAutochek\u2019s new acquisition\n\nTikTok\u2019s Branded Mission\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\nJumia\u2019s earnings for Q1 2022\n\nAutochek acquires Morocco\u2019s KIFAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek, a digital automotive commerce company, has acquired Morocco\u2019s KIFAL Auto.\n\nThis follows Autochek purchasing Cheki\u2019s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria and collaborating with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast last year.\n\nConsequently, Autochek is now available in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast). It\u2019s also present in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). And thanks to the acquisition of KIFAL Auto, it now has a presence in North Africa, specifically Morocco.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, KIFAL claims it\u2019s one of the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets for used and new cars.\n\nKIFAL Auto, like Autochek, connects car buyers and sellers and, through partnerships, provides financing and insurance.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Maane and the KIFAL Auto team joins Autochek to lead the company\u2019s North African expansion efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Autochek, it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and partnerships with over 70 financing partners, including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Bank.\n\nFor more information on this acquisition, listen to today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast here.\n\nTikTok to roll out a new ad product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has announced the launch of \u201cBranded Mission,\u201d a new advertising product.\n\nWith this product, creators will be able to connect with brands and potentially earn rewards for their videos using this product.\n\nAdvertisers can use the new ad product for crowdsourcing content from creators and turning top-performing videos into ads. Also, they can launch branded campaigns and encourage creators to participate in them.\n\nThey\u2019ll create a brief and distribute it to the creator community to encourage them to participate in Branded Missions. TikTok creators can then choose which Branded Missions to join.\n\nIn summary, Branded Mission allows emerging and aspiring creators to respond to ad casting calls directly on TikTok.\n\nSo, who is eligible to participate? Branded Missions are open to all creators who are 18 years old and above and have at least 1,000 followers.\n\nPer TikTok, eligible creators whose videos are chosen by brands will \u201cbenefit from a cash payment and increased traffic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company believes that this product will allow the TikTok community to have a creative hand in brand campaign ads.\n\nBranded Mission is currently in beta testing and is available to brands in over a dozen markets. Plus, it will be available in more markets later this year.\n\nSimilar, but kinda different: Recall that earlier this month, TikTok introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that allows brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nWell, the company emphasises that it is constantly looking for innovative ways to support creators and assist brands in reaching users on its platforms with relevant content.\n\nBesides, the product is currently available in 12 countries, with plans to expand into additional markets by the end of the year.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in two days! Are you ready?\n\nMARA is giving away 20 tickets to attend Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit.

To win, follow the instructions here.\n\nBesides, online tickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBamba, a mobile-based enterprise software for African micro-merchants, has raised $3.2 million in seed funding to scale its app and expand its team.\n\nThe round was led by 468 Capital, with participation from Presight Ventures, Jigsaw VC, and high-profile angel investors, Mato Peric, Leonard Stiegeler, Laurin Hainy, and Thomas Stafford.\n\nBastian Gotter (CEO) founded Bamba in 2022 as a mobile application company. The startup is focused on simple tools for merchants to manage their customers, record stocks, receive payments, make payments, and access cash advances against their future cash flow.\n\nBamba aims to be one of the innovators in addressing the lack of digital solutions for record-keeping and payments, which creates a barrier that prevents these businesses from scaling due to insufficient access to credit facilities.\n\nConsequently, it plans to use the funds to expand its engineering team and user base in 12 sub-Saharan African countries where mobile money is prevalent.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumia, the pan-African e-commerce company, announced its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.\n\nOn today\u2019s podcast, Chimgozirim refers to Jumia as \u201c\u2026the guy who never fulfils his potential.\u201d What?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d That was brutal, if you ask me. What do you think?\n\nAnyway, when you compare this report to the first quarter of 2021, you\u2019ll see how Jumia\u2019s results demonstrated consistent growth.\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking me how. Well, I\u2019ve got you. The report shows that Jumia experienced significant growth in orders, gross merchandise value (GMV), and revenue.\n\nIn other words, orders increased by 40% year on year, from 6.6 million to 9.3 million. GMV increased by 27% year on year, from $198.9 million to $252.7 million. And Jumia\u2019s revenue reached $47.6 million, up 44 percent from $33 million in Q1 2021.\n\nHowever, these figures fell far short of where the eCommerce giant ended 2021, with the last quarter recording GMV sales of $330 million, revenue of $62 million, and orders of 11.3 million.\n\nDespite \u201ccontinued global supply chain volatility for these categories,\u201d food delivery grew 86% year over year, while phones and electronics grew 19%.\n\nOther negatives include its Q1 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) loss, at $53 million, up 70% year on year.\n\nIf you want to know why Chimgozirim said what he said, don\u2019t forget to listen to the podcast.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSEC\u2019s rules: Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

Using the National Identification Number (NIN), the organisation wants to track financial transactions in the country to tax Nigerians effectively. Your NIN will be required for any transaction you engage in, including paying school fees or purchasing a car.\n\nThis was how we kicked off proceedings on the Techpoint Africa podcast today. While this development could increase government revenues, Oluwanifemi wondered how good this could be in light of revelations that cast doubt on the safety of data collected by Nigerian government agencies.\n\nNext was a look at Jumia\u2019s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1 2021, the company witnessed impressive growth with revenue growing to $47.6 million, orders growing to 9.3 million, and gross merchandise value hitting $252.7 million.\n\nWith the company announcing that it had acquired a payment service solution provider license (PSSP), we explored the possibility of the company growing its fintech footprints. We also touched briefly on its healthtech ambitions and its chances of survival.\n\nWe rounded up the day\u2019s discussion with news of Autochek\u2019s acquisition of the Moroccan cars marketplace KIFAL Autos and the viability of the BNPL model for cars. Emmanuel shared a Technext report that revealed that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales. With many Nigerians earning below 200,000, it\u2019s not clear how profitable these companies could be in the long run.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, please follow the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

Please help us express our profound gratitude to him. We will continue to appreciate his kind gesture.\u201d\n\nHailing the army officers\u2019 wives for the support and encouragement they continue to give to officers, ensuring peace and security in the country, the governor said, \u201cWe know the role of the Nigerian Army Officers\u2019 Wives play in the lives of our services men, and also, when we run into a crisis, we call on the army and we know the professionalism at which they respond to our call.\n\n\u201cFor us as a government, our priority is our people. It\u2019s our people first because it\u2019s people that create everything first; it\u2019s people that create money, as well as technology, among others. So, without education and healthcare, at the basis, to strengthen your population, nothing else is going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThat is why we have prioritized education in Edo and we are spending as much as we can afford on those two issues that affect the people. In the case of education, our focus is on the foundation, because once you have a sound foundation, that child can build on that foundation subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe children in our public schools can compete with their colleagues anywhere in the world. Certainly, we want to extend this to your barracks if you allow us.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nPensioners in Osun State have lamented the non-committal of their pension areas by Gboyega Oyetola-led administration, noting that they are presently facing starvation.\n\nThis was asserted by Mrs Ronke Aderibigbe, the Coordinator of Nigeria Union of Pensioners, Women\u2019s Wing, Osun State chapter during a prayer session organised by the wing in Osogbo on Thursday.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cwe are facing a lot of problems, challenges on our pensions in Osun. We are facing a lot of problems. We are facing a lot of challenges in Osun State as regards our entitlements.\n\n\u201cFor instance some pensioners who retired in 2008/09 are yet to be renumerated. Gratuity is not forthcoming, 33% is not forthcoming, we are on half salary, half pension or quarter pension.\n\n\u201cWe now notice that our efforts to meet Governor Oyetola have been proving futile. It is like an exercise in futility.\n\n\u201cOur management, the NUP (Nigeria Union of Pensioners) under the Chairmanship of Alhaji Abdulganiyu and the Secretary, Comrade Bandele Aina, they have done all necessary things to meet with the Governor. We don\u2019t know our sins to Governor Oyetola. Since we have sought his face and he has refused to look at our faces, we know God will answer our prayers.\n\n\u201cWe have written so many letters (but) nothing is forthcoming. With all our struggles, Governor Gboyega Oyetola is not doing anything. He has rubbished us. He has pushed us to the walls. And we feel there is no more to do than to pray.\n\n\u201cThe SSG is there. The Chief of Staff is there; they cannot say they don\u2019t know what is happening just as Governor Oyetola is claiming he did not know what is happening. After all he (Oyetola) worked with Governor Aregbesola (Former Governor of the state, now Minister of Interior)\n\n\u201cPensioners are dying. Oyetola has refused to pay. He has refused to give us our entitlements. We are dying because there is no money to treat ourselves. There are elders amongst us who have terminal ailments.\u201d\n\nShe added that the situation has forced some pensioners to be commercial motorcycle riders, while their children, take up odd jobs.\n\nShe alleged that the Government officials have found \u2018a cabal\u2019 and only pay their family members and relatives.\n\nConclusively, she begged Oyetola to attend to address their grievances before the gubernatorial election stipulated for July 16, 2022.",

          "text": "An Abuja-based Catholic Priest, theologian, author, preacher, teacher, administrator, musician, social commentator and an activist, Rev. Father George Ehusani, has called on Nigerian youths to reject old politicians in the 2023 general elections.\n\nAccording to the cleric, the older politicians have failed the country, adding that they have nothing to offer again.\n\nSpeaking at a roundtable discussion organised by Development Specs Academy (DSA) at the Army Resource Center in Abuja on Friday, he said politicians, who promised to make one Dollar equal to a Naira only for the exchange rate to rise to N580 to a Dollar, should be rejected.\n\n\u201cReject the old politicians,\u201d Ehusani said, insisting that the 2023 general election should be a turning point for the Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cThey have failed, reject those people who said they will make dollar to naira but the same dollar to naira has now risen to about 580,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, former President of the Historical Society of Nigeria, Professor Chris Ogbogbo, has said one of the challenges confronting Nigerian youths was lack of a sense of history, which is why they do not appreciate where the country is today.\n\nThe professor, who spoke on the topic, \u2018Youth Crisis\u2019, said the youths have been damaged because they don\u2019t have a good sense of history.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand where we are coming from, so if you don\u2019t appreciate where we are now and as a consequence, your future would be bleak,\u201d Ogbogbo said, adding that Nigerians often forget that those who occupied leadership positions before 1960 and in the post-colonial period were mainly youths.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cA good number of them made their mark on the national and international scene when they were under 30s.\n\n\u201cI know, when I was president of the Historical Society of Nigeria, my main mandate as President was to fight for the restoration of history in the primary and secondary schools\u2019 curriculum for 34 years.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of you who are here now did not study history in secondary school or primary school.

Meanwhile, its peers are all well ahead catching up with the first world. This is clearly the culmination of the two decades of bad governance.\n\n\u201cGovernance has been defined by pilferage, wastage, prodigality and mind-boggling corruption. Our political culture has been pedestrian, defined by money and violence while caught in the web of politics of big men rather than the politics of big ideas. All these can be traced to the quality of leadership or lack of it as it were.\n\n\u201cThis is further compounded by the fact that the leadership recruitment process in the political parties is so flawed that it does not appear to have any criteria at all, much less prioritize knowledge or character.\n\n\u201cThus we have found ourselves on a dangerous trajectory, that is not only unsustainable but actually dangerous, because the anger and frustration it has been generating can consume the polity, as it has always done in the history of human societies.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 election offers us the opportunity to change our trajectory by electing leaders that are knowledgeable, competent and credible.\n\n\u201cGovernance in the 21st century is a corporate scientific business. Modern governance starts with a vision, which is broken down into mission, which then requires planning and monitoring and evaluation, all of which require knowledge.\u201d\n\nBugaje, former Special Adviser to ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar said the PRP was built on the premise to uplift the poor and downtrodden.",

          "text": "Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, has advocated for the emergence of best President with the capacity and foresight to solve Nigeria\u2019s myriad of problems, either from the North of the South, come 2023.\n\nOba Ogunwusi said he is joining the political tendency that is arguing that zoning of political offices should have no place in Nigerian politics.\n\nThe revered royal father told his hosts, on Arise TV breakfast programme, The Morning Show that emotions had no place in development and Nigeria should not make it a foundation for building sound governance, because it would backfire.\n\nIt was also on the day the Ooni, who spoke from his palace in Ife, flatly denied endorsing National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is one of the candidates for the party\u2019s ticket to contest next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cLet us focus on the factual things. Who is going to turn around our structures irrespective of emotions and sentiments. We have built our institutions on emotions and sentiments. It\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s not going to last. We have problems in this country \u2013 very many problems. Who is going to solve the problem of security, who is going to solve the problem of unemployment? The youths are everywhere and we are churning them out in millions.\n\n\u201cLet us look at it very critically from our analytical mind other than the emotions and sentiments of zoning. It\u2019s very important. If our nation is built on sentiments, then, we\u2019re going to have issues.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is to face the facts. Let all our leaders, past, present and the ones that are aspiring to lead in the future, let them lock themselves in one room and tell themselves the truth. It\u2019s very important for them to tell themselves the truth. They should also stop working in factions.\n\n\u201cNigeria is greater than all of us. Nigeria is far greater than all of us. They (Presidents) only there for eight years. The country that is greater than all of us, why don\u2019t they want us to talk about it. It\u2019s very important they should talk about it. So, the issue of zoning, I have a different school of thought about it.\n\n\u201cWhat is critical for me is equality across board. Who is going to do the job? If the person to do the job is going to come from the South, so be it. Everybody in life, have comparative advantage. Some have strength to do things longer than others. Some do not have the competence and the wherewithal, may be because of their environment, may be their tradition, culture will not sustain them to go all the way.\n\n\u201cIf it is a candidate from the North that will do it, then, let us go ahead. When it comes to the basis of politics, they will now say North, and then break it down to North East, North West and North Central. What is going on in this country? Who is facing the issue of our dear country?\n\n\u201cNow, when it comes to the South, they will again break it down to South East, South South and South West. What is happening. Who is going to solve the problem of security? Who is going to solve the problem of unemployment? But I know that at some point, there will be transformation.\n\nDenying his alleged endorsement of Tinubu, the royal father, who spoke ahead of the honouring of 100 youths with the Royal African Young Leadership Award (RAYLA), which he hosts on the auspices of the Global Outreach Initiative (GOI), on Saturday, said he only prayed for the APC leader and former Governor of Lagos State, as he did for others who approached him, adding that as a father of all, he would not show preference to any politician during such a contest.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "A chieftain of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), in Ekiti state, Mr. Dayo Ashaolu, has stated why out-going governors usually abandon their deputies while searching for their successors.\n\nSpeaking exclusively with Blueprint Weekend on why most outgoing governors are torn between picking their deputies and loyalists to succeed them, he said one of the reasons incumbents usually look the other way could be lack of trust.\n\nAsahaolu said further that many of the governors and their deputies hardly knew each other before they got to the seat, stressing that some deputies were imposed on the governors by party leaders.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s either because of where he comes from or whether or not he represents some godfather; in a situation like this the governor may not want such a deputy to succeed him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s look at our immediate family; it is not all your brothers you can boast off that will manage your property very well if you are out of town.\n\n\u201cAgain, some governors are so greedy that they want to eat the state cake alone with little or none for their deputies; such governors may be reluctant to hand over to their deputies in order to avoid a probe.\u201d\n\nNot done yet, the SDP publicity secretary noted that, \u201cAge is another factor which if it\u2019s not on the side of the deputy governor, it would not allow for power to pass to the deputy.\n\n\u201cTake Ekiti state, for example, you don\u2019t expect Fayemi to hand over to his deputy governor who is already over 70 years old.\u201d\n\nAdebayo said further that \u201ccompetency is another factor,\u201d adding that \u201csome deputy governors may not be competent enough to go ahead with the good job of their bosses and so such governors will look for a better candidate.\u201d\n\nHe also said \u201crotation may not favour some deputies, especially where rotation is key to how the state is governed.\n\n\u201cNot only that, the population of the deputy\u2019s constituency may also hinder him from succeeding his boss. We have seen an instance where the deputy came from the minority with lesser votes and he was not considered.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, party or party leaders\u2019 decisions can sometimes serve as an obstacle to some deputies\u2019 quest to succeed their bosses.\u201d\n\nSuspicion\n\nAlso, in an exclusive chat with this reporter, a stalwart of the\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo state, Adebowale Laditi, noted that\n\nthe relationships between most governors and their deputies \u201care suspicious and not too tight politically.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, they never trust each other enough for possible recommendations for higher positions.\n\nLaditi said deputy governors in most cases were products of party imposition, stressing, \u201cThe governors have always been at a crossroads when it comes to picking successors, especially if their deputies are interested. But the funniest thing is that at the end of the day, they (governors) will have their ways as against their \u2018spare tyres\u2019 (deputies\u2019) interest.\u201d\n\nGodfatherism, disloyalty\n\nAsked for his opinion on the matter, an analyst at S&D Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, said most governors had several reasons they didn\u2019t endorse their deputies.\n\n\u201cBut major amongst them are party positions on zoning, agreements reached with godfathers or sponsors before becoming the governor and majorly because the deputies are perceived to know too much and might be difficult to control which has happened in some states in time past.\n\nFor Olamilekan Adefolarin, a political economist, mistrust and disloyalty are amongst the several factors that could make an out-going governor not to endorse his deputy to take over from him.\n\nHe told Blueprint Weekend exclusively that, \u201cOur understanding of contemporary party politics in Nigeria, especially with the advent of the Fourth Republic in 1999, and the do-or-die syndrome, there is supposed to be a democratic process that will ensure continuity in governance.\n\n\u201cHowever, mistrust and disloyalty have always crept up to cause disagreements amongst party members. Majorly, this occurs between governors and their deputies.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, for many of them, endorsing them is like self-inflicted poisoning. Nonetheless, the Nigerian is not against governors endorsing their deputies, but one can understand this could also be a plot to allow somebody that would succeed them to cover up the mess they might have created.\u201d\n\nCorrupt dealings\n\nAs far as the national coordinator of the APC Professional Forum (APC-PF), Comrade Akeem Akintayo, is concerned most governors do not trust their deputies to cover their dirty deals when they leave office.\n\nHe said naturally, deputy governors were frontrunners as a result of continuity of great ideas and programmes, but greed and corruption usually lead to conflicts among governors and their deputies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of interest by politicians in the corridors of power. Unfortunately, many incumbent governors do not value loyalty and capacity. They rather focus more on who can cover their tracks.\n\n\u201cOvertime it has been revealed that most deputies who take over from their predecessors cannot be trusted to keep the dirty secrets of the bosses. I think this is the main reason many Nigerian governors or political leaders do not want their deputies to succeed them. A case study is the relationship between Obasanjo and Atiku.\n\n\u201cThese deputies know too much of their respective bosses and their corrupt dealings; in that case the chief executive declines support to their second-in- command. It is typical of the Nigerian political scenario.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians go to politics for the sole purpose of dirty dealings instead of service to the Nigerian people. In advanced political scenarios, deputy governors are the frontrunners to succeed their bosses for continuity of development ideas and programmes. Continuity is the bedrock of sustainable development goals,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, speaking exclusively to Blueprint Weekend, a former commissioner in Ekiti state, Mr. Lanre Ogunsuyi, said deputy governors were a creation of the Constitution, but that it was left for the governors who \u201csee them as irritants that must be tolerated.\u201d\n\nOgunsuyi, who served under former governor Ayo Fayose, also said; \u201cOver the years, there is usually a cold war between them and so relationships are at the lowest ebb in addition to distrust which is why they shop elsewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cErosion of trust over the years often ruins earlier agreements for succession.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "Russian forces have bombarded areas of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas from land and air, killing at least 13 civilians, Ukraine\u2019s military said on Friday, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the assaults had turned the region into \u201chell\u201d.\n\nAs the war neared the three-month mark, the Russians were intensifying their efforts to subdue the Donbas region, the Ukrainian general staff said.\n\nThey had hit civilian infrastructure with \u201cmassive\u201d artillery shelling, including multiple rocket-launchers, the general staff said in a statement. Russian aircraft had also struck at targets.\n\nRussian shelling in the Luhansk area of Donbas killed 13 civilians over the past 24 hours, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Twelve of those deaths were in the town of Sievierodonesk but a Russian assault there had been unsuccessful, he said.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports and Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\n\u201cThe Donbas is completely destroyed,\u201d President Zelenskiy said in an address on Thursday night. \u201cIt is hell there \u2013 and that is not an exaggeration.\u201d\n\nThere were also constant strikes on the Odesa region in the south, he said.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports and Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nRussia\u2019s focus on Donbas follows its failure to capture the capital Kyiv in the early stages of the invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24.\n\nThousands of people \u2013 many of them civilians \u2013 have been killed and whole towns and cities razed in the gravest crisis in Europe in decades.\n\nAlmost a third of the Ukraine\u2019s people have fled their homes, including more than 6 million who have left the country in a refugee exodus, while others remain trapped in cities pulverised by Russian bombardments.\n\nBritish military intelligence said on Friday that Russia is likely to further reinforce its operations in Donbas once it finally secures the southern port city of Mariupol \u2013 scene of a weeks-long siege and Russia\u2019s most significant success in an otherwise faltering campaign.\n\nThe region, an industrial powerhouse, compromises the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\n\nPutin calls the invasion of Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to rid the country of fascists \u2013 an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.\n\nThe Kremlin leader was due to hold a security council meeting later on Friday.\n\nWESTERN SUPPORT\n\nWestern powers, who have strongly condemned Russia\u2019s actions and sought to isolate Moscow with an array of sanctions, were stepping up their support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Group of Seven rich nations on Thursday agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion to make up for lost revenues as the war wrecks its economy.\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved nearly $40 billion in new aid for Ukraine, by far the largest U.S. aid package to date.\n\nThe White House is also working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia\u2019s naval blockade, which has largely stopped Ukraine\u2019s exports of food. read more\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of using food as a weapon by holding \u201chostage\u201d supplies for not just Ukrainians, but also millions around the world. read more The war has caused global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser to soar.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nHOLD OUT\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began, with the Kyiv government ordering the defenders of a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down after a protracted siege.\n\nBritish military intelligence said as many as 1,700 soldiers were likely to have surrendered at the Azovstal steel factory, matching a similar number released on Thursday by Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have tried to arrange a prisoner swap, have declined to comment on the number, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still inside the plant.\n\n\u201cA certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\u201d he said.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of prisoners from Azovstal now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks.\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Parliament Pressures Buhari to Sign Act that Changes Rules in Middle of Electoral Process",
          "text": "Members of the National Assembly have started mounting pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the amended Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, which some analysts have said would amount to altering rules of the electoral process in the middle of the game.\n\nThis is coming at a time the Supreme Court has joined the Rivers State government in a suit seeking its interpretation of the controversial Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHowever, analysts also expressed concern that if the president yields to the pressure of the lawmakers and assents to the amended section of the Act, it might affect the timetable for the 2023 general elections that had been released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) because under the electoral body\u2019s schedule of activities, elections for delegates ought to taken place this weekend.\n\nMore so, some analysts pointed out that what members of the National Assembly did was that they amended the Act for their own personal gains.\n\n\u201cEssentially, once they passed the Electoral Act, INEC released the timetable and the process started. They now went back and changed the rules when the game has already started,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe federal legislature, had last week amended Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act to enable some categories of non-elected offices within the executive officers of the 18 registered political parties vote at the various categories of party executives, including the President, Vice President, Governors and Deputy governors, at the congresses and national convention expected from Saturday.\n\nIn view of this, the 18 registered political parties have not been able to present their delegates lists, because the President has yet to assent the amended act.\n\nThe implication is that only the statutory delegates and the elected three man-delegate as well as local governments\u2019 delegates could vote at the congresses expected to commence Saturday.\n\nIn the PDP, for instance, a source said the delegates list was not ready, because the NWC was waiting for the signing of the amended section 84 (12) to enable the party compile a list of the executives from the wards to the states congresses.\n\nSpecifically, Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, initially allowed only elected delegates of a party to participate in conventions and congresses. But the National Assembly, last week, amended the Electoral Act to allow statutory delegate participate and vote in party conventions, congresses, and meetings.\n\nHowever, in his argument, the Deputy Senate President Omo-Agege, said the amendment sought to make provision for those who would not be elected as ad-hoc delegates to participate in the conventions, congresses, or meetings of political parties.\n\nHe further asserted that the initial section of the Bill was an error on the part of the legislature.\n\nCorroborating Omo-Agege\u2019s presentation, Senator Uche Ekwunife, said the amendment was a straightforward one, adding that, \u201cwithout this amendment, most of us will not have the liberty of voting during the convention. I support the amendment. Let us have it for second reading.\u201d\n\nSenator Sabi Abdullahi, said, \u201cThis Bill is a very straightforward Bill, and let us put in on record that this error was something that happened inadvertently. We have seen the error and that is why we are back here to ensure nobody suffers any harm.\u201d\n\nThe Bill was read the second time and referred to the Committee of the Whole where it was passed.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that if by the end of Friday, the bill was not signed into law by President Buhari, then, executives of the 18 political parties would not be allowed to vote at the presidential conventions, National Assembly congresses, governorship congresses and other congresses to elect the standard bearers of their candidates.\n\nS\u2019Court Joins Rivers in Case over Section 84 of Electoral Act\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court, on Thursday, joined the Rivers State government in a suit seeking its interpretation of the controversial Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nThe apex court joined the state after its application for joinder was not opposed by other plaintiffs in the suit filed by President Buhari and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nThe hearing was earlier slated for May 19 but has now been adjourned to May 26 to enable parties exchange processes.\n\nBut the Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly and the State Attorney General, were joined as second and third defendants in the suit. The National Assembly is the first defendant.\n\nAccording to the applicants, they would be affected one way or the other by the outcome of the case since the subject matter in the originating summons relates to the validity and constitutionality of the provisions of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act enacted by the National Assembly and applicable through-out the country, including Rivers state.\n\nThe 1st applicant claimed that the outcome would affect the, \u201cLegal rights of the Rivers State House of Assembly and impinge upon its legislative powers to make laws in addition to, but not inconsistent with Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act enacted by the National Assembly and applicable in Rivers State and will affect the scope of its authority to make laws as conferred on it by Section 7 and Item E. 12 of the concurrent legislative list of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nThe AG of Rivers, said he should be joined in the suit as the state was constitutionally bound to be governed democratically in accordance with letters and spirit of the constitution.\n\nResponding, Buhari\u2019s counsel, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), said he was not opposed to the applicants joining the suit.\n\nIn the suit filed on April 29, 2022, marked: SC/CV/504/2022 by the President and the Chief Law Officer of the country, wherein they are contending that the said Section of the Electoral Act 2022 was in conflict with constitutional provisions, has the National Assembly as the sole defendant.\n\nThe plaintiffs noted that the Constitution has made provisions for qualifications and disqualifications for the offices of the President and Vice President, Governor and Deputy-Governor, Senate and House of Representatives and House of Assembly, Ministers, Commissioners and Special Advisers.\n\nBuhari and Malami prayed the apex court to declare that, by the joint and or combined reading of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196, of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which also ignores Section 84(3) of the same Act, is an additional qualifying and/or disqualifying factors for the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential elections as enshrined in the said constitution, hence, unconstitutional, unlawful, null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that having regard to the clear provision of Section 1(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, as amended, read together with Section 4 of the same Constitution, the legislative powers vested in the defendant do not permit or empower it to make any other law prescribing additional qualifying /disqualifying grounds for election to the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential election outside the express constitutional qualification and disqualification provisions as already provided in each or all of Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), and without amendment to any of those sections is for reason of inconsistency, unconstitutional and therefore null and void.\n\n\u201cA declaration that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 disqualifying a political appointee from being a voting delegate or be voted for at a convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election is discriminatory, inconsistent with and in violent breach of the provision of each or all of Sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of

country.\n\nThe caucus, in a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said the President\u2019s delay in signing the single amendment to Section 84 (8), has thrown the nation into serious confusion and constituted a huge threat to democracy and the smooth conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, warned that any further delay in signing the amendment to the Electoral Act to give political parties a sense of direction in the conduct of primaries for the election of candidates for the 2023 general election has the capacity to derail the entire democratic process and destabilise the nation.\n\n\u201cAs representatives of the people, the Minority Caucus, urges Mr. President to avert an imminent political crisis, which has the capacity of exacerbating the security situation in the country by immediately signing the Amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 and leaving a legacy of a credible electoral process to the nation.\n\n\u201cOur caucus calls on all Nigerians, the Civil Society, the International Community and all lovers of democracy to prevail on President Buhari to immediately sign the amendment to the Electoral Act 2022 and save our nation from an avoidable crisis.\u201d\n\nMark: PDP Will Not Compromise Her Rules\n\nIn a related development, Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 National Convention Organizing Committee, Senator David Mark, has urged party faithful across the country to imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship in the conduct of the exercises, promising that the PDP would not compromise her own rules.\n\nIn a statement issued ahead of the party primaries, which began with the election of candidates for the state Houses of Assembly seats on Saturday (May 21, 2022), Mark urged party men and women to comply with the rules of the game.\n\nThe former senate president between 2007 and 2015, said, \u201cThe Party has clear guidelines and rules for the exercises. Every aspirant should be guided by the processes. The party will not compromise any of the rules.\u201d\n\nHe counseled delegates to the congresses and conventions to consider the integrity and past accomplishments of aspirants in order to make informed choices of candidates for the elections.\n\n\u201cIn making your decisions, consider the interest of the people. Politics is a conveyor belt to serve humanity. The greater interest of our people is paramount,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, therefore, cautioned against politics of acrimony, bitterness or violence, saying, \u201csee politics like a sporting competition. If you don\u2019t win today, you can win tomorrow.\u201c\n\nChuks Okocha, Alex Enumah and Udora Orizu in Abuja",
