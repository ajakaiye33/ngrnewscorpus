          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has joined the world to mourn the passage of the United States\u2019 first female Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright.\n\nIn a statement released in Abuja on Thursday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, the President condoled with the US President, Joe Biden, and the Albright family over the passage of Madeleine.\n\nBuhari equally condoled with the global diplomatic community, adding that he had pleasant memories of meeting with the international diplomat at Washington in 2015.\n\nHe described Albright as a warm and savvy woman who excelled in a turf hitherto considered the exclusive preserve of men.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cShe helped shape and steer Western foreign policy after the Cold War. She will be sorely missed.\n\nHe praised the deeds of the woman who first served as the US Ambassador to the United Nations under President Bill Clinton and later as Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cIt is to her eternal credit that she championed human rights and democracy round the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President noted that the deceased was able to raise funds for democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nHe added that Albright also co-chaired the Independent Global Commission on Justice, Security, and Governance, along with Professor Ibrahim Gambari of Nigeria, which was called the Albright-Gambari Independent Commission.\n\nThe president also recalled that the late Secretary was the convener of the Aspen Ministerial Forum of former Foreign Ministers drawn from all over the world.\n\nHe lauded the mentoring that Albright gave younger diplomats, most of who are now at the peak of their careers.\n\nHe concluded by praying that her soul would rest in peace, \u201ceven as America and the world continue to relish her services to humanity.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe PUNCH reported that Albright died on Wednesday, March 23, 2022, as a result of cancer.

          "title": "$418m Paris Club Refund: 36 states lose suit against FG, as case shifts to A-Court",
          "text": "By Ikechukwu Nnochiri\n\nThe Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Friday, dismissed a suit the 36 states of the federation filed to stop the Federal Government from deducting $418million from their bank account to settle debt in relation to the Paris Club Refund.\n\nAttorneys-General of the states had in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1313/2021, challenged FG\u2019s decision to withdraw money from state accounts to settle consultants that facilitated the Paris Club Refund.\n\nThe Plaintiffs told the court that FG had insisted that the fund it intends to withdraw from the accounts, monthly, was to service a debt for contracts that were allegedly executed for the states.\n\nThey told the court that after the said contracts were carefully scrutinized, as well as a purported judgement debt the FG relied on, it was found that the 36 states were not parties to court action that resulted to the judgment debt.\n\nThe AGs maintained that allowing such withdrawal would cripple the states financially.\n\nBesides, they submitted that the purported contracts claimed to have been executed for the states, were not known to any of the 36 state governments and was therefore a phony contract, adding that FG was the only party to the court case that led to the said judgment.\n\nAmong those cited as Defendants in the matter, were the Attorney General of the Federation, the Finance Minister, Accountant General of the Federation and all banks in Nigeria, Central Bank of Nigeria, Debt Management Office, Federation Account Allocation Committee, Incorporated Trustees of Association of Local Government of Nigeria, ALGON, as well as the consultants.\n\nHowever, the Defendants, through their lawyers, among whom included Chief Wole Olanipekun, SAN, Maimuna Lami Shiru (Acting Director, Civil Litigation, Federal Ministry of Justice), and Chief Olusola Oke, SAN, urged the court to dismiss the suit for want of competence.\n\nThey described the Defendants as meddlesome interlopers, noting that the state governments claimed to be fighting for the Local Governments, a distinct tier of government, without the consent of the third tier of government.\n\nFG, maintained that its decision to deduct the fund to settle some consultants, was based on a previous verdict of the court.\n\nIt argued that since the court had earlier decided on the matter, proceeding with the suit would amount to a high court sitting on appeal over its own judgement.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs have not appealed against the judgments of this court and the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) that the contracts awarded to the consultants are valid,\u201d Mrs Shiru submitted.\n\nFG told the court that based on an earlier judgement of court, the former Chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum, NGF, Abdulazeez Yari, issued a promissory note on behalf of the governors to the effect that the $418m be deducted from their money in the federation account.\n\nIt further argued that the decision to issue promissory notes to the consultants, as a way of settling the debt owed them, was legitimate, stressing that the Plaintiffs could not distance themselves from decision of the NGF that engaged some of the consultants.\n\nThe Defendants equally noted that four years after the earlier judgement was delivered, the states had yet to challenge it at the Court of Appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, in his judgement on Friday, Justice Inyang Ekwo, held that Attorneys-General, being employees of state governors, lacked the locus standi to institute the suit.\n\nIt stressed that the suit did not fall within the purview of section 211 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, which allows state AGs to independently file action in court without the express permission of the governor.\n\nMore so, the court, observed that both the NGF and ALGON, are duly registered bodies that could sue or be sued.\n\nIt held that both bodies have the right to file the suit and not the state AGs.\n\n\u201cThe Attorney-General cannot sue, except when authorized by the governor\u201d, Justice Ekwo added, noting that the suit exposed constitutional limit of an AG to institute certain actions.\n\n\u201cThe Plaintiffs have no legal or statutory power to challenge the case of their employer. Since the Plaintiffs do not have the locus standi, the issue of cause of action do not arise\u201d.\n\nJustice Ekwo held that that the suit amounted to an abuse of court process since it sought the review of a subsisting judgement that involved both the NGF and ALGON.\n\nHe held that there was evidence that both the NGF and ALGON had indeed entered into an agreement that led to the court judgement.\n\n\u201cThe Plaintiffs, not being members of the NGF and ALGON, are not proper persons to state what transpired or the agreement that was reached.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, I do not see any merit in the case and I accordingly dismiss it as lacking in merit\u201d, the court held.\n\nMeantime, counsel to the Plaintiffs, Mr. Jubril Okutekpa, SAN, said his clients would take the matter to the Court of Appeal.",

          "text": "By Nnamdi Ojiego\n\nAS the 2023 general elections draw closer, the contest for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP governorship ticket in Akwa Ibom State is getting stiffer with more aspirants joining the race.\n\nIn fact, it has become a battle of wits as many aspirants from different blocs in the party keep pushing their interest. Not even Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s \u2018anointing\u2019 of his Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Pastor Umo Eno, as his successor, could deter others from aspiring to the position.\n\nThose who have joined the race after the public declaration of support for Eno by the governor include the member representing Etinan/Nsit Ibom/Nsit Ubium in the House of Representatives and former Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Mr. Onofiok Luke; the Senator representing Akwa Ibom North-East Senatorial District and former Commissioner for Finance, Bassey Akpan; former Commissioner for Economic Development and Ibom Deep Seaport, Akan Okon; and Chief Executive Officer of Falcon Oil & Gas, Ani Wellington, among others.\n\nGovernor Emmanuel had on Sunday, January 30, 2022, at a meeting of PDP stakeholders held at the Government Lodge, Uyo, announced Eno as his preferred candidate for the 2023 election. The governor\u2019s decision came as a huge surprise to those who had expected him to choose between Onofiok and Akpan due to their antecedents and involvement in the politics of the state.\n\nThe choice of the Land commissioner against Onofiok did not go down well with some party stakeholders and interest groups in the state who have gone ahead to pledge their support for the former speaker.\n\nPendulum\n\nLooking at the visible PDP governorship aspirants, the pendulum may swing to Nsit Ubium Local Government Area where both Onofiok and Eno hail from. However, supporters of Onofiok said he stands a chance of grabbing the throne as he possesses the qualities needed for a governor.\n\nIt was speculated in the state that the incumbent governor would handover to Onofiok based on an unwritten agreement.\n\nStrong force\n\nA source told Vanguard that the agreement was the reason Onofiok didn\u2019t join the All Progressives Congress, APC, with his former boss, and immediate past governor of the state, Senator Godswill Akpabio. According to the source, the former students\u2019 leader was a strong force behind the success stories of the Akpabio and Udom Emmanuel administrations, especially, the electoral victory of the incumbent governor in 2019.\n\nEndorsements\n\nIn the face of alleged injustice, Onofiok \u2018s governorship aspiration has received boost from groups and civil society organizations that have endorsed him to run for the number one position in the state.\n\nAkwa Ibom Youths under the umbrella of Akwa Ibom Youths Mandate, adopted Onofiok as their 2023 preferred candidate.\n\nArising from a recent special stakeholders meeting of the organisation in Uyo, the youths stated that the lawmaker \u201cis the only aspirant that has articulated his blueprint and has clearly demonstrated capacity, experience and ability to execute the demands of the office of the governor of Akwa Ibom State.\u201d\n\nSix political groups had also endorsed Onofiok. The groups \u2013 Social Justice Movement (SJM), Democratic Alternative (DA), Akwa Ibom Students Congress (AKSC), Not Too Young To Lead Parliament (NTYLP), Political Action Initiatives (PAI), and Maintaining Peace From Justice Movement (MPJM), in a joint communiqu\u00e9, stressed that they were throwing their weight behind him because \u201che has been with the poor, the high and the mighty and still remembers that there was serious hunger in the streets of the state.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, Oniofiok almost lost his life while defending the cause of this state. It takes someone who has the love of his people to shun all approaches to sell out the House of Assembly to the then growing opposition to impeach the governor; it takes someone who is courageous, intelligent, experienced but humble to govern a state like ours\u201d, the communiqu\u00e9 stated.",

          "title": "NDDC: Group tackles newspaper over publication against Niger Delta",
          "text": "Niger Delta United Congress (NDUC) has flayed a national newspaper for what it described as a \u201cscurrilous and preposterous editorial\u201d titled \u201cNDDC Has Outlived Its Usefulness, Scrap It.\u201d\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by its President, Ebizomor Brisibe, and Secretary, Edem Archibong, it argued that \u201cIf scandals, poor resource allocation, and duplication of functions, are the paper\u2019s reasons for its suggestion to scrape the commission, why did it then not include North East Development Commission (NEDC), and other agencies set up by law, to be scrapped since they are also dogged with the above issues listed by the newspaper.\u201d\n\nREAD THE FULL STATEMENT BELOW\n\n\u201cThe unpatriotic fifth columnists and traducers of the Niger Delta region are, once again, trying to rear their ugly heads, and distract attention from the legitimate demands of the authentic stakeholders that the Board of the NDDC should be inaugurated in compliance with the law, the NDDC Act.\n\nIn a scurrilous and preposterous editorial in a national newspaper of Thursday, 24 March 2022, disingenuously titled \u201cNDDC Has Outlived Its Usefulness, Scrap It,\u201d the otherwise reputable stable claims that the Commission is \u201cdogged by scandals\u201d and that NDDC is \u201cessentially a bribe to the oil producing states.\u201d It posits that \u201cinstead of the minimum 50 percent derivation and control over the crude oil and gas resources, the state doles a meagre 13 percent as derivation and set up the agency to provide infrastructure that federating units should do by themselves.\u201d Nothing can be more outlandish and insulting to the people of the Niger Delta region.\n\nIf scandals, poor resource allocation, and duplication of functions, are the paper\u2019s reasons for its suggestion, why did it then not include North East Development Commission (NEDC) and other agencies, set up by law, to be scrapped since they are also dogged with the above issues listed by the newspaper.\n\nWhy do we have the North East Development Commission (NEDC) functioning unhindered with its substantive, legal Board and not being recommended to be scrapped despite its share of scandals? How does anyone then begin to suggest that what is not being done to the North East Development Commission (NEDC) should be done to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)?\n\nThe Buhari Administration is showing utmost disdain and disregard for the Niger Delta people and treating us so shabbily. There is increasing anger against the Federal Government and the APC in the Niger Delta region as a result of the very poor, biased, illegal and provocative actions of the Federal Government in the handling of matters concerning the NDDC and the Niger Delta region. This orchestrated red herring will therefore be adding insult to injury.\n\nWith regard to suggesting that Niger Delta states should be allocated 50 percent derivation of oil and gas resources, why did the paper not proceed in it editorial to recommend steps to actualising it, in the first instance, after which the NDDC can then be side-stepped when the region begins to receive 50 percent derivation of oil and gas resources? Why would a responsible medium recommend the scrapping of an important interventionist agency as NDDC when there is no visible or viable alternative at the moment? This newspaper\u2019s ludicrous suggestion, in the absence of an immediate and better alternative, invariably amounts to an obvious invitation to anarchy.\n\nNothing can be more irresponsible from an otherwise tested stable that readers rely on for accurate, fair, and balanced news, features, and editorials, that affect the development of our country, and in this case, a volatile Niger Delta region that is at tenterhooks following the ongoing illegality in NDDC with the two-year imposition of the interim management and sole administrator contraption that is alien to the law setting up NDDC.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt and proper guidance of gullible Niger Deltans and Nigerians we wish to state the facts, that NDDC is an Act of Parliament established by \u201cNiger-Delta Development Commission (Establishment etc) Act 2000 Act No 6 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria.\u201d Consequently, no change whatsoever can be effected to the manner of governing the Commission through an executive interference or fiat of the Federal Government, but only through a process of National Assembly amendment or repeal of the NDDC establishment Act.\n\nTo be clear, NDDC, according to its establishment Act, is a Commission owned by the people of its nine constituent states and in that regard the Act provides for a Governing Board with representatives from each of the nine constituent states. It also provides for an Advisory Committee comprising the Governors of the nine constituent states. As a result it cannot be whimsically scrapped as suggested by this ill-informed news medium. NDDC is therefore a Commission set-up by law to cater to the peculiar needs of the Niger Delta people and majorly funded by statutory allocations meant for the constituent nine (9) Niger Delta states. In its non-factual editorial, the newspaper did not recommend a better actionable alternative, clearly suggesting that the paper is working in cahoots with some elements in the government who are flying a kite to distract from the legitimate demands of Niger Deltans for the inauguration of a Board in accordance with the law.\n\nIf this newspaper was genuinely and dispassionately interested in charting workable alternatives that will be of benefit to the people of the Niger Delta, it would have carefully gone through the NDDC Enabling Act of 2000, and would have realized that the framers of the law made adequate provisions for proper corporate governance, accountability, probity, checks and balances in the administration of the Commission. The proper thing for the newspaper would have been to call out the other agencies and arms of government who have dithered in their supervisory or oversight functions, as a wake-up call.\n\nTo educate the Newspaper, sections of the NDDC Act provide for proper supervision and oversight. In Section 19 of the NDDC Act, \u201cThe Commission shall, at the end of every quarter in each year, submit to the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria report on the activities and administration of the Commission.\u201d In Section 20 (1-2) \u201cThe Board shall prepare and submit to the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, not later than 30th June in each year, a report in such form as the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces may direct on the activities of the Commission during the immediately preceding year, and shall include in the report a copy of the audited accounts of the Commission for that year and the auditor\u2019s report thereon. The President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces shall, upon receipt of the report referred to in subsection (1) of this section, cause a copy of the report and the audited accounts of the Commission and the auditor\u2019s report thereon to be submitted to each House of the National Assembly.\u201d Furthermore, in Section 21 (1-2), \u201cThere is hereby established for the Commission a Monitoring Committee which shall consist of such number of persons as the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces may deem fit to appoint from the public or civil service of the Federation. The Monitoring Commission shall- (a) monitor the management of the funds of the Commission and the implementation of the projects of the Commission and (b) have access to the books of account and other records of the Commission at all times, and submit periodical reports to the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nFrom the aforementioned, it is clearly discernible that this Newspaper is working with fifth columnists to create this unnecessary subterfuge to cause disaffection in the region at a critical time that Niger Deltans are focused on, and legitimately demanding that the Federal Government should inaugurate the substantive Board of NDDC, that is already long overdue, moreso following President Buhari\u2019s promise on June 24, 2021 when he hosted the leadership of Ijaw National Congress, to inaugurate the Board of the Commission upon receipt of the report of the Commission\u2019s forensic audit, which report he received seven months ago, since September 2, 2021.\n\nThe President said: \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d\n\nHowever, knowing how fickle the Buhari Administration has become and its increasing numerous decisions against the people of the Niger Delta region, it will not be far-fetched to conclude that some elements in the Federal Government are flying a kite with this vexatious report.\n\nThese elements in the government have become so comfortable in the latitude the federal government has given them to continue to toy with the delicate peace in the Niger Delta states. After a rigmarole of a controversial forensic audit, a convenient excuse by which President Buhari appointed Interim Managements/sole administrator contraptions for the NDDC in contravention of the NDDC Act, the promise to inaugurate a substantive/legal Board has still not been met. Rather, specious propositions are being made in the public space, creating tension in the Niger Delta states.\n\nAt a time that the tension in the entire region is at fever pitch, when all stakeholders, men, women, youths, traditional institutions, civil society organisations, professional groups, elders, and governors, are already genuinely provoked at the ongoing delay in the inauguration of the NDDC Board, Niger Deltans will definitely not accept any ploy by whatever means to complicate matters at the NDDC and plunge the region into avoidable crisis.\u201d",
          "summary": "How does anyone then begin to suggest that what is not being done to the North East Development Commission (NEDC) should be done to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)?\nThe Buhari Administration is showing utmost disdain and disregard for the Niger Delta people and treating us so shabbily.\nNDDC is therefore a Commission set-up by law to cater to the peculiar needs of the Niger Delta people and majorly funded by statutory allocations meant for the constituent nine (9) Niger Delta states.\nTo educate the Newspaper, sections of the NDDC Act provide for proper supervision and oversight.\nRather, specious propositions are being made in the public space, creating tension in the Niger Delta states.",

          "title": "Senate investigates how DPR illegally awarded OML 46 to Halkin Oil, despite Buhari\u2019s order",
          "text": "The Nigerian Senate is investigating how OML 46 was illegally awarded to Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited, by the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), in contravention of the Presidential directive.\n\nThe Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions, while interfacing with the groups involved at a public hearing on Tuesday, 22nd March 2022, was informed that, after the revocation of the oil field, the presidency intervened, considered the numerous petitions from the various marginal owners and directed that the fields be rewarded on a discretionary basis with preference to the previous owners, including the Atala Oil Field.\n\nThe public hearing followed a petition brought before the Senate dated the 5th October 2021, by Sir Daniel Chukwudozie, on behalf of Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited (HONL), against the DPR, for alleged breach of trust, corruption and illegal revocation of OML 46 and re-awarding same to Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited, in breach of due process.\n\nDuring the public hearing which was the third in the series, the representative of Hardy Oil, Ike Onwuchuluba, adopted its presentation dated 24th September 2021, in addition to the annexed documents that the company submitted to the Committee.\n\nHe submitted that the subject matter of the petition bothered on the OML46 \u2013 Atala Marginal Oil Field and the improper way and manner the field that was formerly managed by the trio of Bayelsa Oil Company Limited (BOCL), Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited and Century Exploration and Production (CEPL) was revoked and handed over to a company in a very shady and fraudulent circumstances, ipso facto, that Halkin Exploration and Production Limited invested $60,000,000 in the Atala Marginal Field and executed a Farm-In Agreement with BOCL.\n\nDebunking the allegation that there was an investment of $60 million and acquisition of 41 percent shares of BOCL by Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited, Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited said: \u201cThe allocation of the field to Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited was done and secured under fraudulent misrepresentation made by Halkin.\n\nOnwuchuluba also told the Senate that the award, which was predicated on two reasons by the defunct DPR was false, adding that, Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited was an unknown entity to the former Atala Marginal Field owners.\n\n\u201cThey did not invest any $60m in the field, did not execute any Farm-in Agreement with BOCL and that Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited secured OML 46 under false pretence, misrepresentation\u201d, he added.\n\nHe also informed the Committee that the man who presented himself as the Managing Director (MD) of Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited was the immediate past MD of Bayelsa Oil Company Limited as at the time the field was given to Halkin and stands conflicted by holding such dual positions.\n\n\u201cWhich means that he was on one leg the MD of BOCL and on another leg the MD of Hakin. So it is not impossible that he may have used his position as the MD of BOCL to alter documents to the benefit of Halkin. And that the failure of DPR to verify the claims of Halkin from the Atala JV Partners was in breach of the principle of a fair hearing\u201d, he submitted.\n\nWhile emphasizing that the re-awarding of OML46 was under false pretence and to an unknown entity, Ike Onwuchuluba called the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Atala Marginal Field was developed between 2014 to 2018 by the trio of BOCL, Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited and Century Exploration and Production Ltd whereas Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited which claimed to have invested $60m in the Atala Marginal Oil Field, was incorporated sometime on the 29th September 2019, long after the field has been developed by the parties.\n\nHe further reminded the Committee that, as the original owner of the Oil field, the trio of BOCL, Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited and Century Exploration and Production Ltd has been producing and paying royalties to the account of the federal government of Nigeria and that as at the time the field was purportedly revoked, the JV-partners have an outstanding 20,700 barrels of crude on the site.\n\nHe, therefore, requested that the Senate should look into the matter and urge the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) to immediately reinstate Atala Marginal Oil Field OML 46 to the joint venture that owns the Oil field.\n\nIn its submissions in support, the Managing Director of Bayelsa Oil Company Limited, Mr. Bello Akpoku stated that:-\n\n\u201cWe have availed the Committee with the Memo written to the Honorable Minister of Petroleum Resources, whereby the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) stated that the field was allocated to Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited for two principal reasons namely; that Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited claimed to have invested $60m to the Atala Marginal Oil Field and second was the alleged acquisition of 41% share of Bayelsa Oil Company Limited shares in the Atala Marginal Oil Field\u201d.\n\nHe maintained that \u201cBOCL owned 51% in the Atala Marginal Field and Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited claim to have acquired 41% of the 51% share thereby making it the largest partner owner of the field is false\u201d.\n\nWhen he was called to react to the allegations made against him and his company, the MD of Halkin Exploration and Production Company Limited, Mr. Charles Dorgu, who could not put up a defence, claimed to be sick and urged the Committee to give him two weeks extension to come up with his defence to the weighty allegations.\n\nThe visibly infuriated Senate Committee, on its part, called on the Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) to interface with the groups involved and look into the matter critically and report back to them in two weeks.\n\nThe lawmakers also frowned at the refusal of Mr. Dorgu to honour their invitations for two consecutive times previously and how he made some fruitless efforts to stop the Committee from hearing the petition by resorting to litigation against the National Assembly.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, Senator Ayo Akinyelure, thereafter directed the MD of Halkin to provide documented evidence of how the shares were acquired and evidence of the $60million investment, if actually such were made in its submissions to NUPRC.",

          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has warned that any political party that picks any member of the Redeemed Church of Christ Group (RCCG) will kiss the Aso Rock goodbye.\n\nThe group gave the warning in a statement signed by Idrees Safiyanu Gambo, Chairman, Bauchi State Chapter, Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC)\n\nRecall that the RCCG had a few weeks ago created a directorate for politics and governance across the country.\n\nThe church said the move is to mobilize support for members who are aspiring to occupy political offices.\n\nVice President, Yemi Osinbajo though yet to declare his intention to run for president is a pastor in RCCG.\n\nThere are indications that he may soon declare his intention.\n\nBut MURIC said it is challenging the Redeemed Church of Christ Group (RCCG) for having the effrontery to launch a national political structure.\n\nAccording to the group, RCCG plans to eliminate other religions or turn their faithful into political slaves, adding that any Muslim who queues behind a redeemer is now considered a traitor to the cause of Islam.\n\n\u201dThe rest of us have no option but to challenge this existential threat.\n\n\u201dWe must work towards our survival before the RCCG tsunami threat sweeps Islam and other Christian denominations out of existence.\n\n\u201cThe ugly experience of our Muslim brothers in Yorubaland where they are persecuted politically and marginalised economically despite their superior numerical strength is enough for us to know what is likely to happen if members of the RCCG take over the reins of power either in Aso Rock or in any state in the manner they are going about it at the moment. We in the North have been watching this ugly development with keen interest.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is unimaginable to expect the emergence of RCCG candidates as winners in the Northern States and we will ensure that this does not happen now or any time in the future. We are not unaware of the \u2018winner-takes-all\u2019 mentality of the RCCG but Northern Muslims will never expose their land to such obnoxious cultural invasion, as what we want is a society where everyone is treated equally.\n\n\u201cThe RCCG declaration of a directorate of political affairs was met with great annoyance by us in the North and it has destroyed any goodwill Christian politicians enjoy here in the North. It is so bad that any Muslim who queues behind a redeemer is now considered a traitor to the cause of Islam and this is not what we want at this critical point in our nation. \u201d\n\nMURIC further warned Idrees Safiyanu Gambo also warned Islamic organizations and Muslim communities against hobnobbing with any RCCG candidate, whether presidential or gubernatorial.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough MURIC will not support any political party against another during the coming general election, we warn Islamic organizations and Muslim communities against hobnobbing with any RCCG candidate, whether presidential or gubernatorial.\n\n\u201cWhile our interest lies in credible candidates who are most likely to benefit their states or the country as a whole we frown upon attempts by the RCCG to turn the whole country into Redeemers territory. It had better not be. The RCCG plot is dangerous, provocative and contemptuous. Our warning to all political parties is: pick redeemer candidate, kiss Aso Rock goodbye.\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The Supreme Court has affirmed the decision by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to de-register 22 political parties.\n\nIn a judgment on Friday, the apex court upturned an earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal in Abuja, which voided the de-registration on the grounds that INEC failed to accord the parties fair hearing and that the electoral body acted during the pendency of a suit by the parties.\n\nThe 22 parties are among the 74 de-registered in 2020 by INEC following their dismal performances in previous elections.\n\nJustice Ejembi Eko, in the lead judgment of the Supreme Court on Friday, held that the Court of Appeal was wrong to have, on its own, raised the issue of lack of fair hearing, without hearing from parties in the case, and reached a conclusion that the 22 were not accorded fair hearing.\n\nJustice Eko noted that the Court of Appeal took out the issue of fair hearing out of the contemplation of the notice of appeal filed by the political parties, but refused to do the needful in order to be fair to others in the case.\n\nHe added that the Court of Appeal erred by, raising the issue of fair hearing in favour of the political parties on its own, but failed to give opportunity to other respondents in the case to address it on the matter in order to arrive at a just conclusion.\n\nJustice Eko also added that proceeding to give judgment in such a situation, as done by the Court of Appeal, offended the principle of fair hearing, and as a result, its findings and conclusion were flawed.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not the basic functions of any court to raise a fundamental issue suo motu (without the prompting of parties) and come to a conclusion without being addressed by parties in the matter.\n\n\u201cSuch action runs foul of the pillar of the fair hearing itself.\n\n\u201cThis appeal by INEC is meritorious and it is hereby allowed. The decision of the court below is set aside,\u201d Justice Eko said.\n\nOther members of the panel that heard the appeal agreed with the lead judgment.\n\nINEC had on February 6, 2020 de-registered 74 political parties for failing to win any political office in the last general election.\u201d\n\nThe Advanced Congress of Democrats (ACD) and 21 other parties sued at the Federal High Court in Abuja to challenge their de-registration by INEC.\n\nIn a judgment on June 11, 2020, the Federal High Court dismissed the suit on the grounds that INEC was empowered to de-register parties that failed to win elections.\n\nThe court held that Section 225(a), (b) and (c) of the Constitution could be construed disjointively to imply that INEC possesses the power to de-register parties.\n\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal, Abuja, the appellate court, in its judgment in August 2020 said although INEC possesses the powers to de-register parties, it was wrong in the case of the 22 including the ACD, that were already in court to challenged their planned de-registration before INEC announced the de-registration.\n\nINEC then appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which judgment the the Supreme Court upturned on Friday in its judgment in the appeal marked: SC/485/2020 filed by INEC.",

I am ready for a public debate with any other aspirant on job creation with specifics on timelines for implementation.\n\n\u201cI do not know everything. I am not one of those who know it all.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nTwenty-four hours to the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), its caucus in the National Assembly has resolved to work towards the emergence of consensus candidates.\n\nObservers believe the development is a boost for the aspiration of former Nasarawa governor, Senator Abdullah Adamu, as President Muhammadu Buhari, had reortedly endorsed him for the exalted position at a meeting with governors elected on the platform of the party recently. Described as a detribalised Nigerian, if elected national chairman, his backers said he would stabilise, unify and reposition the party for electoral victories.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nBuhari met with the governors and the party national chairmanship aspirants on Wednesday, to reiterate the need to go into the convention with a united front.\n\nBriefing State House Correspondents after the meeting, yesterday, Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, explained that the president emphasised the need for party members to be united. Asked if the party had arrived at a consensus for the position of the chairman and what would happen to those who bought forms, Lawan said they were not in the position to answer. \u201cWell, I think that question shouldn\u2019t be put to us because we\u2019re not the party. But because you asked and we are in your territory, we\u2019ll make some effort to say something to it. The essence of this engagements is for the party to achieve consensus, and consensus is a process. It doesn\u2019t just happen like that. So, I believe that before we go into the convention square on Saturday, by the grace of God, we would have a lot of consensus reached and may be the sort of document that we call or refer to as unity list, that is bringing all the agreed positions where consensus have been achieved in the various sections or geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamila described the meeting as productive. \u201cAs many of you are aware, the president, in the last couple of days, has been having meetings with stakeholders towards the convention. The whole idea is to encourage all stakeholders to unite, have a common front, and a peaceful, rancour-free and successful convention.\u201d\n\nSome of the principal officers in the delegation inluded Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, Senator Abdullahi Yahaya, Senate Leader, Ajayi Boroffice Deputy Senate Leader, Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, Deputy Chief Whip, Sabi Abdullahi, Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, Alhassan Ado Dogowa \u2013 Majority Leader, Mohammed Tahir Monguno- Chief Whip and Nkeiruka Onyejeocha Deputy Chief Whip.\n\nPresident Buhari urged leaders and members of the party to channel their energies into improving fortunes of the party in the forthcoming elections, and avoid squabbling that can easily distract and create disharmony.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nAccording to a statement by Mr. Femi Adesina, Buhari, the president reminded members of the proximity of the election dates set by INEC and admonished that positions should be harmonised with a bigger picture of winning elections and providing good governance.\n\nPresident Buhari told the lawmakers that a zoning template was produced and adopted by the party after wide consultations in order to ensure that the leadership was reflective of the diversity in unity while representing various dynamic interests.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u2022Regional stakeholders\u2019 micro-zoning\n\nSimilarly, President Buhari received applause for respecting the micro-zoning arrangement.\n\nAccording to a prsidency source: \u201cThe issue of Mr. President trying to impose persons against the wish of party leaders, especially governors, does not arise. It is a pure blackmail by those who have lost out. The man has been transparent enough to tell stakeholders his desire for the party to have its chairman and the governors themselves wanted to know if he had a preferred choice which he told them at the meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt is true he had agreed to a unity list having taken into consideration the fact that the slots had been bundled into the geopolitical zones. It was on the basis of that he initially signed one off. But it became obvious that though slots had been bundled into geopolitical zones, there were states in those zones. So, after a careful consideration of the reports from those zones, the president had no choice than to respect the views and opinions of the regional stakeholders.\n\n\u201cIn essence, even where he preferred certain persons, he could not force them on the people if the positions they are seeking are not zoned to their states. For instance, he wanted his long time ally and friend, Farouk as deputy national chairman (North). But he could not make it because he is from North West while the position was zoned to North East. That is why you can see Muhammed Kyari as the new person. In the same vein, he would have loved Ife Oyedele as secretary but the slot does not belong to Ondo, it goes to the Oyo/Osun axis, according to the briefing he got from the governors. So, do you now expect the president to force persons on the people? It is not possible.\u201d\n\n\u2022Nkire lauds Buhari on consensus\n\nParty chieftain from Abia State, Chief Sam Nkire also commended President Buhari for advising members of the party to adopt consensus as the best way of choosing their leaders at the National Convention.\n\n\u201cThe consensus arrangement which is a provision in the APC constitution, would eliminate the incidence of quarreling and fighting at the convention venue, having agreed on a unity list right from the zones\u2019.",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nAccording to him, 1,486 people have been directly employed for the Second Niger Bridge while another 8,110 indirect jobs have been created.\n\nHe puts the cost of three major PIDF projects at N1.3 trillion. The projects are Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway (375km): N797 billion, Second Niger Bridge (11.59km): N206 billion and Lagos-Ibadan Expressway (127km): N310 billion.\n\nOn when the projects will be completed, Fashola said that Lagos Ibadan Express Way and Second Niger Bridge are on course to be completed this year 2022, while the main Carriageway of Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano expressway is scheduled for completion by Q2 2023, adding that ancillary works will be completed later.\n\nThe minister warned motorists to shelve the temptation to exceed 100km/h on completed roads, to avoid crashes. He said the warning became necessary when he got messages from some of the road users commending the quality of work done, who said they were doing 150 100km/h due to the smoothness of the roads.\n\nHe also decried the sale of Premium Motor Spirit and other petroleum products on the roads, saying they deteriorate the roads faster.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nFashola also said the Mondays sit-at-home order issued by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB), is also impacting on the delivery of the Anambra end of the Second Niger Bridge.\n\nHe also said power outage for between seven to 10 days will happen on the Anambra side of the bridge to enable them reinstall transmission lines.\n\n\u201cOn the Second Niger Bridge, we are going to shut down power supply from one of the power plants for maintenance, but that will provide us the opportunity to quickly replace all the transmission lines because we have built and raised the level which is now dangerously close to the Transmission Line so they have to reinstall them. So power outage will happen I think for a week to 10 days, we\u2019re working with our partners in the ministry of power and also the Gencos to have this done. Again, these are challenges.\u201d\n\nOn whether the Second Niger Bridge is a PPP arrangement, Fashola said, not yet.\n\nIt\u2019s government money so far. NSIA is talking to some investors who want to bring money, they have not brought it. Invariably they will, or we expect that it will and invariably, we tend to then concession the assets for better management. But that is further down the line.\u201d\n\nOn allegations that the second Niger Bridge was fully funded by the administration, the minister said: \u201cCertainly not. It wasn\u2019t fully funded by the previous administration. The answer to this lies in anybody just going to the 2015 budget. Go to the 2016 budget. Go to the 2017 budget. These are matters of public record. You will also see my statements where I was complaining that the only funding those budget were usually N2 billion, N5 billion and sometimes they will slash it. But part of the work has started, something tiny was being done for nothing near where the PIDF came in. It was when the PIDF came in, that JB now mobilise all of it resources, bring in dredgers order piles. So at that time, we will pile one and go. If you go back in the records, you will see that my first visit to this site, they had stopped work. Some of you covered me then in 2016, we received in their yard and no work was going on because there was no money.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Your days are numbered, minister tells saboteurs\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday deployed the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor to assess the level of oil theft in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe development followed public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had hobbled the country\u2019s ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had on Monday lamented the unprecedented rate of oil theft recorded in recent times and its debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comment came a day after THISDAY reported similar concerns expressed by the Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru, who called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nHe revealed that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen.\n\nAvuru spoke a few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal.\n\nEarlier, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, had threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, perennial sabotage and outright theft.\n\nHowever, at the group\u2019s first ports of call in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, Delta and Bayelsa states yesterday, Sylva who described the perpetrators as criminals, said the deployment of top stakeholders by Buhari was to underscore the importance of the situation.\n\n\u201cWe have come because of the activities of these criminals. The government and the country can no longer afford these activities and that\u2019s why we are here. I don\u2019t want to say much, but we are going now, the CDS, myself and the operating companies and the GMD, we are going to overfly and see for ourselves what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cAnd then I can assure you that within the next few days, operations will start in earnest and we are very sure that we are going to be victorious in a few months.\n\n\u201cThe problem of security has come to the attention of the president and Mr. President has directed myself and the CDS and the GMD to ensure that this problem is handled once and for all,\u201d the minister said.\n\nAccording to Sylva, there are three elements to the solution to the extant problem, including the communities, as in his words, \u201cthese people involved in the illegal activities are not ghosts.\u201d\n\nSylva argued that since the perpetrators are from communities, the host communities need to be involved in finding a lasting solution to the menace.\n\n\u201cThe security too must be involved because you are the law enforcement arm of government and of course we also as part of government we must be involved and then the third arm, are the operating companies.\n\n\u201cAll the elements are complete now. We are here as government, the operating companies are here and of course we are going to the communities. So, I believe that finally, this problem will be resolved.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to stop it because we can ill afford the continuation of the insecurity in the oil industry. So I want to let everybody know that these criminals have their days numbered.\n\n\u201cWe are here to ensure that this problem is finally resolved and to reclaim this industry for the country because this country has lost so much from the activities of these criminals and the government and country can no longer afford these activities and that\u2019s why we are here,\u201d he maintained.\n\nIn his comments, Kyari stated that the government had concluded plans to move against oil bunkering, pipeline vandalism and illegal activities threatening the country\u2019s oil sector.\n\nKyari noted that the government would leave no stone unturned to arrest the increasing spate of oil theft and destruction of the environment which had cost the country foreign exchange earnings.\n\nThe team which visited various sites where illegal oil refineries were being carried out, he said, was on a mission to ensure that illegal oil refining and theft of crude oil was halted.\n\nAt Ibaa which is in Emeoha Local Government of the state, Kyari and the team ordered the destruction of several illegal sites.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at Ibaa, Kyari said the country could no longer afford to see her oil illegally exploited and stolen. He pointed out that the strategy being adopted would finally arrest the situation.\n\nHe commended the security team in the effort to stop denying the country the much needed resources for economic development.\n\nThe NNPC GMD warned that stakeholders are not being left out in the quest to find a lasting solution, adding that the Navy were also on top of the situation, assuring that the task of destroying illegal oil refinery will not stop until the problem is resolved.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nkateko Muyimane and six fellow African students hid in a subway while Russian shells pounded Kharkiv, before fleeing on a train to Budapest they very nearly failed to board.\n\nNow their main concern is how to salvage the degrees they sacrificed so much to start, Reuters reports.\n\nSouth African Muyimane, 24, and classmate Mandisa Malindisa, 25, were both studying medicine with a year to go before graduating. Now, they say, there is no university left.\n\nIt's been bombed out and turned to rubble,\" Muyimane said at his brother's apartment in a northern Johannesburg suburb. \"Even if we do continue online, medicine is practical: you need to be physically there with the patient.\"\n\nThey are among tens of thousands of African students whose studies were upended by Russia's war on its neighbour, many of whom were drawn to Ukraine's world-class educational facilities available at a fraction of the cost of Western universities.\n\nUkraine's history of attracting Africans to its academies dates back to the Cold War, when Soviet states wooed students from newly independent African nations with the promise of subsidised education.\n\nLike many parents, Malindisa's mother, a nurse, and father, a civil engineer, tightened their belts, saved and borrowed to put her through Ukraine's Kharkiv National Medical University.\n\n\"It was a big sacrifice for the school fees, and the apartment she was renting,\" her mother Zandile told Reuters.\n\nMalindisa's anxiety about losing her qualification, after all, her parents had invested, had kept her in Ukraine, but as war approached, she decided to fly out rather than risk staying.\n\nHer mother booked her three tickets; all got cancelled. She, Muyimane and the five other African classmates endured days of bombardments before fleeing to Pivdennyi Vokzal station. There, they said, they had to fight to get on a train including against a passenger who bit one of them to try to prevent her boarding.\n\nCompared with that horror, finding her a new school seems less daunting.\n\n\"I haven't lost hope,\" Zandile said. \"Something will come up for her.\"\n\nMalindisa worries that she has no certificate to show prospective universities what she has accomplished - getting her transcripts from what is now a war zone isn't going to be easy.\n\nHer fears are shared by many students who returned from Ukraine in recent weeks.\n\nMuyimane's mother is a doctor, and she was proud to have a son follow in her footsteps, he said, adding: \"I must make a plan: medicine is my dream\".\n\nAt her house in Ghana's capital on March 5, 23-year-old medical student Maame Akousa Addo stood over two small duffel bags containing the few things she'd managed to bring back with her to Accra and wondered whether she would be able to go back after the war.\n\n\"We're just waiting to hear from our schools,\" she said. \"To see if they will establish a sort of online option.\"\n\nFor Nigerian student Joshua Adebowale, 32, the hope is that things will calm down soon so he can return to Kyiv Medical University, which his parents and brothers were paying for. \"Otherwise these will be wasted years and money,\" he said.\n\nBut for compatriot Jasper Ahamefula, 19, who had just started a business studies course, a degree no longer seems an option. He plans to try and start up a business -- tailoring perhaps -- without a qualification.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" he said. \"My parents, yes it's a lost investment, but they care that I'm alive. That's great, I guess.\"",

          "text": "A federal high court in Abuja has dismissed a suit seeking to restrain President Muhammadu Buhari and others from effecting the planned deduction of $418 million from states\u2019 funds to settle the Paris Club Fund debt.\n\nInyang Ekwo, the judge, while delivering judgment on Friday, held that the plaintiffs who are the attorneys-general lacked the locus standi to institute the suit.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1313/202 sought to restrain the president and others from effecting the planned deduction of $418 million from states\u2019 funds to settle the debt owed consultants engaged by states and LGs.\n\nThe controversial payment of $418 million to consultants over the Paris Club refund had become a contentious issue between the three tiers of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsultants had claimed the amount as a percentage for the payment of services rendered to the states and local government councils.\n\nThe federal government maintained that its decision to deduct the fund to settle some consultants was based on a previous verdict of the court. It argued that since the court had earlier decided on the matter, proceeding with the suit would amount to a high court sitting on appeal over its own judgment.\n\nThe court, had on November 5, restrained the federal government from deducting $418 million from states\u2019 accounts to pay the disputed debt.\n\nBut delivering judgment, Ekwo held that the state attorneys-general lack the legal standing to institute the lawsuit with the consent of their respective governors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was no express evidence to show that the state governors consented to the file of the suit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe office of the attorney-general of a state was created under Section 195 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\n\u201cThe AG of a state is appointed by a governor, which makes the AG an appointee, who is under the control of a governor.\n\n\u201cFrom the court\u2019s findings, the plaintiff has no locus standi to file the suit, therefore there was no cause of action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe state attorneys-general cannot on their own bring this suit given the provisions of Section 211 of the 199 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThis suit does not fall within the class of suits that can be initiated by the state attorneys-general without the consent of the governors.\u201d\n\nThe judge dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the contract was not entered by the states because the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) are not constitutionally recognised bodies.\n\nEkwo said both the NGF and ALGON are duly registered bodies that could sue or be sued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge also held that the suit amounts to an abuse of court process.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, I do not see any merit in the case and I accordingly dismiss it as lacking in merit,\u201d the court held.",

It argued that since the court had earlier decided on the matter, proceeding with the suit would amount to a high court sitting on appeal over its own judgment.\n\nThe court, had on November 5, restrained the federal government from deducting $418 million from states\u2019 accounts to pay the disputed debt.\n\nBut delivering judgment, Ekwo held that the state attorneys-general lack the legal standing to institute the lawsuit with the consent of their respective governors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was no express evidence to show that the state governors consented to the file of the suit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe office of the attorney-general of a state was created under Section 195 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\n\u201cThe AG of a state is appointed by a governor, which makes the AG an appointee, who is under the control of a governor.\n\n\u201cFrom the court\u2019s findings, the plaintiff has no locus standi to file the suit, therefore there was no cause of action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe state attorneys-general cannot on their own bring this suit given the provisions of Section 211 of the 199 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThis suit does not fall within the class of suits that can be initiated by the state attorneys-general without the consent of the governors.\u201d\n\nThe judge dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the contract was not entered by the states because the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) are not constitutionally recognised bodies.\n\nEkwo said both the NGF and ALGON are duly registered bodies that could sue or be sued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe judge also held that the suit amounts to an abuse of court process.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, I do not see any merit in the case and I accordingly dismiss it as lacking in merit,\u201d the court held.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) says the country lost about $3.27 billion worth of crude oil to theft between January 2021 and February 2022.\n\nThe commission disclosed this during a presentation on crude oil theft at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement with the Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS) and the Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nOPTS is the umbrella body of major international and indigenous operating oil companies, while IPPG is an association of indigenous exploration and production (E&P) companies.\n\nThe NUPRC had said the country loses more than 115,000 barrels per day to oil theft and vandalism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Tuesday, the commission announced it had set up a panel to audit activities of operators in the upstream sector to ascertain the actual volume of oil lost to theft.\n\nOn the trend in oil theft, the NUPRC said: \u201cTotal value loss for the period January 2021 to February 2022 is about $3.27 billion\u201d.\n\n\u201cAverage monthly value loss for the period is about $233.99 million. Average daily value loss for the period is about $7.72 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLosses are mainly from Bonny Terminal Network, Forcados Terminal Network (and) Brass Terminal Network.\u201d\n\nThe commission delineated factors that aided crude oil theft to include inadequate security, poor community engagement, economic challenges, poor surveillance, stakeholder compromises, and exposed facilities.\n\nIt said spillages and leakages were caused by activities of saboteurs affecting the source of livelihood of the community members and leading to environmental degradation.\n\nIt, however, noted that efforts are ongoing to mitigate crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism, as a work team comprising the regulator and operators was set up in August 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe work team was set up to deliberate on workable solutions to mitigate crude oil losses, identify various responsible parties along the crude oil loss value chain and propose improvement areas for effective surveillance,\u201d the NUPRC said.\n\nOn the impact of the illegal activities, the NUPRC said government revenue was adversely affected.\n\nAlso, it said there had been a loss of value stemming from soaring costs owing to frequent repairs of damaged facilities.\n\nGbenga Komolafe, chief executive officer, NUPRC, said: \u201cThe meeting was convened to get the opinion of stakeholders, especially the investors, which include the OPTS and IPPG. It is the concern of the government that we increase our oil production.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause when the upstream is sick, it affects the well-being and health of the country. The situation is happening upstream and is a threat to the existence and wellbeing of the economy.\n\n\u201cSo we are very concerned about this, and we\u2019ve been doing a lot and will ensure that we do everything possible to increase oil production in a manner that will make the nation benefit from the upward movement in the international prices of crude.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, the federal government said it had collaborated with security agencies, operators, and relevant stakeholders, to clamp down on the activities of oil thieves.",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a 9-5er with great colleagues who own cars, you are probably already familiar with the concept of hitching a ride. Let\u2019s say your office is in Ikeja, you live in Surulere, and your colleague who also lives in Surulere has a car. So, you tend to get a ride with them, sometimes paying for fuel, saving you quite a bit of money that you\u2019d have spent on transport.\n\nBut what if you could hitch a ride with a stranger going in the same direction? Doesn\u2019t sound too safe, right? Especially if you\u2019ve been following the recent news on social media about insecurity on some ride-hailing and even government-owned transport systems.\n\nWell, Laolu Onifade thinks he might have found a sweet spot with his newly launched ride-sharing startup, Hytch.\n\nBut what does Hytch do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaolu Onifade, Hytch Founder\n\nAccording to Onifade, Hytch connects car owners and passengers going in the same direction. Using our earlier example, say you\u2019re trying to get to Berger from Surulere, all you have to do is launch the app, find drivers within a 2-3km radius going in that direction and, voila, you\u2019ve \u201chytched\u201d a ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar to the defunct GoMyWay, the ride is shared with three other riders going in the same direction, making the fare cheaper\n\nModelled after popular ride-hailing companies like Bolt and Uber, Hytch doesn\u2019t own any of the cars on the platform and only onboards drivers, with certain safety restrictions \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into later \u2014 built in to prevent mishaps.\n\nHytch takes a 15% commission off every ride and operates a cashless payment method. All users \u2014 drivers and passengers \u2014 have a wallet, so passengers are automatically debited the amount for the trip when it ends.\n\nThe idea for Hytch was birthed between 2019 and 2020, following Onifade\u2019s frustrations with ride-hailing platforms.\n\n\u201cI have encountered this problem myself moving around and with Uber being so expensive; I\u2019ve had this problem with Uber since 2019/2020. I noticed that Uber and Bolt were getting so expensive and I used to wonder, how about I just hitch a ride?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be in someone\u2019s car? Sometimes when I\u2019m in an Uber that\u2019s costing me say \u20a65,000, I don\u2019t mind sharing the ride with three other people in the back seat going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nRoping in his friends, Femi Omoniyi (CTO), Olawale Adeyeye (Chief Imagineer), and Kemdirim Akujobi (Product and Design Lead), they began building Hytch in 2021.\n\nAfter several months of beta testing, which saw them onboard 200 people, Hytch comes out of stealth mode today, with the app available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsuring user safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week Friday, March 18, 2022, this tweet by twitterer, @_kimaura set Nigeria\u2019s Twitter streets ablaze.\n\nso guys, i got robbed on wednesday night at ikoyi by my bolt driver, he took my phone, my cards, my ID, all my money and savings, lemme tell you how it happened. I ordered a bolt ride going to lekki, after i got into the ride which was a heavily tinted car and we started \u2026 \u2014 KIMBORO\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf51 (@_kimaura) March 18, 2022\n\n@_kimaura described being robbed by the Bolt driver who took her phone, debit cards, and IDs, among other things. Barely a month after the tragic death of Oluwabamise Ayanwole on a BRT in Lagos, it was enough to cause an uproar, with many people narrating various incidents.\n\nAnother Twitter user, @ade_IDD, narrated how she was almost kidnapped by a Bolt driver whose appearance was different from the picture on the platform. He told her that he was using his brother\u2019s account because his had been blocked.\n\nSo @Boltapp_ng i have strength today. I ordered a ride from school to my house yesterday Friday 18th of march and i got a driver. He came and i confirmed car type and number plate and i put my stuff in the car and he started the ride. \u2014 AdaUgo.\ud83e\udd84\u2728Busiswadede. \ud83e\udd75 (@ade_IDD) March 19, 2022\n\nThankfully, she got to safety, before anything untoward happened.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, another user, @shugadupri reported encountering the same driver.\n\n[Image: Screenshot of the tweet]\n\nInterestingly, while Bolt\u2019s support team acknowledged some complaints on Twitter, it is yet to release an official statement on the matter.\n\nTechpoint Africa asked Onifade how Hytch hopes to ensure user safety.\n\nOnifade explained that user safety is provided for both drivers and riders.\n\n\u201cFor drivers, we verify driver\u2019s licence. For riders, you have to take a picture at the moment. So that means, the same picture you take at the time that you are signing up is what the driver is going to use to recognise you. So you have to make sure you\u2019re taking an actual picture or else the driver is not going to pick you up.\n\n\u201cYou also have to put in your legal first and last name while signing up.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that it is an actual picture, Hytch has partnered with Nigerian digital compliance and security company, IdentityPass, plugging in an API that determines whether it is a human face.\n\nFor added security, the driver and rider are sent a pin which both users must confirm on the app before a trip commences. This could also prevent issues of drivers starting trips before arriving.\n\nLike other ride-hailing/ride-sharing companies, Hytch provides a panic button that enables users to alert family and friends when they are in danger.\n\nWhere a rider receives a streak of three bad ratings, they are automatically blocked from using the app, although they can be reinstated. The driver would have to reach out to get the account unblocked after an investigation is carried out.\n\nOnifade said there are currently plans to include National Identification Number (NIN) verification as a security measure; however, he agrees this could be limiting for users with no NIN.\n\nThere\u2019s still much for the startup to do with plans to eventually include interstate travel and as Onifade laughingly told Techpoint Africa, the ability to book a seat on a private jet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuidax, Africa founded cryptocurrency exchange, unveiled its brand ambassador on Tuesday, March 22, 2022.\n\nAfter giving his opening remarks, Buchi Okoro, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder, Quidax, briefly talked about the brand, what they do, and what they have achieved over the years.\n\nHe said that Quidax makes it easy for users to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.\u201d There is a lot of exclusion that happens because we are Nigerians, Africans.\u201d Crypto is the solution. Quidax was built to solve issues affecting accessing funds and transferring them easily for Africans.\n\nQuidax On CoinMarketcap\n\nOver the years, Quidax has grown to be one of the largest crypto exchanges in Africa and the first African exchange listed on CoinMarketCap. By May 2021 they had processed over 3.2 billion dollars in transactions in less than three years and were awarded Business Day\u2019s 2021 digital assets company of the year.\n\nNew Year, New Quidax\n\nBuchi mentioned that improvements are constantly made to their platform through customer feedback, with the new price alert feature on the platform being a notable example. Quidax has also found a way to engage users to learn crypto on its platform and recently launched Quidax academy to train crypto beginners.\n\nAnswering how secure the platform is, Buchi said they have a custody solution that includes fund insurance; every fund in Quidax is insured. Also, there is a 13-man team constantly working on securing the platform from attacks and a three-factor authentification (3FA) feature that helps to confirm the user\u2019s identity.\n\nQuidax and Don Jazzy\n\nBuchi said that they started the #TheQuidaxCall recently, aiming to help put crypto in front of more people. \u201cThe point is to help preach the gospel of crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nBuchi introduced Michael Collins Ajereh, professionally known as Don Jazzy as a new member and brand ambassador of the Quidax family.\n\nWhen asked why crypto and why he feels it is important, Don Jazzy said he tries his best to stay ahead of the curve and know what is next to avoid being left behind in a fast-moving world. He added that he wants to get more people into crypto as he believes it is the future.\n\nDon Jazzy, who started his crypto journey during the Covid19 pandemic in 2020, said he finds crypto relatively easy to use and transfer money to various world parts.\n\nDon Jazzy also expressed his opinions on Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their many use cases. He sees NFTs becoming a thing in the music industry, and he highlighted the other use cases like property ownership in the metaverse.\n\nBuchi said their choice in selecting Don Jazzy was because he is very easy to relate to and approach, and he is genuinely interested in crypto.\n\nCalling it a match made in heaven, Buchi said, \u201cAt Quidax, we believe that learning crypto should actually be fun. Learning crypto should be something you can relate to, and Don Jazzy exemplifies and shows what it means to be a Quidaxian.\n\nAlso in attendance at the unveiling event were Uzo Awili, Quidax Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and CO-Founder, Morris Ebieroma, Quidax\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and CO-Founder, members of the Quidax staff; Miss Techy, Money Africa, members of the media, among others.\n\nQuidax is an African-founded cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.

Humla Ventures, Nabuboto, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, and Pulse Africa founder Leonard Stiegeler also participated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Romain Poirot-Lellig, CEO and Founder, the company\u2019s goal is to \u201cbring the informal economy into the formal economy,\u201d focusing on last-mile delivery, eCommerce (warehousing and fulfilment), and financial services.\n\nThe company claims that it has made significant progress in providing merchants with last-mile delivery and eCommerce fulfilment services.\n\nBy the end of 2022, they plan to launch a B2B lending marketplace to help merchants obtain financing. Also, Kwik will use the funds to acquire customers and finance operations in Ibadan, Kano, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna.\n\nAccording to the CEO, Kwik intends to increase the number of merchants on its platform from over 100,000 to 800,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nThe big question: How does the company hope to accomplish this in the face of competition? I mean, the company claims to have over 100,000 merchants since launching in 2019. So, with less than 200,000 merchants in over two years, what magic will it perform in nine months?\n\nWell, I\u2019m looking to expand my platforms organically, and maybe, I could become one of those 800,000 merchants.

The next few months should be interesting.\n\nNew regulations for Kenya\u2019s digital lenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the introduction of a law regulating the financial sector, digital credit providers (DCPs) in Kenya will be required to reveal and provide evidence of their funding sources.\n\nWhy? The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) stated that disclosing the source of funds ensures that lenders are not engaging in financial crimes like money laundering, cybercrime, fraud and terrorist financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new regulation was published on Monday, March 21, 2022, and requires digital lenders to obtain a licence from the country\u2019s monetary authority or cease operations by September 2022.\n\nTo begin operations in the country, digital lenders were previously only required to register their businesses without showing proof of funds.\n\nNow, the new law requires digital lenders to disclose all loan terms and fees, including interest rates and the total amount owed. They will also be required to obtain permission from the Central Bank of Kenya before changing their pricing models.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they are also prohibited from sharing customer data with third parties, using threatening language, accessing or contacting their customers\u2019 phone contacts, and engaging in \u201cunconscionable debt collection tactics.\u201d\n\nWhat happens when digital lenders don\u2019t comply? Those who violate the regulations \u2014 like sharing loan defaulters\u2019 personal information with third parties \u2014 could face sanctions or licence revocation.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nThe Willie Lynch Letter: History or Hoax?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about ADHD.

          "text": "The anger and frustration on 45-year-old Joseph Martins\u2019 face were unmistakable \u2013 the power outage in Nigeria in recent days has almost ruined his 10-year-old bakery business.\n\nHe was visibly agitated not only by the long power outage in his Ikorodu community, a border town north of the country\u2019s economic nerve center, Lagos but also by the soaring price of diesel that is eating into his bottom line.\n\n\u201cIt can be like this for the next two months, yet the electricity distribution company would bring a humongous bill for us to settle at the end of the month,\u201d Martins moaned.\n\nHe had purchased various generators of various sizes, but they had only lasted a short time. He had almost given up until a ray of hope arrived on his doorstep when a dealer introduced him to solar power products. \u201cI switched to solar 10 days ago because the economics of a diesel generator no longer make any business sense,\u201d Martins added.\n\nLike Martins, Folarin Gbadamosi, who runs a barbing shop in Almourf area, a community at the outskirts of Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, also decried the high power bill that does not reflect the electricity consumption in his area.\n\nHe described the poor supply of electricity and the cost of diesel as a nightmare for his business. \u201cI bought a solar system that can power my business through a Pay As You Go (PAYG) model, which is currently serving my business very well,\u201d Gbadamosi said.\n\nBusinessDay findings revealed that more homes and businesses have been forced to turn to or consider switching to alternative sources of electricity as supply from the national grid worsened in recent days.\n\nMany households and businesses across the country were plunged into darkness for days after the national grid collapsed on March 14. The next day, the grid encountered another failure. Generation capacity dropped from around 4,000 megawatts (MW) to 2,000MW, with about 14 power plants shutting down.\n\nTotal power generation in the country stood at 3,775MW as of 6am on Wednesday from 3,522.8MW on Monday, according to the Nigeria Electricity System Operator. It stood at 4,470.1MW at the start of this month.\n\n\u201cIn the last three months, we have seen a more than 300 percent increase in the demands for our products and services,\u201d said Femi Adeyemo, chief executive officer of Arnergy, a distributed utility that provides renewable energy to residential and industrial customers in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUnlike previous years, estate agencies, firms and households are currently demanding for our services not just because it\u2019s reliable but also because of the flexible payment structures that make it affordable,\u201d he added.\n\nGabriel Chukwudi, a business development executive at Auxano Solar Nig. Ltd, said his firm had recorded a 30 percent increase in the demand for solar products in the last three months.\n\n\u201cGrid collapse, increased maintenance costs for generators and shortage of petroleum products are some of the reasons some of our customers gave for looking in our direction,\u201d he told BusinessDay.\n\nFrom a January average of N288 per litre, the price of diesel has more than doubled to N700 in Nigeria, causing widespread anxiety for businesses that rely on the product to power generators that make up for unstable public power supply.\n\n\u201cFrom 2020, we commenced the process of evolving all of our manufacturing plants to be powered in part by renewable solar energy. Today, we can boast of the fact that 50 percent of our manufacturing plants are now powered in part by solar energy, delivering up to 3,640-Kilowatt peak power output to the facilities,\u201d Matthieu Seguin, managing director at Nigerian Bottling Company Limited, told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cWe have embarked on fleet conversion/replacement to CNG trucks. Already, we have introduced 10 of these trucks to our fleet, which are already delivering cumulative CO2 emission savings of 17 tons every month,\u201d he added.\n\nBeyond solar, findings showed some factories in Nigeria are switching to compressed natural gas (CNG) to reduce the cost of energy by adopting clean fuel amid a global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming.\n\n\u201cOur factory runs strictly on CNG. This is because we know it is cheap, cleaner and healthier for the environment than diesel,\u201d said Ayodapo Keshinro, general manager, sales and technical at Pacegate Limited.\n\nPacegate manufactures 210 litres steel drums in the tighthead, open head and internally lacquered drums. The plant, located in Ilupeju, Lagos, is described as Africa\u2019s largest fully automated steel drum facility. The factory can produce 5,000 steel drums daily in line with the United Nations and International Society Organisation standards, according to the company.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Nigeria Plc introduced CNG as a fuel source for its Flowergate Factory in 2013, enabling the big nutrition, health, and wellness company in the West African economic powerhouse to reduce electricity costs by 30 percent.\n\nRead also: CBN solar intervention to domesticate renewable energy technology in Nigeria\n\nFlowergate Factory receives its regular CNG using specially designed vehicles, to serve as a backup against regular disruptions in the national power supply.\n\n\u201cThe conversion kits for CNG are imported, and should the government work out favourable terms and conditions such as free import duties and tax incentives, the cost per kit will fall and more car owners will participate; there is demand, no doubt,\u201d Ola Alokolaro, partner, energy and infrastructure at Advocaat Law Practice, said.\n\nOn Thursday, a standard cubic meter of CNG (equivalent of a litre of diesel) is less than N200 while a litre of diesel is over N600.\n\n\u201cGas is readily available and capable of driving down cost of production; manufacturers need do is to approach a reliable operator in the gas realm on how to access the product in any of the identified means of transportation,\u201d Taofeek Lawal, head, corporate communications of NIPCO, a parent company for NIPCO Gas Limited, told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cLots of manufacturers along gas corridors in the country are benefitting from the avenues as more pipelines are being laid across the country,\u201d he added.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that Powergas Limited is in talks with ECO Bus Maker to provide autogas filling stations in Nigerian cities where CNG-powered vehicles can be refuelled and will be put to good use.\n\nNonetheless, investors want the government to match intent with actions. \u201cThe government can grant a tax waiver for the importation of equipment and machinery, create a proper pricing system for CNG, formulate policy towards the use of CNG,\u201d Lawal said.\n\nNigeria is struggling to produce enough electricity to power its growing urban and rural population. With fluctuations in power generation capacity over time, power output in the country has been hovering around 4,000-4,500MW in recent years.\n\nSingapore, a Southeast Asian nation, which Nigeria is more than 1,280 times bigger in size and 33 times bigger than in population, produces more than three times (12,000MW) as much electricity as Nigeria.\n\nLagos, Africa\u2019s largest city and Nigeria\u2019s smallest state by size, is two times bigger than Singapore by size. Ghana, a neighbouring country, consumes over twice as much as Nigeria; Tunisia over 10 times, and South Africa almost 30 times as much.\n\n\u201cMore than 80 percent of the power that supplies the state at any point in time is from off-grid generation,\u201d Olalere Odusote, commissioner for energy and mineral resources, Lagos State, said at a recent industry event.",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) is set to go into a National Convention this Saturday to elect national officers of the party, more than a year and a half after the removal of the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nBarring any last-minute change, the office of the National Chairman will be determined through consensus, with Abdullahi Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State and current senator representing the Western Senatorial District of the state, already endorsed and accepted by President Muhammadu Buhari and governors on the party\u2019s platform.\n\nThe choice of Adamu, according to reports, is at the behest of the leader of the party, Buhari, who impressed it on even the \u2018powerful\u2019 APC governors and other leaders to accept the senator.\n\nAdamu, the late entrant into the race of APC National Chairman, was not among the list of aspirants for the exalted seat as at January 31, when he submitted the Interim Report of the National Reconciliation Committee of the party which he chaired.\n\nOver 10 contenders had expressed interest for the APC National Chairmanship including Saliu Mustapha, former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change; Tanko Almakura, former governor of Nasarawa State; Ali Modu Sheriff, former governor of Borno State; Mohammed Sani-Musa, senator representing Niger East District, and Abubakar Bawa-Bwari, former minister of state for mines and steel development.\n\nOthers were Abdulaziz Yari, Isa Yuguda, Kashim Shettima and Danjuma Goje, former governors of Zamfara, Bauchi, Borno and Gombe states respectively; George Akume, minister of special duties and intergovernmental affairs; Sunny Moniedafe; Mohammed Saidu-Etsu; and Sani Shinkafi, former national secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance.\n\nHowever, with the zoning formula that conceded the seat to the North-central geopolitical zone and other intrigues, only seven aspirants, six of them, including Adamu, were from the zone, except Yari from North-west.\n\nThe seven aspirants, namely Mustapha, Musa, Al-Makura, Adamu, Akume, Yari and Etsu, had bought and returned the N20 million worth nomination forms and screened for the race.\n\nHowever, like what started like rumours that spread like wild fire, the endorsement of Adamu came to the fore about 48 hours to the Convention (March 23,2022), when President Buhari reportedly met with APC governors and the aspirants and told them his preference for consensus chairmanship candidate.\n\nThat might have put to rest the earlier refusal by some of the aspirants that they were not aware of consensus arrangement and endorsement of Adamu.\n\nMusa, one of the aspirants, had last weekend said the party leadership had not reached out to any of them over consensus arrangement.\n\nHe wondered, \u201cWhy did the party sell forms to us? You sold (APC) forms to us. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, there has never been anybody that officially contacted me or any other aspirant. Nobody!\u201d\n\nYari had also said he was not aware that the office had even been zoned to the North-central, not to talk of micro-zoning and endorsement of a candidate.\n\nYari is the only contender to the APC National Chairmanship from another geopolitical zone (North-west) other than the North-central zone where the party ceded the position.\n\nHe said: \u201cNobody indicated whether it is South-West, South-East or South-South. The party acting chairman has not come out officially to tell us the chairmanship has been zoned to a particular geopolitical zone.\u201d\n\nBuhari had at the Wednesday meeting pleaded with the APC Governors on the need for the party chose its leadership by consensus, saying it was \u201cconsistent with the spirit of democracy, the party\u2019s constitution, and the Nigerian Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe President told them: \u201cI have already given my input and other recommendations on the way forward in both my 25th February 2022 meeting with the chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee and my 13th March 2022 letter to the chairman of the APC Governors Forum.\n\n\u201cWith the convention only two days away, I implore you to come together and sort out all the remaining party positions so that within the next 24 hours we can arrive at a Unity List which we can take to the convention.\n\n\u201cFinally, all those who have bought forms indicating interest and have been dropped should have their money refunded without delay.\u201d\n\nApart from Adamu, Ken Nnamani, a former president of the Senate, was picked by consensus as deputy national chairman (South), while Abubakar Kyari is the consensus candidate for deputy national chairman (North).\n\nRead also: APC convention: Buhari, APC Governors reach consensus on chairmanship candidate\n\nThe APC Governors agreed to the President\u2019s demands, as their Chairman and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku-Bagudu, said: \u201cMr President has always urged consensus for all positions because consensus is in accordance with the democratic tenets.\n\n\u201cOn the principle of ensuring that we get leadership that will hit the ground running, we are united, and to that extent, who will support any process that will lead to consensus and the emergence of leaders without the need for election.\u201d\n\nHowever, the other aspirants who have spent millions of naira on consultations and campaigns are yet to make their position known on the call for them to adopt Adamu as the consensus National Chairmanship aspirants.\n\nAbdullahi Sule, governor of Nasarawa State and chairman of the APC Convention Media and Publicity Sub-committee, confirmed this on Thursday when he told journalists: \u201cYou said most of the aspirants have already agreed to the consensus request yesterday; they have not made it public to us yet.\u201d\n\nThe development seems not to go down well with some party stakeholders who felt Buhari would have allowed a democratic contest and supremacy of the party to reign by not having preferred candidate and method of emergence of national officers.\n\nA party chieftain who does not want to be named told BusinessDay that the President\u2019s action was at variance with democratic norms and principles of party supremacy.\n\n\u201cHis involvement in the process at the tail end is not healthy for democracy and party supremacy at all. Giving His Excellency, Abdullahi Adamu National Chairman doesn\u2019t show reward for faithful party members who have paid their dues over the years,\u201d the APC chieftain said.\n\nThere is also ill-feeling that having Adamu as National Chairman and Nnamani as Deputy National Chairman (South) is giving the party back to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which is just a fraction as compared to the Congress for Progressive Change, the Action Congress of Nigeria blocs that formed the party.\n\nWhile Adamu was a two-term governor, one term senator under PDP and secretary, Board of Trustees of the party; Nnamani was president of the Senate during the PDP era and joined APC in 2017.\n\nAPC stakeholders under the agies of APC Rebirth had rejected the endorsement of Adamu as National Chairman and Nnamani as Deputy National Chairman (South) over what they described as signals to return APC to the hands of the original PDP members.\n\nAliyu Audu, APC Rebirth spokesperson, said that the senator representing Nasarawa West was not deserving of the coveted seat in APC ahead of many other aspirants who have unwavering belief in the ideals of the party and have laboured day and night for its success.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe lingering and now widespread speculation as to the plan to bring a former member of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP in the person of Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the APC National Chairman in the forthcoming Convention, where loyal, qualified and competent foundation members of the APC are also in the race is not only an aberration but a violation of the established principle of APC which respects long term fidelity to the party and frowns at every vestige of injustice.\n\n\u201cWe believe also that Senator Abdullahi Adamu, in his recent assignment as the chairman of the reconciliation committee is a case in hand. Even though he failed grossly in reconciling aggrieved members of our party, particularly from all the states he visited, Senator Adamu failed to accord recognition to the critical mass of young people in the party who are even more aggrieved by the people he consulted during the so-called reconciliation process.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, he does not possess the democratic credentials that should be exemplary of a National Chairman in a party like the APC, considering that he was one of the strong proponents of Obasanjo\u2019s third term agenda. If that agenda had succeeded, the beneficiary may be sitting as a lifetime president today, but we wonder if that development would have deepened democracy so much as to have a progressive party like the APC which some interest now want to hand over to Abdullahi Adamu.\u201d\n\nFor Nnamani, Audu also said: \u201cWhile he is known publicly to be a member of the All Progressives Congress, there are several instances where his loyalty to the party has been questioned. Information out there is that he has continued to be a member of APC in the day time and a member of PDP at night, and while this information has not been proven to be true, the APC would be playing safe by refusing to hand over such an important position of Deputy National Chairman to a man whose loyalty once completely lied in the opposition.\u201d",

I appeal that you try and attend functions as often and not depend on collecting stories from your colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe should make our presence felt in most of the places where the events are happening; they should monitor these activities and write a correct report.\n\n\u201cI appeal that you write correct reports so that your reports will not be trashed in courts.\n\n\u201cThe state government should pay attention to the media. Let us not ignore the media in any part of the state.\n\n\u201cThe media is very active in elections. The media must endeavour to go round the state, monitor electoral activities, get first-hand information and publish the truth.\n\n\u201cMedia should function on fairness and balance. If you are writing facts and balancing them, there won\u2019t be much damage to repair.\n\n\u201cNot only have we faced a lot of challenges from the media, but we have also had a lot of support.\n\n\u201cMedia houses should endeavour to pay their journalists adequately and substantially,\u201d Uduaghan pleaded.\n\nUduaghan, who advocated that media practitioners should be well remunerated, said traditional rulers should be given more roles to play in the polity, especially in the area of security.\n\n\u201cBy next year, we would have spent 24 years in this democracy. Twenty four years of unbroken democracy.\n\n\u201cThough not many people expected it to come this far, by the grace of God, we are still enjoying it.\n\n\u201cThe media has enjoyed more freedom than they did in the military regime.\n\n\u201cYou need some form of dictatorship for a nation to develop to some extent. Dictatorship brings discipline.\n\n\u201cTraditional rulers are not playing the significant role they should be playing. Our traditional rulers must practice dictatorship no apologies.\n\n\u201cTraditional rulers should be given more roles to play in the society because if they are, insecurity will reduce.\n\nDignitaries at the occasion included former Minister of State for Education, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi, Ovie of Uvwie Kingdom, HRM Emmanuel Sideso Abe I, Ovie of Idjerhe Kingdom, HRM King Obukowho Monday Whiskey, Udurhie 1, and the Rector of the Delta State Polytechnic, Otefe-Oghara, Prof. Emmanuel Ogujor, among others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) has disclosed that about 82 percent of its oil production was stolen in the month of February 2022.\n\nThe IPPG made the disclosure in a presentation at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement on oil theft in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nRepresented by the Managing Director of Waltersmith Petroman, Chikeze Nwosu, the group said the independent producers were facing existential threat.\n\nAccording to Nwosu, the oil theft challenge has grown from what it used to be in the past of about 4 percent to a high of 91 percent in December, 2021.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe TNP (Trans Niger Pipeline) is the major issue. We have seen crude theft grow from single digit percentages to reports of 91 percent in December for some of the operators who produce into the TNP, 75 percent in January and the February report we got has an average of 82 percent\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that the situation seems to be getting worse despite all effort to curb it. He therefore called for urgent action from the government and stakeholders, Vanguard reported.\n\nOn its part, the federal government, disclosed that about $3.27 billion worth of oil has been lost to vandalism in the past 14 months.\n\nThe government said high level cases of oil theft have become a threat to the country\u2019s corporate and economic existence, with the industry now thinking of transporting crude oil from fields to export terminals by trucks, Vanguard reported.\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) in a presentation at a stakeholders\u2019 engagement on oil theft in Abuja yesterday said the government was extremely worried about the tragic situation.\n\nThe Commission disclosed that most of the crude oil losses came from Bonny Terminal Network, Forcados Terminal Network and Brass Terminal Network.\n\nIt listed factors that were aiding the criminal activities as: economic challenges, inadequate security, poor surveillance, poor community engagements, exposed facilities and stakeholder compromises.\n\nThe commission stated that due to the high level of theft, the country has been unable to meet its OPEC production quota.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the Chief Executive of NUPRC, Engr. Gbenga Komolafe said the government was determined to end the menace so that the country can benefit from the rising price of oil and also to protect the environment from oil spills.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe issue of oil theft has become a very worrisome issue to the government of Nigeria and I believe to you as investors too\u201d.\n\nEngr. Komolafe stressed that it was important that the government and the oil companies\u2019 work together resolve the issue especially on the agreed volume of oil lost to vandals as the issues strike at the heart of Federation revenue.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that in the last one week we have set up a crack team for us to determine the accurate figure because as a government we cannot continue to act on the basis of an abstract or inaccurate figure in dealing with an important issue as crude oil theft because the issue goes to the heart of Federation revenue\u201d.\n\nHe noted that \u201cthe concern of the government is to increase our national oil production. Basically, we are an oil economy and when the upstream is sick it affects the wellbeing and the health of the country.\n\n\u201cThe situation that is happening in the upstream is getting to the level of threat to the existence and wellbeing of Nigeria. As a responsible regulator we are very concerned about it. We have been doing a lot and we are not relenting. We will do everything possible to increase oil production in a manner that will make the nation benefit from the upward swing in the international price of crude oil\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman/Managing Director of ExxonMobil, Richard Laing who represented the Oil Producers Trade Section (OPTS) of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce, pointed out that though the issue was not new, it has grown from just oil theft to organized criminality with sophisticated operation.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs an industry, I know how hard my colleagues work to produce products that we need and to suffer the level of theft that we have is disheartening. But more importantly it is a threat to investments, a threat to the health of the industry and wealth of the nation\n\n\u201cIt is important that the stakeholders integrate their activities and their thoughts. As OPTS we have met with a number of stakeholders over the last several months and we want to make sure that whatever we do is joined up and effective.\n\n\u201cThe language is very important and I think we use theft rather quickly. I don\u2019t think this is theft, this is organized criminal activity. The level of sophistication in terms of tapping into the pipelines, the distributions, efforts required to move hundreds of thousands of barrels a day isn\u2019t some guy coming along and taping into a pipeline and taking container crude oil. It is organized criminality\u201d, Laing stressed.",

          "text": "National Chairman Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr Iyorchia Ayu has said the opposition party has a history of rotating offices among various components making up Nigeria.\n\nAyu, who stated this Thursday while inaugurating the 37-member PDP zoning committee in Abuja, insisted that it is a tradition in the party to discuss every issue, including fair distribution of offices.\n\nThe committee would work out modalities for the sharing of positions of Senate President, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and other leadership positions in the two chambers of the National Assembly among the six geopolitical zones.\n\nAyu recalled that before they came into office as National Working Committee (NWC) members, PDP leaders put heads together and ensured party offices were fairly distributed across the country.\n\nThe former Senate President said: \u201cWe talk, we don\u2019t fight, we resolve issues. There is no issue that is too difficult or too important for the PDP to resolve, that is the spirit of the party.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I urge all of you to discuss this matter with the same spirit that you discussed at the National Executive Council (NEC) because most of you are members of NEC, you knew what happened and you are free to advance your arguments.\u201d\n\nHe said the goal was for the party to win power next year, saying this can only be possible by uniting and working together.\n\nThe PDP chair stated that \u201cif the zoning committee pursues it without bitterness, whoever wins, we will rally around the person and then the party will win the election next year.\u201d\n\nAyu who charged members of the committee to remain focused on the bigger picture, explained that \u201cbecause that is what we want. I believe by the time we have the big prize in our hands, we will share it, we will rotate it the way we want. If we had not been interrupted on this journey, about six years ago, we have started the same process.\n\n\u201cSo, PDP has a history of rotating our offices. Anybody who doesn\u2019t get it this time should wait after the tenure whoever will be our next President\u201d.\n\nAyu expressed optimism the PDP would produce the next president and ensure it goes round with justice, fairness and the interests of Nigeria.\n\nThough the chairman of the inaugurated committee was yet to be named as at the time of this report, but the party announced Emmanuel Ekpe as secretary.\n\nMembers include former governors Ayo Fayose (Ekiti), Sule Lamido (Jigawa), Ahmed Makarfi (Kaduna), Liyel Imoke (Cross River), Boni Haruna (Adamawa), Ibrahim Dankwabo (Gombe), Ibrahim Shema (Katsina), Ibrahim Idris (Kogi) Attahiru Bafarawa (Sokoto) and Jonah Jang (Plateau).\n\nOthers include Chief Tom Ikimi (Edo), Mao Ohuabunwa (Abia), Emmanuel Ibokessien (A/Ibom), Prof. A. B. C. Nwosu (Anambra) Sen. Abdul Ningi (Bauchi), Boyelayefa Debekeme ( Bayelsa) and Sanusi Daggash (Borno), Reps Minority Leader Ndudi Elumelu (Delta) and Amb. Franklin Ogbuewu (Ebonyi) among others.\n\nAspirants to meet Atiku\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP presidential aspirants met Thursday and promised to reach out to former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar and other aspirants on a consensus candidate for the party in 2023.\n\nIn continuation of the Bauchi meeting, the immediate past President of the Senate, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki, governors of Sokoto and Bauchi states, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and Bala Mohammed respectively met in Abuja to intensify the discussion on consensus.\n\nSaraki who addressed the media on behalf of his colleagues said: \u201cWe\u2019re in this country today and it\u2019s important as stakeholders that key leaders of this party ever seen to be united. Some of the decisions we\u2019ve also taken today is that we are going to embark on reaching out to other aspirants, of course, identified senior leaders of the party and other aspirants across the country and also stakeholders. Some of them are former colleagues, so we are going to reach out to all parts on this process of bringing us together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to that process because we believe that, once we unite as PDP, we lay the foundation, therefore a strong party, will help in delivering Nigerians from the challenges that they\u2019re facing now and prepare for the country to be much stronger as we go ahead.\u201d\n\nOn whether the consensus meeting was being plotted to shut out the likes of Atiku, Saraki said: \u201cThose are just people who do not see anything good; we are not shutting anybody out as we said we are going to see him, it is not about shutting anybody out, it is about uniting everybody for the interest of this country. And you will see when we begin to go round. As we said we are going to see him and other aspirants of the party.\u201d\n\nGroups purchase forms for Bala, Tambuwal, Anyim\n\nMeanwhile, Bauchi state Governor Mohammed, his Sokoto counterpart, Mr Tambuwal, and former President of the Senate Anyim Pius Anyim, purchased their nomination and expression of interest forms to contest the presidential election.\n\nThey picked the forms at the party secretariat in Abuja Thursday.\n\nThe duo of former Vice President Abubakar and Saraki had both picked their forms earlier in the day.\n\nBala\n\nThe Bala Mohammed Vanguard (BMV), a political pressure group, purchased the N40million Presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for the governor.\n\nThe group, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said they had been mounting pressure on the governor to join the presidential race on the PDP platform.\n\nPresenting the form to Governor Mohammed, Director General BMV Mohammed Jibo said:\n\n\u201cWe need someone that is detribalized, someone that sees everyone as his own, someone that loves people more than money, someone that recognizes the power of women and youths.\n\n\u201cWe know that we need a candidate that the youths will stand for, someone who will go ahead and win the election.\n\n\u201cThe format he used in ruling this city of Abuja is still being used today. Many people who had no connections got land under his leadership and are today landlords in this city that is very expensive to live in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he gets to Aso Rock, he must train new leaders. He has done it in Bauchi and he will do it again,\u201d he assured.\n\nAlso speaking, the group\u2019s women leader, Charity Anthony, extolled the former minister\u2019s leadership qualities.\n\n\u201cToday, BMV has honoured you because we see you as a leader with passion for humanity. We consulted widely and we found out that you are the potential this country needs. You are destined to rule this country. We will vote and defend our votes and our leaders are ready to work for you,\u201d she said.\n\nResponding, Mohammed, who described the moment as \u201causpicious\u201d said he\u2019s encouraged to take up the task.\n\n\u201cOn my own, I may not have come out but what BMV has done for me today has given me the impetus to offer myself to serve.\n\n\u201cIf given the opportunity, I will not let you down. I am not going to be a President of a zone, I will be the President of Nigeria. Nigeria has the resources and with the right leadership, we can become an important member of the global community.\n\n\u201cThe leader we need is one who does not believe in winner takes all but someone who believes in \u2018live, let live.\u201d We are ready for business, we are ready to work.\n\n\u201cWith this energy and impetuous, I have accepted these forms. They will be filled with the required information and I will do my best to start this journey,\u201d Bala said in an emotion-laden voice.\n\nThe event was attended by renowned academic, Prof. Udenta Udenta and former Director General of the Nigeria Orientation Agency, (NOA), Mike Omeri among others.\n\nTambuwal\n\nAlso, another group of concerned Nigerians purchased the forms for Tambuwal, saying the Chairman PDP Governors Forum has all the qualities needed to rescue and rebuild Nigeria.\n\nCoordinator of the group, Olumuyiwa Akinboro (SAN) said Tambuwal had demonstrated good leadership that can tackle insecurity and improve the economy.\n\nAkinboro said: \u201cHe is young and vibrant and can take us to the promise land and PDP is the platform that can actualize this if we get to do things right.\n\n\u201cNigerians need him at this time. We are not lacking in strong leaders, we are lacking in people that understand the politics of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAnyim\n\nSimilarly, a coalition of about 350 groups purchased the presidential forms for Anyim because of their unshaken confidence in his ability to govern the country.\n\nAddressing journalists after picking the forms, Comrade Mayor Samuel said: \u201cOn behalf of the members of the over 350 support groups and partners scattered all over the world, who are driving the Greater Nigeria 2023 Project for Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim\u2019s Presidential Campaign. I am immensely delighted to address you on our mission to the National Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party today.\n\n\u201cThe events of the last few weeks and the bitter experiences ordinary citizens have been subjected to have shaken the confidence and faith of Nigerians in the ability and commitment of the leadership of this country to protect the lives and cater for the needs of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIf by 2023, Nigeria fails to get the leadership question right, the future will be very bleak. We have, therefore, decided to throw our hats in the ring by getting directly involved in the process of choosing who will be the candidate of the PDP, the Party Nigerians are hanging their hopes on for a secure, peaceful, united and prosperous Nigeria come 29th of May 2023.\n\n\u201cIn order to ensure we get it right this time, we have decided to lead other support groups and partners of Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim to purchase the forms for him to contest in the PDP presidential primary election\u201d.",

          "text": "With some 24 hours to the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja, stakeholders have been advised to avoid any squabble that could jeopardise the party\u2019s chances in the 2023 general elections.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari gave the admonition Thursday while receiving the National Assembly lawmakers elected on the APC platform at the State House.\n\nHe reminded them that the proximity of the election dates set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would not allow for any acrimony that could constitute a cog in the wheel of the party\u2019s progress.\n\nBuhari said all positions should be harmonized with a bigger picture of winning elections and providing good governance.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the National Convention of our party, which we have committed to, is holding on the 26th March, 2022. And we cannot afford to do anything that will jeopardize the chances of the party in the 2023 General Elections. The limited time frame of the INEC time table does not permit us any room for delay or further squabbling. We must therefore in the light of this reality consistently keep our eyes on the ball and refuse any distraction.\n\n\u201cA critical segment of our national democratic process is the National Assembly. Being representatives of our people from all over the country, the National Assembly especially the 9th Assembly has exhibited commitment to a peaceful democratic process in its conduct and utmost maturity in its relationship with other arms of government. I commend you, the leadership for this success.\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senators and Honorable Members, we have an obligation to conduct the upcoming convention in a manner that not only fortifies the unity of our party but also improves the prospects of our electoral fortunes in the 2023 general elections. You have an important role to play in ensuring that this happens,\u201d he said.\n\nZoning\n\nOn sharing of party offices based on zoning, President Buhari told the lawmakers that a zoning template was produced and adopted by the party after wide consultations in order to ensure the leadership was reflective of the diversity in unity while representing various dynamic interests.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we adhere to that template,\u201d he noted, adding: \u201cThe time available to us is limited and I therefore enjoin you to collaborate with the various stakeholders within and outside your respective states and zones to agree to work together and harmoniously in electing into the allotted positions appropriately, as stipulated in the provided template. This will not only produce a smooth process and limit friction but will enhance the image of the party positively and strengthen our over-all position of dominance in the political space.\u201d\n\nThe president said he met with the governors and the party national chairmanship aspirants Wednesday to reiterate the need to go into the convention with a united front.\n\n\u201cIt is the same reason why I invited you today. We should all do our part to ensure the success of this convention. This will fortify us for the campaigns ahead of us,\u201d he further said.\n\nThe APC lawmakers were led to the meeting by Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawal and Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nConsensus best \u2013 Sule\n\nIn a related development, Nasarawa state Governor Abdullahi Sule has said consensus remains the best way if the ruling party is to fully prepare ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe governor, who is also chairman publicity sub-committee of the convention, also cited the need for unity and a peaceful national convention as reasons President Buhari and governors on the platform of the party opted for consensus.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the party\u2019s national secretariat Thursday in Abuja, Governor Sule said the APC governors were now more united and would go into the convention as one united family.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cAs I mentioned earlier, we have been driven towards a consensus arrangement so that we can have a very peaceful convention after which most of the political activities will begin which will lead to the success of the party at most of the elections that we are going to have next year by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe also want to inform you that the major caucuses of this party, we have been meeting in order to discuss most of the grey areas and resolve them and so far again so good all the governors had been inspired yesterday (Wednesday).\n\n\u201cWe actually had a meeting with Mr. President where some grey areas were resolved and the governors are now united more than you can ever think. We are going as a united front into this convention.\n\n\u201cWe also look forward actually to a convention that is going to signify our unity and our strength as we come together to face the election next year.\u201d\n\nPolicy conference\n\nMeanwhile, a policy conference tagged \u201cConsolidating Democracy: Scorecard, impact and the road ahead\u201d is slated for Friday (today).\n\nSecretary of the Pre-Convention Committee and Director General Nigeria Orientation Agency Dr. Garba Abari said this in Abuja Thursday.\n\nHe said the overall objective of the conference was to position APC thought leaders and sector experts to deliberate on its current and future policy direction of the party.\n\nHe said the conference would also provide a reform agenda which the party would drive over the next phase of its administration building on the current achievements, including the outcomes for state and local governments.\n\nAbari said the conference would further seek to address various segments around governance, economy and social environment with the aim to re-enkindle investors\u2019 confidence in the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe specific objectives, he said, include; \u201creview the performance of APC-controlled national and sub-national governments, analyse introspective pathways towards mapping the future to bridge the gaps and unlock the productive potential of the country, discuss the approaches required towards achieving an inclusive and coherent policy trajectory for the party in government and harmonise a sustainable implementation agenda with the implementation framework as a follow-up to existing plans, policies, programmes and projects.\n\n\u201cThe APC Policy Conference will be structured into different panel discussions that will focus on core thematic areas as follows: economy, governance, and human development. This will enable resource persons and participants to create a central spine that holds the party\u2019s development agenda since 2015.\u201d\n\nAmong the expected participants include; President Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad, Speaker House of Representatives Gbajabiamila , chairman and members of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). governors, among others.",

          "text": "Justice Inynag Ekwo of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Friday, dismissed a suit filed by the Attorneys General of 36 States of the Federation against the Federal Government over plans to deduct from states\u2019 funds to settle debts owed consultants engaged by the states and Local Governments in relation to the Paris Club refunds.\n\nJustice Ekwo held in a. 51-page judgment that the 36 states Attorneys General lacked the locus standi (Legal right) to file the legal action against the Federal Government.\n\nThe judge, who maintained that the plaintiffs failed to prove to the court that they have the legal right to institute the action, also held the they (plaintiffs) havr no constitutional powers to challenge the decisions of their state governors, whom he said the AGs are their appointees.\n\nAccording to Justice Ekwo, States Attorneys General cannot challenge the constitutional powers of their state governors and held that, \u201cOn the whole, I hold that the plaintiffs have no locus standi to institute the legal action against the governors of their states\u201d.\n\nThe court further held that the case of the AGs of the 36 states of the Federation constitute an abuse of court processes as the court cannot seize the judgment which authorised deduction of the judgment debt.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, I hereby make an order dismissing the suit of the plaintiffs for lacking locus standi\u201d, Justice Ekwo held and agreed with the defendants that there was an agreement for the deductions of $480 million from the federal allocation to the state governments.\n\nHe said the plaintiffs, who are neither members of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum nor, Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), cannot challenge the action of the two bodies.\n\nHe said since the plaintiffs were complaining of the action of the state governors, they ought to have joined the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum as respondents in the suit.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, I do not see merit in this case and I make an order dismissing it for lacking in merit\u201d, Justice Ekwo held.\n\nCounsel representing the States AGs, Jibrin Okutepa (SAN), in his reaction, commended the judge for the timely delivery of the judgment in spite of the volumes of the processes filed.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the hardworking put into the matter. We commend your Lordship\u201d.\n\nCounsel to the respondents, who are, the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria and 43 others also commended the industry of the Judge in the judgment, which they noted was a result of hardworking.\n\nThe plaintiffs had, in their suit, want the court to restrain President Muhammadu Buhari and others from effecting the planned deduction from states\u2019 funds to settle the debt owed consultants engaged by states and local governments.\n\nSunday Ameh (SAN) representing the plaintiffs at the November proceeding, while adopting his final submission, argued that the defendants misconstrued the kernel of his clients\u2019 suit and faulted the argument by the defendants that the suit was challenging existing judgments given by the court in favour of some of the consultants.\n\n\u201cWe are not challenging the judgments, we are saying the way the Federal Government and its agencies are going about enforcing the judgments violates sections 120 and 162 of the Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nAmeh stated that his clients were not averse to the issuance of promissory notes to the consultants (also sued as defendants) by the federal government but became uncomfortable when it (FG) issued a notice to commence deduction from the states\u2019 accounts.\n\nHe added that since the Federal Government agreed that the contractors were owed in relation to the services they rendered, it should settle the indebtedness without deploying funds belonging to the states and local governments.\n\nAmeh contended that it is the nation\u2019s commonwealth that some individuals were attempting to take out of the Federation Accounts, stating that \u201cif the Federal Government is inclined to pay the debt, it should look for another way to do so and leave the funds belonging to the state governments and local governments alone.\u201d\n\nDefendants\u2019 lawyers, including Wole Olanipekun (SAN), Maimuna Lami Shiru (Acting Director, Civil Litigation, Federal Ministry of Justice) and Olusola Oke (SAN) faulted the competence of the suit and urged the court to dismiss it.\n\nOlanipekun, who represented one of the consultants, Dr Ted Iseghohi-Edwards (14th defendant), described the plaintiffs as meddlesome interlopers, noting that the state governments claimed to be fighting for the Local Governments, a distinct tier of government, without the consent of the third tier of government.\n\nHe prayed the court to dismiss the suit for being time-wasting and constituting an abuse of the court process.\n\nMrs Shiru argued that not only was the suit statute barred, but the plaintiffs are also seeking the impossible by asking the court to sit on appeal over judgments earlier delivered by it and other courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\nShe further argued that the decision by the Federal Government to issue promissory notes to the consultant as a way of settling the debt owed them was legitimate, adding that the plaintiffs cannot distance themselves from the decision taken by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) in engaging some of the consultants.\n\nMrs Shiru represented the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria; the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), the Accountant General of the Federation (AGoF), the Ministry of Finance Incorporated and the Debt Management Office (DMO), sued as the first to sixth defendants in the suit.\n\nOke, who represented Riok Nigeria Limited and Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu argued that the suit is without merit and should be dismissed and that the promissory notes by the Federal Government were charged on its properties and not those of the states.\n\nOke stated that the judgment obtained by his clients was against the Local Governments and not the plaintiffs, adding that the local governments have admitted the contract awarded to his clients.",

The court presided over by Justice Adolphus Enebeli, yesterday, watched some of the video clips where Wike was speaking relating to the alleged reports in THISDAY.\n\nIn the video clips presented by Igbanoi and played in the courtroom as evidence to the said report, Wike was sighted in a campaign speaking about Obaseki as televised on Channels and TVC News.\n\nThe court also watched a video clip during an interview with the Governor televised by ARISE News titled, \u201cThe politics and issues in PDP.\u201d\n\nA video clip of Wike praising Amaechi over his performance in Rivers State, when he was the Acting Director of Amaechi Campaign Organisation was also played.\n\nHowever, during cross examination, Emmanuel Ukala (SAN), lead counsel for the claimant, told the defendant witness (Igbanoi) that the publication was intended to smear the integrity of the governor.\n\nBut in defense, the witness stated that the story was gathered from speeches made by Wike from different occasions of campaign and interviews.\n\nIgbanoi also told the court that the publication had no intention to damage the image of the governor but was only doing being professional.\n\nHe added that Wike has always been a friend and wondered how he would want to hurt a friend.\n\nHowever, after about three hours of hearing the matter, the judge adjourned till today to continue with cross examination of the first defence witness.\n\nIgbanoi denied strongly that THISDAY was out to libel the claimant, Wike.\n\nHe stressed that the newspaper was only fulfilling its constitutional duty of informing the public and making a fair comment on the situation during the Edo State governorship election in the said publication.\n\nWhile responding to some of the questions during the cross-examination, he further pointed out to the court, that Wike has been a public servant in the past two decades.\n\nThat his life therefore was an open book that is open to members of the public and therefore the media was free to comment on his utterances and actions, whether positive or perceived negative. He cited examples of his televised statements as the Director General of the Rotimi Amaechi\u2019s Campaign Organisation where he praised Amaechi to high heavens and turned round a few years after to lampoon, castigate and lambast him at every given occasion.\n\nHe also pointed out that Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki whose campaign organisation he chaired is now his number one enemy to the dismay of the public.\n\nThat he has since been apologising to the former Edo State Governor and former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole openly in the media.\n\nAfter several hours the court adjourned the case to Friday.",

          "text": "A former governor of Anambra State and vice presidential candidate on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general election, Mr. Peter Obi on Thursday, joined the 2023 presidential race with a promise to lift the country out of poverty.\n\nObi declared his intention to run for the presidency at the Anambra State Government House, during a meeting with traditional rulers of the state.\n\nHowever, a former governor of Niger State, Mu\u2019azu Babangida Aliyu, has said Obi, an already accomplished corporate leader and successful businessman, only went into politics to make the society better.\n\nSpeaking on his declaration, Obi said, he decided to declare his intention to run for president, while also calling for prayers and support from the monarchs.\n\nThe former banker said, \u201cI am talking to the traditional rulers, because if somebody begins any journey, he must first tell his fathers. I am telling you as my fathers that I am coming out to contest the position of the President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf I am voted as the president, I will secure Nigeria, create jobs for the teeming youths of the country and pull Nigeria out of poverty. Everything I have done regarding resources, I have manage them proudly. I want to move this country forward. I\u2019m a Nigerian, I believe in one united Nigeria, and I want it secured.\n\n\u201cI am not just aspiring for political position but to serve and move the country forward. I have all it takes to be president and move the country forward. You know me and you know how Nigeria is today. In 2019, I went with Atiku as the vice presidential candidate but today I want to come out on my own.\n\n\u201cI just came to seek your blessing as traditional rulers of the state. I am here to tell you as my own fathers that, I am aspiring for the president of Nigeria,\u201d Obi told the monarchs.\n\nBut Aliyu, who remarked on the Obi presidency when he paid a courtesy visit to the former Niger State governor in Minna, stated that Obi, passionate about societal development, joined politics and became a governor, so as to make positive impacts in the society.\n\nAccording to him, Obi was someone whose track record of success in governance showed how committed he was to nation building.\n\nAliyu, therefore, commended members of the party for their unity and for pursuing the democratic ideals for which a society should be known, adding that the whole essence of governance was service to the people.\n\nHe, however, lamented the state of poor governance in the country as manifested in high level of insecurity, high cost of living, high inflation, high unemployment rate, and so on.\n\nBut he assured the people that the PDP would rescue Nigeria from further collapse and transform the nation, when given power in 2023.\n\nIn his remarks, Chairman of the PDP in Niger State, Tanko Beji, wished Obi well in his political journey, and reassured him of their commitment to ensuring that the party wins the 2023 elections both at the state and federal levels.\n\nResponding, Obi noted that Niger State contributed greatly to Nigeria\u2019s development and would do more if supported by the government.\n\n\u201cNiger State has a landmass of 76km2, twice the size of Netherlands, which has 33,500km2. Their income from their agricultural exports is over $100 billion. Government can support small scale farmers in Niger State to produce more.\n\n\u201cThe rice farmers at Baddegi area, Mambe and Doko Axis, Gbanchitagi and Kusotachi axis can be empowered by the government to be more productive. Same goes for the yam farmers at Shiroro, Munya and Kuta areas of Niger State. All these offer us great opportunity for development of the nation,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Nigeria: In Deft Political Move, Buhari\u2019s Men Set to Dominate Incoming APC National Working Committee",
          "text": "In a demonstration of deft skill and intriguing art of political manoeuvring, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s men appear to have stamped their authority on the incoming National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Buhari has, apparently, appropriated some of the key offices ahead of the party\u2019s national convention coming up Saturday, March 26, in Abuja.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) elements in APC had adopted Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi as their nominee for the office of National Vice Chairman, South-west. With this, the CPC leg of the APC merger, Buhari\u2019s original group, seem to be establishing a foothold in the South-west and other zones in the south.\n\nAhead of the convention of the ruling party, Nasarawa State Governor and Chairman of the Media Committee of the national convention, Abudulahi Sule, assured that the consensus arrangement that would be adopted tomorrow in choosing candidates for the party offices conformed to the 2022 Electoral Act. Sule spoke Thursday at a press conference in Abuja.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nBeyond the convention, APC will Friday hold a policy conference in preparation for the post-Buhari era. Secretary of the committee and Director General of National Orientation Agency (NOA), Dr. Garba Abari, disclosed this Thursday in Abuja while addressing a pre-convention conference, with the theme, \u201cConsolidating Democracy: Scorecard, Impact and the Road Ahead.\u201d\n\nThat was as Buhari hosted the founding fathers of the ruling party to dinner at his official residence at the State House, Abuja, Thursday.\n\nThe president, who had watched the APC crisis peak a couple of weeks ago, before stepping in, began to stamp his authority on some of major offices with a message that clearly dismissed insinuations he would sit by and watch others do it or allow things take shape without lifting a finger.\n\nFirst, before the president left for London on a short medical trip some weeks ago, he had hinted at his choice for the national chairmanship of the party, a move that unsettled all initial permutations. It also sent other stakeholders, particularly, the APC governors, back to the drawing board. The governors tried to rally and pushback on the president\u2019s decision. For a while, it seemed they were succeeding.\n\nBut with the crisis not abating, Buhari showed his hand again, albeit in a different way, when he ordered the sack of Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, and his replacement with Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello. Bello acted in Buni\u2019s stead and took far-reaching decisions within a week that he was in office.\n\nHowever, when the legal implications of Buhari\u2019s rather hasty directive were evaluated, and a warning was served by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which declined to recognise Bello, Buhari rescinded some of his decisions. Though the former national secretary of the party, John Akpanudoedehe, was sacrificed in the process.\n\nSince his return, Buhari had taken some deft political decisions meant to shape the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s national convention. These include establishing that consensus was the way to go at the convention, meaning there would be a unity list, particularly, of the core prospective NWC members.\n\nBesides, the president had long hinted at the possibility of consensus, when sometime back, he told his party members that APC had always embraced the consensus approach since inception, citing the emergence of Chief Bisi Akande, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, and Adams Oshiomhole as examples to buttress his point.\n\nIn quick turns, therefore, the president on Wednesday met with the APC governors at State House, Abuja, after which he also met with the contenders for the post of national chairman of the party. Some members of the party claimed it was part of moves to further show his hand and interest in some of the key NWC positions.\n\nThus, in another letter this March, the president had, allegedly, signed off four NWC offices with preferred aspirants that would not be challenged, as other stakeholders perfected the \u201cunity list\u201d to fill other positions.\n\nThe NWC offices include the national chairman, the national secretary, organising secretary, and deputy national chairman, south, of the party.\n\nInterestingly, the president, who sources claimed did not ask or interfere with what other stakeholders in the party were doing with the non-NWC offices, moved beyond his influence in the north, to now exert same influence in the south.\n\nFor instance, for the national chairmanship of the party, Buhari had so far indicated interest in a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, a man, who was not even in the race some months ago, but was only appointed to reconcile some of the aggrieved members of the party.\n\nUp until some hours ago, the notion was that the South-west wing of the APC had settled for Senator Iyiola Omisore, from Osun State, as the candidate for the office of national secretary. But there were some last minute developments, which showed that the president had signed off on Mr. Ifeoluwa Oyedele, a 2020 governorship aspirant of the party in Ondo State.\n\nSimilarly, news doing the rounds had it that the president had included in his list of choice candidates a former president of the Senate, Senator Ken Nnamani, from Enugu State, as Deputy National Chairman (South), effectively closing the door against some South-east governors, who had been pushing other interests.\n\nLikewise, Alhaji Waziri Bulama, a former acting national secretary of the party from Borno State, according to sources, has secured the blessing of the president to emerge National Organsing Secretary of the party, representing the North-east geo-political zone.\n\nAlthough not in the original letter, which contained the names of the other four signed off by the president, THISDAY gathered from other inside sources that Alhaji Adamu Farouk from Jigawa State had been positioned for the office of Deputy National Chairman (North), having also allegedly received the president\u2019s blessing.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the CPC arm of APC had positioned Afikuyomi to emerge as National Vice Chairman, South-west. With this development, the CPC tendency in APC is fast establishing its dominance in the South-west and other geopolitical zones in the south.\n\nSources told THISDAY that since Afikuyomi had always had a relationship with most of the CPC elements, especially, from his days in the senate, coupled with his involvement in the activities of the for Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) before the merger, it was easier going with the current flow of party alignment and realignment.\n\nAfikuyomi\u2019s aspiration to be national vice chairman elicited some interests recently, when news went viral that his friend, a former governor of Lagos State and presidential hopeful, Bola Tinubu, was against his ambition and instead, preferred another position to be micro-zoned to Lagos State, to protect his presidential aspiration.\n\nThe development, which THISDAY reported on Monday, had caused division among some of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists, who thought the decision of the APC national leader amounted to betrayal of friendship and trust. Afikuyomi was, thus, forced to now pitch tent with the CPC elements in the APC and by implication, enhance the president\u2019s hold on the party as the 2023 succession battle peaks.\n\nAlready, some of the other stakeholders in the south, who did not like how their leaders managed their aspirations, had also started to enlist for the CPC, picking signals that the president was now awake to certain realities that might inform his choices in the next general election.\n\nBesides, they were said to have concluded that since the office Afikuyomi wanted to vie for was a national office, they would mobilise effectively across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to ensure that the former senator for both Lagos Central and West emerged victorious tomorrow.\n\nThe Nasarawa State Governor and Chairman of the APC Media Committee for the national convention, Abudulahi Sule, assured that the consensus arrangement to be adopted tomorrow would conform to the provisions of the 2022 Electoral Act, as amended.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, Sule noted that the party was being driven towards a consensus arrangement in order to have a peaceful convention.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs I mentioned earlier, we have been driven towards a consensus arrangement so that we can have a very peaceful convention, after which most of the political activities will begin, which will lead into the success of the party at most of the elections that we are going to have next year, by the grace of God.\u201d\n\nSule stressed, \u201cWe will not do anything whatsoever as a political party that is going to be in violation of the law, because as the ruling party, we will not carry out something that is going to be detrimental to our law in this country, so that we do not give bad example. You can rest assured that whatever we are going to do is going to be in line with the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cWhat our party has that others don\u2019t have is the fact that we have a political leader and father that everyone, who is truly a member of this party, respects and that is President Muhammadu Buhari. We strongly believe that he will not do something just for selfish reasons, for greed or for anything that will be against the interest of the party. He is interested in ensuring the unity of the party. So, he\u2019s not doing anything for his personal benefit.\n\n\u201cThat is the kind of leader we have. That is why each time he speaks, everyone listens, because they know he is not doing it for any personal benefit. That is his request and I am telling you his request will be honoured, because we know he is doing it sincerely for the benefit of the party.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of refund to other aspirants, Sule was of the opinion that the president only made an appeal, which he believed the leadership of the party agreed with.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cThis was an appeal made by Mr. President in order to show leadership. He said once we agreed on the consensus, it is only fair that what they paid be returned back to them. It was a request actually made by Mr. President to the leadership of the party and the leadership was there. So, I will say that the leadership of the party also agreed.\u201d\n\nSule noted that the total number of delegates expected at the convention would be determined by the party and revealed that the major caucuses of the party had been meeting in order to discuss most of the grey areas and resolve them.\n\nHe added that the meeting of the APC governors with the president on Wednesday provided them with the opportunity to resolve some of the contentious issues, noting that the governors are now more united, and the ruling party would go as a united front into the convention.\n\nAPC will Friday hold a policy conference in preparation for the post-Muhammadu Buhari era. Secretary of the committee and Director General of National Orientation Agency (NOA), Dr. Garba Abari, disclosed this yesterday in Abuja while addressing a pre-convention conference, with the theme, \u201cConsolidating Democracy: Scorecard, Impact and the Road Ahead\u201d.\n\nThose expected at the conference include President Buhari; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawn; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; Chairman and Members of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), and governors, among others.\n\nAbari stressed that the overall objective of the APC policy conference was to position leaders of thoughts of the party and sector experts to deliberate on the current and future policy direction of the party. He said it would also provide a reform agenda, which the party would drive over the next phase of its administration, building on the current achievements, including the outcomes for state and local governments.\n\nAbari said, \u201cIt will seek to address various segments around governance, economy and social environment with the aim to rekindle investors\u2019 confidence in the Nigerian economy.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to attend, monitor or supervise tomorrow\u2019s national convention of the APC, saying it is a jamboree being organised by the ruling party. PDP forewarned that INEC would be going outside its statutory mandate under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as emended) and the Electoral Act 2022 by attending or monitoring the APC national convention.\n\nIn a statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Debo Ologunagba, the party said INEC, being a government agency set up by law, that also drew from the budgetary allocation of the country with respect to superintending electoral processes and management of political parties, could only superintend over and monitor bodies it had the mandate to supervise.\n\nAccording to PDP, \u201cThe APC, having been defunct on December 8, 2020, when it dissolved its national, states as well as local government structures, ceases, in the eyes of the law, to be a political party and as such, cannot be subject of INEC\u2019s regulations with particular reference to its supposed national convention.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) was established for the singular purpose of organising the APC National Convention in 2020. The committee violated the constitution and the Electoral Act by engaging in party administration, conducting congresses to produce officers at the various state chapters as well as delegates for APC national convention.\n\n\u201cIn any event, the CECPC by its composition with a state governor, H.E Mai Mala Buni, as chairman is illegal and unconstitutional by reason of Section 183 of the Nigerian Constitution, which bars a sitting governor from holding \u201cany other executive office in any capacity whatsoever.\u201d\n\nThe opposition party added, \u201cArticle 14 (i) of the APC Constitution, clearly states that the Chairman of the APC \u2018shall be the Chief Executive\u2026\u2019 of the party. In going beyond its mandate, the CECPC acted ultra vires and all administrative acts purportedly done or deemed to have been done by this committee are null and void and void ab-initio.\n\n\u201cTo this effect, delegates to the APC purported national convention produced by congresses conducted by the CECPC are at best handicapped delegates with leprous fingers, who cannot deliver any vote to produce a valid and legal political leadership for the APC. INEC should, therefore, not waste public resources to monitor a jamboree that would be of no legal or electoral effect under our laws.\u201d\n\nPDP noted that if APC had listened to one its members, Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, SAN, who had cautioned that the \u201ccompetence of Governor Mai Mala Buni to organise the congresses has been called to question by the Supreme Court\u201d, it would not have been in this quagmire, adding, \u201cOur Party for the umpteenth time cautions Nigerians, who intend to participate in the electoral process under the APC to be guided as they are on a voyage that leads to nowhere.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

An offensive that Western countries believe was aimed at swiftly toppling President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s government has been halted at the gates of Kyiv.\n\nBattlelines there have been frozen for weeks with Russian columns threatening Kyiv from the northwest and the east. But in an intelligence update on Friday, Britain described a Ukrainian counter-offensive that had pushed the Russians far back.\n\n\u201cUkrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, has allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 km east of Kyiv,\u201d the update said.\n\nIt said Ukrainian forces were also likely to try to push the Russians back on the other main axis threatening Kyiv from the northwest, while in the south Russia could still be planning to attack the port of Odesa after abandoning efforts to take Mykolaiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said its troops were repelling Russian forces trying to fight their way into Kyiv. Troops were also still holding on to the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, hindering a Russian advance in the direction of the capital.\n\nMoscow calls its actions in Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm its neighbour. Kyiv and its Western allies call it an unprovoked war of agression and say Russia\u2019s true aim was to overthrow the government of what President Vladimir Putin regards as an illegitimate state.\n\nUnable to capture Ukrainian cities, Russia has resorted to pounding them with artillery and air strikes. The eastern port of Mariupol has been under siege since the war\u2019s early days. Tens of thousands of people are still believed to be trapped inside with no access to food, medicine, power or heat.\n\nIn a part of the city now captured by the Russians, one woman waiting in line to receive food supplies told Reuters her diabetic husband had slipped into a coma and died. He was buried in a flowerbed.\n\n\u201cWe are planning on leaving but it\u2019s very difficult at the moment,\u201d the woman, who gave her name as Alexandra, said. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my husband in a flowerbed \u2026 And then we have nowhere to go.\u201d\n\nAfter attending an emergency summit of NATO and the G7, Biden will visit Poland, which has taken in more than half of Ukraine\u2019s refugees.\n\nThe West has ruled out intervening on the ground or answering Ukraine\u2019s plea for a no-fly zone, but has supported Kyiv with hundreds of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that have blasted Russian armoured columns and prevented Moscow from taking control of the air.\n\nA senior U.S. administration official said Washington and its allies were also working on providing anti-ship weapons to protect Ukraine\u2019s coast.
