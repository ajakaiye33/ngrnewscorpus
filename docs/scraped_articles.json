          "text": ".\n\n\u2022Say Mr. President should act before cabal finally wreaks agency\n\n\u2022Demand inauguration of governing board approved by Senate since 2019\n\nBy Emma Amaize, Regional Editor, South-South, Sam Oyadongha, Jimitota Onoyume, Festus Ahon and Egufe Yafugborhi\n\nA cross-section of Niger-Deltans saddened by the goings-on at the Niger-Delta Development Commission, NDDC, weekend, notified President Muhammadu Buhari that a powerful cabal in Abuja connected to the Presidency was still holding the interventionist agency by the balls, despite the resignation of Senator Godswill Akpabio as Minister of Niger-Delta Affairs.\n\nFrom Edo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, and Cross-River to Akwa Ibom states, the stakeholders called Buhari to stop the desperate cabal before it succeeds in its mission of ruining the agency and without much ado, hearken to the cry of the people to inaugurate the governing board of NDDC, screened and approved since 2019 by the Senate.\n\nThey explained the cabal has been undermining the oil region and suggested to President Buhari what should be done to give a kiss of life to the rudderless organization.\n\nCartel behind interim administration \u2014 Ekiye\n\nPublisher of Environment Watch, Elder Braeyi Ekiye, told Saturday Vanguard: \u201cThe ingenious contrivance to get the NDDC administered through the interim administration was a calculated attempt to advance the cause of power brokers in Abuja, whose main interest, together with their collaborators, is to rip the commission clean and dry of its financial allocations, so much so that, it has unfortunately stultified the region\u2019s rapid socio-economic and infrastructural transformation.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt is our ardent hope that the on-going despicable \u2018dance of the devil\u2019 in the NDDC in wild celebration of the Forensic Audit Report put away in the coolers would stop forthwith, with the unceremonious departure of Senator Godswill Akpabio, lord of the estate of the Commission.\n\n\u201cAs long as this masquerade dance lasts, the dark clouds of the dance shall continue to provide cover for the task masters and their comrades-in- arm to scoop remnants of fast depleting financial resources of the interventionist agency.\u201d\n\nClique remains in charge \u2014 Omare\n\nFormer national president, Ijaw Youth Council, IYC, Barrister Eric Omare, who raved on Akpabio, said: \u201cWe Niger Deltans based on verifiable facts strongly believed that Akpabio was responsible for the mismanagement of NDDC in the past three years. Now that he is out of the way, we expect President Buhari to immediately publish the outcome of the forensic audit, bring those who have embezzled.\u201d\n\n\u201cNDDC resources to book and as a matter of importance, inaugurate the board of the NDDC in line with its establishment Act. However, I doubt if this would done because the cabal members who have been with Akpabio I do not think are out of government. They may still be in the corridors of power and continue with the NDDC\u201d, he said.\n\nNo lawyer to give good advice \u2014 Wills\n\nPresident Ijaw Professionals Association (Homeland Chapter), which comprises Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers, Iniruo Wills, asserted: \u201cThe president and presidency cabal obviously do not give a hoot whether there is NDDC or it has lawful management or not. The Niger Delta will remember this president as the one who set a notorious record of allowing NDDC to be under a series of illegal managements for four and a half years, which is more than the full four-year term prescribed even for a legitimate Governing Board by the enabling law.\u201d\n\n\u201dObviously, the president does not have any lawyer around that can give him conscionable advice on the matter, so if he likes let him appoint a Pakistani as the next NDDC sole administrator. We are tired of complaining about this unprecedented executive callousness. At worst, in another one year we can say good riddance\u201d, he added.\n\nPresident breaking the law \u2014 Gbemre\n\nBut social justice advocate, Zik Gbemre, stated: \u201cLet us stop mocking or deceiving ourselves. Akpabio never meant well, but then he was not the real problem. Long before Akpabio was rewarded to have his turn, NDDC has been a cash cow and patronage agency through which a serving president lines the private pockets of political loyalists who live largely and go on to use a chunk of the sudden wealth to gamble on elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo President Buhari who sustained an NDDC that shares the commonwealth among a few to the neglect and anger of the larger Niger Delta, with impunity is the problem with the commission. For mutual benefits, Akpabio was being used by Buhari to prevent the board from being functional. Akpabio was not elected but appointed by Buhari.\n\n\u201cIt is trite to suggest that Akpabio acted on his own in being an obstacle to the NASS cleared NDDC board members. Buhari deliberately directed his appointee not to recognize the board. Akpabio had no power to stop the swearing in of NDDC board that was duly screened and approved by the Senate.\n\n\u201cWith Akpabio forced out by his vaulting ambition, he does not have to do the Niger Delta any special favour, the president has been brazenly breaking the NDDC law? All he needs do is to stop the defiance of the law. The NDDC Act has no place for interim, caretaker board and worst of all, sole administrator.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re skeptical \u2013 Robinson, PANDEF\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, Pan Niger Delta Forum, PANDEF, Hon. Ken Robinson, told one of our reporters: \u201cWe do not suppose that Akpabio was the main problem of NDDC. The primary problem is the callous indifference of the Buhari presidency to issues of the Niger Delta region. Under the supervision of Senator Godswill Akpabio as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, NDDC was attenuated to a political porch with all manner of deplorable theatrics.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs in itself was virtually reduced to a bureau of NDDC, but Mr. President watched on like an uninterested spectator. We, therefore, do not expect any reasonable changes in the administration of the NDDC under this presidency despite the said resignation of Godswil Akpabio; let them prove us wrong.\u201d\n\nLet governing board function \u2013 Okaba, Uti, Mudiaga-Odge, others\n\nPresident, Ijaw National Congress, INC, Prof Benjamin Okaba, informed Buhari: \u201cSet up /inaugurate the governing board according to the laws establishing the NDDC without further delay. Provide the needful to enable the new board function maximally.\u201d\n\nFor Chairman, Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Warri branch, Chief Emmanuel Uti: \u201cI do not subscribe to the notion that it was Senator Akpabio that frustrated the NDDC board. My opinion is that, it is President Buhari that was not keen on the existence of the board. My take is that Senator Akpabio out or not, it all depends on the President\u2019s disposition.\u201d\n\nConstitutional lawyer, Dr. Akpor Mudiaga-Odje, intoned: With or without Akpabio, what we, the pauperized people of the Niger Delta, earnestly yearn for is inauguration without any further delay, the board as duly cleared by the Senate in 2019, almost three years ago.\n\nChairman, Centre for Environmental Preservation and Development, CEPAD, Surv. Furoebi Akene, told Saturday Vanguard: \u201cTo start with, subjecting the supervision/overseeing of the NDDC to the Minister (Ministry) of Niger Delta Affairs is illegal and is a misnomer against the provisions of the NDDC establishment Act of 2000. The Act put the NDDC under the supervision by the presidency.\u201d\n\nSpokesman, Niger Delta Rights Advocates and All Progressives Congress chieftain in Rivers, Darlington Nwauju, said: \u201cAnd as the appointer, President Buhari should immediately appoint substantive Ministers to that Ministry with a matching order to inaugurate a substantive board for the NDDC, publish the report of the forensic audit on NDDC and lastly, deliver on the East-West Road project.\u201d\n\nSet up board \u2014 Egba-Ologo\n\nEntrepreneur and media consultant, Chief Nathan Egba-Ologo, opined: \u201cIn as much as one cannot really say what exactly is causing the delay in the inauguration of a substantive NDDC board, Niger Deltans would really love for Mr. President to constitute the board as soon as possible in order to enable the NDDC function properly as it should. At the moment, it seems like a rudderless organization that is drifting aimlessly.\u201d\n\nOur prayer \u2014 Alaowei, CHURAC\n\nChairman Board of Trustees, Centre for Human Rights and Anti-Corruption Crusade, CHURAC, Cleric Ebikonbowei Alaowei, Esq., said: \u201cWe pray that nothing should bring Akpabio back to that office again. Buhari should also immediately inaugurate the NDDC board if he means well for the development of the Niger Delta region. Mr. President should take immediate steps to investigate the commission for the periods Sen. Akpabio held it sway\u201d.",

          "text": "Just like the proverbial hunter becoming the bushmeat, the country\u2019s Accountant-General, Ahmed Idris, was arrested during the week over alleged money laundering and diversion of public funds.\n\nSome of the many duties of the Accountant-General is to detect and deter corruption through a timely audit, and to also carry out external audit functions and scrutiny of public funds, but unfortunately, Idris allegedly failed to uphold these duties.\n\nOn different occasions, he got summoned by the House of Representatives for carrying out some activities \u2018without due process.\u2019\n\nHe got caught by the long arm of the law during the week; Idris was intercepted in Kano and was subsequently flown to Abuja.\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) in a statement explained that Idris allegedly diverted and laundered N80billion \u2013 about N78 billion more than convicted former pension boss, Abdulrasheed Maina diverted from the pension fund.\n\nUwujaren disclosed that Idris laundered the money through real estate investments in Kano and Abuja. At least 17 properties were traced to Idris. Uwujaren explained that Idris was arrested after he failed to honour invitations by the EFCC to respond to issues connected to the fraudulent acts.\n\nAll of the preliminary investigations showed that the country\u2019s chief accountant allegedly used proxies to buy some of these properties.\n\nWith all of these controversial allegations, Idris has since been suspended by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed.\n\nIn a letter dated May 18, 2022, the minister said the suspension \u201cwithout pay\u201d was to allow for \u201cproper and unhindered investigation\u201d in line with public service rules.\n\n\u201cFollowing your recent arrest by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on allegations of diversion of funds and money laundering, I write to convey your suspension from work without pay effective 18th May 2022,\u201d the letter read in part.\n\nThe suspension, Finance Minister said, is in line with Public Service Rules to give room for proper and unhindered investigation.\n\nThe letter, titled, \u2018Letter of Suspension\u2019, also bars Idris from visiting his office or contacting any official in his office during his suspension except for disciplinary proceedings that might be initiated against him.\n\nPrior to his appointment as Accountant-General, Idris had served as Director of Finance and Accounts at the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) headquarters, Abuja. His rich profile shows he is a chartered accountant with over two decades of working experience.\n\nHe joined the public service as Assistant Director Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) in charge of Financial Analysis in 2000. He was at the National Poverty Eradication Programme(NAPEP), Ministry of Police Affairs and Ministry of Interior as Assistant Director Finance. He was Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Interior and Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) before his promotion as Director Accounts in OAGF in 2011.\n\nIdris, born on November 25, 1960, is a 1984 BSc Accounting graduate of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria, Idris obtained Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from Bayero University Kano and Master of International Affairs and Diplomacy (MIAD) from ABU Zaria.\n\nHe was specifically first appointed on June 25, 2015, as the country\u2019s Accountant-General. He was re-appointed on June 25, 2019.\n\nIdris is a Fellow of the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria and Fellow, the Association of Financial Analysts of Nigeria, he is Member of other professional bodies including the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria, Certified Institute of Cost Management of Nigeria, and Association of Certified Fraud Examiners.\n\nDespite all of these enviable antecedents, it is quite ironic that Idris fell for the temptations attached to his office, and now he is left with a stained record.",

          "text": "Eminent businessman and All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential aspirant, Tein Jack-Rich, has said his motivation to govern Nigeria in 2023 is to emancipate the country from its current economic doldrums.\n\nIn this interview with AIDOGHIE PAULINUS in Abuja, Jack-Rich said the country needs a navigator, someone with the cutting edge knowhow, a developing agent who understands the mechanics and the microeconomic dialectics to deal with the core issues of the country and establish footprints that can grow the economy so that anyone can come on board.\n\nAmongst other issues, Jack-Rich said if elected president in 2023, he will banish the nagging issues of youth unemployment, poverty, and social unrest, among others.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nWhat is the motivation behind your quest to become president of Nigeria in 2023?\n\nThe point is that you have to be a patriotic citizen of your country. With the current trend of things going on in the world, if you look at the global economy right now, you\u2019ll realise that Europe is struggling and it is likely to get worse by 2023. You look at the challenges in Eastern Europe where you have Ukraine and Russia fighting, and just a few days ago, we also saw that Finland and Sweden wanted to join NATO. It means that the global supply chain will be disrupted the more \u2013 market will struggle. In the Asian block, you see China also struggling with COVID; in the United States, it is struggling with inflation and these are countries that we all run to for help. The global economy is standing at about $82 trillion; continental Africa is about three percent of that, which is less than $2.5 trillion. Nigeria is about 19.8 percent of continental Africa\u2019s GDP. The GDP that we currently have does not really mean cash at hand. Well, that is the size of our economy. It means that in 2023, with all the turbulences that the world is experiencing, it is going to be worse. So, you need the political leadership that understands the dialectics of microeconomic fundamentals to put in place the right economic policies and then, back it up with the right legislation to create jobs for our youths.\n\nUnemployment is a major challenge. That will enable us to then secure a peace pact in our respective communities and states as unemployment has ravaged our communities and states as we speak right now. So, you need a strong, smart, energetic, and fresh leader with the right knowhow and how to turn that knowhow into fiscal value for the country to grow. And I have seen myself as one who has been able to develop these qualities to be able to give back. I have been in business for 24 years now, doing good around, helping communities in states and all that, providing potable water, building hospitals; some, constructing roads so that we can connect markets; awarding scholarships and really feeling the vibes of those communities. So, the bubble right now is about a do-not scenario in 2023 is going to be catastrophic. Oil and gas is dwindling. You saw the report that JPMorgan just put out, deleting Nigeria from the list of emerging economies. These are challenges that social unrest is creating for us. Even with the oil windfall, we were not able to produce a lot to deal with our needs, while we are still struggling with subsidies and all that. So, my interest for the 2023 presidency is for the heart of this country to be saved, to be protected so that I can give back my knowhow to my great country, Nigeria.\n\nBreaking!!!

I am also engaging governors, engaging stakeholders, party members and all that and I believe strongly that with the message that I have, when they listen to the message, the partnership to support my candidature will be something that they will all buy into.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nIn the race, we have Bola Tinubu, Vice President Osinbajo, and Rotimi Amaechi, among others. How do you hope to galvanise party members to ensure that you clinch the ticket from them?\n\nParty members are like you and I. They all represent their respective interests \u2013 economic interest, political interest and social interest. My message is key \u2013 the economic emancipation of the people. My message is key \u2013 to create jobs so that unemployment will be a thing of the past. To help develop the party in such a manner that it becomes the strongest, the most innovative and rich party. So, my message to my party members is all about the newness I am bringing to the table. Yes, the names you mentioned have been there, they are fathers, they are highly respected, but I am a producer, I am not a consumer. I produce what a lot of these guys consume and spend. What brought them to where they are is all about consuming what someone has produced. So, I am a producer of the critical asset that this country must depend on. So, you need a president that can enable oil production to mitigate the shortfall in our foreign exchange earnings and using it as a catalyst to industrialise this economy. I am a development agent, so I understand the engines of economic growth and that is the type of leadership that we need and not names. We need leadership that has the audacity and capacity to take risk in what he or she believes in and to deliver goods for the best of the economy and the country.\n\nThere is the issue of North-South dichotomy and the South-East is saying it hasn\u2019t taken a shot at the presidency and that it should be given to them. Are you confident that a southerner will clinch the 2023 presidency, particularly you?\n\nMy interest for 2023 is not about South-South, South-East or South-West. It is about the heart of this country. This country will be bleeding real hard by 2023. You need the right political leadership to deliver the best for this country. You need freedom of the press; you need our creative industry to be accessed to getting the best from their creative work. We have a lot of piracy and all that. So, there is a lot to be done for this economy.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThere is a lot to be done for all the sectors and the collaboration that I am bringing on board as a private sector player is the engine that will develop this economy to a point where it goes on a cruising altitude. When the economy is cruising, then you can bring any man to come on board. But right now, the economy requires someone with the cutting edge knowhow, someone who is a developer, a developing agent, who understands the mechanics and the microeconomic dialectics, to deal with the core issues and establish footprints that can grow economy so that anyone can come on board. You can ask a child of ten years to pilot a ship, but that child does not have the ingredients and the knowhow to navigate the ship. So, right now, we need a navigator.\n\nWhy do you think we are where we are as a nation? Why have we not been able to get it right till now?\n\nI don\u2019t want to talk about why we are where we are. All I want to talk about is that 2023, we have a challenge that you need the right knowhow to deliver the best and I think that overtime, our forebears have tried in working so hard to deliver their promises. But the most important thing is that there have been several challenges and all that. But 2023 is key for us to reset this economy. And to do that, you need someone with the right knowhow, with a cutting edge, an intellectual prowess, someone who has been a risk-taker; someone who is a development agent, somebody who understands the microeconomic dialectics that needs to be established and to enable us to have an economy to deliver what this country really needs. We need a knowhow-based leadership, a leadership that can take risk in what it believes in. We need a leadership that will enable our currency have the right value because the fiscal policy enablers have strengthened the core engines that drive profitable economic growth, using the private sector as the key engine.\n\nThere is no way you can reset the Nigerian economy without putting in place, proper security architecture. What is your plan in that direction?\n\nYou talk about security architecture and we talk about providing jobs for the youths. I mean, the youths are hungry, the youths are angry. We have a surge in population, a population that by 2023 will be about 222 million. And the dependency rate is so high. We have over 78 per cent of the population as dependants. So, you need a leadership that can put in place, the right economic policy to utilise a lot of our youths who are hanging out there doing nothing. Train them through the value chain, get the right education for them, and then, as soon as they come out, they are into the market, creating value. Not only that, we need a leadership that can convert a lot of the informal sector value into the formal sector market. And to do that, there are certain incentives that we need to provide so that the government can earn more money. Over 60 per cent of the market opportunities that have been inflated, the government can\u2019t even say anything, can\u2019t realise any value from it. The government is not earning from it. So, our strategy is to go smart. With a smart industrialisation, a model which is borne by the Jack-Rich Industries-360, we will be able to curb a lot of these excesses and all these waste and put them into the basket so we can have a lot more to enable local community wellness and to grow economy and maintain social wellness.\n\nIt is believed nationally and internationally that one of the reasons why we are backward as a nation is as a result of corrupt tendencies in governance? How do you hope to tackle corruption?\n\nThat is where technology comes in. Right now, technology has advanced. We have artificial intelligence and all that. Public and private sector partnership is key and the public sector development is also important \u2013 -developing the public sector with the right knowhow, with the right training. Reforms will be done so that they will be through modern technologies so that you don\u2019t have to submit a document and somebody will pick that file and start going from desk to desk for approval. That is where corruption sets in. So, avoiding one-on-one handling also will reduce corruption. But the most important thing is reconstructing the economy with a lot of job opportunities so that a lot of these redundant youths who will find themselves in public service will not be thinking about how do I maximise wealth for myself rather than maximising wealth for state? So, technology is going to be one of the key engines, but to do that, we need to set up a centre of excellence \u2013 smart cities where they can go and be trained. A lot of our universities will also be enabled to have different schools so that they can have vocational training centres where they can acquire these basic skills and knowledge that is needed to deliver the best that the local community or society really needs.\n\nHow do you hope to repair the battered image of Nigeria?\n\nYou know I am a private sector player. I play in the bigly strategic national economy. So, when a private sector player who understands the mechanics of public and global enterprise, how it works \u2013 the ethics, the standards, the procedure, the requirement, the operationality, the trade,he does and then, they use that to judge you. But again, my story is there. My antecedent is known. Our interest is our country and also to create that inclusion and in collaboration within the private and public sector. Not only that, foreign investors will have that security to put in that money in Nigeria and then, to grow the amount of wealth that they need so that they can make profit and the country too can earn from it.\n\nThe party on whose platform you are contesting for the presidency in 2023, the APC, a lot of Nigerians believe it has not fulfilled the promises it made to them in 2015 and 2019. What is your take on that?\n\nYou need to understand why I pretty much love the party. It is called APC. Do you know what APC means? All Progressives Congress. I am a progressive and the party is for the youths, young people like me, to showcase your interest, to come out with innovation. Whatever may have happened before, it is a party with varied interest and different people with different political ideologies. Sometimes, you have that mix up. They will come with different stuffs. But I am coming in with newness and for me, the best party to showcase my contents is APC because it is for the progressives. And we will come in and change the tide and change the narrative and then work by the principles that guide the progressives. And I believe it is for young guys like you too. Perhaps, you are going to join us when I become the president.",

          "text": "Former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has warned the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) against towing the same path that eroded the All Progressives Congress (APC) victory in governorship, National Assembly and other victories in the 2019 general election.\n\nIt is recalled that Supreme Court\u2019s five-member panel of Justices, had in a unanimous judgment in May 2019, voided all votes cast for the APC and consequently sacked the party\u2019s candidates, who were declared winners in the February 23 and March 16, 2019 general election in the state by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), ruling that the party had no candidates in the elections, having failed to conduct primaries in accordance with its own rules and as required by law.\n\nBut speaking through his governorship campaign organisation at the weekend, Ekweremadu advised the PDP to be careful so as not to make the same mistake.\n\nHe spoke vide a statement by the Director-General of the Ikeoha Campaign Organisation, Hon. Charles Ogbo Asogwa, giving update on the legal tussle surrounding the three-man delegates election in the Enugu State chapter of the PDP.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cWe wish to inform our teeming supporters that the lawsuit concerning the three-man ad-hoc delegates came up today, Friday, May 20, 2022 at the Federal High Court, Abuja. Arguments were taken and the matter was adjourned to May 27, 2022 for judgment. We await the outcome and intend to pursue the matter to a logical conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, it is noteworthy that the President is yet to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill that will allow the participation of statutory delegates in the congresses and national conventions of all the political parties. This has further complicated the process for the primaries, as every political party is trying to find a way out of the quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn the case of our party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the decision of the National Working Committee (NWC) to use only the three-man ad-hoc delegates for the state congresses/primary elections and only the 774 national delegates for the national convention and presidential primary election readily offends the provisions of the PDP Constitution (as amended in 2017), especially as it concerns quorums.\n\n\u201cArticle 25 of the PDP Constitution provides that quorum for a State Congress shall be two-thirds of the members of the State Congress, while Part 10 Article 6 provides that the quorum for a National Convention shall be two-thirds of the members of the Convention.\n\n\u201cThree-man ad-hoc delegates for the State Convention and 774 national delegates for the National Convention fall far short of the quorum stipulated in the PDP Constitution. In the case of Enugu State, well over 2,500 delegates constitute the State Congress, while the ad-hoc delegates are only 780. This is way below the two-thirds stipulated by the PDP Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstance, therefore, we advise the leadership of the PDP to be mindful of the constitutional and legal landmines posed by its decision and their far-reaching implications in order to avoid the Zamfara scenario on the entire candidature and structure of our party across board and throughout the country. Prudence is advised\u201d.\n\nSources said that although some informed minds at the meeting between the PDP NWC and Governors where the decision to use only ad-hoc delegates for the PDP State congresses and national conventions had warned against the possible catastrophe it could bring upon the party, the PDP governors insisted on it since it conferred an advantage on them, being the ones that compiled the three-man delegates in all the states.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

For PDP, it will be the three delegates elected from each ward.\n\n\n\nSo, statutory delegates, including elected councillors, local government chairmen and their deputies, party chairmen in local government areas, state and federal lawmakers (current and former), governors and their deputies, President and Vice- President, National Working Committee members, state party chairmen and secretaries, are no longer voters at the primaries.\n\n\n\nThe largesse they had been enjoying from all the aspirants at various levels seeking their votes \u2013 presidential, governorship, Senate, House of Representatives and states\u2019 House of Assembly \u2013 has come to an end.\n\nMany are struggling to face the reality and hoping that the President will still sign the amendment by next Monday.\n\n\n\nBut analysts countered this, saying, \u201cWith the seven-day INEC rule for parties to submit their list of delegates before primary elections, new election amendment is now out of time, even if it gets presidential endorsement.\u201d\n\nA source told THISDAY last night that the APC had already submitted its list of elected delegates to INEC, while the PDP had partially complied, to beat the seven-day deadline.\n\n\n\nThe PDP has scheduled its presidential primary for May 28 and 29, while the APC will elect its presidential candidate on May 28 and 29.\n\nAs things stand, the APC will elect its presidential flagbearer with 2322 democratically elected delegates, based on three National delegates per local government area.\n\n\n\nThe PDP will elect its presidential flagbearer with 810 delegates based on one National delegate per local government area and one each per state to cover the physically challenged.\n\n\n\nPower to determine those that will emerge as candidates for various elective positions has now returned to the state governors; already, they determined those on the list of elected delegates sent to INEC.\n\nSo, the state governors are back in business.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*No signal there\u2019ll be free, fair elections in 2023, PDP alerts EU\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF) has condemned in strong terms the decision by the two main political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to jettison \u201cthe time-honored principle of rotation,\u201d ahead of their presidential primaries, \u201cwhich has traditionally served as the glue holding Nigeria together.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the same day, the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyochia Ayu yesterday told a visiting delegation of the European Union (EU) that his party was not getting very encouraging signals that there would be free and fair elections in the country next year.\n\n\n\nThe SMBLF in a communiqu\u00e9, issued yesterday at the end of its meeting in Abuja, signed by its Chairman, Chief Edwin Clark; Leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; President-General, Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus; President-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor; and National Chairman, Pan-Niger Delta Forum, Senator Emmanuel Essien, warned that the reported permutations by the two parties to foist Northern presidential candidates on the nation would be a grave misadventure, with grim consequences on national concord and harmony.\n\n\n\nIt reiterated its stance on the principle of zoning and power rotation between the North and the South, as the basis on which the Nigerian Federation has, since Independence, been premised, stressing that they are fundamental to the future existence of the country.\n\n\n\nSMBLF therefore called on all delegates of all political parties to reject Presidential aspirants, or candidates, from the North, and only vote for those from the South in the party primaries.\n\nThe Forum also called on all politicians and professionals from the South not to accept, on any account, the position of Vice President, as that would amount to a shameful committal of present and future generations of Southern Nigeria to senseless political vassalage.\n\n\n\nThe leaders, while commending a number of northern governors such as Malam Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State, Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State, Babagana Umara Zulum of Borno State, and Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State, who have demonstrated great patriotism by their public support for the rotation of the presidency to the South, urged other northern leaders, who believe in the oneness of Nigeria, to support this cause, because therein lies the unity and progress of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nOn the worsening state of insecurity and rampaging violence across the country, the Forum warned that Nigeria was plummeting into a state of total disorder and lawlessness, with attacks on innocent people resulting in kidnapping, loss of lives and destruction of properties happening in different parts of the country almost daily.\n\nThe Forum condemned in unmistakable terms, the killing of Miss Deborah Samuel Yakubu, a student of the College of Education, Sokoto, by her Muslim schoolmates and the wide spread violence that engulfed the state, following the arrest of two of her killers.\n\n\n\nAccording to the leaders: \u201cSadly, the federal government and its security agencies are not doing enough to arrest the situation, whereby people can no longer travel safely either by road, rail or even by air to Kaduna State in particular. It is not only frightening but unimaginable that despite the heavy presence of military commands and installations in the State there could be such security challenges.\u201d\n\nThe SMBLF cited the bombing of the Kaduna-Abuja bound train over 60 days ago, as well as the brazen attack on motorists on the Abuja-Kaduna Road about two days ago, saying, \u201con both occasions, innocent lives were lost while several people were wounded with many abducted. Undesirably, most of those who were kidnapped are still in the terrorists\u2019 captivity after 60 days.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt said it classified these killings as pervasive acts of aggression on the indigenous people, \u201cbeing perpetrated by elements of Islamic extremism and terrorists, as cultural genocide and ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nThe SMBLF continued: \u201cThe Meeting cautions that these bellicosities and deliberate programme to exterminate the indigenous populations of the Middle Belt are, by implication, acts of aggression against the rest of Nigeria, and would not be tolerated any further. The Meeting resolved to resist, through all legitimate means, the barefaced attempts by religious fundamentalists to impose on the rest of us, a Nigeria of \u201cone country, different laws.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo Signal There\u2019ll Be Free, Fair Elections in 2023, PDP Alerts EU\n\nAyu yesterday told a visiting delegation of the European Union (EU) that his party was not getting very encouraging signals that there would be free and fair elections in the country next year.\n\nAyu, who spoke when the EU delegation, led by Samuela Isopi, visited the party as part of its mission on the Nigerian 2023 general election, said \u201cinsecurity is at its peak in Nigeria and extending beyond the rural areas and even coming to the urban centers.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP Chairman drew the attention of the EU and other members of the international community to the fact that Nigerians want free and fair elections in the country, adding, \u201cThe signals that we\u2019re getting are not very encouraging.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyu told the EU delegation: \u201cAs a political party, we want to appreciate the European Union for their various contributions to Nigeria, whether economically or politically. There are also important cultural exchanges that are vital to our country; we want to appreciate the European Union for that.\n\n\u201cI would say that I also want to appreciate the interest in the growth of democracy in Nigeria, for the last 24 years that this political party came on board and helped to stabilise democracy in Nigeria, the European Union has actually been a very worthy partner.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always given support, they\u2019ve shown interest, and we hope this will continue, because we don\u2019t want to return to the dark days of dictatorship. We hope that the European Union, as our friends in the international community, will continue to support genuine democratic processes and institutions, because no country lives as an isolated entity in the world. And therefore we think that the European Union and other friends of Nigeria have an important role to play.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the ongoing registration of voters, he told the EU team that the PDP was not getting a favourable technical report because the regulatory body (INEC) lacked the technical capacity to register more voters in the ongoing registrations exercise.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ayu, \u201cIt is not just the mobilisation by the political parties, but it is also the technical capacity of INEC to go out there and register Nigerians because in a population of almost 200 million People, we expect that 40% of the population should be captured on the electoral register and that is not the case.\n\n\u201cI think what we have today is less than 5% and it\u2019s not good enough.\n\n\u201cAnd, therefore, we want to call on INEC and all our friends that can help in that direction to make sure more people are captured on the electoral register.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyu told the European Union delegation that by the end of this month, Nigerians would be in position to know the next president of the country, boasting that the PDP would produce the next president.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe know that in the next eight days, we will know the next president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, because once the delegates in our political party, cast their vote, and the pronouncement is made on who is the candidate of the PDP, we will not be calling him candidate of the PDP, we will be calling him the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, he said the All Progressive Congress (APC) should be willing to accept defeat when the time comes.\n\nAyu said: \u201cWe worry about post elections as a political party. We have demonstrated that democracy is best when you transit smoothly from one electoral cycle to the other. And therefore, we want everybody to appreciate what we did when we lost elections in 2015. We didn\u2019t use agencies of the state to stay in power.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe conceded defeat and when we win, we expect those who are currently in government to concede defeat because they are going to lose the next election. And they shouldn\u2019t hang in there and create an atmosphere of instability in the country. So with the current escalation of violence in the country, we hope, and we pray, that it is not deliberate to extend the tenure of this administration which has failed the country. We hope that when they lose, they also will willingly concede defeat, and hand over power to the Nigerian people.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a political party, we\u2019re having our convention in the next eight days. And in the tradition of this party, we want our convention to be very transparent; we will provide a fair and open view to everybody i.e. our 15 presidential aspirants.\u201d\n\n\n\nAyu also lamented the rising debt of Nigeria, saying when the PDP was in power, Nigeria was a debt-free country.\n\nHe said. \u201cToday, we are the country with the highest debt to GDP in the world, it is in trillions. It is our hope that this will not continue because it has a direct impact on the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cThe lack of employment opportunities, lack of attention to even education, lack of attention to industrialisation, these have worsened the condition of our people, particularly the youth. Therefore, these are areas, as a party, we\u2019re interested in addressing when we come back to power because we believe that Nigerians will vote for the PDP in the next election.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation, Isopi, said the EU had been supporting Nigeria in strengthening its democratic governance through the support of all the stakeholders from INEC to the other actors and players of the process of the society, the media, and the political parties.\n\nShe further stated. \u201cWe have also at the request of the Nigerian authorities always deployed electoral observation, to entrench the process of democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is part of our regular consultations with all the stakeholders, actors and partners, particularly in view of the next elections and I would like to reaffirm our support to Nigeria\u2019s democracy and we continue to work together with all the institutions and stakeholders involved.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He reiterated the need for peace as the necessary foundation for any meaningful development.\u201d\n\n\u2018Deborah: Justice Will be Served\u2019\n\nWhile speaking in Asaba, Delta State yesterday, Tambuwal assured Nigerians that justice will be served in the killing of Deborah.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen shortly after his meeting with PDP delegates in the Unity Hall, Government House Asaba, Tambuwal described the incident as unfortunate because \u201cSokoto is a peaceful place where people live peacefully irrespective of ethnic or religious differences.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor said nobody has right to take laws into their hands, while also debunking the rumour that no attempt was made by security officials to save Deborah from the mob attack.\n\nHe said that personnel of the Department of State Security (DSS) got to the scene early and had rescued the victim to a safe place before the mob overpowered the DSS officials.\n\n\n\nTambuwal said, \u201cThe security agencies, particularly the DSS, were able to get to the school in time and they were actually able to get our sister, Deborah rescued from the hands of the mob initially. As they were mobilising forces from the military barrack and the police command, the mob was growing.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, one of the DSS personnel that really attempted to save her is in hospital receiving treatment because he had a broken head and another one had a broken hand.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, they were actually overpowered. It is not as if she was left alone; there was rescue attempt by the DSS and they were where she was locked for safety but the mob overpowered them.\n\n\u201cIt was not that the security agencies didn\u2019t respond; maybe, they didn\u2019t respond adequately, but there was a response.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSokoto is one state where the state government, which l preside over, pays the school fees and give school materials to every student of Nigeria that is schooling in our public schools without discrimination.\n\n\u201cSo, we don\u2019t discriminate against our brothers who are from other parts of the country and we live peacefully.\n\n\u201cNormalcy has returned to Sokoto and the matter is in court and it is being tried. l can assure you that by the special grace of God, there will be justice in that matter.\u201d\n\nTambuwal: Buhari\u2019s Exclusion of South-East in Govt Fuelling Insecurity\n\nEarlier yesterday, the Sokoto State Governor was in Imo State as part of his campaign for the presidential ticket of the PDP.\n\nWhile addressing the Imo State chapter of the PDP on his presidential aspiration, Tambuwal said the insecurity in the South-east was a result of the exclusion of the people of the zone from the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government.\n\n\n\nThe governor said his presidency, if elected, would quench insecurity in the zone by incorporating a large number of people from the zone into his administration.\n\nAccording to him, the people of the zone feel cheated that Buhari left them out in the scheme of things in his regime.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cBuhari has shortchanged the South-East. I was the one who advised Saraki to choose Ike Enweremadu to become his deputy in 2015. There is a complete case of exclusion of the people of South East. The head of the ten most important parastatals are not from South-East, including the CBN governor.\n\n\n\n\u201cNone of the service chiefs is from the South-east. The president, the vice president, the Senate president, the deputy senate president, the speaker of the House of Representatives and his deputy are not from the South-east. Under my watch that can\u2019t happen. Every part of this country will be carried along.\n\n\n\n\u201cSouth-east and Imo State in particular can\u2019t be excluded. The PDP will win back Imo when I become president. Igbo people are industrial. You will find a partner in me. We are working together with our brothers in Sokoto. We have restored normalcy now in Sokoto State. I will be a president for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\n\nA former Governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, said that Tambuwal was the right person to lead the country after Buhari.\n\nIhedioha said that Tambuwal had the capacity to fix the country and foster religious harmony between Christians and Muslims.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Malami Accused Of Interfering With EFCC\u2019s Probe Of Multi-million-naira Pension Fraud In University Owned By Ex-lawmaker",
          "text": "Sunday Ajibade, a former worker of Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State has accused the management of the institution owned by a former House of Representatives member, Bode Ayorinde, of diverting millions of naira of pension contributions of staff members.\n\n\n\nHe also accused Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Abubakar Malami of allegedly interfering with the investigation of the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC) into the alleged misappropriation of pension funds at the university, urging him to issue a disclaimer to exonerate himself from the grave allegation.\n\nAjibade disclosed this in a letter to Malami titled \u2018Alleged Interference With EFCC Investigation Into Misappropriation Of Pension Funds/Pension Fraud At Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State\u2019.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, one Mr Oladokun Farinre, a Chartered Accountant (ICAN) and the university's bursary from 2008 to 2021 admitted that the institution did not enrol its employees in the nation's uniform contributory pension scheme.\n\n\n\nRather, it operated an unlicensed and unregulated pension scheme tagged \"University Savings Scheme\" where the management diverted the pension contributions of its staff members to.\n\n\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI am a former employee of Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State, where I worked as a lecturer between November 2012 and October 2017. In a letter dated 17 November 2020 written by my Attorney, A. A. Solagbade Esq. of Femi Emmanuel Emodamori & Co. and addressed to the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC), I reported the incident of misappropriation of pension funds and pension fraud at the University.\n\n\u201cI have annexed the acknowledged copy of that letter, for ease of reference. One Oshili Moses later invited me to the Commission\u2019s Ilorin Zonal Command to adopt the petition, so I visited the Zonal Command on 11 January 2021 for that purpose, following which the Commission invited the University officials. The University rebuffed the invitation, so operatives from the Zonal Command visited the University and arrested the Registrar and one other officer.\n\n\n\n\u201cI visited Ilorin again on 26 February 2021 and gave a supplementary statement in the presence of another officer named Ayo Bashir. During my third visit on 30 March 2021, I discussed with the Zonal Head, one Mr. Kazeem Oseni, and presented him with documentary evidence of my allegations, following which Mr. Oshili Moses stated that he would invite me in three weeks to provide additional information. This invitation did not materialize so I contacted Mr. Oshili, and he stated that the Headquarters office had recalled the case file, and would contact me.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Oshili\u2019s report staggered my imagination, and I began suspecting that the University officials, particularly Hon. Bode Ayorinde (PhD) (the University Pro-Chancellor, who is a politician and former member of the House of Representatives), were pulling strings behind the scenes to scupper further investigation into the University\u2019s illegal practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the EFCC never contacted me or my Attorney, and stonewalled all my attempts to follow up on the investigation. My suspicion was later justified when my Attorney received a motion on notice seeking leave to appeal the judgement of 28 September 2020 by the National Industrial Court, Akure Judicial Division, in Suit NICN/AK/23/2018: Sunday Adediran Ajibade vs Achievers Educational Investment Ltd & 2 Ors. In paragraphs 4(f) and (h) of the supporting affidavit deposed to by Toyin Bamifere, she averred amongst other things as follows:\n\n\u201c4(f) That by the time the University resumed early this year 2021, the Respondent through his counsel had already petitioned EFCC Ilorin Zone to harass, intimidate, arrest and detained the officers of the Applicants for days.\n\n\n\n\u201c(h) That it took the intervention of the Attorney General and Minister for Justice and Chairman EFCC before these officers detained were released and the EFCC stopped destructing the activities of the school.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have annexed a certified true copy of the motion on notice filed on 19 November 2021, the supporting affidavit and other accompanying processes. The import of Mrs. Bamifere\u2019s shocking revelation is that the Chief Legal Officer of the Federation interfered with and/or meddled in the EFCC\u2019s ongoing pension fraud investigation. Her depositions certainly cast a dark cloud over the investigative efforts of law enforcement agencies and further erode confidence in our criminal justice system. In addition, they nourish the narrative that highly connected individuals can leverage their influence to insulate their illegal activities from scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the record, Achievers University operates an unlicensed pension scheme tagged \u201cUniversity Savings Scheme\u201d, which it uses as a piggy bank to siphon hundreds of millions of Naira in employees\u2019 pension funds, in simulated compliance with the Pension (Reformed) Act, 2014.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the University is not even registered with the Pension Commission (PenCom), does not have an employer code, and is not registered under the mandatory contributory pension scheme, contrary to the Act. The University has thereby denied the national Pension Funds the legitimate access to pooling and investing pension contributions of the staff of the University and jeopardized my social security and that of other employees.\n\n\u201cMr. Oladokun Farinre (Chartered Accountant and University Bursar from 2008-2021) admitted these facts during his testimony as the University\u2019s sole witness in Suit NICN/AK/23/2018, which the Court reproduced in its judgement of 28 September 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Court equally found in Suit No. NICN/AK/25/2017: Olayiwola Akanji Popoola vs Achievers University, Owo, that these same admissions by Mr. Farinre were proof of the University\u2019s breach of the Pension (Reformed) Act, 2014. Your alleged intervention has now derailed the investigation of these admitted infractions of the law that I reported in my letters to the EFCC and PenCom. Consequently, criminal breach of trust and pension fraud at Achievers University lingers on.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honourable AG would recall that as at 31 December 2021, the Federal Government borrowed N8.77 trillion from Pension Funds to finance budget deficits and infrastructural development programmes. Such funds may become inaccessible, depleted, and threaten the national economy in future if they become subject to diversion and misappropriation by employers like Achievers University.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is therefore clear that the depositions in Mrs. Bamifere\u2019s affidavit are too grievous to be ignored or dismissed by a wave of the hand; for they suggest that the Minister of Justice (a Senior Advocate of Nigeria) is aiding and abetting pension fraud. Thus, it is imperative that the Honourable AGF respond to these claims bordering on gross misconduct, abuse of office and sabotage of a criminal investigation, comprehensively. I fear that silence and/or anything short of a robust response may not bode well, considering the avalanche of similar accusations against your exalted office in recent times.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Ayorinde said he had nothing to say as the matter was already in court.",

          "text": "Sunday Ajibade, a former worker of Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State has accused the management of the institution owned by a former House of Representatives member, Bode Ayorinde, of diverting millions of naira of pension contributions of staff members.\n\n\n\nHe also accused Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Abubakar Malami of allegedly interfering with the investigation of the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC) into the alleged misappropriation of pension funds at the university, urging him to issue a disclaimer to exonerate himself from the grave allegation.\n\nAjibade disclosed this in a letter to Malami titled \u2018Alleged Interference With EFCC Investigation Into Misappropriation Of Pension Funds/Pension Fraud At Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State\u2019.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, one Mr Oladokun Farinre, a Chartered Accountant (ICAN) and the university's bursary from 2008 to 2021 admitted that the institution did not enrol its employees in the nation's uniform contributory pension scheme.\n\n\n\nRather, it operated an unlicensed and unregulated pension scheme tagged \"University Savings Scheme\" where the management diverted the pension contributions of its staff members to.\n\n\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI am a former employee of Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State, where I worked as a lecturer between November 2012 and October 2017. In a letter dated 17 November 2020 written by my Attorney, A. A. Solagbade Esq. of Femi Emmanuel Emodamori & Co. and addressed to the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC), I reported the incident of misappropriation of pension funds and pension fraud at the University.\n\n\u201cI have annexed the acknowledged copy of that letter, for ease of reference. One Oshili Moses later invited me to the Commission\u2019s Ilorin Zonal Command to adopt the petition, so I visited the Zonal Command on 11 January 2021 for that purpose, following which the Commission invited the University officials. The University rebuffed the invitation, so operatives from the Zonal Command visited the University and arrested the Registrar and one other officer.\n\n\n\n\u201cI visited Ilorin again on 26 February 2021 and gave a supplementary statement in the presence of another officer named Ayo Bashir. During my third visit on 30 March 2021, I discussed with the Zonal Head, one Mr. Kazeem Oseni, and presented him with documentary evidence of my allegations, following which Mr. Oshili Moses stated that he would invite me in three weeks to provide additional information. This invitation did not materialize so I contacted Mr. Oshili, and he stated that the Headquarters office had recalled the case file, and would contact me.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr. Oshili\u2019s report staggered my imagination, and I began suspecting that the University officials, particularly Hon. Bode Ayorinde (PhD) (the University Pro-Chancellor, who is a politician and former member of the House of Representatives), were pulling strings behind the scenes to scupper further investigation into the University\u2019s illegal practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the EFCC never contacted me or my Attorney, and stonewalled all my attempts to follow up on the investigation. My suspicion was later justified when my Attorney received a motion on notice seeking leave to appeal the judgement of 28 September 2020 by the National Industrial Court, Akure Judicial Division, in Suit NICN/AK/23/2018: Sunday Adediran Ajibade vs Achievers Educational Investment Ltd & 2 Ors. In paragraphs 4(f) and (h) of the supporting affidavit deposed to by Toyin Bamifere, she averred amongst other things as follows:\n\n\u201c4(f) That by the time the University resumed early this year 2021, the Respondent through his counsel had already petitioned EFCC Ilorin Zone to harass, intimidate, arrest and detained the officers of the Applicants for days.\n\n\n\n\u201c(h) That it took the intervention of the Attorney General and Minister for Justice and Chairman EFCC before these officers detained were released and the EFCC stopped destructing the activities of the school.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have annexed a certified true copy of the motion on notice filed on 19 November 2021, the supporting affidavit and other accompanying processes. The import of Mrs. Bamifere\u2019s shocking revelation is that the Chief Legal Officer of the Federation interfered with and/or meddled in the EFCC\u2019s ongoing pension fraud investigation. Her depositions certainly cast a dark cloud over the investigative efforts of law enforcement agencies and further erode confidence in our criminal justice system. In addition, they nourish the narrative that highly connected individuals can leverage their influence to insulate their illegal activities from scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the record, Achievers University operates an unlicensed pension scheme tagged \u201cUniversity Savings Scheme\u201d, which it uses as a piggy bank to siphon hundreds of millions of Naira in employees\u2019 pension funds, in simulated compliance with the Pension (Reformed) Act, 2014.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the University is not even registered with the Pension Commission (PenCom), does not have an employer code, and is not registered under the mandatory contributory pension scheme, contrary to the Act. The University has thereby denied the national Pension Funds the legitimate access to pooling and investing pension contributions of the staff of the University and jeopardized my social security and that of other employees.\n\n\u201cMr. Oladokun Farinre (Chartered Accountant and University Bursar from 2008-2021) admitted these facts during his testimony as the University\u2019s sole witness in Suit NICN/AK/23/2018, which the Court reproduced in its judgement of 28 September 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Court equally found in Suit No. NICN/AK/25/2017: Olayiwola Akanji Popoola vs Achievers University, Owo, that these same admissions by Mr. Farinre were proof of the University\u2019s breach of the Pension (Reformed) Act, 2014. Your alleged intervention has now derailed the investigation of these admitted infractions of the law that I reported in my letters to the EFCC and PenCom. Consequently, criminal breach of trust and pension fraud at Achievers University lingers on.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honourable AG would recall that as at 31 December 2021, the Federal Government borrowed N8.77 trillion from Pension Funds to finance budget deficits and infrastructural development programmes. Such funds may become inaccessible, depleted, and threaten the national economy in future if they become subject to diversion and misappropriation by employers like Achievers University.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is therefore clear that the depositions in Mrs. Bamifere\u2019s affidavit are too grievous to be ignored or dismissed by a wave of the hand; for they suggest that the Minister of Justice (a Senior Advocate of Nigeria) is aiding and abetting pension fraud. Thus, it is imperative that the Honourable AGF respond to these claims bordering on gross misconduct, abuse of office and sabotage of a criminal investigation, comprehensively. I fear that silence and/or anything short of a robust response may not bode well, considering the avalanche of similar accusations against your exalted office in recent times.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Ayorinde said he had nothing to say as the matter was already in court.",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nHow are you doing? How has your week been? No, I\u2019m not being clich\u00e9.

Also, engage my newsletter by leaving your thoughts and encouraging others to subscribe. Promise to do it? Pinky swear? I believe you. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo, I\u2019m excited today, and you know why! \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude0a Tomorrow is the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Africa Summit (TABS)! Well, honestly, it\u2019s been a stressful week for the Techpoint Africa team. But, you know what? It\u2019s over already. \ud83d\ude01\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve registered, you\u2019ll see all the fantastic things we\u2019ve packaged just for you tomorrow. However, all tickets, including giveaways, are sold out.\n\nSo, prepare your NFT and web3 questions. You also don\u2019t want to miss the exhibition booth, networking, and the hackathon\u2019s grand finale. You\u2019re excited too, aren\u2019t you? \ud83d\ude09 I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.\n\nIf you do not have a ticket to the physical event, you can register online for free here.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\nNetflix\u2019s Mystery Box\n\nTikTok\u2019s plan to credit creators\n\nVictory Farms\u2019 $5m investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory Farms, a Kenyan-based startup, has raised $5 million in new funding.\n\nEd Brakeman, a senior managing director at Bain Capital and Hans den Bieman, Founder and ex-CEO of Mowi, a company that claims to be one of the world\u2019s largest salmon businesses, led the investment.\n\nLaunched in 2015 by Joseph Rehmann (CEO), Victory Farms is a tilapia aquaculture startup and farm with hatcheries, nursery ponds, and deep-water cages.\n\nThe company claims to have grown twice as fast as any other African fish company. Also, the CEO says they have sold to mass market Africans through a highly innovative Remote Temperature Monitoring (RTM) cold chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Rehmann, the RTM cold chain uses predictive data to push fish to thousands of marketers every day across Kenya with less than 1% spoilage.\n\nCurrently, Victory Farms has more than 54 retail locations where over 15,000 market women go to buy fish, and according to Rehmann, they use no electricity or ice.\n\nThis funding will enable the company to expand into Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania.\n\nNetflix for kids and people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetflix has launched \u201cMystery Box\u201d, a new feature that helps kids discover new movies and TV shows.\n\nWhy? Netflix wants children to try new movies. According to Netflix, children frequently rewatch their favourite shows, making it difficult to persuade them to try something new.\n\nAlso, the company says Mystery Box will provide kids with a personalised experience that will assist them in discovering their next favourite series or movies, and reconnect them with a familiar character.\n\nThis is now available on the company\u2019s connected TV platforms globally.\n\nNetflix is also expanding its accessibility features globally and launching a new collection featuring stories about people with disabilities in honour of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which was observed yesterday, May 19, 2022.\n\nConsequently, the company is expanding its subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing (SDH) and audio descriptions (AD) offerings in additional languages, including Spanish, French, Korean, and Portuguese.\n\nWhy? Heather Dowdy, Netflix\u2019s Director of Accessibility, stated that they are adding more subtitles because more subscribers are watching disability-inclusive content globally.\n\nMoreover, remember that Netflix reported a 200,000-subscriber loss globally in the first quarter of 2022. Perhaps, this could be a strategy for Netflix to retain and gain more subscribers.\n\nTikTok to credit creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve never used TikTok, but I\u2019m considering signing up. You\u2019re asking me why? Isn\u2019t it obvious?\n\nJust this month, the company introduced two new features \u2014 Pulse and Branded Mission \u2014 for content creators to earn money on the app.\n\nDespite its popularity, TikTok has been criticised for amplifying trends without crediting the original creators. TikTok launched a new feature to that effect two days ago, May 18, 2022.\n\nThis feature, a button, allows creators to credit all types of inspiration for their content, like dances, jokes, and viral sounds. By tapping on \u201ccredit\u201d in the video\u2019s caption, TikTok viewers can discover the original creators behind the content.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nReport: The impact of Y Combinator in Africa over the years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

If you have an innovative solution that addresses the prevailing question, apply for the Thought for Food (TFF) Challenge 2022 here.\n\nFirst City Monument Bank and the Mastercard Foundation partnered to launch a 15.5 billion Naira ($27.8m) MSME Revitalisation Fund for techpreneurs.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know that YouTube can identify the most replayed parts of your video? This means you can skip some boring parts of YouTube videos. And no, you haven\u2019t missed out because the feature was introduced yesterday, May 18, 2022.\n\nThe company said it added a graph that people can use to quickly locate and watch parts played the most by other users. Per YouTube, \u201cif the graph is high, that part of the video has been replayed frequently.\u201d\n\nYouTube is also introducing another feature, Single Loop, which allows users to loop a video indefinitely. Moreover, in full-screen mode, a new panel will appear to display video information like the video description, video chapters, and comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, YouTube is expanding support for video chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles. It\u2019s a feature that enables users to skip ahead to a specific video section or easily rewatch that section.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAutochek\u2019s new acquisition\n\nTikTok\u2019s Branded Mission\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\nJumia\u2019s earnings for Q1 2022\n\nAutochek acquires Morocco\u2019s KIFAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek, a digital automotive commerce company, has acquired Morocco\u2019s KIFAL Auto.\n\nThis follows Autochek purchasing Cheki\u2019s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria and collaborating with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast last year.\n\nConsequently, Autochek is now available in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast). It\u2019s also present in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). And thanks to the acquisition of KIFAL Auto, it now has a presence in North Africa, specifically Morocco.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, KIFAL claims it\u2019s one of the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets for used and new cars.\n\nKIFAL Auto, like Autochek, connects car buyers and sellers and, through partnerships, provides financing and insurance.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Maane and the KIFAL Auto team joins Autochek to lead the company\u2019s North African expansion efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Autochek, it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and partnerships with over 70 financing partners, including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Bank.\n\nFor more information on this acquisition, listen to today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast here.\n\nTikTok to roll out a new ad product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has announced the launch of \u201cBranded Mission,\u201d a new advertising product.\n\nWith this product, creators will be able to connect with brands and potentially earn rewards for their videos using this product.\n\nAdvertisers can use the new ad product for crowdsourcing content from creators and turning top-performing videos into ads. Also, they can launch branded campaigns and encourage creators to participate in them.\n\nThey\u2019ll create a brief and distribute it to the creator community to encourage them to participate in Branded Missions. TikTok creators can then choose which Branded Missions to join.\n\nIn summary, Branded Mission allows emerging and aspiring creators to respond to ad casting calls directly on TikTok.\n\nSo, who is eligible to participate? Branded Missions are open to all creators who are 18 years old and above and have at least 1,000 followers.\n\nPer TikTok, eligible creators whose videos are chosen by brands will \u201cbenefit from a cash payment and increased traffic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company believes that this product will allow the TikTok community to have a creative hand in brand campaign ads.\n\nBranded Mission is currently in beta testing and is available to brands in over a dozen markets. Plus, it will be available in more markets later this year.\n\nSimilar, but kinda different: Recall that earlier this month, TikTok introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that allows brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nWell, the company emphasises that it is constantly looking for innovative ways to support creators and assist brands in reaching users on its platforms with relevant content.\n\nBesides, the product is currently available in 12 countries, with plans to expand into additional markets by the end of the year.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in two days! Are you ready?\n\nMARA is giving away 20 tickets to attend Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. To win, follow the instructions here.\n\nVIBRA is sponsoring 20 free tickets to Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS), holding on May 21, 2022. To win, follow the instructions here.\n\nBesides, online tickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBamba, a mobile-based enterprise software for African micro-merchants, has raised $3.2 million in seed funding to scale its app and expand its team.\n\nThe round was led by 468 Capital, with participation from Presight Ventures, Jigsaw VC, and high-profile angel investors, Mato Peric, Leonard Stiegeler, Laurin Hainy, and Thomas Stafford.\n\nBastian Gotter (CEO) founded Bamba in 2022 as a mobile application company. The startup is focused on simple tools for merchants to manage their customers, record stocks, receive payments, make payments, and access cash advances against their future cash flow.\n\nBamba aims to be one of the innovators in addressing the lack of digital solutions for record-keeping and payments, which creates a barrier that prevents these businesses from scaling due to insufficient access to credit facilities.\n\nConsequently, it plans to use the funds to expand its engineering team and user base in 12 sub-Saharan African countries where mobile money is prevalent.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumia, the pan-African e-commerce company, announced its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.\n\nOn today\u2019s podcast, Chimgozirim refers to Jumia as \u201c\u2026the guy who never fulfils his potential.\u201d What?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d That was brutal, if you ask me. What do you think?\n\nAnyway, when you compare this report to the first quarter of 2021, you\u2019ll see how Jumia\u2019s results demonstrated consistent growth.\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking me how. Well, I\u2019ve got you. The report shows that Jumia experienced significant growth in orders, gross merchandise value (GMV), and revenue.\n\nIn other words, orders increased by 40% year on year, from 6.6 million to 9.3 million. GMV increased by 27% year on year, from $198.9 million to $252.7 million. And Jumia\u2019s revenue reached $47.6 million, up 44 percent from $33 million in Q1 2021.\n\nHowever, these figures fell far short of where the eCommerce giant ended 2021, with the last quarter recording GMV sales of $330 million, revenue of $62 million, and orders of 11.3 million.\n\nDespite \u201ccontinued global supply chain volatility for these categories,\u201d food delivery grew 86% year over year, while phones and electronics grew 19%.\n\nOther negatives include its Q1 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) loss, at $53 million, up 70% year on year.\n\nIf you want to know why Chimgozirim said what he said, don\u2019t forget to listen to the podcast.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSEC\u2019s rules: Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxation is not a subject that Nigerians want to talk about, but the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is about to make it unavoidable. Using the National Identification Number (NIN), the organisation wants to track financial transactions in the country to tax Nigerians effectively. Your NIN will be required for any transaction you engage in, including paying school fees or purchasing a car.\n\nThis was how we kicked off proceedings on the Techpoint Africa podcast today. While this development could increase government revenues, Oluwanifemi wondered how good this could be in light of revelations that cast doubt on the safety of data collected by Nigerian government agencies.\n\nNext was a look at Jumia\u2019s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1 2021, the company witnessed impressive growth with revenue growing to $47.6 million, orders growing to 9.3 million, and gross merchandise value hitting $252.7 million.\n\nWith the company announcing that it had acquired a payment service solution provider license (PSSP), we explored the possibility of the company growing its fintech footprints. We also touched briefly on its healthtech ambitions and its chances of survival.\n\nWe rounded up the day\u2019s discussion with news of Autochek\u2019s acquisition of the Moroccan cars marketplace KIFAL Autos and the viability of the BNPL model for cars. Emmanuel shared a Technext report that revealed that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales. With many Nigerians earning below 200,000, it\u2019s not clear how profitable these companies could be in the long run.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, please follow the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

          "title": "How partnership between school, private industry can boost Nigeria\u2019s tertiary institutions\u2019 IGR",
          "text": "Tertiary institutions all over the world are regarded as the hub of economic and sustainable national development. They transmit knowledge and nurture human minds for optimal potential.\n\nIn Nigeria, the tertiary institutions are veritable tools for the realisation of socio-economic national development; hence the most powerful and critical success factor for individuals and society.\n\nHowever, in the face of the incessant insufficient funding beclouding public tertiary institutions in the country, many of these institutions are yet to tap into the numerous benefits of schools- private industry-partnership ventures.\n\nBut the Federal College of Education (Technical), Akoka, the story is different as the institution embraced and is maximizing the benefits of schools-private industries- partnership.\n\nAccording to Samuel Ukit, the dean school of technical education of FCE(T), Akoka, the college partnered with a firm \u2018Automedic Company \u2018 in the year 2009 with a memorandum of understanding geared toward the generation of revenues for both parties, which profited the college in many ways.\n\n\u201cIt exposed our students to numerous practical approaches to their career and in turn generated revenue to both the college and the Automedics,\u201d Ukit said.\n\nAkinpelu Oluwafemi an instructor in the automobile technical department disclosed to BusinessDay that the project which lasted for about 5years had many people coming from within and outside the college community to fix their vehicles in the workshop.\n\n\u201cPeople were coming from even the University of Lagos and other neighbouring communities to service and repair their vehicles with us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a noble venture that generated many gains both in terms of finance and academics because our students were exposed to competency-based education to complement the theories,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, the academic scholars said that there is also another private-partnership venture available to institutions such as the vendor\u2013partnership scheme ongoing in the college.\n\nAccording to the dean, the college-vendor-partnership scheme is currently being run in the metal department of FCE (T), Akoka, \u201cIt is designed in such a way that individuals can come in as an apprentice and learn the technical skills at a price, or as experts in partnership with the college to use the tools at a price.\n\n\u201cPrivate companies also have a slot to have their machines serviced or repaired in the college workshop by these professionals at a price which the institution shares with its partners according to prior agreements.\n\n\u201cThese arrangements in return yield dividends financially to the institution in form of internally generated revenue.\u201d\n\nExperts believe that to achieve complete education and be fully literate, industry leaders and progressive entrepreneurs need to be partnered as adjunct lecturers in the various Nigerian tertiary institutions to enable them to translate their experiences to transform the students.\n\nAccording to Izu Nwachukwu, a senior lecturer, at the University of Calgary, Canada, \u201cThe 21st-century education is competence-based, where students learn to master their chosen careers through learning by practice system.\n\n\u201cMaking experts adjunct lecturers will be an avenue for them to share their experiences with students thereby preparing them for the lifelong learning.\u201d\n\nEducation, he reiterated should be made to prepare people to live happier, healthier, and more fulfilled in life. And this according to him can only be realised by tailoring the education system to encouraging learners to learn and develop transferable skills.\n\nSimilarly, Emmanuel Nnadozie, the executive secretary of the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) in a paper he delivered at the 2022 Bullion lecture said, \u201cEducation has generally been poorly funded by the federal government in Nigeria over the years, averaging just 6percent since attaining independence in 1960.\n\nMoreover, given the yawning gap between budgetary allocations and release, especially in recent years when all levels of government suffered from significant revenue shortfall and rising debt service, the actual release to education and other sectors has always been lower than budget.\u201d\n\nFunding shortfalls in the tertiary education sector have been the norm for many years as enrolments have increased more quickly than the government\u2019s capacity to maintain corresponding increases in financial support.\n\nAnd because government funding is insufficient, Nigerian tertiary institutions, just like others elsewhere in the world have to seek to supplement their public funding with internally generated incomes or revenues.\n\nThe intellectual quotient system of education is outdated. Nigeria needs as a matter of urgency to switch to competence-based education system to meet up with the global community.\n\nStudents must have the outlet to acquire skills; students must have the outlet to merge theory and practical knowledge. It is a win-win situation for the students and the non-student trainees.\n\nFor instance, if students are sent to the mechanic village and the mechanics on their own learn certain theoretical skills from these students that will help them in better management of the human and material resources they have.\n\nOn the other hand, the students will learn the skill that is required and find more ways to be more innovative, to create the entrepreneurial drive to be the manager of resources.\n\nIt has become imperative for tertiary institution lecturers to know the best teaching and learning process to be adopted so that graduates will perform according to expectations.\n\nExperts believe that this will in a massive way help curb the rising numbers of graduates in the street that are unproductive and are becoming very dangerous to society.\n\nAccording to Anthony Adebayo, metal-tech instructor, \u201cWe all condemn the practice of yahoo boys, but we must note that these are not just uneducated people; most of them are graduates, who lack the skills, hence, they do not have what it takes to live and they find themselves driven into some of these atrocities.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that to tame this ugly development among our young men and women is to teach them how to become responsible and productive citizens. The most important challenge is the quality of education given to young minds.\n\nAnother engineer advocates for the work job learning education system as a solution to the incessant half-baked graduates coming out of Nigeria\u2019s tertiary institutions.\n\n\u201cEverybody is aware that Nigerian engineering graduates are not performing to the expectations of the labour market. Hence, the need to design the most appropriate module to solve this problem from the root causes, which happens to be the teaching and learning process,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed that the country\u2019s tertiary institutions must adopt a teaching approach that will help students of engineering programmes produce goods and services that are expected from engineers. He explained that most times these institutions are not able to expose students to competency-based education because the equipment is not there.\n\nTo overcome such shortcomings, Nnadozie recommends that tertiary institutions among other things must learn to rely less on the government for funding by seeking avenues to boost their internally generated revenues.\n\nRead also: Nigerians rely on unhappy teachers to develop education sector\n\n\u201cInternally generated revenue (IGR) can be a very solid means of financing tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Most tertiary institutions in the country need to set up internally generating revenue units to source for funds to assist the government in financing the institutions. Internally generated revenue unit in higher institution, therefore, is to serve as a relief to government expenditure,\u201d he stated.\n\nResearch has shown that industry and university collaborations (ICUs) have a long tradition in several countries worldwide and universities play a crucial role in achieving economic growth in today\u2019s knowledge-based societies.\n\nAccording to a World Bank report in 2002, the late 20th century witnessed a decrease in public funding for higher education, relative to private funding, in most parts of the world.\n\nFurther findings indicated that in many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the proportion of institutional funding received from the state declined; in some jurisdictions, this translated into reduced public funding per student.\n\nMany publicly funded universities responded, first, by cutting costs and, then when it became clear that a return to the status quo ante was not in the cards by seeking out new sources of revenue.\n\nThe ambition of policymakers and universities to develop \u2018third missions\u2019 in addition to the two traditional core missions of research and teaching, and to commercialise academic knowledge, for instance through continuing education programmes, patenting, technology transfer offices, science parks or incubators have intensified the relevance of such collaborations.\n\nIndustry and university collaborations according to scholars have the tendency for companies to profit from highly qualified human resources such as researchers or students, gain access to technology and knowledge, and can boost the use of expensive research infrastructure.\n\nUniversities, in return, benefit from additional funding provided, from access to industrial equipment, or from licensing or patenting income. In fact, collaboration with industry has become an inevitable part of tertiary education funding, and the funds from international organisations and business enterprises for research and development in the higher education sector nowadays represent a \u2018significant source\u2019 in many countries.",

Please help us express our profound gratitude to him. We will continue to appreciate his kind gesture.\u201d\n\nHailing the army officers\u2019 wives for the support and encouragement they continue to give to officers, ensuring peace and security in the country, the governor said, \u201cWe know the role of the Nigerian Army Officers\u2019 Wives play in the lives of our services men, and also, when we run into a crisis, we call on the army and we know the professionalism at which they respond to our call.\n\n\u201cFor us as a government, our priority is our people. It\u2019s our people first because it\u2019s people that create everything first; it\u2019s people that create money, as well as technology, among others. So, without education and healthcare, at the basis, to strengthen your population, nothing else is going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThat is why we have prioritized education in Edo and we are spending as much as we can afford on those two issues that affect the people. In the case of education, our focus is on the foundation, because once you have a sound foundation, that child can build on that foundation subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe children in our public schools can compete with their colleagues anywhere in the world.

We are facing a lot of problems. We are facing a lot of challenges in Osun State as regards our entitlements.\n\n\u201cFor instance some pensioners who retired in 2008/09 are yet to be renumerated.

          "text": "Barely hours after the Imo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) issued a directive to aspirants to provide what it termed stipends for delegates, opposition members have condemned their action, saying it is legalisation of vote buying.\n\nThe PDP State Secretary, Nze Ray Emeana had in a notice to all aspirants titled \u201cStipends to Delegates\u201d dated May 19th, directed them to provide finances for the transportation of delegates to the different points of election.\n\nPart of the directive read \u201cIn view of the need to minimise cost of party primaries and conserve funds for the general elections, the state working committee directs all aspirants to provide Stipends only to enable delegates transport themselves to the venues of the primaries.\n\nHouse of Assembly N30,000 each House of Representatives N50,000 each Senate N80,000.\n\nThe party will frown seriously at any aspirant or delegate who violets this directive and attempt to convert the primaries into a commercial venture. All state Vice Chairmen of the senatorial districts are directed to appoint monitoring committees to ensure compliance and report any breach to the state party\u201d.\n\nFormer Dean of the Imo State University and Law Professor, Nnamdi Obiaraeri said the directive was a tacit endorsement of vote buying.\n\nThe former Imo North Senatorial aspirant said \u201cMen and women of enlightened consciences are alarmed that a baptismal name has been given to corruption and vote buying code-named- \u201cStipend to Delegates\u201d.\n\nIt is not funny that an illegal and immoral act (vote butying) that should never have been tolerated has now been elevated to an approved and regulated act by Imo PDP\u201d.\n\nHe called on the party to immediately retract the directive saying \u201cWhoever is behind this satanic approval and or endorsement that delegates voting at primary elections should earn daily stipends that are more than the monthly salary of a Nigerian worker should do a rethink and quickly withdraw same\u201d.\n\nOn his part, another chieftain of the ruling All Progressive Congress, Onwuasanya FCC Jones said the directive was a pointer that the party has embedded corruption and impunity.\n\nJones said \u201cThe memo from the major opposition Party\u2019s Scribe goes a long way to show that the PDP might not really be the \u201credeemer\u201d we are hoping for, as they apparently have corruption and impunity entrenched in their system.\n\nFurther he said \u201cA simple analysis of these figures show that aspirants would be doling out millions of Naira to delegates during the primaries. For instance, in an LGA, where we have ten House of Assembly aspirants, each delegate to the House of Assembly will be going home with at least 300,000 Naira, while each aspirant for House of Assembly election is expected to spend nothing less than Three Million Naira on buying delegates alone, that is in the very rare situation where there are just 100 delegates participating in the Primaries.\n\nReacting to the claims of conserving funds, Jones said \u201cIf an aspirant for the Party\u2019s Senatorial ticket might be spending up to N50 million, \u201cofficially \u201c, on just buying delegates. And if an aspirant is to spend such amount of money on just procuring delegates, yet, the party Scribe still expects that money would be conserved for general election, it could therefore mean that the Party is preparing to unleash heavy financial artillery on Imo people during the general election\u201d.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of the PDP State Publicity Secretary, Mazi Emenike Nmeregini proved abortive as he didn\u2019t take the calls put across to him.",

          "title": "24 Years After Oil Pollution, Lagos Community To Taste Potable Water",
          "text": "A big relief seems to have come the way of Baruwa , a Lagos community which was prior to governor Sanwo-Olu\u2019s promise to give them affordable and sustainable clean water supply, signing a three-year memorandum of understanding with WaterAid, an International Non-governmental Organisation was exposed to the illicit activities of bunkers and other oil pipeline vandals. In fact, aside pipeline vandalism, the community also battles underground pollution due to leakages, water sources across different parts of the community were contaminated\n\nThe once peaceful community is host the Nigerian National Petroleum Company pipeline that runs through the community from Mosinmi oil depot to Ejigbo oil facility had at a point resorted to a series of sacrifices to appease the gods of the land over the strange development.\n\nPrior to 1994, there was little or no cause for restiveness among the people who were merely concerned about how to eke out a living for their daily survival. However, the table turned and the centre could no longer hold for them , no thanks to the unusual discovery of oil pollution in their common sources of drinking water.\n\nTrouble was said to have started after some of the residents who went to draw water from a well noticed an oily substance in it. They dismissed it as nothing to worry about. But were later proven wrong when the oily substance began to be noticed in other wells. After a while, those who sourced water from boreholes also began to notice slight changes in the taste and colour of the water they got. In addition, an unusual odour started to spread in the environment.\n\nFor residents of the community before 1996 , their community had existed for over 50 years without any such (leakage) issue. They said they did not generate serious concerns until December 1998 when tests were conducted by the community showing that water sources were contaminated in the community which they promptly made known to the government.\n\nThe community had their wells and borehole contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbon due to oil leaks from the pipeline as a result of the aged and rusted pipeline.\n\nIn the same vein, over one million inhabitants of the area were for 24 years deprived of drinkable water due to the oil seepage from leaking underground NNPC pipeline. Residents of the community who are largely small holder farmers suffered persistent catarrh, irritation of the airways, wateriness, discoloration of the cornea of the eyes, skin rashes, and dermatitis.\n\nBaruwa community is located in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos State. It is drained by Lagos lagoon, Badagry creek and Lekki lagoon which runs into the lagoon. Geographically, the community lies on a poorly sorted coastal sedimentary plain and recent alluvial deposit in Nigeria. The Local Council is richly blessed with arable landmass of about 57.621 km2 and it is surrounded by rivers Owa and Oponu which are suitable for navigation, shing and tourism purposes.\n\nApart from aged petroleum pipes, vandalisation of petroleum pipelines is a major cause of pipeline fire disasters in the area.\n\nSadly, until this latest development, the number of deaths recorded, little information about the effects of such disasters on the environment were often reported , even as post-disaster remediation process was usually unmonitored or ineffective.\n\nAlthough factors such as institutional weakness, lack of effective implementation of environmental laws were hypothesised as the causes of vandalism in Nigeria and they are considered neither exhaustive nor confirmed as no available empirical evidences can be found confirming the asserted causes of vandalism.\n\nHowever, a number empirical researches claimed that institutional weakness, injustices, marginalisation and corruption forced people to fight for justice in a negative way.\n\nOn its part, the NNPC blamed pipeline vandalism, crude oil and petroleum products theft for the not-too-impressive performance of some of its subsidiaries and division as recorded in its recently-released audited financial statements.\n\nIn a note to the audited financial statements obtained from the NNPC, the corporation, however, noted that the significant increase in crude oil price in 2018, impacted positively on the financial performance of majority of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe release of the 2018 Audited Financial Statements (AFS) of its 19 Strategic Business Units (SBUs) and a Corporate Services Unit (CSU), made it the first time in its history that the NNPC is making public its audited financial statement.\n\nHowever, the NNPC said: \u201cThe continuous vandalism of NNPC pipelines resulted in an increased cost of pipelines maintenance alongside loss of crude oil and petroleum products.\u201d\n\nLEADERSHIP WEEKEND reports that vandalism of NNPC pipelines across the country rose by a phenomenal spike of 50 per cent in January 2020.\n\nThis information is part of the monthly financial and operations report, which was released in April that year.\n\nIn 2020, 60 pipeline points were vandalised compared to 40 incidents recorded in December 2019. Atlas Cove-Mosimi and Mosimi-Ibadan axis pipelines accounted for 50 per cent and 17 per cent of the breaks respectively, with the remaining 33 per cent being accounted for by all other routes.\n\nThe group managing director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, also decries the activities of pipeline vandals whose nefarious act torched parts of the corporation\u2019s pipeline network especially in Abule Egba area of Lagos State which has claimed lives and properties of innocent Nigerians.\n\nBaruwa And Erosion Control\n\nThe community, is presently exposed to possible pipeline breach by thieves as a result of incessant rainfall which has brought the buried pipes on the surface.\n\nOur Correspondent who visited the community reports that most of the pipes are now exposed.\n\nBaruwa, a sprawling Lagos community already battling with underground water contamination that has constrained residents efforts in managing COVID-19 spread without potable water is now living in fear.\n\nWith over 300 boreholes and wells contaminated with various petroleum products, there is no doubt that there is fire in the mountain for Baruwa community.\n\nIn Baruwa, serial fire outbreaks have further complicated environmental challenges in that community hosting high pressure petroleum products conveyor infrastructure.\n\nThe community has expressed serious worry about new wave of vandalism of oil assets following alleged impotence of the contractor engaged by government to secure about 151 kilometers of pipelines stretching from Atlas Cove bypassing Baruwa to Mosimi in Ogun state.\n\nBetween 1996 up To 1998, there was initial flurry of activities when the community was almost turned to Mecca of sort by numerous organism and individuals who are very curious about the press for more in view of the widespread pollution.\n\nLagos State Government Intervention\n\nTwenty four years after ruptured petroleum pipeline reportedly contaminated underground water in Baruwa area, present administration of Lagos state has commenced efforts to provide potable water to the community.\n\nThis follows the historic visit of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ascertain the level of environmental degradation of the community as a result of petroleum products leakage in the community.\n\ndrinking water.\n\nThe community in a letter to the Governor sited by our Correspondent, decried cost of procuring usable water in the last 24 years which range from between N1,000 to N1,500 daily by families.\n\nThe letter signed by the Baale of Baruwa, Alh. Halid Baruwa, dated 6th of May, 2022, said families spend between N2,000 to N3,000 daily to procure drinking water, adding, \u201cWe have faced serious health hazard like, irritation of eyes, skin and mucous memberances, nausea and nervous system depression for a long time.\n\nLagos State Government said the sum of N300 billion would be required yearly to meet its Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, target on universal access to water for its growing population.\n\nSanwo-Olu, has however, expressed readiness of his administration to improve the water supply needs of residents towards achieving universal access to safe water by 2030.\n\nThe governor who highlighted the challenges of achieving sustainable water supply\n\nat the second edition of the annual International Water conference, organised by Lagos state Water Regulatory Commission, LASWARCO, noted that Lagos State Water Corporation produces 210 million gallons per day, MGD, against the daily water demand estimate of 540 MGD.\n\nThe figure showed a clear deficit of over 300 MGD, which translates to less than 40 per cent of population having access to clean and safe water.\n\nWhile stating that government was not oblivious of the huge gap and its consequences on the health of the populace, he stressed that his administration remains dedicated to its goal of becoming a global point of reference in the provision of sustainable safe water and sanitation for its increasing population.\n\nSanwo-Olu further stated that in furtherance of his commitment to affordable and sustainable clean water supply, his government has signed a three-year memorandum of understanding with WaterAid, an International Non-governmental Organisation on capacity building for approved regulation and expansion of clean water access.\n\nHe assured that phase II of the Adiyan Water Project which now stands at 80 per cent completion stage would soon become operational.",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has paid a condolence visit to the new President of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, on the passing of his predecessor, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. During the visit, President Buhari expressed his condolences and that of Nigeria to Sheikh Mohamed and congratulated him on his election as President. He assured the new UAE leader of his determination to do more to ensure the growth of the strategic partnership between Nigeria and the Asian country. President Buhari also hopes that under Sheikh Mohamed the two countries will continue to actively champion a vision of sustainable security, strengthen counterterrorism cooperation, facilitate trade and investment, and promote prosperity and development. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Garba Shehu, said in a statement on Saturday that in the seven years of the Buhari administration, the two countries \u201chave actively conducted bilateral dialogues\u201d. These dialogues, according to him, have led to several agreements and Memoranda of Understanding that have paved the way for further cooperation, mutual understanding and progress in many aspects of their bilateral relations. President Buhari had left Nigeria for the UAE on Thursday, six days after the death of Sheikh Khalifa.\n\nSheikh Khalifa, who was rarely seen in public died on Friday, May 13 aged 73 after battling illness for several years.\n\nThe Ministry of Presidential Affairs announced 40 days of mourning, with flags at half-mast from the day of his death and work was suspended in the public and private sector for the first three days.\n\nSheikh Khalifa took over as the UAE\u2019s second president in November 2004, succeeding his father as the 16th ruler of Abu Dhabi, the richest of the federation\u2019s seven emirates.\n\nHe has rarely been seen in public since 2014, when he had surgery following a stroke, although he has continued to issue rulings. The cause of death was not immediately released.\n\nThe UAE, a former British protectorate that was founded in 1971, has gone from a desert outpost to a booming state in its short history, fuelled by its oil wealth and Dubai\u2019s rise as a trading and financial centre.\n\nThe Arab world\u2019s second-biggest economy behind Saudi Arabia has also begun to wield growing political influence, filling a space ceded by traditional powers such as Egypt, Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe country of 10 million also joined military campaigns in Libya and Yemen and broke ranks with much of the Arab world to establish ties with Israel in 2020.\n\nThe bearded Sheikh Khalifa had cut a frail figure on his occasional public appearances, while his Sheikh Mohamed hosted world leaders and led diplomatic forays abroad.\n\nThe late Sheikh Khalifa, who had no formal higher education, led the UAE as Dubai emerged as a tourism and trade hub and Abu Dhabi pumped oil as a key OPEC player.\n\nHe came to the rescue of Dubai when it was hit by the global financial crisis in 2009, extending a multi-billion-dollar lifeline to the debt-laden emirate.",

          "text": "Russia on Saturday stopped providing natural gas to neighbouring Finland, which has angered Moscow by applying for NATO membership after the Nordic country refused to pay supplier Gazprom in rubles.\n\nFollowing Russia\u2019s February 24 invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has asked clients from \u201cunfriendly countries\u201d \u2014 including EU member states \u2014 to pay for gas in rubles, a way to sidestep Western financial sanctions against its central bank.\n\nGazprom said in a statement Saturday that it had \u201ccompletely stopped gas deliveries\u201d as it had not received ruble payments from Finland\u2019s state-owned energy company Gasum \u201cby the end of the working day on May 20\u201d.\n\nGazprom said it had supplied 1.49 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Finland in 2021, equal to about two-thirds of the country\u2019s gas consumption.\n\nHowever, natural gas accounts for around eight per cent of Finland\u2019s energy.\n\nGasum said it would make up for the shortfall from other sources through the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to Estonia, and assured that filling stations would run normally.\n\n\u201cNatural gas supplies to Finland under Gasum\u2019s supply contract have been cut off,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nIn April, Gazprom Export demanded that future payments in the supply contract be made in rubles instead of euros.\n\nGasum rejected the demand and announced on Tuesday it was taking the issue to arbitration.\n\nGazprom Export said it would defend its interests in court by any \u201cmeans available\u201d.\n\nGasum said it would be able to secure gas from other sources and that gas filling stations in the network area would continue \u201cnormal operation\u201d.\n\nRift over NATO bid\n\nIn efforts to mitigate the risks of relying on Russian energy exports, the Finnish government on Friday also announced it had signed a 10-year lease agreement for an LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal ship with US-based Excelerate Energy.\n\nOn Sunday, Russia suspended electricity supplies to Finland overnight after its energy firm RAO Nordic claimed payment arrears, although the shortfall was quickly replaced.\n\nFinland, along with neighbouring Sweden, this week broke its historical military non-alignment and applied for NATO membership, after public and political support for the western alliance soared following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow has warned Finland that any NATO membership application would be \u201ca grave mistake with far-reaching consequences\u201d.\n\nBoth Finland and Sweden are seemingly on the fast track to joining the military alliance, with US President Joe Biden offering \u201cfull, total, complete backing\u201d to their bids.\n\nBut all 30 existing NATO members must agree on any new entrants, and Turkey has condemned the Nordic neighbours\u2019 alleged toleration of Kurdish militants and has so far voiced opposition to letting them in.\n\nRussian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has said the Kremlin would respond to any NATO expansion by creating more military bases in western Russia.\n\nSaturday\u2019s halt to gas shipments follows Moscow cutting off Poland and Bulgaria last month in a move the European Union described as \u201cblackmail\u201d.\n\nAFP",

It means that if the E-Cube solar energy is sitting within a small clinic in whatever village, the people can enjoy treatment from a doctor sitting in Abuja, Katsina. We can get the best doctors to give the best services. On Monday, the doctor can give advice for five hours in communities in Kaduna, Abuja etc.\n\n\u201cWhat we are giving here is a livelihood to the people and sustainability.

For PDP, it will be the three delegates elected from each ward.\n\nSo, statutory delegates, including elected councillors, local government chairmen and their deputies, party chairmen in local government areas, state and federal lawmakers (current and former), governors and their deputies, President and Vice- President, National Working Committee members, state party chairmen and secretaries, are no longer voters at the primaries.\n\nThe largesse they had been enjoying from all the aspirants at various levels seeking their votes \u2013 presidential, governorship, Senate, House of Representatives and states\u2019 House of Assembly \u2013 has come to an end.\n\nMany are struggling to face the reality and hoping that the President will still sign the amendment by next Monday.\n\nBut analysts countered this, saying, \u201cWith the seven-day INEC rule for parties to submit their list of delegates before primary elections, new election amendment is now out of time, even if it gets presidential endorsement.\u201d\n\nA source told THISDAY Friday night that the APC had already submitted its list of elected delegates to INEC, while the PDP had partially complied, to beat the seven-day deadline.\n\nThe PDP has scheduled its presidential primary for May 28 and 29, while the APC will elect its presidential candidate on May 29 and 30.\n\nAs things stand, the APC will elect its presidential flagbearer with 2322 democratically elected delegates, based on three National delegates per local government area.\n\nThe PDP will elect its presidential flagbearer with 810 delegates based on one National delegate per local government area and one each per state to cover the physically challenged.\n\nPower to determine those that will emerge as candidates for various elective positions has now returned to the state governors; already, they determined those on the list of elected delegates sent to INEC.\n\nSo, the state governors are back in business.",

          "text": "Russian forces have bombarded areas of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas from land and air, killing at least 13 civilians, Ukraine\u2019s military said on Friday, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the assaults had turned the region into \u201chell\u201d.\n\nAs the war neared the three-month mark, the Russians were intensifying their efforts to subdue the Donbas region, the Ukrainian general staff said.\n\nThey had hit civilian infrastructure with \u201cmassive\u201d artillery shelling, including multiple rocket-launchers, the general staff said in a statement. Russian aircraft had also struck at targets.\n\nRussian shelling in the Luhansk area of Donbas killed 13 civilians over the past 24 hours, regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Twelve of those deaths were in the town of Sievierodonesk but a Russian assault there had been unsuccessful, he said.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports and Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\n\u201cThe Donbas is completely destroyed,\u201d President Zelenskiy said in an address on Thursday night. \u201cIt is hell there \u2013 and that is not an exaggeration.\u201d\n\nThere were also constant strikes on the Odesa region in the south, he said.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports and Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\nRussia\u2019s focus on Donbas follows its failure to capture the capital Kyiv in the early stages of the invasion launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24.\n\nThousands of people \u2013 many of them civilians \u2013 have been killed and whole towns and cities razed in the gravest crisis in Europe in decades.\n\nAlmost a third of the Ukraine\u2019s people have fled their homes, including more than 6 million who have left the country in a refugee exodus, while others remain trapped in cities pulverised by Russian bombardments.\n\nBritish military intelligence said on Friday that Russia is likely to further reinforce its operations in Donbas once it finally secures the southern port city of Mariupol \u2013 scene of a weeks-long siege and Russia\u2019s most significant success in an otherwise faltering campaign.\n\nThe region, an industrial powerhouse, compromises the Donetsk and Luhansk areas, which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\n\nPutin calls the invasion of Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to rid the country of fascists \u2013 an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.\n\nThe Kremlin leader was due to hold a security council meeting later on Friday.\n\nWESTERN SUPPORT\n\nWestern powers, who have strongly condemned Russia\u2019s actions and sought to isolate Moscow with an array of sanctions, were stepping up their support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Group of Seven rich nations on Thursday agreed to provide Ukraine with $18.4 billion to make up for lost revenues as the war wrecks its economy.\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved nearly $40 billion in new aid for Ukraine, by far the largest U.S. aid package to date.\n\nThe White House is also working to put advanced anti-ship missiles in the hands of Ukrainian fighters to help defeat Russia\u2019s naval blockade, which has largely stopped Ukraine\u2019s exports of food. read more\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused Russia of using food as a weapon by holding \u201chostage\u201d supplies for not just Ukrainians, but also millions around the world. read more The war has caused global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser to soar.\n\nThe EU said it is looking into ways of using the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs to fund the reconstruction of Ukraine, while the United States has not ruled out possibly placing sanctions on countries that purchase Russian oil.\n\nHOLD OUT\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began, with the Kyiv government ordering the defenders of a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down after a protracted siege.\n\nBritish military intelligence said as many as 1,700 soldiers were likely to have surrendered at the Azovstal steel factory, matching a similar number released on Thursday by Moscow.\n\nUkrainian officials, who have tried to arrange a prisoner swap, have declined to comment on the number, saying it could endanger rescue efforts.\n\nLate on Thursday, Sviatoslav Palamar, deputy head of the Azov Regiment defending the steelworks, released an 18-second video in which he said he and other commanders were still inside the plant.\n\n\u201cA certain operation is going on, the details of which I will not disclose,\u201d he said.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said it had registered hundreds of prisoners from Azovstal now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks.\n\nThe wounded were given medical treatment while those who were fit were taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said.",
