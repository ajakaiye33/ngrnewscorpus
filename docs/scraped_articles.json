          "text": "By Dapo Akinrefon & Adeola Badru & Sola Isola\n\nLawyer to the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemi, fondly called Sunday Igboho, Yomi Alliyu, SAN, yesterday, dismissed a social media report of an alleged plan to eliminate the activist in Benin Republic prison, saying the Federal Government of Nigeria led by President Muhammadu Buhari is keeping Igboho in prison and not the Benin Republic Government.\n\nHe, however, warned those \u201cflying the kite\u201d to desist from spreading such speculations, assuring that Igboho would regain freedom soon.\n\nAlliyu, in a chat with Vanguard, said: \u201cI don\u2019t have knowledge of a threat to his life. I speak with his wife regularly but I don\u2019t have such knowledge of plans to eliminate him.\n\n\u201cWe have persuaded his boys and Yoruba youths not to take laws into their hands. We told them that if they start killing and burning, they will be killing their kith and kin. We urged them to keep their cool. However, if anybody is flying such a kite to know the feelings of what will happen if Sunday Igboho is murdered in prison, I advise that such a person should have a rethink.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is planning that except the enemies of this government. The only way this Government can wash its hands off this evil intention is to release Sunday Igboho now because they (FG) are the ones keeping him in prison and not the Benin Republic Government.\n\n\u201cIf anything should happen to Sunday Igboho, we will hold the Federal Government responsible. That is why we have been appealing to Yoruba youths not to take laws into their hands because we are optimistic that Sunday Igboho will be freed and that the alleged plan to kill him is a mere rumour. I don\u2019t see any threat to his life.\u201d\n\nSunday Igboho had reportedly alleged that there was a plot by the Federal government of Nigeria to eliminate him in the Benin Republic.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nOlayomi Koiki, spokesman for Igboho, in a podcast on Tuesday evening, alleged that the Benin Republic President, Patrice Talon, was working with the Federal Government to extradite Igboho to Nigeria.\n\nI was quoted out of context \u2014Spokesman\n\nHowever, Koiki has explained that he was quoted out of context on the alleged plot to eliminate his principal in Cotonou prison.\n\nKoiki, while speaking with Vanguard via WhatsApp call on Wednesday, on reports of the alleged elimination of his principal, which was credited to him, stated that there was no time he said they wanted to eliminate Igboho.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was quoted out of context. I was referring to Prof. Banjo Akintoye in my statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, if they are planning evil against Prof. Banji Akintoye and others, they are only trying but God\u2019s power is superior.\u201d\n\n\u201cI further said enemies are trying to eliminate Prof. Akintoye (not Igboho) to silence the Yoruba nation agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut on the issue of Igboho, the Government of Nigeria is indirectly instigating his continued detention in Cotonou.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Benin Republic judicial system is no longer working again and we are going to fight for our right to the end.\n\n\u201cIgboho cannot be silenced like the way they killed MKO Abiola, Funsho Williams, unjustly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Benin Republic President Patrice Talon is working continuously with the Federal Government to extradite Igboho to Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Yoruba leaders must continue to fight. Igboho must get justice.\u201d\n\nIgboho, 49, was arrested by operatives of Brigade Criminelle (Criminal Brigade) on July 19 in Cotonou. Despite efforts to get him released, he has spent over 161 days in detention.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Chairman Board of Trustees of the Centre for Human Rights and Anti-Corruption (CHURAC), Cleric E. Alaowei, Esq, today said former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s reply to Chief Edwin Kiagbodo Clark\u2019s letter is unnecessary.\n\nAlaowei made the assertion in a statement signed and made available to DAILY POST.\n\nHe said the former president relied on the provisions of the 1999 Military Decree, otherwise known as the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Alaowei, \u201cTo us in the Niger Delta, that Military Decree did not reflect the will of the people. A constitution is supposed to be the true reflection of the people\u2019s will but that\u2019s not the case with the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason why Nigerians are agitating for the constitutional review. Of course, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo should have known better, the outcome of the National Political Reforms Conference (NPC) in 2005 which he convened.\n\n\u201cIf the provisions of the 1999 constitution were acceptable to the Niger Delta people, the latter wouldn\u2019t had boycotted the Conference when the demand for 25% derivation was rejected by the conferees.\n\n\u201cOBJ ought to have informed the world that his NPC and the 2014 National Dialogue approved 18% derivation for the producing States. If the ownership of the natural resources belong to the central government as erroneously provided in that military Decree, the Constitutional conferences from 2005 to date would not have resolved to increase the derivation in the Constitution in order to address the yearnings of the Niger Delta people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a national consensus that the natural resources belong to the people whose lands produce them but draconian military Decrees were promulgated by competing interests to deny the people of their rights.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason why they\u2019re making an upward review of the provisions of the constitution in order to appease the people whose rights have been constitutionally stolen from them.\n\n\u201cOBJ also relied on international treaties to support his constitutional claim of ownership of natural resources. We stand to be corrected. The provisions of the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights which was domesticated in Nigeria did not vest ownership of natural resources in the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat treaty clearly provides that ownership of natural resources belong to the people where they\u2019re found. Baba Obasanjo should tell us the particular treaty that gives ownership of natural resources to the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe believe, the former President is only trying to be economical with the truth. We agree with Chief E. K. Clark that the natural resources belong to the people and not the central government. That\u2019s the practice in the world over.\n\n\u201cWhether or not our constitution vests ownership in the Federal Government as against the interest of the oil-bearing host communities, we will continue to agitate for our rights. Niger Delta people and indeed, a good number of Nigerians are in agreement with the Elder Statesman, Chief Edwin Kiagbodo Clark.\u201d",

          "title": "UTERINE FIBROIDS: Poor blood vein flow, second chankra",
          "text": "FRANKLY, I did not plan to wrap up 2021 with a column on uterine fibroids.\n\nEvery new month of every year for about 10 years now, I have tired to examine new ideas about the causes of this problem which saddens hundred of thousands of Nigerian women and does not even think it was bringing to the front burner in January 2022. Dementia and neutrologicak ailments engaged my attention. But, suddenly, like thunder out of the blue in harmattan season when the rain season has long departed, talk of uterine fibroid suddenly filled the air. I received several enquiries about which herbs or foods may help. The enquiries were young women or close to menopause and anxious that they did not have children as yet. Many of them had tried protocols which failed. In some cases, the root stumps of uterine fibroids surgically removed regrow. With much money gone down the arian and with no hope if respite, some women have learned to live with uterine fibroids as an all batross of their lives. The enquiries made me speak to a woman I have known since the early 1980s who never experienced any of the common or complex gynaecological problems many women face. Her periods were regular and painless. Her weight had not changed since her university days in the 1980s. Infact, at 63, she still wears some of the clothes she wore at 30. She puts it all down to her catholic moral discipline and dietary discipline. As a spinster, she distanced herself from contraceptives and and did not have an abortion. As a wife, she has no business with family planning protocol. An only challenge I ahvs heard her complain of is inflammation of the veins which she suspects was behind her early symptoms of varicose veins and arteries m one day long after menopause, she woke up from a long night sleep to find blood Staind on the bed linen. She was not menstruating. One of the swollen vains in her legs got bruised and leaked blood. Then, she began to feel arthritis pain in one knee. When she called me, we discussed two herbs from NATURE\u2019S WAY that were popular in Nigeria if the 1980s for bleeding haemorrhoids. Somehow, the modern or post 2000 distribution networks have swamped them out of the marked. So have they the third called SHEPHERD\u2019S PURSE. You\u2019d be lucky nowadays to find it in proprietary formula in small pinches. The other two which she was lucky to find in one of my pet proprietary formula of the 1980s were BUTCHERIS BROOM and HORSE CHESTNUT. They are well combined in the products called LEG VEINS. To cut a long story short, this woman\u2019s varicose like symptoms cleared and her arthritis considerably eased. Persuaded that these two conditions were possibly caused by poor blood circulation in the veins (venous return insufficiency), she believes it must be the cause as well of Uterine fibroids. I couldn\u2019t disagreed, because for about a decade or more, I have pretended studies which link Uterine fibroids to either in complete menstrual discharge and stagnation of blood in the pelvic region where the uterus is situated. What other evidence do women need when there menstruation comes with thick clumps of black or deoxygenated blood? Dos this not show that the blood has been retained for longer than is necessary, all its oxygen used up, and become blackened with a heavier load of carbon dioxide, a killer of cells and tissues whose trade mark is deoxygenated blood? Without adequate amounts of oxygen, how can the uterus live a useful and fruitful life? Is uterus fibroids, like cancer, not a tumour, and are tumours not cellular adjustment to oxygen deprivation in a fermentative rather than oxidative existence? These thoughts guided me to add various return insufficiency to SECOND CHAKRA challenges to the present conversation . The other 20 or so settled or partially settled ideas about possible causes of uterine fibroids will, therefore,be taugetically discussed.\n\nIt is possibly for this reason that no woman and physicians find uterine fibroids difficult to treat or cure. Where there are about 20 possible causes, how many of them can one protocol or a group of them capture? Wouldn\u2019t a therapy be like shooting in the dark? What if the culprits are outside the net?\n\nACIDOSIS\n\nThe bodies of many women are acidic. Evidence of this is the graying white carpet over the pinkish red tongue. It is a sign of candida. The fungal form has a mushroom like head, a trunk and roots buried inside the tongue. They draw nutrients and emit poisons. These poisons may affect weak organs. Candida, other fungi, bacteria and viruses are often found in uterine fibroid specimens. The answer to acidosis is alkalinity, since germs hardly grow or survive in an alkaline environment. Many women have sweet tooth, a cause of acidosis.Happily, there are many alkalising food supplements today in the Nigerian market. For people who love tea, we now have LIVEN ALKALINE COFFEE, the world\u2019s first alkaline coffee with more than 16000 alkalising and phenolic compounds extracted from more than 100 plants. We also have my Choco tea with about 20,000 of these compounds.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOXIDATIVE STRESS\n\nThis Refers to damage caused by oxygen free radicals. The body is protected against them by the natural antioxidants it produces. These include gluthatione , super oxide Dismutase(SOD) and catalyse. To produce gluthatione, the body requires from protein intake glutamic acid, clycine and cysteine . But the diet of many women is heavily carbohydrate, which is acid forming . Zinc, selenium and manganese are needed for the other antioxidants. How many women take them as food supplements?, What about other antioxidants?\n\nPOTASSIUM\n\nPls check the Gerson therapy online. Dr Max Gerson, a German , treated and cured some cases of cancer complicated by chemotherapy with fruit and vegetable juices on one hand and organic enema coffee (not edible coffee )on the other hand. Fruit and vegetable juices are rich in potassium. Bread, margarine and soft drinks have none.\n\nPotassium deficiency, therefore ,means little or no oxygen for the cell from oxygen -using(oxidative) lifestyle to a survivalist non oxygen using (fermentative) lifestyle. Dr Gerson said this was the origin of a cancer or a benign tumour.\n\nMICROBES\n\nThere are too many germs and parasites in the human body. The immune system is equipped to deal with them. But it is disoriented and weakened by a squalid, acidic internal environment. This has to be cleaned up and the immune system aided to do it\u2019s work. Were doctors and nurses in Nigeria not specially motivated to fight ebola virus and covid 19? Are the soldiers not encouraged to fight Boko Haram insurgency? Many women learn to regularly detoxify their bodies only when the small organisms have almost completely eaten them up.\n\nESTROGENATION\n\nPeriod pains from early childhood are thought of as normal for women. So are dark, blood clumps in the menstrual blood ,and breast pains. Yet these may be signalling excess of estrogen, one of the female hormones over the balancing ratio with the others. Even in the estrogen matrix of estrione, estradiol and estriol, the domination of one over the other may spell trouble. Too much estrogen vis-a-vis progesterone, may elevate the blood level of yet another female hormone, prolactin, which may cause breast troubles and shut down the ovaries from producing eggs. For men whose mothers were estrogenated while their bodies were growing in the wombs, this may cause testicular damage and inability to produce sperm in later adult life. Many women love milk, egg, poultry turkey and chicken. To make cows produce milk everyday of their lives, estrogen is added to their feed. This appears in the milk. The same happens to the chicken and the turkey and their eggs and flesh. A heavy reliance on them causes many girls nowadays to grow breasts from about the age of ten and adult women to have more estrogen in their bodies than they require. Estrogen is required for the maturation of eggs in the ovary. Progesterone is required for preparing the uterus to receive and feed the fertilised egg or , in the absence of fertilisation, to discard it and the uterine lining as menstruation. So, when there is too little for the housekeeper in the uterus, would there not be changes in there? Could one of the changes not be in the uterine fibroids?\n\nMOTHERHOOD ANXIETY\n\nGynaecologists in Europe and America now subscribe to the African notion that when a woman becomes obsessed with having a baby, either to keep her marriage or because she believes that time is running out or for whatever other reasons , the womb responds with either pseudo or dummy pregnancies or uterine fibroids. In pseudo or false pregnancy, the breast fills up, the abdomen enlarges, the skin may lighten up but the uterus is empty . Dr Christiane Northrup discusses the problem in her book WOMEN\u2019S BODIES, WOMEN\u2019S WISDOM which she wrote after 35 years of post qualification experience.\n\nMENSTRUAL RETENTION\n\nIn some women, all the menstrual blood is not evacuated. The back up is thought to irritate the uterus with retained toxins which ought to have been flushed out. While this may be a consequence of poor blood circulation, especially when gravity ought to have aided a complete flush-out, venous return insufficiency is another uterine challenge altogether, according to some authorities. In some cases, the black clumps may be dissolved and clean, clear, red menstrual flow re-established with such food supplements as Apple cider vinegar(ACV), cayenne and black pepper, Gotu Kola, camphorated castor oil massages, restore lyfe(Japanese Knot Weed and grape seed extract) , Choleduz(fish oil and vitamin E), vidamax(tomato extract and RESEVERATROL) etc. But it is horse Chestnut and butchers broom I would like to discuss today.\n\nHORSE CHESTNUT\n\nIn Frank J Lipp\u2019s herbalism, we learn:\n\nThe regular use of horse chestnut vitalises skin tissue and metabolism, and supports venous circulation in the legs, particularly during and after pregnancy.\n\nIn THE NATURE DOCTOR, Dr H.C.A Vogel advises against surgical removal of varicose veins and instead, prescribes horse Chestnut formulas along with low heel shoes, loose clothing and avoidance of standing for too long on stone or concrete floor, to avoid damage to non return valves, a cause of pulling of blood in the lower limb. For the regeneration of veins and promotion of healthy venous circulation, he recommends as well good calcium intake, yarrow, arnica and sweet clover.\n\nBUTCHER\u2019S BROOM\n\nAccording to www.Web MD.com:\n\n\u201cButchers broom is commonly taken by mouth for symptoms of poor blood circulation, such as pain, leg cramps, leg swelling, varicose veins, and itching. Butcher\u2019s broom is sometimes used for kidney stones, gallstones, \u201chardening of the arteries\u201d (atherosclerosis), constipation and many other conditions\u201d.\n\nIn www.rxlist.com, we learn:\n\n\u201cButcher\u2019s broom is used for hemorrhoids, gallstones, \u201chardening of the arteries\u201d (atherosclerosis), and for symptoms of poor blood circulation such as pain, heaviness, leg cramps, leg swelling, varicose veins, itching, and swelling. Butcher\u2019s broom is also used as a laxative, as a diuretic to increase urine output, to reduce swelling, and to speed the healing of fractures\u201d.\n\nSECOND CHAKRA\n\nThanks to surgeon Norman Sheally and spiritualist Carolyn Myss who are popularising energy medicine in the United States, Western medicine is being cross bred by eastern medicine in the knowledge area of the seven chakras. Eastern world doctors believe a human spirit exists as the overself in the lifeless earth body. In their book, THE CREATION OF HEALTH, Dr Sheally and Myss present case studies, including the healing of breast cancers without harsh medication, when chakra healing principles are applied.\n\nThe overself or the soul interfaces with the physical body at seven different points which, as now found, correspond with locations in the endocrine glands. The soul carries tremendous energy from the spirit which cannot be directly impacted on the physical body without damaging or \u201celectrocuting\u201d it. So, like the high voltage electricity stepped down by transformers for domestic use, the chakras step down energy from the spirit through the seven interfaces or chakras.\n\nThe chakras go beyond this. The earth is a spiritual school for immature human spirits expelled from paradise on a journey through the various walls for self discovery and such self development which make them admissible to their original world , the spirit realm. Each chakra corresponds to a lesson of life to be learned every seven years of one\u2019s life. The first chakra is at the base of the spine where animal tails are. In humans,it corresponds with \u201cgroundedness\u201d or feeling of security in earth life.Persons who are brought up in love and surrounded by love are more self confident and secure than those who are not and do not easily as adults, fall prey to lower limb problems such as sciatica challenges. If groundedness is not achieved in the first seven years of life, it becomes a \u201ccarry over\u201d lesson to the next seven years. Between age 8 and 14, the lesson to learn is acquisition of power and uses of it. Power is required to secure groundedness. But just here is where the problems of many people begin. They use power as parents, siblings, teachers, bosses, spouses, financiers, politicians etc to not help or support the self fufillment of persons they are superior to. Rather, they use it to enslave them. Where this becomes a pathological occupation and the \u201cprey\u201d is unyielding, the aggressor may suffer such pain of the soul and emotional distress and emotional injury as may block inflow of animating power from the second chakra to the pelvic region which it interfaces. This will lead to poor energy maintainance of the organs in this region which include the prostate gland in men, the uterus, the cervix, vagina and the tubes in women, kidneys and the large intestine. If this condition persists for too long, deterioration of these organs may occur. This is one of the hypothesis or even theory for the occurrence of uterine fibroids, according to eastern European medicine. The solution is to learn to not seek to control other people to develop pain of the soul or pathological hatred for persons and events they cannot bring under their consuming authority. In other words , \u201cletting go\u201d and preventing emotional stress in the use of power is a good natural medicine for second chakra challenges.\n\nAccording to Debra Rose in www.healthline.com:\n\n\u201cShadow issues \u2014 or negative qualities \u2014 associated with the sacral chakra include:\n\nwounded emotions\n\nsecrets\n\nfear of judgment, getting into trouble, or being \u201cfound out\u201d\n\nrepression\n\ninability to experience emotional or sexual intimacy\n\nnightmares and not remembering or understanding dreams\u201d.\n\nAccording to Jessica Estrada in www.well and good.com,There are seven different major energy centers throughout the body, from the base of the spine to the crown of the head through which this energy can flow in and out in a constant stream,\u201d says nutritionist and Reiki Master Serena Poon. \u201cThese energy centers are called chakras, Sanskrit for \u2018wheel,\u2019 and are essentially the link between our energetic and physical bodies and the universal life force energy that connects us environmentally and spiritually.\n\nCirculatory systems, reproductive organs, bladder, kidney, and large intestine\n\nSo, really, what does it mean to heal your sacral chakra? Poon explains that it\u2019s about clearing and cleansing that energy center and bringing it back into a state of balance. There are many things you can do to heal your chakras. There\u2019s talking wearing chakra-balancing jewelry.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe chakras are interesting health subjects. For this reason, everyone should endeavour to learn about them. They help healing from inside to the outside. Can we call it spiritual healing? In many cases of spontaneous healing (read Dr Andrew Weil\u2019s book, spontaneous healing on this subject). The healing patient may have done one or a few things which unblocked blocked chakras. Do we and our children not jubilate, shouting, UP NEPA!, when our deformed electricity transformers in the neighbourhood are reactivated and we are again reconnected to municipal electricity supply?\n\nSome second chakra authorities who advise healing from the outside, that is from the physical body , encourage us to drink plenty of water, especially some orange filtered solarized water (see internet for solarized water), eat plenty of orange-colour foods, wear orange colour clothes(because orange is the colour of the second chakra) and dance, among other measures.\n\nFor me, I would like healing from the inside. It involves being selfless and relating in love with everyone, trying to not enslave or take advantage of anyone, living in the knowledge that the sky is wide enough to accommodate all birds, recognising that our endowments are not ours but held by us in trust from the Creator to enjoy part of and expend the remainder in creating opportunities for his other creatures.",

          "text": "By Sunday Ani\n\nSenior lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome and the Niger Delta Congress (NDC) have faulted the position of former president Olusegun Obasanjo that crude oil deposits in the Niger Delta belongs to Federal Government and not the oil-bearing communities.\n\nObasanjo, in an open letter to Chief Edwin Clark, had argued that it was wrong for Niger Delta to claim sole ownership of oil resources found, saying it belongs to Nigeria just as any mineral resources found in any other region belongs to the country.\n\nBut in a statement entitled: \u201cI humbly disagree with Obasanjo\u2019s and his oily these\u201d, Ozekhome accused Obasanjjo of being part of successive military juntas that cleverly and systematically inserted expropriatory and inhuman laws concerning ownership of oil and gas into the Nigerian statute books.\n\nHe reminded Obasanjo said Nigeria operates a federal system of government, and that federalism is fiscal and plural.\n\n\u201cOne of the major attributes of federalism is that it ensures that regions, sub-national or federating units develop according to their pace and needs, using the God-given resources that are available to such units. They pay tax to the central government,\u201d he said.\n\nPart of the statement read: \u201cLegally speaking, Obasanjo can be said to be correct because he was part and parcel of successive military juntas that cleverly and systematically inserted expropriatory and inhuman laws concerning ownership of oil and gas into our statute books. But, does that make such laws right or justifiable? No. I think not. Ex-president Obasanjo should be told in very clear terms that there is such an overriding principle of law which goes with the maxim of \u201cquic quid plantatatur solo solo credit.\u201d This literally means that whoever owns the land owns everything on top of it.\n\n\u201cAny extant constitutional or statutory provisions ( such as those apparently referred to by Obasanjo) that run contrary to this commonsensical common law principle are therefore nothing but bad, immoral, expropriatory and exploitative laws. Help me inform President Obasanjo that a law that literally steals the resources of a people, punishing them with destruction of their only available aquatic and agrarian life, even though in the statute books, is a bad, aberrant and obnoxious law.\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta region has been repressed, suppressed, marginalised and neglected. Respected Obasanjo, more than any other person,knows this very well, having had the rare privilege of governing Nigeria both in khaki and agbada. The poor people have had to pay with their sweat, sorrow, tears, blood, pains and pangs, over their God-given wealth. The wealth has become a curse rather than a blessing. I wholly disagree with Obasanjo\u2019s thesis. I rather embrace wholly embrace Pa E.K.Clark\u2019s anthesis, which wears a human face.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, NDC dismissed Obasanjo\u2019s arguments on the legalities of the expropriation of land and resources of Niger Delta as absurd.\n\nIn a statement by its spokesman, Ovunda Eni, yesterday, the group stressed that it was the right of the people of the region to control their resources and determine their socio-political future within or without the Nigerian state.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe Niger Delta Congress has already begun the process of collating signatures of the representatives of the different ethnic nationalities of the region for the Niger Delta Peoples Charter which asserts the right of the people of the region to control their resources and determine their socio-political future within or without the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cThe NDC would like to use this opportunity to state clearly that it will resist any move to foist any constitution that does not take cognisance of the demands of our people as captured in the Niger Delta Peoples Charter adopted on October 8, 2021, at the Niger Delta Peoples Conference in Yenagoa,\u201d he said.\n\nEni lamented that despite Obasanjo\u2019s admittance that the land and mineral resources of the region sustained the civil war, he was still taunting the people to be appreciative of the outcome of the war on the premise that their situation would have been worse if Biafra had won.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate these revelations, and although they aren\u2019t new to us, in these uncertain times, it is important for the Niger Delta people to take note of this fact that its territory and people are seen by the larger nationalities as war booty won and/or lost and this thinking is what has and continues to influence the relationship between the nationalities of the Niger Delta and the larger nationalities; not neighbours, not brothers, not comrades, not friends, but war booty,\u201d he said.\n\nNDC Obasanjo\u2019s understanding of fairness and equity to mean the suppression of ethnic nationalities, or tribes so the state could emerge.\n\n\u201cWhat he failed to reveal here but which can be deduced from previous paragraphs is that suppressing \u2018tribes\u2019 in a state is in reality nothing more than an attempt to create a state where smaller nationalities are silenced, or annihilated so their lands and resources are annexed and controlled by the larger ethnic nations who also make up the state. We have seen the ruthlessness with which this suppression as a strategy has been applied, most importantly with the genocide in Odi which left over 10 percent of the population dead in 1999; a genocide perpetrated by Nigerian troops when Obasanjo was the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cObasanjo stating that he would continue to push for the suppression of \u2018tribes\u2019 in the Nigerian state until he \u2018breathes\u2019 his \u2018last\u2019 is pledging allegiance to a genocidal ideology. Such audacity can only come when a man has successfully carried out a massacre on the scale of Odi,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group accused Obasanjo and his collaborators within and outside the Niger Delta of planning to shortchange the people once again as has been done since 1960 through his Committee for Goodness of Nigeria (CGN).\n\nIt accused the CGN of planning to recommend 18 percent derivation to those who can take action as part of moves to prepare a new constitution before the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThis is insulting to the Niger Delta, and at this point, it is important to state clearly that the agitations of the Niger Delta people since time immemorial have revolved around economic and political autonomy or resource control, which is contained in the different declarations and charters that have emanated from the region since the Rumuomasi declaration of 1965,\u201d the statement said.",

          "title": "Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence. Nkongho died on December 26, 2021.\n\nNkongho had over 15 years of experience in identifying, building, and capturing value for corporations and funds in Africa is the founding partner of Otundi Ventures, a pan-African early-stage fund. She was also a founding investor at Digital Growth Africa (DiGAME), one of Africa\u2019s earliest (2016) institutional venture investing organisations, which has deployed about $35 million in the series A/B rounds of high-growth, tech-enabled businesses including Getsmarter (exited to 2U, Inc.), SWVL, 10X Investments, and Rhino Safaris Africa.\n\nPrior to that, she was a founding team member at Nubuke Investments, a $75 million multi-strategy pan-African fund.\n\nOutside investing, she briefly worked as an African c-suite executive via her roles as the Head of Business Development, SOLO Phone Nigeria, and Head of Strategy & Business Development, Etisalat Nigeria.\n\nEarlier in her career, she spent seven years working at global financial services companies, Morgan Stanley (New York and Hong Kong) and at Merrill Lynch (London).\n\nNkongho was a Kauffman fellow, with an MBA from Columbia Business School and a B.A. from Princeton University.\n\nAs a Nigerian-American, Nkongho spent her formative years in the US, with occasional visits to Nigeria, especially to see her grandmother in eastern Nigeria. It was these visits that opened her eyes to the transformation that was taking place in Africa, making her shift her focus to working in the African investment space.\n\nNnena Nkogho by Kunmi Owopetu\n\nAn ardent believer in the power of technology, she explained why she eagerly supports the African tech ecosystem, in this interview.\n\n\u201cMy grandmother was a farmer in eastern Nigeria, but not a very [successful] one. She would wake up at the crack of dawn to fetch water. She would then carry large containers of water on her head to the rocky soil of her small plot of land. Over the past five years, I\u2019ve seen technology change the lives of smallholder farmers like my grandmother. I\u2019ve seen businesses use the mobile platform to offer value-added services\u2014provide loans for better seeds, automatically irrigate land, and find better markets (and pricing) for harvested goods. Technology-enabled investing can transform lives. To me, that\u2019s the most impactful thing that you can do.\u201d\n\nThe African and global technology ecosystem mourns the loss of their colleague, friend, peer, and mentor. As a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal has been granted the opportunity to publish tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime. May her soul rest in eternal peace.\n\n(L-R) Nnena Nkongho, Principal, DiGAME; Taiwo Ketiku, VP Investments, EchoVC; Omobola Johnson; Senior Partner, TLcom and Osarumen Osamuyi, Founder, The SubTxt (Moderator) at TechCabal Townhall Mobility event.\n\nEghosa Omoigui, founder, EchoVC Partners\n\nAbsolutely devastated to hear of the passing of @NnenaP, an amazing woman, friend, investor, & long-time believer in & contributor to the African tech ecosystem.\n\n\n\nAs one of the few Black female @KauffmanFellows, she was a shining light to many.\n\n\n\nMy condolences to her family.#RIP \u2014 Eghosa Omoigui (@EghosaO) December 26, 2021\n\nIdris Bello, founder, LoftyInc\n\nVery early on as we were figuring out our Fund journey at LoftyInc Capital, a mutual friend introduced me to Nnena who was then at Digame Investment. We met up and by the time we were done, she had shortened my VC journey, while sharing great insights from her own journey. Over the last year, I have kept tabs on her as she set up Otundi and worked harder than anyone I have seen to build her new fund. Hence, her death comes as a rude shock, especially at this opportune moment for venture capital on the African continent. On behalf of LoftyInc Capital, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Nnena\u2019s family and friends and the folks at Otundi. She will be missed.\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, Big Cabal Media\n\nNnenna was a wonderful person, generous, cheerful and helpful to a fault. She was a close friend and supporter of our work at TechCabal, ready to offer advice, connections and knowledge whenever we asked it of her. She checked in on us and offered encouragement at those times when it was most needed. She will be greatly missed by us all. May she rest her peace and God comfort her family and loved ones.\n\nEmilian Popa, Ilara Health\n\nYou started out as a colleague and became a friend over the years. Your thoughtful advice and friendship will be missed. Rest in peace.\n\nDotun Olowoporoku, Novastar Ventures\n\nI first met Nnena at a conference in Kigali in 2020. The last time we met was over dinner a few weeks ago at another conference in Abu Dhabi. I\u2019m always grateful for the time we spent discussing and debating. Nnena was super thoughtful, willing to help and deeply insightful. She was one of a rare breed of institutional VCs in Africa who had been active for a long time in the region, and yet remained genuinely curious about what came next. It\u2019s devastating that we\u2019re losing her when we really need more African VC fund managers like her. She will be greatly missed.\n\nKarim Shariff, Managing Partner, Majlis Investments\n\nNnena. What beautiful energy and willingness to listen to perspective. Her memory attached her to Africa. Her imagination will bring her back. A sense of culture, geography, and technology. Always tirelessly moving. We met, over the years, in New York, London, Dubai, and Nairobi. She knew these places intimately. I know I will miss her and her lens on everything.\n\nIyin Aboyeji, founder, Future Africa\n\nNnenna was a force of nature, a real one. She always had the courage to say what everyone was thinking but dreading to say. This was where we found a common cause. No one was ever in doubt of where they stood with her. Her impact in our industry was silent but potent. The Get Smarter deal is one for the ages. Our industry will miss her. May her soul Rest In Peace and may GOD give her family and friends the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\nSteven Grin, managing partner, Lateral Capital.\n\nNnena was a friend, colleague, and an intellectual sparring partner with no BS, in a world filled with so much fakery. She was relentlessly curious and had that rare combination of being strong and vulnerable at the same time. She was a trailblazer and deeply committed to the African tech ecosystem, especially at a time when most LPs did not believe in the asset clas. I know she was particularly excited about the work she was doing with Kauffman, her new fund, Otundi, and her support to emerging female managers. Being one of a few female general partners in our space, we have lost a real lion. I can only trust, somehow, that we will all continue in her honour, doing our part, to keep up the work.\n\nMari\u00e8me Diop \u2013 Orange Ventures.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days since I heard the devastating news of Nnena\u2019s passing. I have been processing it since then\u2026, and after the tears, questions, sorrow, remembrance, and acceptance\u2026, it still hurts to know that she\u2019s gone forever.\n\nI liked Nnena very much. I met her almost five years ago. We hit it off straight away and have stayed in touch ever since. She was always supportive, enthusiastic, empathetic, and so hard-working. These past six months after she started Otundi Ventures, we had wonderful conversations once or twice a week, and she always had great insights on how to address the root cause of gender inequality and biases in our industry.\n\nShe fought hard not only to get a seat at the table but to build her own and hence forge a path for women investors in Africa.\n\nNnena cared about people. She loved the arts and creative minds. Even when she was very busy, we sent each other encouraging messages, and she was always advising me to take care of myself. I am glad that she knew how much I valued her, which I told her for the umpteenth time in our last conversation, a few days before she left this world. Nnena, you will be really missed, and I will continue to hold you warmly in my heart. Rest in peace, my friend. My deepest condolences to her family and friends.\n\nWale Ayeni \u2013 IFC | World Bank Group\n\nThis is difficult to write. Nnena was a giant. She was ebullient, extremely dedicated, and cared deeply about Africa. Her passion for the ecosystem and for founders was palpable, and I will miss our hour-long conversations on the ecosystem. I, and we, have lost a colleague and trusted friend. Her energy is irreplaceable. We will miss you Nnena, and we won\u2019t forget.\n\nIK Kanu, founding partner, Atlantica Ventures\n\nNnena was always real to me and everyone that met her. She was always positive, smiling, and quick to lend an ear or hand. We met years ago, and strengthened our friendship during our Kauffman Fellowship. She was strong, confident, yet humble and kind. Always laughing and looking forward to better days ahead. Rest well with God my dear friend.\n\nRomain Diaz \u2013 Founder & CEO, Satgana\n\nI am deeply saddened that my mentor, Nnena P. Nkongho, has left this world. I met Nnena five years ago in Cape Town, and she has been one of the most important people in my professional development ever since. From a mentor, she became a friend, advisor, and confidant.\n\nI am profoundly grateful for all the countless hours that she selflessly spent to help me figure things out, solve problems, strategise, and grow.\n\nEvery hour I spent with her equated to months of accelerated development, thanks to the right blend that she always brought between validating me and challenging me. She is the one who pushed me to pursue a vision that later gave birth to Satgana. She believed in me when I sometimes didn\u2019t. I wish all entrepreneurs out there find their own Nnena.\n\nIf anything, as I have been told by another dear friend and business partner, I should honour her by making this company as successful as she believed it would become. Thank you for everything, Nnena. You\u2019ll leave a hole in my life and those around you.\n\nRest in peace. Much love.\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nArun Iyer \u2013 Alpha Direct Insurance\n\nNnena was an incredibly astute individual and investor. In the brief time in which I got to know her and the interactions we had, she became a friend and partner, giving me advice and being open, honest, and straightforward about everything she did, every interaction we had. She gave me the inspiration to aim higher and push harder because she believed in us founders as much as we believed in ourselves. She understood our business so quickly and well, and she had an incredible ability to be forthright and candid while staying supportive and encouraging. She thought like a founder, and her optimism and enthusiasm were infectious.\n\nWe lost a true gem of a human being. It\u2019s a big loss for the entire African technology ecosystem and the world at large. May her soul rest in eternal peace, and I pray for her family and loved ones to find the strength and courage to deal with her loss.\n\nCraig McLeod \u2013 Box Commerce\n\nNnena Nkongho was one of the greatest champions of the African tech ecosystem as a VC, leader, pioneer and, hands down, one of its smartest players. She was a great mentor, friend and peer. In an ecosystem of only a handful of giants, she stood tall. She will be missed.\n\nLeonard Stiegeler \u2013 Founder, Pulse Africa\n\nI was deeply saddened to hear of Nnenna\u2019s passing.\n\nShe was a kind, joyous, and thoughtful person that I was lucky to meet in different places around Africa & in the UAE, over the years. Every time we met, we had great discussions and I left smarter than I had come.\n\nNnenna\u2019s impact in the African technology and venture capital space will live on. Her support for entrepreneurs, businesses, and industries will facilitate opportunities for young people and economies for generations to come.\n\nMy thoughts are with her loved ones and friends.\n\nIbrahim Sagna \u2013 AFREXIMBANK\n\nSome people show up in your life and leave without notice, not realising how they have impacted you. Such individuals are so consumed by their mission to share what they know that they are not counting or keeping tabs of their impact. Instead, they remain busy improving other people\u2019s lives. Rumi\u2014Persian poet and philosopher\u2014reminds us that, \u201ca candle never loses any of its light while lighting up another candle\u201d.\n\nNnena Nkongho is such a candle. She is that sister who comes into your life without notice; that missionary who enlightens you with the breadth of her knowledge and network in African tech investment and leaves you forever impacted. I had just moved to Cairo, and in one small trip, she had managed to plug me into the local ecosystem and left me at first curious, then ultimately full of passion for the sector and its players.\n\nThe reality is that Nnena was not just remarkable because of her knowledge, network, or dedication to startups. She was remarkable because her fundamental character combined humility and ingenuity on the one hand, and calmness and a zest for life on the other. She gave and gave. She was selfless. We will all miss a phenomenal human.\n\nHer departure leaves many of us in shock. May she rest in perfect peace. Hereby extending our most sincere condolences to her family.\n\nSamer Salty, Managing Partner, Zouk Capital\n\nYou could always tell you are in the presence of a gentle soul when you are speaking with Nnena. She always cared about people, regardless of their walk of life. For her, doing good is good business. It was a great pleasure to have worked with her and known her. We will miss you, Nnena.\n\nIdo Sum, Andreata, and the TLcom team\n\nWe met Nnena first in 2013, through a mutual friend at Kuramo, one of Africa\u2019s very first fund of funds. She was just out of Columbia Business School, helping Africa founders in the very early days of the African tech ecosystem, and keen to play a role in its formation. Our first chat was a sign for the years to come. She was a super open, honest, smart, nice, deliberate, and driven person.\n\nWe remained friends, and over the years after she joined DiGAME, started sharing investment opportunities and insights with each other. Nnena was a voice we listened to. Grounded, rounded, thoughtful, and most importantly, in the early days of African tech, a true optimist.\n\nIn the coming years, our paths crossed many more times. Drinks in Cape Town, dinners in Kigali, Zooms, WhatsApp messages\u2026 She was always keen to collaborate. She was full of good humour and lightened the load of life with a good laugh. When Nnena decided to launch her own fund, we couldn\u2019t have been happier. A women-led team, with a great perspective of the scene\u2019s evolvement and exits expertise, nothing could stand in her way.\n\nOur last catch up was just a few weeks back. As always, future-looking, with her eyes set to conquer the next summit ahead. Little did we know at that time\u2026\n\nWe stand broken-hearted at the loss of one of our true friends in this journey. Nnena will forever be in our hearts. A true leader, early visionary and, above all, a mensch. You will forever be in our hearts.\n\nRaj Kulasingam, Senior Counsel, Dentons\n\nI met Nnena many years ago when venture in Africa was a desert. Since then, whenever we met, I was always struck by her warmth, genuineness, and willingness to share her experience and knowledge.\n\nHer passing will be felt by many I know. I hope we can remember her not only for the contributions she made but also for her warmth and humanity.\n\nStephan Breban, CEO, Giants\u2019 Shoulders Capital Limited\n\nThe first thing to say is that this has hit me far more than I expected. Maybe because she was always so full of life. I\u2019ve lost people closer to me, and in the current environment, it should not be too shocking. But this is. I know many people know her and remember her fondly. There will be many tributes to her intelligence and general investment and tech brilliance, and so I\u2019m going for another angle. I\u2019m going to share my favourite memory of Nnena. We met many times in many different cities, and she would always know the best spot for coffee. She was a proper authority. The first time I met her in London, I knew I had to do something special. No coffee was ever going to impress her, so I took her here, a Victorian urinal that had been converted to a coffee shop. Not sure I can say she loved it, but I made an impression! If you ever get to London, please visit Fitzrovia, have a coffee there, and try to imagine Nnena\u2019s reaction.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "GetEquity is changing startup investment in Africa. But how?",
          "text": "GetEquity, a Nigeria-based investment platform, came into the market with the mantra of \u201cchallenging the status quo of startup financing and venture capital\u201d in Africa. The company says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nLooking back at its activities, that mantra doesn\u2019t seem like a mere marketing play, the startup is indeed walking the talk. But how is it doing that?\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July this year, GetEquity is a product of a series of iterations. Initially, the co-founders didn\u2019t set out to democratise startup investment in Africa. In fact, Dike and Okafor, who are blockchain engineers, were building a blockchain exchange platform, and Temitope was working around a big data analytics product. But, on getting into the Mozilla Accelerator, the trio realised that they could \u201cmerge forces\u201d and build one of the most innovative products in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cI met Temitope at the Mozilla Accelerator after we\u2019d bantered on Twitter for the longest time. I and William are technical persons and Temitope is a business operator, so I asked Temitope to help us figure out the business side of our product and we\u2019d help him build a technical team for his product,\u201d said Dike, CEO at GetEquity. Apparently, this was the supposed skill trade that would lead to the founding of GetEquity.\n\nThis is how disruption looks like\n\nTake a look at this: Shola, 25, wants to invest in a high-growth startup but doesn\u2019t know where to start, and when he finally finds some answers, his cheque is not enough to be an LP or even get him into an angel syndicate. So, he gives up. On the other side of things, Ada, a young founder, is struggling to raise enough capital to keep her startup running. So, she shuts down the business.\n\nBut what if Ada could find 10, 20, 100, or even more, of Shola who only have maybe $100 or less to invest? She could have raised close to what she needed to keep her business alive. This simple thinking led to building GetEquity.\n\nAcross the world, investing in early-stage businesses is not usually a public affair; it is mostly available to capital institutions, top-tier individual angel investors, syndicates (a group of angel investors), and sometimes, family and friends. Though this is still largely the case, startups like GetEquity are making a decent effort to disrupt this privileged arrangement and open up the space to any interested party.\n\nOn GetEquity, startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nFor instance, Herconomy, a fintech startup for women, closed a $100,000 pre-seed funding round within 24 hours on the platform. That\u2019s 20% of the total funding raised and the portion reserved for its community. Before now, the possibility of a Nigerian startup closing a funding round\u2014both the seeds and the series\u2014within 24 hours was not only a tall order but a fantasy.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Fluidcoins, TalentQL and Mizala have closed $30,000, $25,000, and $25,000, respectively, from users who weren\u2019t necessarily part of their communities.\n\nTo clear the misconception that GetEquity was built on blockchain technology, the CEO said their technology only employs the core blockchain concept, which is tokenisation. \u201cBlockchain is all about ownership, accessibility and security, and we have borrowed this core concept to tokenise funding on our platform,\u201d Dike said.\n\nThis means, when a company wants to raise $50,000, it\u2019s technically selling 5,000 tokens at $10 per one.\n\nDue diligence and investment security\n\nOne of the most important and heaviest stages of investment is due diligence (DD); it\u2019s at this point the worthiness of a company is being tested. A lot of checks and notes comparisons happen at this stage. The question now is if investors can\u2019t carry out DD individually, how do they then know that a business is worth investing in?\n\nApparently, GetEquity operates like every other VC: its team of diverse backgrounds\u2014law, marketing, investment, business development\u2014analyse the potential growth of a startup before onboarding them on their platform. If that\u2019s the case, one can chose to question the validity of the disruption the company promises to bring into startup investment. Isn\u2019t this just a digital VC? Well, it is and it isn\u2019t. GetEquity\u2019s DD process is reportedly fast and doesn\u2019t hold startup to ridiculous equity shares, unlike most conventional VCs.\n\n\u201cWe look through the entire business\u2014the model, product roadmap, founder(s), traction, and revenue. We ensure the business is solid before we enlist them on our platform,\u201d said the company\u2019s head of growth Ekundayo, who doubles as joint CEO at Printivo.\n\nHowever, Ekundayo mentioned that even though the company\u2019s approach to DD is thorough, the company can\u2019t guarantee investors ROI on all their investments. And that\u2019s why GetEquity accepts investments as low as $10; this way investors can minimise risk by putting in small money across a number of startups.\n\nGrowth and Traction\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 GetEquity raised in April this year, it also raised an undisclosed six-figures pre-seed from Green House Capital, a renowned fintech investment shop based in Nigeria, and this validates the potential of its products. Since the investment, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nGetEquity has released a couple of features that make investing on its platform even better; it launches secondaries where users can sell off their equity (token) according to its present value. For instance, if a user wishes to sell their token after buying and keeping for a while, all they need to do is indicate their interest to sell and they will be matched with a buyer, and vice versa.\n\nThe startup also recently just released Dealroom, a feature that allows users, mostly syndicates, to privately raise money faster. Think of a private room where you can quickly meet with your family and then convince them to commit to a course, but here, the course is raising money.\n\nGetEquity has a wallet infrastructure that users can use to hold value until ready to invest in their chosen startup. It charges between 0.5-5% on every transaction, depending on the payment option chosen. There\u2019s also an option to fund a wallet with crypto for those living where crypto dealings aren\u2019t frowned at, thanks to its partnership with Fluidcoin, another startup that has raised on its platform. The company also charges startups 4% commission on transaction.\n\nBoth local and international investors are bullish on Africa, especially Nigeria, which recorded the largest funding of about $1.4 billion out of almost $5 billion funding raised by African startups in 2021.

          "title": "Inside Jack Dorsey\u2019s Btrust members\u2019 plan to facilitate financial freedom",
          "text": "Bitcoin technology is powered by software developers or contributors that work on a pro bono basis. So, the Bitcoin infrastructure would be threatened if these highly skilled developers refuse to work or are not skilled enough to maintain the code that sustains the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIn recent times, there have been efforts to prevent this from happening by supporting Bitcoin software developers to make Bitcoin more private, resilient, and decentralised. In May, popular crypto derivatives exchange, BitMEX, partnered with global non-profit, Human Rights Foundation (HRF), to provide a $150,000 grant for Calvin Kim, a Korea-based Bitcoin scaling researcher, and a $50,000 grant for Abubakar Nur Khalil, a Nigeria-based Bitcoin wallet developer.\n\nIn February this year, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, Jack Dorsey, had also taken a similar path when he announced that he was launching a new endowment called \u201c\u20bftrust\u201d, in partnership with rapper Jay-Z, to fund Bitcoin development in India and Africa.\n\nHe promised to donate 500 bitcoins ($23 million) to the endowment fund and give its board complete autonomy to use the funds as they deemed fit. But he has one ask: \u201cMake Bitcoin the Internet\u2019s currency.\u201d\n\nLast week, he unveiled the members of the board\u2014four of them\u2014to the world: Nigeria\u2019s Abubakar Nur Khalil, Obi Nwosu, and Ojoma Ochai; and South Africa\u2019s Carla Kirk-Cohen.\n\nBoard members with a game plan\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account. He became a contributor to Bitcoin Core\u2014there are less than 40 of them in the world\u2014when he was just 19. But the journey began in late 2017 when he heard about Bitcoin\u2019s price and started reading about it. The following year, he got into programming and built a blockchain-based app, before becoming a contributor to Bitcoin Core in 2019.\n\nIn 2020, he co-founded Recursive Capital, a venture capital that provides crypto-focused startups with seed and early-stage investments, with the aim of contributing to the development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Recursive Capital is on a mission to facilitate online sovereignty\u2014tools, protocols, and ventures that democratise data ownership and promote privacy, encryption, and financial sovereignty\u2014all driven by Bitcoin. Despite being founded before the Web 3.0 buzz, Recursive Capital had decided that it wanted to enhance financial freedom by decentralising the financial monetary system.\n\nAbubakar Nur Khalil, 22, does not have a traditional bank account.\n\nKhalil, who was recently named Recursive Capital\u2019s CEO\u2014after serving as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO)\u2014explained that Recursive Capital realised that Africa\u2019s financial infrastructure is underdeveloped and cannot handle the amount of load being put on it.\n\nHe explained that this is why it is hard to send and receive money across two African countries, and even more difficult across continents. But he believes that Bitcoin will level the playing field since the requirements for participating are low. All you need is a phone and internet access, and a bitcoin address or lightning address\u2014think email address but for Bitcoin.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is democratising financial freedom on a global scale. It is also providing a unified monetary network where individuals from any part of the globe can transact instantly and have settlement across the global ecosystem cheaply,\u201d he told TechCabal in a call.\n\nTalking about the barrier to entry for Bitcoin, Khalil believes a misconception lies in the way people approach it. He explained that Bitcoin should be seen as an investment over a long time. This way, investors don\u2019t bother about how high its current price is. He also believes that an easy-to-use interface on mobile and web-based wallets should be created, so that non-technical individuals can use Bitcoin. This would help in lowering the barriers to entry.\n\nEarlier this year, after realising there is a dearth of Bitcoin developers in Nigeria and Africa, Khalil also founded Qala, to begin a revolutionary campaign of expanding the pool of Bitcoin and lightning developers on the continent.\n\nAll selected \u20bftrust board members\n\nOjoma Ochai, one of the newly appointed board members to \u20bftrust, explained that her selection was based on a combination of her experience in Africa\u2019s creative and digital economy and demonstrated interest in writing and talking about emerging technologies on the continent. Ochai has vast experience in non-profit management and governance across Africa and has run creative and digital economy projects across policy and practice in these sectors, on the continent and beyond. She also has board experience, being the board chair of the British Council Nigeria Programmes entity for two years. She was also involved in initiatives like the African Tech and Creative Group, which aims to capture value for African creatives and the tech sector.\n\nOchai also started a company with CcHub, The Creative Economy Practice, to capture more value for the African creative economy through projects that stimulate innovation and technology and enhance value chains and business models.\n\nWhat will Bitcoin do for Africa?\n\nKhalil believes in educating and enlightening individuals about Bitcoin\u2019s long-term benefits: economic freedom for the entire continent. Khalil believes Africa needs Bitcoin more because the currency of most of its countries are volatile, making it pointless for people to save long term in their native currencies.\n\nHe said that the reason many people see Bitcoin as volatile is that they approach it as a short-term asset: \u201dBitcoin is only volatile in a short timescale\u2014 a week, three months. But if you look at the asset across, for example, an entire year, it is quite stable, compared to some national currencies.\u201d\n\nOn fraud claims around Bitcoin, Khalil argues that Bitcoin is one of the most open monetary systems because the majority of fraudulent transactions still pass through the traditional financial system, where it is relatively easy to track parties involved.\n\nOchai believes that bitcoin will eventually become a viable medium for Africans to do business without restrictions. She added that it would also help the creative industries easily monetise content.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for Africans to be more involved in building solutions that work for us so that we move away from the paradigm of things being done to us and for us to a paradigm where we contribute our skills, worldview, and capabilities towards solving our own problems and being part of a global seismic shift,\u201d Ochai said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve come across the buzzword, non-fungible tokens (NFT) on the Internet, chances are you have also seen the latest buzzword \u2014 Web3. Both words are generated by proponents of blockchain technology and crypto heads who believe it is the future of the Internet.\n\nAlthough some people like Elon Musk have said the word is a mere \u201cmarketing buzzword than reality right now,\u201d a deeper look at it suggests it could change not just the Internet but the world economy as we know it. But before I suggest that Musk could be wrong and sound like a crypto head myself, what exactly is Web3?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting web3 is real \u2013 seems more marketing buzzword than reality right now \u2013 just wondering what the future will be like in 10, 20 or 30 years. 2051 sounds crazy futuristic! \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 20, 2021\n\nWhat is Web3?\n\nWeb3 is simply the Internet that belongs to everyone. A decentralised World Wide Web owned by no one but run based on everyone\u2019s decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo get a deeper understanding of what Web3 is and the rationale behind its formation, it is important to start from the beginning \u2014 the first and second generations of the web and how they\u2019re different from the imminent third generation.\n\nWeb1: The beginning\n\nWeb1 is the earliest version of what we call the Internet today. According to a 2014 paper by Nupur Choudhury, World Wide Web and Its Journey from Web 1.0 to Web 4.0, the Web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1989. He envisioned the Web in three ways: a Web of documents (Web1), a Web of people (Web2) and a Web of data (Web3).\n\nIt is accurately referred to as \u201cread-only web\u201d as there were very few visuals besides text. Unlike today\u2019s Internet that allows users to interact with information online, users of Web1 were more passive and only read things online.\n\nThere was no comment section like you have on the Techpoint Africa website or Twitter or Facebook where you air your views or share your opinion about someone else\u2019s. To get an excellent example of what Web1 is like, visit Cameron\u2019s World, a web-collage of text and images from 1994 to 2009. Another great example will be what CNN used to look like in 2000.\n\nBerners-Lee is a British scientist who worked at Organisation Europ\u00e9enne pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire (CERN). He submitted the proposal for what is known as the Internet today as an effective communication system at CERN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim-Berners-Lee. Source: Britannica\n\nHowever, Berners-Lee realised that what he had proposed was far more powerful than just being a communication system within CERN but for the whole world. He and Robert Cailliau, a Belgian computer scientist, decided to connect information on the Web with hypertext and the Internet was formed.\n\nInterestingly, the first iteration of the Internet was very different from what we have now. To millennials or Gen Zs, Web1 was more or less looking at an offline doc.\n\nWeb2: Current dispensation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Web1 looks like\n\nBy 2004 the era of Web1 was about to fade away and the second iteration of the Internet was on its way. It would mark the beginning of user-generated content on the web. The same way Web3 is causing a stir now on the Internet, the coming of Web2 also did the same thing. It was dubbed a movement and a new wave of social services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the words of Tim O\u2019 Riley, Co-Founder of the O\u2019Riley Media and the man who popularised the term Web2, \u201cWeb 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as a platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform.\n\n\u201cChief among those rules is this: Build applications that harness network effects to get better the more people use them.\u201d\n\nWeb2 was truly transformative; it birthed social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, which have dominated online social interactions to date. Cloud computing, eCommerce, financial services and many of the things we enjoy on the Internet today were only possible with the creation of Web2.\n\nAlthough Web2 stirred as much excitement as Web3 is doing now, people calmed down when Web2 became an everyday thing.\n\nThis is Web3\n\nWeb3 underpins the idea behind the creation of cryptocurrencies which is simply decentralisation. The technologies behind cryptocurrency, such as blockchain and cryptography, will also be a crucial part of Web3.\n\nLike Web2, Web3 wants to make the Internet more inclusive but, in contrast, take control away from big corporations like Facebook, Google, and Amazon. It aims to do this by decentralising the Internet.\n\nMat Dryhurst, a Berlin artist and a proponent of the Web3 revolution, says, \u201cThere\u2019s a small group of companies that own all this stuff, and then there\u2019s us who use it, and despite the fact that we contribute to the success of these platforms, we don\u2019t have anything to show for it.\u201d\n\nBut how will Web3 give people control of the Internet? We\u2019re already seeing a glimpse of how Web3 will work with the advent of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, for example, does not belong to anyone and every data on the Bitcoin network is not in a single place, it\u2019s everywhere.\n\nWhat to prepare for with Web3\n\nWith Web3, user data on the Internet is not held by Google or Facebook; it\u2019s on a blockchain that belongs to everyone. According to Business Insider Africa, you\u2019ll only need a single account to do anything on the Internet. For example, the same account will be used for Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Spotify, Jumia, Bolt, and even Techpoint Africa.\n\nBasically, all of the applications and websites online will be decentralised. So, we\u2019ll log in to these applications the same way we use the Web3 wallet, Metamask, to log into blockchain platforms like decentralised finance.\n\nFor example, to buy or upload an NFT on OpenSea, an NFT market, you only need to connect your Metamask wallet, and it identifies you. The same Metamask wallet can be used to log in to other NFT marketplaces like Rarible and SuperRare. In fact, decentralised finance platforms (DeFi), decentralised exchanges (DEX) and virtually every Web3-enabled application will work with that same wallet.\n\nAnother huge part of Web3 will be artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI works with Web2, the third generation of the Internet will help AI understand the content on the web the same way humans do, making AI a lot smarter. In an example by CoinMarketCap, AI will not just understand words but the emotions behind the words with something called Semantic Web, a writing standard on the web that makes online content readable for AI and machines.\n\nIt is important to note that a large part of what Web3 is said to be capable of hasn\u2019t been seen or tested. However, many venture capitalists seem to believe strongly in the Web3 future.\n\nThis year alone, $27 billion has been raised by Web3-related startups, which is over 1,200% more than what the whole African startup ecosystem raised in 2019 and 2020 combined.\n\nGetting started with Web3 in 2022\n\nAlthough the idea of Web3 isn\u2019t fully formed, platforms that embody the concept already exist, and they\u2019re creating sources of collaboration and income for people. Such platforms include decentralised autonomous organisations (DAO), DeFi platforms, crypto gaming platforms, and even the metaverse.\n\nHowever, there are financial and educational barriers to entering these platforms as they\u2019re very new and complicated. So, the first step to getting started with Web3 will be learning, for instance, knowing how to get into the world of non-fungible tokens.\n\nWhile Web3 might be a new concept, there\u2019s quite enough content about it on the Internet, and a quick Google search could do a lot of wonders.\n\nWhen it comes to earning with Web3, on the other hand, a quick search on the Internet might not cut it. However, gaming seems like the least risky way to profit from the new Internet iteration.\n\nIn Africa, platforms like the Metaverse Magna have made it easy to profit from crypto gaming with their scholarship programme. It provides players with the assets they need to compete on crypto gaming platforms such as Axie Infinity, where they can earn up to $2,000 a month.\n\nA career in Web3 is also another path to profiting from it in 2022. Web3 and blockchain experts are in high demand as the field is still new. Dapp University is a great place to start learning about careers within Web3.\n\nWhile Web3 might be the shiny new future of the Internet, only time will tell if it will deliver on its many promises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2021, due to strong pushbacks from the US government, lawmakers, and parents, Meta (formerly Facebook), Instagram\u2019s parent company, was forced to halt the development of Instagram for Kids for children aged 13 years and below.\n\nThe argument was based on leaked intel revealing that Instagram contributes to the increasing rate of anxiety and depression among teenage girls.\n\nHowever, the global tech company pushed back, claiming that an exclusive photo-sharing platform for children would help parents better supervise their children and control their experience instead of relying on Instagram.\n\nAn official comment from Instagram revealed that parental permission would be required to sign up to join the app. It would not have ads and would only have age-appropriate content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe public pushback could be considered suspicious because YouTube, Facebook Messenger, and TikTok already have similar children-exclusive platforms. Apps that don\u2019t develop separate versions have safety/parental control tools.\n\nThis is no coincidence. Social media companies that were created without children\u2019s plans have realised that it is almost unrealistic to build fail-safe underage controls on their platforms to give a level of control to parents. Besides, the age that children have to be before they can use internet-enabled phones has become younger and younger.\n\nOn a macro scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by dole777 on Unsplash\n\nThe approach to addressing the issue of online safety for children \u2014 a global concern \u2014 differs across platforms. Nearly all social media platforms have age restrictions of at least 13 years to use their platform. These restrictions are supported mainly by countries\u2019 data protection regulations.\n\nAll these restrictions are necessary to avoid inappropriate and age-sensitive suggestions popping up on children\u2019s timelines. Also, it would protect them from Internet predators. But this does not necessarily protect young users from other issues that might affect them during their initial exposure to social media \u2014 like an addiction that can preclude anxiety, depression, and other mental challenges.\n\nWhen we discussed the highly addictive nature of social media during one of Techpoint Africa\u2019s team bonding sessions, most of the team opined that just as children below a certain age should be protected from addictive substances, they should also be kept away from social media.\n\nWith many divided on the move, China\u2019s regulatory authority has implemented regulations requiring social media and gaming companies to disincentivise youth from spending too much time on social media.\n\nVideo-sharing app, Douyin \u2014 similar to TikTok \u2014 does not allow people below 18 who open it in Youth Mode to use the platform for more than 40 minutes at a time. Also, the app becomes inaccessible between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. and it screens content.\n\nMeanwhile, a new set of rules was recently released for gaming platforms to only allow young users to play games between 8 pm and 9 pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and on official holidays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile other countries might not take this route, they often find legal means to check the activities of these platforms. In Instagram\u2019s case, US lawmakers stood their ground.\n\nA cursory glance at a report that surveyed nearly 3,000 parents of teenagers in the US shows that parents are aware of the dangers of having their children online, but they either don\u2019t know how to go about it or admit in resignation that it is a necessary evil.\n\n\u201cHow do you want to keep track of your child\u2019s online activities without getting drained or getting them riled up to the point of finding loopholes to get back at you?\u201d complains one bemused parent.\n\nPlatforms and companies can establish restrictive rules, but parents and guardians have a part to play, and ignorance of what to do just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nDon\u2019t be a clueless parent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore exploring the provisions that different social media apps put in place to keep children safe, it is necessary to state that it\u2019s best if parents open social media accounts for their children.\n\nWith that, they can effectively define settings that suit their children\u2019s ages since these platforms only activate specific security restrictions when age is stated.\n\nParents should understand any app their children want to use. Where necessary, they should download the app and familiarise themselves with what goes on there.\n\nFacebook/Facebook Messenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nFacebook is one of the oldest surviving social networking platforms globally. As of October 2021, with over 2.9 billion users globally, the platform ranked first on the list of the most popular social networks. Attempting to protect a teenager with a mobile phone from the lure of such a platform is probably an exercise in futility.\n\nFor one, a Facebook account cannot be created for someone under 13 years old. For teens 14 years and above, parents have to activate the following settings during account creation:\n\nChange the default audience from \u201cPublic\u201d to \u201cFriends\u201d under the \u2018Audience and visibility\u201d option in the settings menu. With this, only friends can see their activities.\n\nRestrict who can send friend requests from \u201cEveryone\u201d to \u201cFriends of friends\u201d under the \u201cHow people find and contact you\u201d option. Here, you can also remove them from public search; this will stop their profiles from popping up in a Google search or appearing as a suggestion to anyone with their phone number or email address.\n\nAlso, review who can follow, tag, comment, or share their posts by changing the settings to \u201dFriends\u201d or \u201cFriends of friends\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, there is an under-13 child-friendly version of Facebook\u2019s instant messaging platform, Messenger Kids, which allows parents to decide who their children chat with. This was launched in 2017.\n\nTo use the Messenger Kids app, the child does not need a Facebook account or a phone number since activation is only possible via an adult\u2019s account.\n\nAfter installing the Messenger Kids app on a child\u2019s phone, a parent needs to authenticate it with their Facebook account before creating a mini-profile for their child.\n\nThe parent controls who becomes friends, hence who the child chats with. Even though parents control sending and accepting friend requests, they cannot spy on their children\u2019s chats.\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Meta-owned photo-sharing app, Instagram, is another social network that has caught the fancy of young people. Given the several reported cases of online abuse on the platform, online safety precautions need to be taken, especially for young people.\n\nTo keep minors and all its users safe, the platform has several safety features \u2014 particularly \u2018Tools to fight bullying\u2019.\n\nTo manage those that interact with your children, set profile as \u2018Private account\u2019 in the \u2018Privacy\u2019 settings menu. With this, interaction will be limited to only followers. For people younger than 16, their profile is automatically set as \u2018private\u2019.\n\nYou can also control comments, tags, mentions, and unwanted interactions, and direct messages.\n\nYouTube\n\nLike other platforms, YouTube does not allow people under 13 to open accounts unless, of course, the age isn\u2019t reported.\n\nFor teens and tweens, parents can supervise usage, change the video privacy settings, and disable autoplay. They can also take their children through these safety settings.\n\nIn 2015, Google introduced YouTube Kids to give younger users child-friendly content. YouTube\u2019s algorithm directs uploaded videos appropriate for children to the app.\n\nBecause a few cases have been reported where some offensive videos slipped through YouTube\u2019s filters, parents still have to monitor app use and report offensive content.\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Souvik Banerjee on Unsplash\n\nSnapchat has been around for a while \u2014 2011 \u2014 and It is popular for sharing temporary videos and images.\n\nUnlike other platforms considered, Snapchat posts \u2014 called Snaps \u2014 disappear after 24 hours. Direct messages also disappear after the recipient views them. However, the ephemeral nature of its content does not guarantee safety. If anything, extra care should be taken.\n\nOne of the ground rules on Snapchat\u2019s Terms of Use is that anyone under 13 is not permitted on the app.\n\nAn excellent way to help teens use the app safely is to discuss staying off explicit content and unfollowing any account that makes them uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, parents can adjust the safety settings and change location sharing settings to \u2018ghost mode\u2019. With this, only followers can see their Snaps or send direct messages.\n\nHere\u2019s how to enable Snapchat\u2019s Parental control features:\n\nOn the profile page, on the settings icon, change the option in \u2018Contact me\u2019 to \u2018My friends\u2019. Select the same option under the \u2018Who can\u2019 section (to manage who can see their snaps).\n\nTo make their account private so that they don\u2019t get suggestions to subscribe to channels or make them appear in other users\u2019 suggestions, uncheck all the boxes in the \u201cSee Me in Quick Add\u2019 section.\n\nTo deactivate location sharing, check \u2018Ghost Mode\u2019 under \u2018My location\u2019 settings.\n\nTikTok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nWith over 2.6 billion downloads, TikTok is one of the most used social media platforms globally. Like every other social media platform, it has its safety issues.\n\nThe video-sharing app also has provisions for young users, although, like other platforms, age has to be reported in the account settings to activate the accounts.\n\nThe default account setting for users younger than 16 is set to \u2018Private account\u2019, which means videos will only be visible to followers. Direct messaging is also disabled. This setting can be manually activated in the settings menu.\n\nFor children under 13, TikTok takes them to TikTok Kids, where they are exposed to curated content; sharing, commenting, and messaging are deactivated. In some countries, parents can link their child\u2019s TikTok account with theirs. Once the \u2018Family Safety Mode\u2019 is enabled, parents can manage screen time, restrict content, and supervise messaging, following, commenting, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Wednesday, swore in seven Senior Special Assistants (SSAs) and 25 Special Assistants (SAs), following harmonisation by leaders and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oredo Local Government Area (LGA).\n\nObaseki, who performed the inauguration ceremony at the Government House, Benin City, reassured his government\u2019s commitment to fulfilling all promises made to Edo people during the electioneering.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cI had to wait, take my time and ensure harmonization of the party in the LGA before making this appointment. Politics in Oredo LGA is very sensitive and the barometer through which Edo politics is judged. If we fail to get Oredo right, it will be difficult and challenging to get Edo State politics right.\n\n\u201cDuring our electioneering, we went around and made promises to the people and we must fulfill those promises or else they will tell us that they have the voting power when the election comes again. What we did on September 19, 2020 governorship election has become a reference point for Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\u201d\n\nCharging the new political appointees on service delivery to Edo people, Obaseki noted, \u201cLeaders have carefully selected you believing you are the one to help the governor achieve his electioneering promises and so much has to be done, particularly ahead of local government elections.\n\n\u201cI have divided Oredo into 20 zones for development purposes as data are available for every household in Oredo.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, has said his government will improve access to foreign exchange for the importation of raw materials and machines unavailable locally.\n\nBuhari said this in Abuja on Wednesday while responding to requests from the manufacturing sector on how to increase its contribution to the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe government had banned forex on the importation of selected items into Nigeria.\n\nA statement issued by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina said Buhari told the leadership of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) that the relevant ministry would revisit their concerns about the increase in excise duties on the identified products and other tariff-related matters.\n\nOn the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the president said Nigeria would accelerate the process of setting up designated competent authority to oversee the administration of Rules of Origin.\n\nThe statement added that the government would also ensure that relevant structural platforms are established for monitoring and evaluation.\n\n\u201cOur strategic plan to boost manufacturing activities in the country is on course,\u201d the statement quoted Buhari as saying.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will continue to improve the patronage of locally made goods, bridge the gap between skills required by industry and those provided by our tertiary institutions and ensure seamless access to long term finance for our Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs).\n\n\u2018\u2018We recognise that MAN remains a key stakeholder in this journey, and we will continue our engagement with you.\n\n\u2018\u2018I beseech you to continue to support the government in our quest to provide the appropriate environment that will attract the necessary investment both domestic and foreign for the upliftment of the nation\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari emphasised that despite limited resources, the present administration has made progress in road and rail infrastructure development; provision of stimulus packages for the manufacturing sector; improvement in energy management and support for exporters to bolster the operations of businesses in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018These projects are there for all to see,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, we are vigorously pursuing reforms on ease of doing business and currently putting in place other necessary policy measures and incentives that will guarantee full recovery from the consequences of COVID-19, sustain economic development and further shield the economy from the potential impact of fluctuations in the price of crude oil in the global market.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have listened carefully to all the challenges enumerated by the President of MAN and would like to assure you that, like we have done in the recent past, we will give consideration to some of the constraints that are yet to be fully addressed, especially those that align with our policies and programmes for economic recovery and sustainable development.\n\n\u2018\u2018Let me assure you that this administration is fully aware that the survival of Nigeria lies in agriculture and having a viable domestic manufacturing sector.\n\n\u2018\u2018I must emphasise here that when I say Agriculture, I also refer to the agro-allied business, which is the value-added component in the value chain.\n\n\u2018\u2018A strong manufacturing sector creates more jobs and wealth for our people.\n\n\u2018\u2018It will usher in sustainable economic prosperity because we will produce what we consume as a nation and generate foreign exchange by exporting surpluses and by import substitution.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks, Mariam Katagum, minister of state, industry, trade and investment, said: \u201cMAN is in business to create a climate of opinion in this country so that manufacturers can operate efficiently and profitably for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Mansur Ahmed, MAN president, said the association had articulated remedial measures for the challenges faced by manufacturers in the Blueprint for Accelerated Development of Manufacturing in Nigeria, which will be formally presented to the president within the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe MAN leadership, however, highlighted a few challenges that could be addressed in the immediate term.\n\nThey include the inadequate supply of foreign exchange, inadequate electricity supply, poor access to long term funds, patronage of made-in-Nigeria goods and local content development, looming increases in the tax rates, among others.\n\nAhmed also used the occasion to formally present the new logo and annual report of the association to the president\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The National Union of Nigerian Associations in Italy (NUNAI) has lauded the Federal Government of Nigeria for promptly responding to its appeal for the supply of passport booklets to the Embassy in Italy.\n\nNUNAI disclosed this in a video interview with journalists on Tuesday in Abuja, which refuted recent media reports that over one million, five hundred thousand Nigerians were yet to be issued their passports.\n\nSecretary of NUNAI, Frank David, who described the report as a fallacy, said the total number of Nigerians in Italy is not up to a million.\n\nDavid noted that it was impossible for over one million Nigerians supposedly living in Italy to be stranded for lack of passport.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe noted that currently, there are 209,000 Nigerians in Italy, 180,000 are legally documented with 29,000 yet to be documented.\n\nHe said that as much as NUNAI, the umbrella body of all Nigerian Associations in Italy will continue to appeal to the Federal Government for regular supply of booklets, they also appreciate the intervention so far.\n\n\u201cThe publication by the Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation Europe (NIDOE) which claims that 1.5 million Nigerians in Italy are in need of passport booklets in Italy is a fallacy and we debunk such claims.\n\n\u201cThe population of Nigerians in Italy is not up to one million. And on the issue of passport, yes are requests for people who need to renew their passport of get fresh passports.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut the mission has captured thousands of Nigerians who are having issues with passport in the past months and that is a great deal.\n\n\u201cThere was an intervention about three months ago, especially in my own city, Modena we were able to capture about 250 people, we went to another city called Pesaro and we were able to capture 138 people.\n\n\u201cWe went to another city which I supervised and they were able to capture over 170 people. So if you sum all these figures up you will get about a thousand.\n\n\u201cBe that as it may, there are other cities that need to be covered and that is not to say that they are up to a million. I stand to debunk that any day, any time.\n\n\u201cNUNAI as it were is the umbrella body of all Associations in Italy which NIDO should be part of, and NUNAI has been working with Embassies long before the existence of NIDO in Italy.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to speak more in favor or in criticism of NIDO because I do not know their modus of operandi and how they got their information.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNUNAI has been in the forefront of issues that concerns Nigerians in Italy, in terms of welfare, in term of documentation, we have been working assiduously is collaboration with Embassies,\u201d David said.\n\nFor his part, the Welfare Officer of NUNAI, Frank David, also appreciated the Federal Government, the Nigerian Ambassador to Italy, Mfawa Abam, and the Immigration Attache to the Mission for their swift response.\n\nHe said that Amb. Abam and the immigration attach\u00e9 to the mission have been working tirelessly to ensure the challenges of scarcity of passports was solved to ameliorate the plight of Nigerians living in Italy.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware of the challenges the Nigeria Immigration service is experiencing, which is not only affecting Nigerians in Italy but even those living in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe supply of booklets to Italy is not regular but there are cases where the Embassy gets 1,000, gets 500, gets 2,000.\n\n\u201cAfter we have made a passionate appeal to the two Ministers, the Comptroller General of immigration last month, we have started getting supply.\n\n\u201cBefore the Christmas we got supply of about 1,500 because I work closely with the immigration and they promised to give us more, they are talking of giving us 10,000 booklets to clear the backlog.\n\n\u201cThere is an improvement, and the immigration and the Nigerian mission is working but more need to be done because Nigerians have to renew their passports and get new ones,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Rivers State governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has narrated how a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Emmanuel Ukala, saved his political career in 1998, when some politicians in Obio/Akpor local government area of the state ganged up and conspired with the police to frame him up for armed robbery.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark Ukala\u2019s 65th birthday in Port Harcourt on Tuesday night, Wike said his problem started when he declared his intention to contest for the office of the chairman of Obio-Akpor local government council in 1998.\n\nAccording to the governor, Ukala not only intervened then and secured his release, but also defended him from the Tribunal up to the Supreme Court when some vested interests in the council desperately attempted to stop him from being be sworn into office as Obio-Akpor LGA chairman.\n\n\u201cThroughout my chairmanship matter in 1998, when we had election down to April 4, 2000 when Supreme Court finally decided my matter, he (Ukala) never took a dime, one Naira,\u201d Wike said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also recalled that before he proceeded to then then Rivers State University of Science and Technology, now Rivers State University, to study Law, Ukala had been his family lawyer.\n\nWike also recalled that while studying Law in the university, a chieftaincy dispute occurred in his community which led to the arrest and detention of his father, uncle, brothers and himself on trumped-up murder charge.\n\nThe governor, who was accompanied to the event by his wife, Hon. Justice Suzette Nyesom Wike, said it took the intervention of Ukala as their counsel for them to be discharged and acquitted.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was a time that the entire family was charged for murder, every male was taken away. We only had women left in the house with children between the ages of 1 and 5. As at that time, I was reading Law at the then Rivers State University of Science and Technology, now Rivers State University.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWike disclosed that the legal luminary, in whose law firm he worked after leaving the Nigerian Law School, took his family\u2019s ordeal very personal and gave his best to ensure that they got justice.\n\nThe governor added that when the Rivers State Election Petition Tribunal annulled the 2015 governorship poll which he said he won convincingly, he contacted some lawyers to defend him in the matter and they demanded as much as N300m to N600m as their legal fees.\n\nHowever, Wike confessed that when he approached Ukala, whom he described as a mentor, he offered him free legal services.\n\n\u201cThen my governorship election, most people may not believe it, from governorship tribunal down to Supreme Court, he never collected one dime,\u201d he said.\n\nWike, who described Ukala as refined and discipline lawyer, applauded the legal icon for being a worthy mentor to him and his wife when they started their legal practice in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe governor showered encomiums on the children of the celebrant for deciding to honour their parents, Emmanuel and Dr Kate Ukala, in appreciation of all the sacrifices they have made in ensuring they become responsible citizens.",

By now, these things should be everywhere. I wonder what is really holding us back from taking some of these steps. Today we have fantastic drones in the market that will carry out surveillance capabilities.\n\n\u201cAll you need to do is to sit at an operations room, give out the command, pressing the buttons and the drones will be busy doing all the jobs, sending in results and so on.

          "text": "The alleged move by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Justice Minister Abubakar Malami to take over the prosecution of alleged N3 billion fraud case involving Mrs. Ochuko Momoh, wife of a former Managing Director of Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Haruna Momoh, has sparked a controversy.\n\nThe Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) had, in March 2020, arraigned Mrs. Momoh and five others at a Federal High Court in Abuja for alleged money laundering.\n\nThe others are: Blessing Azuka-Agozi, Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, Energopol Nigeria Limited, Blaid Construction Limited and Blaid Farms Limited.\n\nThe ICPC accused Mrs. Momoh of laundering funds estimated at N3 billion through her companies \u2013 Blaid Construction and Blaid Farms.\n\nAzuka-Agozi was accused of reneging on her promise to provide ICPC\u2019s investigators with documents on the contracts that Energopol Nigeria Limited allegedly executed for the PPMC, for which it was reportedly paid huge sums.\n\nThe ICPC accused Stanbic IBTC of failing to report suspicious transactions in the accounts of Blaid Construction and Blaid Farms to relevant authorities, as required by law.\n\nTrial was concluded in the case on November 23, 2021, with Stanbic IBTC calling its sole witness, and the trial judge, Justice Taiwo Taiwo, adjourning till February 9, 2022, for parties to adopt their final written addresses.\n\nBut it was learnt that after the conclusion of trial, some of the defendants contacted the Office of the AGF to make him take over the case.\n\nWhile sources at the ICPC confirmed learning about the move, the defendants and the AGF claimed ignorance of such development.\n\nA senior ICPC official, who spoke in confidence, said he heard about the plan by some defendants in the case to make the AGF\u2019s office take over the case in order to discontinue it.\n\nThe official said he was not aware if the AGF had filed a formal application to that effect.The AGF has denied any plan to make him take over the case.\n\nThe media aide to the AGF, Dr. Umar Gwandu, told The Nation that there was no evidence to support the claim that the minister planned to take over the case.\n\nAlso, a lawyer in the defence team, Ade Adedeji (SAN), told The Nation that he was not aware of any move to have the AGF take over the case.\n\nThe Nation recalls that the AGF\u2019s intervention has stalled some high profile cases.\n\nThese include the planned arraignment of former Aviation Minister and serving Senator Stella Oduah before a Federal High Court in Abuja on November 22, owing to Malami\u2019s intervention.\n\nA similar intervention of the AGF equally stalled proceedings in the two cases involving former Imo State Governor Ikedi Ohakim at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Maitama and the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nIn the case before Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Ohakim and one of his aides, Chinedu Okpareke, are accused of threatening the life of the ex-governor\u2019s alleged ex-mistress, Mrs. Chinyere Igwegbe Amuchienwa.\n\nIn the case before Justice Yusuf Halilu of the High Court of the FCT, Mrs. Amuchienwa is accused of threatening the life of the ex-governor.\n\nTrial was to start last November in both cases (originally filed by the Inspector General of Police), but it was postponed till next year by both courts after the AGF intervened and took over the prosecution of both cases.

          "text": "THE World Bank has said that the new wave of COVID-19 pandemic that has seen a variant of the virus, Omicron, ravaging the world, may lead to governments across the globe being tempted to shut down schools again.\n\nThe World Bank has said this in a report titled: \u201cReversing the pandemic\u2019s education losses\u201d, recently released.\n\nIn the said report, the bank also said no fewer than 647 million school children are yet to fully resume for either physical or online learning.\n\nIt added that school children in developing nations are the hardest hit regarding the negative effects the pandemic has had on education globally.\n\n\u201cWhen schools around the world moved online due to COVID-19, children in developing countries suffered the most.\n\n\u201cEven though digital learning does not produce the same outcomes as in-person education, technology used effectively can close educational gaps and prevent learning loss.\n\n\u201cAs the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic approaches, classrooms remain fully or partially closed for as many as 647 million schoolchildren around the world.\n\n\u201cEven where schools have reopened, many students continue to lag behind. It is now abundantly and painfully clear that children have learned less during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nAccording to World Bank estimates, pandemic-related school closures could drive up \u201clearning poverty\u201d \u2013 the share of 10-year-olds who cannot read a basic text \u2013 to around 70% in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nThis learning loss could cost an entire generation of schoolchildren $17 trillion in lifetime earnings.\n\n\u201cAs the Omicron variant takes hold, more governments may be tempted to close schools. Without the online infrastructure in place to support learning, doing so would extend the educational losses and deny children many other benefits of daily school attendance, like the possibility to connect with classmates and develop social skills for personal growth.\n\n\u201cInteractions with teachers and peers are essential to develop the abilities necessary to work collaboratively. Being part of a class promotes a sense of belonging and helps build self-esteem and empathy.\n\n\u201cThroughout the pandemic, marginalised children have struggled the most. When classrooms around the world reopened this fall, it became clear that these children had fallen even further behind their peers.\n\n\u201cBefore the pandemic, gender parity in education was improving. But school closures placed an estimated 10 million more girls at risk of early marriage, which practically guarantees the end of their schooling.\n\n\u201cUnless this regression is reversed, learning poverty and the associated human capital loss will hold economies and societies back for decades. Children must be given a chance to recover the education they have lost.\n\n\u201cThey need access to well-designed reading materials, digital learning opportunities, and transformed education systems that help prepare them for future challenges. Well qualified teachers and effective use of technology are fundamental to this process.\n\n\u201cMany countries have deployed massive stimulus packages in response to the health crisis. But, as of June 2021, less than three per cent of these funds was devoted to the education and training sector.\n\n\u201cAnd most of these resources were spent in advanced economies. For many low-income countries, elevated debt-service payments crowd out essential social spending \u2013 including for education.\n\n\u201cThe resulting weakness in investments to support education and training threatens to deepen the disparities in learning outcomes that existed prior to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cAnd while narrowing the education gap will require using resources more efficiently, the bottom line is that more resources are needed.\n\n\u201cFor the world\u2019s poorest countries, in particular, an acceleration in debt relief under the G20\u2019s Common Framework, would provide fiscal space to increase support for human capital.\n\nInvestment in education must include funding for educational technology, taking into account what has worked well in different contexts around the world,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe Bank called for improved investment in infrastructure to move education to the digital level and commended countries such as Uruguay and India for making giant strides in that direction.\n\n\u201cBy investing in learning recovery and using technology wisely, it is possible to use the pandemic experience as a catalyst to improve education for all children.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank Group are working together to ensure that all education systems use technology effectively to close gaps and help reverse learning losses.\n\n\u201cEmbedding the use of technology within an overall strategy for ending learning poverty can help improve foundational skills, increase instructional time, and make the most efficient use of resources.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly critical in low-income countries, where technology can provide teachers with the support they need quickly.\n\n\u201cDigital access can serve as a great equalizer.

          "title": "Gov. Wike: All men in my family once charged with murder",
          "text": "Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, said he was once arrested and arraigned alongside his father and all the adult males in his family over allegation of murder.\n\nThe governor said the allegations were \u2018trumped up\u2019 against his family following a dispute over chieftaincy title in his community.\n\nWike who spoke at the 65th birthday ceremony of Emmanuel C. Ukala, a Port Harcourt based Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) on Wednesday also narrated how charges of robbery were leveled against him in a bid to stop him from assuming the office of chairman of Obio-Akpor Local Government Area after he won election.\n\nHe said it took the intervention of Ukala as lead counsel for them to be discharged and acquitted of the murder charge.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cThere was a time that the entire family was charged with murder, every male was taken away. We only had women left in the house with children between the ages of 1 and 5. As at that time, I was reading law at then Rivers State University of Science and Technology, now Rivers State University.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike added that the legal luminary, in whose law firm he worked after leaving the Nigerian Law School, took his family\u2019s ordeal very personal and gave his best to ensure that they got justice.\n\nSpeaking on his initial chequered political history, the governor said when he declared his intention to contest for the office of the chairman, Obio-Akpor Local Government Area in 1998, some callous politicians in his constituency ganged up and conspired with the police to frame him up for armed robbery.\n\nAccording to him, Ukala not only intervened and secured his release, but also defended him from the tribunal up to the Supreme Court when some vested interest in the council desperately attempted to deprive him to be sworn into office as Obio-Akpor council chairman.\n\n\u201cThroughout my chairmanship matter in 1998, when we had election down to April 4, 2000 when Supreme Court finally decided my matter, he (Ukala) never took a dime, one Naira.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike stated that when the Rivers State election petition tribunal annulled the 2015 governorship poll, he contacted some lawyers to defend him in the matter and they demanded as much as N300 to N600 million as their legal fee.

You are one man institution.\u201d\n\nFormer President, Nigerian Bar Association, Okey Wali (SAN), said when he took over the leadership of the Bar, one of the major challenges that confronted him was issue of indiscipline among lawyers.\n\nAnd to tackle the problem head on, he said Ukala was incorporated into the Legal Practitioner Disciplinary Committee of the NBA, and before he left office, discipline was restored in the Bar.\n\nUkala, who said he was tricked by his children to attend the surprise birthday party they secretly organised, thanked Governor Wike, his wife and everyone who graced the occasion.",

          "text": "A Covid \u201ctsunami\u201d threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems, the WHO said Wednesday, as record surges fuelled by the Omicron variant dampened New Year celebrations around the world once again.\n\nGovernments are walking a tightrope between anti-virus restrictions and the need to keep societies and economies open, as the highly transmissible variant drove cases to levels never seen before in the United States, Britain, France and Denmark.\n\nThe blistering surge was illustrated by AFP\u2019s tally of 6.55 million new infections reported globally in the week ending Tuesday, the highest the figure has been since the World Health Organization declared a Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.\n\nREAD ALSO: UN Security Council Condemns Myanmar Massacre\n\n\u201cI am highly concerned that Omicron, being more transmissible, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases,\u201d said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\n\u201cThis is and will continue to put immense pressure on exhausted health workers, and health systems on the brink of collapse.\u201d\n\nThe variant has already started to overwhelm some hospitals in the United States, the hardest-hit nation where the seven-day average of new cases hit 265,427, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.\n\n\u201cThis virus will continue to evolve and threaten our health systems if we don\u2019t improve the collective response.\n\n\u201cRight now, Delta and Omicron are twin threats that are driving up cases to record numbers, which again is leading to spikes in hospitalisations and deaths,\u201d Ghebreyesus added.\n\nHarvard epidemiologist and immunologist Michael Mina tweeted that the count was likely just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d with the true number likely far higher because of a shortage of tests.\n\nBut there was some hope as data indicated a decoupling of the number of cases and hospitalisations.\n\n\u201cWe should not become complacent,\u201d top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci said Wednesday, but \u201call indications point to a lesser severity of Omicron\u201d.\n\nAt a drive-through virus testing site in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, there were long lines of cars with people waiting to provide samples.\n\n\u201cHalf of my family has it, you know this new variant is very, very spreadable, like way more spreadable than the first time around,\u201d said resident Victoria Sierralta.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re back in like the first stage of Covid. It\u2019s absolutely crazy.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is serious\u2019\n\nMillions around the world will again welcome a new year in the shadow of the pandemic, which is known to have killed more than 5.4 million people so far, with festivities dampened or cancelled in many countries.\n\nGreece on Wednesday banned music in bars and restaurants to try and limit New Year\u2019s Eve parties, with public events already cancelled.\n\nThe mayor of Mexico\u2019s capital has cancelled the city\u2019s massive New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations after a spike in cases.\n\nDespite the outbreak concerns, the streets of Mexico City were busy on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that such an event with such economic importance should be cancelled, however health comes before everything else,\u201d said 59-year-old teacher Victor Arturo Madrid Contreras.\n\nWith the \u201ccancellation they are sending a message\u2026 \u2018You know what? This is serious\u2019.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson meanwhile defended his decision not to clamp down on festivities over the holidays, saying around 90 percent of Covid patients in intensive care had not received a vaccine booster.\n\nThe number of people in hospital with the coronavirus topped 10,000 in England, the highest total since March, as Britain on Wednesday reported a new record of 183,037 daily cases.\n\nThe high take-up of boosters in England \u201cis allowing us to go ahead with New Year in the cautious way that we are\u201d, Johnson said, despite new closures in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n\nRecords cases in France, Denmark\n\nAcross the Channel, France too hit a new daily record of more than 200,000 cases \u2014 more than double the number on Christmas Day \u2014 as it extended its closure of nightclubs into January.\n\nWearing masks outdoors will become compulsory in Paris on Friday for everyone over the age of 11 except those inside vehicles, cyclists, users of other two-wheelers such as scooters and those participating in sports.\n\nDenmark, which currently has the world\u2019s highest rate of infection per person, recorded a fresh record of 23,228 new cases, which authorities attributed in part to the large numbers of tests carried out after Christmas celebrations.\n\nPortugal also saw a record with nearly 27,000 cases reported in 24 hours.\n\nAFP",

The Federal Government of Nigeria, through the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, the Federal Ministry of Health, as well as NCDC and its partners, are therefore intensifying risk communication efforts to remind Nigerians of the risk we face and need to take collective responsibility to reduce transmission of the virus.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the agency is launching a \u2018Celebrate Responsibly\u2019 campaign as part of efforts to fight the disease this Yuletide.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari last week Tuesday received a COVID-19 booster shot at the State House in Abuja.\n\nThe Federal Government had commenced the administration of booster shots earlier this month as steps to halt the spread of Omicron, a relatively new variant of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nPersons eligible for the booster dose must be 18 years and above, fully vaccinated with either two doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna, or Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or a single dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.\n\nThe time interval before the booster dose is at least six months for these vaccines, except the Johnson and Johnson which is at least two months.",

          "title": "With Rising Theft, Nigeria Records 193m Barrels of Crude Oil Deficit in 11 Months",
          "text": "At a projected 1.86 million barrels daily oil production in the country\u2019s 2021 budget, Nigeria recorded a huge deficit of almost 200 million barrels in the first 11 months of this year.\n\nThis was largely due to the rising cases of crude oil theft, ageing infrastructure, challenges associated with host communities, under investment, and poor security in the waterways.\n\nFigures from the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Petroleum Commission (NURPC) obtained by THISDAY, indicated that while Nigeria was expected to pump approximately 635 million barrels of oil by November this year, it struggled to produce only 441 million barrels in the period.\n\nMany oil companies are reporting huge losses, sometimes up to 80 per cent of production in the pipelines. \u201cWhen they pump through the pipelines, they only get about 20 per cent of product and the rest lost to pipeline breaches and organised theft. The 20 percent hardly covers cost of production,\u201d an industry expert explained.\n\nSome of the operators essentially, identified security as a core issue for the oil companies as product losses through the pipelines are now so massive that it is affecting their bottomline and the country\u2019s revenue projection from crude oil export. Huge quantities of products are daily stolen by individuals and organised cartels of criminals.\n\nThe Navy and other security agencies that are supposed to protect the waterways and the companies\u2019 operations are either looking the other way, or colluding with syndicates of oil criminals to steal this all-important national resource. It is now a huge and thriving business at the expense of the country.\n\nThis is part of the reason many major oil companies are divesting from the country. To prevent this huge losses to the oil companies, they have largely resorted to using barges to transport oil and the process of building barges and allowing their usage by the government is huge and cumbersome. The cost element to that is; it dramatically increases cost of production to these companies\n\nThis year has been a big disappointment for the industry in Nigeria in terms of matching production with market demand as efforts to meet its almost 1.7 million barrels per day allocation had produced little result.\n\nNigeria, going by the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was expected to produce 1.683 million bpd in January 2022. However, meeting that target would be an uphill task as it has maintained an average of 1.25 million barrels in the last few months.\n\nAn analysis of the data from the regulatory commission indicated that aside its condensates production, which averaged 300,000 barrels daily, the country, through the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and its Joint Venture (JV) partners, pumped far below its forecast for the commodity for the period.\n\nThis was in contrast to last year, when the country was producing 1.7 million barrels per day on the average, except when OPEC compelled its members to cut their production in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEven then, NNPC and its partners pumped almost 1.4 million barrels daily, but that figure has slumped since the August 2021.\n\nThe NURPC data detailing crude production so far this year showed that the country only managed to pump 1.23 million barrels per day in August, 1.24 million barrels per day in September, 1.22 million barrels per day in October, and 1.27 million barrels per day in November.\n\nOn a monthly basis, the figures further revealed a decline from January as production was 42.1 million barrels for that month; in February it was 39.8 million barrels while in March, Nigeria pumped 44.2 million barrels, a relatively good month compared to the rest.\n\nBut April saw the country produce 41.1 million barrels; it was 41.6 million barrels in May; 39.4 million barrels in June; 41 million barrels in July, before it began a downward spiral till now.\n\nIn addition, 38.4 million barrels were pumped from around 30 Nigeria\u2019s terminals and streams in August, 37.4 million barrels in September, 38 million barrels in October and 38.2 million barrels in November.\n\nThe unimpressive production figures have also negatively affected NNPC\u2019s remittances to the federation account and by extension the monies shared by the federal, state and local governments this year.\n\nFor example with a paltry N10.54 billion in November, NNPC was only able to remit 8.5 per cent of its projected N122.7 billion to the Federation Account, a joint pool of funds shared by the country\u2019s three tiers of government.\n\nAside April this year, when the national oil company paid in nothing into the federation account, the November remittance represented the second least payment for the year.\n\nThe information on the proceeds of the NNPC\u2019s sales of crude oil and gas and subsequent contribution to the account was contained in its presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for the month of December 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the N10.5 billion represented a 29.1 per cent decline of the monthly contribution, which has steadily declined in the past three months due to a variety of factors, including under-production and petrol subsidy payments.\n\nIn addition, while a total of N2.30 trillion was supposed to have been paid to the federal, state and local governments in the first 11 months of 2021, only N522.2 billion had been paid as of November.\n\nThe NNPC data showed that the continuous deficit payment had so far resulted in a shortfall of N1.78 trillion in the current year.\n\nHowever, the national oil company blamed the inability to restart the oil wells shut down in 2020 when OPEC compelled member countries to cut production for the declining production.\n\nAdded to that, it listed issues with host communities, vandalism, incessant force majeure on major assets, as well as technical issues leading to shutdowns.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that ageing upstream infrastructure due to years of under-investment remained a major headwind confronting the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate document released by the upstream commission showed that out of Nigeria\u2019s 53 oilrigs, only 12 had been near active in the last few months, while 25 are on standby and 16 have been stacked.\n\nIn terms of terrain, of the 53 rigs, 33 are onshore, 11 are offshore, while nine were found in the swamps.\n\nWhile a stacked rig means the ones which may or may not be operable, but which are stored and have no crews, an active rig count, is an official listing of operational oil and gas rigs in a certain area.\n\nIn the oil industry, the rig count is a major index of measuring activities in the upstream sector.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Buhari Receives Manufacturers, Promises Access to Forex",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has assured manufacturers in the country that the federal government would take appropriate measures to improve access to foreign exchange (forex) for importation of raw materials and machines that are not readily available locally. Buhari gave the assurance on Wednesday, in response to a request by the leadership of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN).\n\nMAN had, during an advocacy visit to State House, Abuja, appealed to the government to take steps to ensure that the real sector contributed more to the Nigerian economy.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Nigerian Association Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), and some experts blamed the rising volume of Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit on the inability of the government to enforce its policy on consumption of locally manufactured goods.\n\nBuhari told the MAN executive that the relevant ministry would revisit their concerns about the increase in excise duties on some identified products and other tariff-related matters.\n\nOn the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the president said Nigeria would fast-track the process of setting up the Designated Competent Authority that would superintend the administration of Rules of Origin and Commission as well as the automation of issuance of electronic Certificate of Origin.\n\nHe said the federal government would also ensure that relevant platforms were established for monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the Ease of Doing Business and improve government patronage of made in Nigeria products.\n\nBuhari told the MAN delegation, \u201cOur strategic plan to boost manufacturing activities in the country is on course. We will continue to improve the patronage of locally made goods, bridge the gap between skills required by industry and those provided by our tertiary institutions, and ensure seamless access to long term finance for our Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises (SMEs).\n\n\u201cWe recognise that MAN remains a key stakeholder in this journey and we will continue our engagement with you.\u201d\n\nStressing his belief in a private sector-led economy as an elixir for job creation, Buhari urged the leadership of MAN to continue to encourage manufacturers in the country. He said the government recognised the resilience of their members and other private sector organisations in promoting a virile manufacturing sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI beseech you to continue to support the government in our quest to provide the appropriate environment that will attract the necessary investment, both domestic and foreign, for the upliftment of the nation\u2019s economy,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president noted that while the COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse effect on the economy, with the attendant fluctuations in the prices of oil, his administration successfully contained the spread of the virus and other diseases.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government would continue to consistently deploy prudent means of judiciously utilising its limited revenue to sustain the economy and stimulate growth.\n\nBuhari emphasised that in spite of limited resources, his government had made appreciable progress in road and rail infrastructure development; provision of stimulus packages for the manufacturing sector; improvement in energy management; and support for exporters with a view to improving the operating environment for businesses in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThese projects are there for all to see. Furthermore, we are vigorously pursuing reforms on ease of doing business and currently putting in place other necessary policy measures and incentives that will guarantee full recovery from the consequences of COVID-19, sustain economic development and further shield the economy from the potential impact of fluctuations in the price of crude oil in the global market.\n\n\u201cI have listened carefully to all the challenges enumerated by the president of MAN and would like to assure you that, like we have done in the recent past, we will give consideration to some of the constraints that are yet to be fully addressed, especially those that align with our policies and programmes for economic recovery and sustainable development.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that this administration is fully aware that the survival of Nigeria lies in agriculture and having a viable domestic manufacturing sector. I must emphasise here that when I say agriculture, I also refer to agro-allied business, which is the value-added component in the value chain.\u201d\n\nAccording to the president, a strong manufacturing sector creates more jobs and wealth for the citizens.\n\n\u201cIt will usher in sustainable economic prosperity because we will produce what we consume as a nation and generate foreign exchange by exporting surpluses and by import substitution,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in her remarks, Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mariam Katagum, stressed that the ministry would continue to work with MAN in the areas of policy, trade and creation of an environment that would facilitate the growth of businesses in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMAN is in business to create a climate of opinion in this country so that manufacturers can operate efficiently and profitably for the benefit of all,\u201d she said.\n\nMAN president, Mansur Ahmed, said the advocacy visit was basically to thank the president for all the support extended to the manufacturing sector since his assumption of office in 2015, and seek further support for the sector to overcome constraints to competitive manufacturing in the country.\n\nAhmed articulated remedies to the challenges of the sector, and spoke on the Blueprint for Accelerated Development of Manufacturing in Nigeria, which will be formally presented to Buhari in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe MAN leadership identified some challenges that could be addressed in the immediate term to improve the manufacturing environment. They include, according to him, inadequate supply of foreign exchange, inadequate electricity supply, poor access to long-term fund, poor patronage of Made-in-Nigeria goods and local content development, and looming increases in tax rates.\n\nNACCIMA, Analysts List Measures to Reverse Nigeria\u2019s Trade Deficit\n\nMeanwhile, NACCIMA and some experts attributed the country\u2019s rising trade deficit to the inability of the government to enforce its policy on the consumption of locally manufactured goods. They also blamed the trade deficit on Nigeria\u2019s over reliance on imported refined petroleum products and the weak non-oil sector.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated that Nigeria recorded N3.03 trillion trade deficit in the third quarter of 2021. Nigeria\u2019s total foreign trade grew to N13.3 trillion in the third quarter of 2021, and was made up of N8.2 trillion imports and N5.1 trillion exports.\n\nReacting to the negative trade balance, Director General of NACCIMA, Mr. Ayo Olukanni, said in an interview with THISDAY that the association had used every opportunity since the beginning of the year to raise the alarm about the country\u2019s growing trade deficit. Olukanni pointed out that the trend was also responsible for the perennial weakness of the naira against the dollar and some other international currencies.\n\nOlukanni said, \u201cWe observed the growing gap between import and export, which was also reflected in the pressure on the naira and loss of its value in the forex market. It is, therefore, not surprising that we are ending up with these figures as trade deficit in the third quarter of year 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the fact that we have not rigorously implemented our policies to truly consume what we produce and produce what we consume. Must we always import champagne and wines of all make from all corners of the world to celebrate Christmas and the New Year? We have the capacity to produce most of what we import. We should, therefore, put a stop to importation of such categories of goods, such as textile, canned food, and drinks.\n\n\u201cAs we look forward to year 2022, we must rigorously pursue our policies, especially as envisioned in the national budget for 2022, to reduce importation and improve on our nonoil export.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the need to address the well-known infrastructure challenges in the country, saying, \u201cWe must empower our local industries to significantly improve their productive capacity to meet local needs. In this respect, our new national policies on Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which include micro enterprises, deserve attention and more support as Year 2022 rolls in.\n\n\u201cThe objective should be to reduce importation of goods as we concertedly work to reduce and even end our trade deficit. Year 2022 is an opportunity for us to truly walk the talk as a less import dependent country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, an economist and Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, stated that current trade balance deficit of N3 trillion, as reported by the NBS for the third quarter of this year, represented an increase of 26.5 per cent on year-on-year comparative analysis.\n\nYusuf noted that the huge import bill on refined petroleum products and the weak competitiveness of the country\u2019s non-oil economy were major contributory factors to the unfavourable balance of trade position.\n\nHe said the balance of trade position of the country could be addressed by giving exporters unfettered and unconditional access to their foreign exchange proceeds.\n\nYusuf said, \u201cWe need to create a fast track for exporters at the ports. If we can have fast track for imports, it is even more imperative that we have a fast track for export. Meanwhile, export processes remain very frustrating at our ports. The shipping companies and the terminal operators do not accord the desired priority to export. This should change.\n\n\u201cTerminal operators and shipping companies should be compelled to prioritise export. For most of them, export is not in serious reckoning in their operations.\u201d\n\nYusuf, who is the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also stated that government should provide access to intermediate inputs on concessionary terms to exporters in order to make their exports competitive both in quality and price.\n\nSimilarly, Chief Executive Officer of De-SME Facilitators Limited, Mr. Tony Chinwe, identified the sharp drop in the non-oil export and a huge increase in the aggregate import value as major causes of Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit.\n\nChinwe said the drop in the value of non-oil exports \u201ccan be traced to a rapid drop in the value and volume of agricultural and agro-processed export products due to insecurity challenges that disrupted farming activities and increased economics of production for farmers.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAlso, the twin effects of COVID-19 and insecurity have seen the nation spending huge sums on the importation of medical consumables, vaccines, food items, sanitary/hygiene products and military equipment to combat both menace. These have significantly increased the aggregate import bill of the nation.\u201d\n\nHe recommended that the government should diversify the export base of the economy by creating an enabling environment for the private sector to drive the process.\n\nChinwe stated, \u201cSome of the sectors that should be given boost in this regard are petroleum and petro-chemical industry products, food products, auto and auto-parts, cotton-textile-garment products, foot wears and packaging materials.\n\n\u201cWe, as a nation, have the comparative advantage in these areas. If government provides the enabling environment, we can be a net exporter of these products.\n\n\u201cWe should domesticate and develop petroleum value chain to save the foreign exchange spent in importing them and even export the excess to generate foreign exchange revenue; ditto for the food and agriculture value chain.\u201d\n\nChinwe stated that the interventions required from government to reverse in the country\u2019s trade deficit included the \u201ccreation of viable industrial parks and clusters with captive power, security and other shared services where business entities that are involved in manufacturing and agro-processing can take up work spaces.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cthe Bank of Agriculture (BOA) should be restructured, recapitalised and re-engineered to prepare it for a major role in financing agribusinesses along agriculture value chain,\u201d while the \u201cbottleneck that stifle export processing in Nigeria should be removed.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos",

The Foundation\u2019s Entrepreneurship Programme remains one of the largest private sector responses to driving the economic recovery of African youth, women and SMEs given the effects of the covid19 pandemic across Africa.\n\n\u201cAcross Africa, the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme beneficiaries are starting and growing trailblazing businesses that have collectively created over 400,000 direct and indirect jobs.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the launch of the 2022 TEF Entrepreneurship Programme, the CEO of the Foundation, Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu said: \u201cWe are constantly blown away by the quality of businesses that come from Africa every year. This motivates us to scale our efforts to empower even more entrepreneurs on continent.\n\n\u201cThe innovation, knowledge and resilience of African entrepreneurs is central to charting Africa\u2019s socio-economic transformation and meet the continent\u2019s development objectives. We are also proud of the increase in female participation on our programme, especially with the 2021 cohort where we witnessed a record 68 per cent selection of women entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nFounding Trustee of the TEF, Dr. Awele Elumelu stated: \u201cThrough the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme, we seek to democratise luck.\n\n\u201cHard work plays an important and undeniable part in success, but one must not discount the role of luck \u2013 someone being willing to take a chance on you or business idea by empowering you through training, mentorship or funding. \u201cOur hope is that, through the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme, we would help the next business leader or captain of industry be whom they are meant to be.\n\n\u201cThis is our own way to give back and also to empower the generation coming behind us so that they can go even further than we have. As a parent, one\u2019s desire is for your children to do better than you and so you will provide the resources and materials that they need to ensure that they go far in life. Similarly, at the Foundation we are equipping the next generation with the tools they need to succeed.\u201d\n\nAlso, commenting on the benefits of the programme, a 2015 Tony Elumelu Entrepreneur, Hauwa Liman, a female business owner and Founder of Afrik Abaya said: \u201cI am always proud to say that I am from the inaugural cohort of the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme. My business is located in Kaduna, in northern Nigeria. I benefitted from this Programme in 2015, and it opened up lots of doors and opportunities.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about the seed capital, but what really fascinates me about the Programme is the knowledge. I call it a mini-MBA programme, because from the ideation stage it teaches you how to really articulate your business, and it gave me my first business plan. The network, visibility and opportunities are endless.\n\n\u201cMy entrepreneurship experience cannot be complete without the Tony Elumelu Foundation. I will start exporting to other countries soon courtesy of the Foundation. We now employ ten permanent staff and an additional eight staff on a commission basis.\u201d\n\nThe TEF is empowering women and men across the African continent through entrepreneurship to catalyse economic growth, drive poverty eradication and ensure job creation.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s mission is rooted in the philosophy of Africapitalism, which positions the private sector as the key enabler of economic and social wealth creation in Africa. Through TEFConnect, the Foundation\u2019s proprietary digital platform, it has provided capacity-building support, advisory and market linkages, to over 1.5 million Africans.\n\nThe Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Programme is open to entrepreneurs across Africa: new start-ups and existing young businesses, operating in any sector.",

          "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver\u2019s marriage is officially over more than 10 years after the award-winning journalist petitioned to end her then-25-year marriage to the action star and former California governor.\n\nA Los Angeles judge finalized the divorce on Tuesday, court records show.\n\nThe pair had been married since 1986 when Shriver filed for divorce in 2011 after Schwarzenegger disclosed he had fathered a child with a member of their household staff years earlier.\n\nThe revelation set off a tabloid frenzy, but Schwarzenegger and Shriver handled their divorce quietly and without lobbing accusations in court or in public.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the process took so long. There were virtually no public actions taken in the case between the initial flurry of filings in 2011 and a resumption of court moves in June.\n\nFinancial details of the settlement were kept confidential. Because the couple\u2019s four children together are now all adults, there is no child support or custody arrangement.\n\nSettlement papers say that neither owes the other any spousal support, but both reserve the right to seek it through the court in the future.\n\nSchwarzenegger amassed a fortune playing action roles in the \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cConan\u201d film franchises after a successful career as a bodybuilder. After California suffered economic problems and widespread power outages under the administration of then-Governor Gray Davis, voters recalled the Democratic incumbent and elected Schwarzenegger, a Republican, to the governorship in a free-for-all election in 2003.\n\nSchwarzenegger put his film career aside and served two terms as governor. Within a year of leaving office, he admitted fathering a child, Joseph Baena, who is now 24, with a member of his household staff in the late 1990s. Shriver filed for divorce in July 2011.\n\nHe has returned to acting sporadically since, with roles in \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cExpendables\u201d films.\n\nShriver was forced to resign from her position as a correspondent on the NBC show \u201cDateline\u201d when her husband announced he was running for governor.\n\nShe resumed her work as a television journalist after her husband left office, producing stories for NBC while remaining active promoting women\u2019s rights issues and reporting on and advocating for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nIn 2018 she authored the bestseller, \u201cI\u2019ve Been Thinking\u2026: Reflections Prayers and Meditations for a Meaningful Life.\u201d\n\nShriver is the daughter of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was the sister of President John F. Kennedy, and of Sargent Shriver, the first head of the Peace Corps and a vice presidential candidate in 1972.\n\nShriver and Schwarzenegger\u2019s children range in age from 24 to 32. The eldest, Katherine Schwarzenegger, is an author who is married to actor Chris Pratt.",

          "title": "Man City Win at Brentford to Go Eight Points Clear",
          "text": "Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says the Premier League title race is far from over despite seeing his side end 2021 eight points clear at the top of the table after victory over Brentford.\n\nWith Chelsea being held to a 1-1 draw by Brighton earlier on Wednesday and Liverpool losing 1-0 to Leicester the day before, City capitalised by seeing off a spirited Bees side.\n\nPhil Foden settled the encounter with his fifth league goal of the season early in the first half, superbly finishing first time from Kevin de Bruyne\u2019s whipped ball.\n\nThe win was City\u2019s 10th in a row and leaves them in a commanding position at the top. The previous two occasions City rounded off December in first place in the Premier League \u2013 in 2011-12 and 2017-18 \u2013 they went on to win the title.\n\n\u201cThere are 54 points to play for,\u201d Guardiola said.\n\n\u201cAll of you, thank you for your nice words because we win but I am not going to believe any words you say about it is already done or expected because Chelsea and Liverpool are more than exceptional. One is champions of Europe and the other has been our big rivals over the years.\n\n\u201cThe distance is not because they drop points but because we win 10 games in a row.\u201d\n\nCity were looking to equal the club\u2019s top-flight record of scoring at least four goals in four successive games set in 1905 but they rarely carved open a hard-working Bees side.\n\nIvan Toney was fortunate to go unpunished for catching Fernandinho with his studs as the City midfielder lay on the ground shortly before half-time.\n\nThe visitors went close to doubling their lead soon after the break when De Bruyne and Foden again linked up, with the latter heading his team-mate\u2019s cross just wide of the post.\n\nDe Bruyne struck the base of the upright with a fierce low drive from distance, while Dias had a header ruled out for a marginal offside, but in the end Foden\u2019s first-half strike was enough to seal the win.\n\nBrentford, meanwhile, remain 14th with 20 points \u2013 nine clear of the relegation zone as they look to ensure a second season in the top flight.\n\nIndeed, the decisive strike had come just moments after the hosts came close to scoring themselves but Ederson reacted well to keep out a cross that bounced towards the City goal off Ruben Dias, before Yoane Wissa\u2019s deflected strike was cleared off the line.\n\nWhat looked like being a three-horse title race at the start of the December now has City firmly out in front after an incredible run of form while their rivals faltered.\n\nCity have won every Premier League game they have played in December, scoring 24 goals in the process and conceding just five.\n\nBut while their previous three victories involved them scoring seven, four and six goals, this was a narrow but hard-fought win that arguably only serves to strengthen their credentials as favourites for the 2021-22 title.\n\nBeing able to grind out results is just as important as recording big wins and they managed to come out on top against a physical Brentford side who provided a stern test for Guardiola\u2019s team.\n\nThe only glimmer of hope for City\u2019s title rivals is that they did not look at their fluid best, particularly in the second half, but ultimately they had done enough to secure the points as Brentford rarely looked like threatening an equaliser.\n\nThe Bees certainly deserve credit for limiting a previously rampant City to just the solitary goal and despite the defeat it was a battling performance that suggests they have a good chance of preserving their Premier League status for another season.\n\nOnly five times before has there been a gap of at least eight points at the top of the Premier League table at the end of a year and on each of those occasions the leader has gone on to win the title.\n\nThe team at the top heading into January has also gone on to win the title in eight of the last 12 seasons, although last season City did go on to become champions despite being eighth at the end of December.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t write Liverpool and Chelsea off just yet,\u201d former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton said on BBC Radio 5 live.\n\n\u201cLiverpool have been on extraordinary runs but the standard City are setting is phenomenal.\u201d\n\nFormer Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha added: \u201cIt\u2019s not game over, but it\u2019s pretty significant. City would need to have a mini calamity between now and the end of the season.\n\n\u201cFour or five weeks ago, it felt like Chelsea were on top, but all of a sudden Chelsea and Liverpool have had a little bit of a dip and City are looking pretty good.\u201d\n\nFormer Newcastle striker Alan Shearer believes if City win their next two games \u2013 away to Arsenal on Saturday and at home to Chelsea on 15 January \u2013 then the title race will be over.\n\n\u201cThe impressive thing is the number of goals they are scoring,\u201d he said on Amazon Prime.\n\n\u201cBut other than [the 6-3 win over] Leicester on Boxing Day, they are hardly conceding too, which is going to make it really difficult for Chelsea and Liverpool to get back into the race, particularly if you look at City\u2019s next two games then [if they win] it is pretty much over.\u201d",
